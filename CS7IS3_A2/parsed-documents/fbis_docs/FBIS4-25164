Their activities are centred around the Chinese Social Sciences Quarterly, a Hong Kong-based journal that has a large readership in China. Into its seventh issue, the Quarterly is edited by an elite corps of mainland-based scholars who vow to bring about evolutionary changes by fostering a "nonofficial academic tradition." "We believe in a people-based academic research as distinguished from one that is officially sponsored," said the Quarterly's chief editor, Deng Zhenglai. "Academic activities should not be tied to any ideology, policy, or slogan." However, he said that since they believed in deep-rooted changes they were taking a gradual approach to solving problems. The bulk of the 39 members on the journals academic board are nationally well-known scholars many of whom hold senior positions in prestigious research units such as the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. They include economists Lin Yifu, Fan Gang, and Bai Nansheng, sociologist Wang Funing, and expert on international relations Wang Jisi. Mr Deng, one of China's first getihu (individual entrepreneur) publishers, has been putting out translations of Western classics since the early 1980s. He is in Hong Kong to promote academic links between the mainland and the territory. It is understood that out of political sensitivity, the Quarterly is published and printed in Hong Kong. However, Mr Deng said a few thousand copies were distributed free to research institutions, government units, and leading intellectuals in the mainland. The Quarterly also holds regular seminars in Beijing and Shanghai. Sources in Beijing said since the Quarterly had steered clear of controversial issues like political reform, it was largely tolerated by the Chinese Communist Party. Such liberal leaders as Politburo member and National People's Congress Vice-Chairman Tian Jiyun have praised the group's research efforts. In recent issues and conferences, the Quarterly has explored issues including agrarian reform, the role of a civil society, the clash of cultures, and the theory of "neo-authoritarianism". The group will later this year inaugurate a new journal called China Book Review, which they claim to be the nation's first-ever independent publication in this field. The group's finances come from sales of the publication in Hong Kong and overseas as well as donations and grants.
