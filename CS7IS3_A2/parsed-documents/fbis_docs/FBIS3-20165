John Major is making a Commons statement this afternoon amid fierce denials by the Brussels-based European Commission that Britain has been given guarantees about social policy legislation as "sweeteners" for backing the votes plan. This is expected to set the Commons ablaze with claims by Tory Euro-sceptics that the Government has been duped by a Commission which one backbencher branded today as "totally untrustworthy." The Cabinet reached agreement after a two-hour session this morning -- the last meeting before the Easter holidays. Employment Secretary David Hunt earlier indicated that assurances emanating from Brussels overnight cleared the way for Ministers to accept the compromise in a bid to end the storm. But the claims by Mr Hunt -- and later confirmation by Downing Street of "oral" guarantees -- were met with surprise and puzzlement in Brussels. [Ministers emerged from the Cabinet meeting smiling but tight-lipped. [The Prime Minister, celebrating his 51st birthday today, will set out the Government's stance to the Commons, including details of the guarantees said to have been received overnight. [However, Euro-sceptics are already denouncing the compromise as a climbdown. Their disappointment is expected to turn to fury when they hear that Brussels is denying any assurances were given. [It was effectively on the basis of these "assurances" that Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd recommended with confidence the package he brought back from the European Union foreign ministers' meeting in Greece over the weekend. [The Commission was surprised by British claims that it had given assurances of no more "back door" social policy under the guise of health and safety. [A spokesman said the talks between Britain, Commission president Jacques Delors and Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn had done nothing more than "remind" Ministers of the situation. [This is expected to fuel Euro-critics' suspicions that Britain has been the victim of a sell-out.]
