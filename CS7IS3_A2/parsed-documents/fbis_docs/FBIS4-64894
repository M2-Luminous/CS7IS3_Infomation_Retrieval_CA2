Weckbach-Mara in Bonn; date not given: "Stihl: SPD Chancellor Bad for the Economy"] [Text] [Weckbach-Mara] Politicians are talking about an economic upswing. When will the Germans profit? [Stihl] The recession is bottoming out, but there cannot be any talk about a strong upswing yet. We expect an economic growth of approximately 1 percent throughout Germany this year. At the same time, however, unemployment will continue to rise and will reach about 4 million this year. A slight decline is expected next year. [Weckbach-Mara] Which government would the economy prefer after the elections? [Stihl] The German economy will cooperate with any democratically elected government. However, I admit that I would have considerable problems with the Greens. They are hostile to the economy and want to lead the state back to the last century. [Weckbach-Mara] Would you prefer a Chancellor Scharping or his Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]? [Stihl] With his government program, a Chancellor Scharping would pass on the burden of unification to the population by introducing a 20-percent supplementary surcharge. This is not fair and would be a big economic mistake. In addition, the SPD is planning changes concerning the taxes of family-owned enterprises. In many cases, a higher inheritance tax would lead to the sale of parts of firms or entire companies. The planned renunciation of nuclear energy would be unacceptable for the economy, and higher energy prices are against all reason. Thus, a changeover of power from Kohl to Scharping would have a negative impact on the economy and the creation of new jobs. [Weckbach-Mara] Is that true? [Stihl] Yes, it is. During Kohl's term of office, between 1983 and 1993, a total of 2.7 million jobs were newly created. I cannot imagine that this successful development would continue under a Scharping government on the basis of the SPD program. [Weckbach-Mara] It sounds as though you were completely happy with the current government. [Stihl] No, we are not. We expect the government to bindingly promise the abolition of the solidarity surcharge. An annual examination alone is not sufficient. After three years at the latest, the solidarity surcharge should be gradually reduced. With this announcement, the government would force itself to save, which is necessary. It would also be useful to announce a fundamental reform of the social security system for the next legislative period. [Weckbach-Mara] Do you support more retention? [Stihl] Yes. One must really tell people that the existing social system will not be able to assume the costs for the treatment of diseases, for nursing care, and for old age in 20 years' time. Thus, people should take out a supplementary insurance on a timely basis. A private life insurance is also required in addition to the pension insurance scheme, which numerous people already have.
