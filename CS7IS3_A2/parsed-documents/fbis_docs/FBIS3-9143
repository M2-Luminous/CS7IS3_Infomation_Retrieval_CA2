Gezim Qinami reports: [Qinami] This morning the People's Assembly continued proceedings in a plenary session to discuss the draft of the state budget for 1994. The deputies discussed it at length and later approved the draft with a majority. At the end of the session, we interviewed Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi. [Begin Meksi recording] The People's Assembly today approved the state budget for 1994; it is the most important financial act for the government and country. Of course, the approval of the budget comes after long preparation by the government in every aspect -- in examining the possibilities of incomes, in planning expenses, and in carrying out a series of laws to do with the restructuring of the Albanian economy and the reformation of the organization of all judicial activity. Of course, this budget bill was examined for approximately three weeks by the parliament's various commissions and remarks were made. The government considered these remarks, depending on the case, by debating with the deputies in the commissions, thus seeing the utility of these changes and reflecting these remarks in the budget, because when we withdraw money from one side, we need to balance the other side. On this occasion, I would like to thank all commissions and deputies, regardless of party affiliation, for the valuable propositions made. This is a new experience for all of us, which will certainly be improved in the coming years. Compared to a year ago, the state budget includes, of course, a series of improvements in its structure, as well as in the government's greater financial possibilities to face various problems, because we should consider that the budget deficit is lower this year. The financing of the state from abroad and banks is lower, thus, incomes are greater than before. At the same time, inflation has been forecast at 19 percent this year, compared to about 35 percent last year. The government is experiencing more difficult working conditions, but the country's economic growth makes it possible to overcome it. Of course, this year's forecast is positive. While last year we had more than 10 percent increase in general production, this year it has been forecast at about 8 percent. My opinion is that it may even be more. Of course, it is up to all Albanians, as now it is not the government that is working to fulfill the plan, but all the free and private Albanians, just as the state enterprises. They deposit incomes into the state budget and the state can function to the benefit of all the citizens and Albania as well. I wanted to say that we can implement many things this year because we close the second year of governing in a month and many things can be done as the Albanian economy has grown, the social basis of this state has been changed, private companies constitute the majority, and laws enabling the forward progress of the Albanian economy have been changed. However, one thing should be considered -- that Albanians do this. [ends recording]
