Correia's resignation nullifies a procedure, involving 17 congressmen incriminated by the CPI, to strip him of his congressional mandate. The Chamber of Deputies Constitution and Justice Committee (CCJ) has handled the procedure. Genebaldo delivered a speech, marked by emotion, in a quiet voice. He was unable to prevent shedding a few tears. [passage omitted]
