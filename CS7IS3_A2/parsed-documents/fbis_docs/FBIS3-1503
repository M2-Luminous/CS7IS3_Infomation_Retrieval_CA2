It was nothing of the sort. Though the IFP constantly claims to speak for "the Zulus", every opinion poll of Zulu opinion has shown that a clear majority of Zulus reject the IFP and support the ANC [African National Congress]. Monday's events were not a Zulu affair but solely and simply an IFP adventure. Nor was there a "march", the so-called march was simply a cover for a preplanned assault on the ANC apparatus in Johannesburg. Well before the IFP mobs gathered in central Johannesburg, the ANC had intelligence information of an aggression against the ANC planned to take place during Monday's demonstration. This information was formally passed to the South African Police [SAP] on Sunday, and a formal request was made for the SAP to control the route of the demonstration and to cordon off streets around the ANC buildings. The SAP failed to do either, until after the attacks had taken place. This was a clear dereliction of duty by the responsible SAP officers. Even after the IFP began to spread panic by random shooting and assaults in the streets of central Johannesburg, police took no steps to control the marchers' routes, or to cordon off ANC headquarters. Early on in the day, it must have been clear to the police that the advertised venue for the demonstration at the Library Gardens had been a diversion. Groups of marchers who had gathered at various places in the city began to move away from the Library Gardens towards Shell House to the west. Whether police shepherded them or ignored them is still not clear. Whatever the truth, the SAP will have to explain themselves. Their present excuse of "insufficient forces" is not acceptable in the light of the explicit fore-warnings they had been given. There is a stark contrast between the SAP actions in Johannesburg on Monday, and their actions during the much larger ANC march through the centre of Durban on the Friday before. The Durban march of some 100,000 passed off completely peacefully. The ANC supporters were completely unarmed. The route had been agreed between the SAP and the ANC; it was adhered to. Yet the entire route was cordoned off with razor wire before the march began to prevent incursions by provocators. The SAP will have to explain why the Johannesburg route was not similarly controlled. And more pertinently, why there was no attempt to disarm the IFP bands before the Johannesburg march was allowed to proceed. It can scarcely be coincidental that the IFP marchers were being co-ordinated by Themba Khoza, recently named by the Goldstone Commission as one of those involved inter alia in gunrunning for the IFP, in collusion with certain SAP senior officers of the so-called 3rd force. Khoza returned from Natal immediately before the march. His spurious claim that the shooting in the streets was done by ANC members who infiltrated the Inkatha ranks, seems to be a total fabrication. The ANC states categorically that there were no ANC snipers anywhere in Johannesburg, and all ANC security personnel operated at Shell House on the ground floor. If Khoza knew in advance about the presence of such `snipers' -- as he apparently claims -- the real question is whether they did not originate from the 3rd force? The Johannesburg events which led to the unnecessary deaths of at least 25 people and the wounding of hundreds more have been variously described by reporters, few of whom were on the scene of the actual shootings when they occurred. Many reports have been assembled at second hand from accounts of casual by-standers, often in state of shock, and untrained to observe and report. As a result, incidents from one place have been concertina-ed into incidents from another, and times of one event conflated into times of another. The SABC, for example, in a televised opinion of DP [Democratic Party] Peace Secretariat member Rupert Lorimer of a "crowd...in a fairly peaceful mood", related to a scene at the Library Gardens; but his comment was placed against TV coverage of carnage at Shell House -- a different place and a different time. Those who were on the scene of the violent confrontation at Shell House were the ANC staff, and the ANC security personnel who were deployed around the building from an early hour. The Events As Witnessed From the ANC Premises Reports had been reaching Shell House since around 8AM of armed demonstrators attacking people around the ANC regional office in Jeppe Street; innocent passers-by seeking shelter in the offices were being pursued. No police had been deployed. ANC security personnel were compelled to fire warning shots into the air to prevent a massed attack on the building. Police arrived at the office later, and checked that all arms held by the ANC security staff were licensed shotguns. They then withdrew. The demonstrators returned to the attack shortly after 9AM, attempting to enter the building through the garage. Warning shots were again fired by security staff. So far as is known there was one person injured in the first shooting incident, and no one in the second. After this second incident, ANC Regional Secretary Paul Masitile phoned General Callitz of the SAP, who promised to deploy police personnel in the area around the regional office. At about the same time, NEC [National Executive Committee] member Joe Nhlanhla phoned General Beukes of the SAP in Pretoria to ask for urgent action to cordon off Shell House. Ten policemen under the command of a sergeant were deployed at around 10.15AM. At around 11.20AM IFP marchers, moving from the west -- that is away from the Library Gardens area -- reached the vicinity of Shell House. They divided into two groups, one moving to the back of the building while the remainder assembled on the pavement opposite the entrance to the building. As this group advanced on the building, ANC security personnel stationed outside the entrance fired warning shots in the air. The IFP group retreated. A second group of attackers, led by a man carrying an AK-47 assault rifle appeared from the west side of the building, firing as they came. The ANC security staff withdrew from the pavement into the building, firing a second volley of warning shots. At this stage, no police personnel were visible. The IFP bands began to coalesce, and to advance on the building for what appeared to be a concerted frontal assault on the entrance. Shots were heard, apparently from automatic weapons somewhere west of the entrance. ANC security personnel fired into the advancing ranks, inflicting a number of casualties, the IFP gangs broke and fled. Despite reports to the contrary, no ANC security personnel were stationed above ground floor level on any of the upper levels of the building. Nor were any ANC personnel stationed on the roof of Shell House or any other building in the vicinity. The ANC considers that its security personnel behaved in a thoroughly disciplined and professional manner. They made every effort to alert the police to the danger of an IFP attack well in advance of the event. They acted with the utmost restraint, firing in the air in order to warn off the attackers even when they themselves were under fire. Their presence in the building, and their right to carry arms for defence of the large staff employed here, had long since been established with the police. Their final decision to prevent the attack by direct fire was fully justified by the provocative behaviour of the attackers. The ANC regrets deeply the loss of life and the injuries suffered by innocent victims of IFP adventurism, both outside Shell House and at other places in and around central Johannesburg and in the surrounding townships. None of this was fortuitous. It was the inevitable outcome of the insane determination of the IFP's leaders to destabilise South Africa regardless of the human cost, and so prevent the holding of free and fair elections on April 27th. They must not be allowed to succeed. They must not be allowed to cover their responsibility for Monday's bloodshed by blaming it on a shadowy group of `indunas.' They must be held fully accountable for their reckless attempts to plunge the whole country into anarchy and civil strife. And so must their police accomplices in the 3rd force, and those other police officers whose neglect of their public duties on Monday contributed directly to the mayhem on the streets. The response to them all will still be given on April 27th, by a resounding and overwhelming public vote for a new democratic government, committed to equal rights and opportunities for all. The gangsters will not be allowed to wreck the national future.
