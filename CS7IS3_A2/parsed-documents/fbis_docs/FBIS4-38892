The crisis was brought to a head when the Supreme Soviet declared it had no confidence in the government's socioeconomic and legal policies. The document said that while making noises about building a market economy the government essentially obstructed the market reform and had triggered an economic chaos in the country. Parliament also thought that the government had not worked a society consolidating program. To avoid complete paralysis of the authority parliament suggested "a constructive dialog between all branches of power and public and political organizations leading to a national reform program and formation of a government capable of implementing the program." A government official told INTERFAX that the government knew what to do and was capable of doing it. He said that the Tereshchenko government has a specific anti-crisis program that was being adapted to the situation in the wake of the introduction of a national currency. The official was critical of parliament which, he said, had failed to adopt numerous bills on oil, transportation and finances and thus obstructed investments in the Republic's economy. The press secretary of Tereshchenko described the parliament declaration as unconstitutional. In a statement made public in Almaty he emphasized that under the Constitution the government had to report only to the president.
