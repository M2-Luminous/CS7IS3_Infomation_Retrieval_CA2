FR940928-0-00064 FR940928-0-00020 HUD Rental Housing Survey Guides HUD continues to recommend use of professionally-conducted Random Digit Dialing (RDD) telephone surveys to test the accuracy of FMRs for areas where there is a sufficient number of Section 8 units to justify the survey cost of $10,000&hyph;$12,000. Areas with 500 or more units usually meet this criterion, and areas with fewer units may meet it if the actual two-bedroom FMR rent standard is significantly different than that proposed by HUD. In addition, HUD has developed a simplified version of the RDD survey methodology for smaller, non-metropolitan PHAs. This methodology is designed to be simple enough to be done by the PHA itself, rather than by professional survey organizations, at a cost of around $5,000. The smallest PHAs may, in certain circumstances, do surveys of clusters of counties. All clustered surveys must be approved in advance by HUD. PHAs are cautioned that the resultant FMRs will not be identical within the cluster_e.g., each individual FMR area will have a separate FMR based on its relationship to the combined rent of the cluster of FMR areas. HUD does not mandate the use of either the RDD telephone survey or the modified RDD telephone survey methodology. Other survey methodologies are acceptable as long as they provide statistically reliable unbiased estimates of the 45th percentile gross rent. All survey results must be fully documented. Because it takes two months to obtain survey estimates, interested organizations concerned about FMR accuracy may wish to begin their FMR surveys in the next few months to assure that the results will be available in time to be incorporated into the FY 1996 FMRs. The starting point is to carefully review one of the two following publications, both obtainable from HUD USER at 1&hyph;800&hyph;245&hyph;2691. Larger PHAs should obtain ``Random Digit Dialing Surveys; A Guide to Assist Larger Public Housing Agencies in Preparing Fair Market Rent Comments.'' Smaller PHAs should obtain ``Rental Housing Surveys; A Guide to Assist Smaller Public Housing Agencies in Preparing Fair Market Rent Comments.'' FMRs for Flood Damaged Areas in the Southeast and Midwest Under the authority granted in 24 CFR part 899, the Secretary finds good cause to waive the regulatory requirements that govern requests for geographic area FMR exceptions for the flood-impacted areas in the midwest and southeast that have been declared Federal disaster areas. The FMR areas eligible for exceptions are those declared Federal disaster areas. Recognizing that the substantial losses resulting from the floods will have a direct effect on local rent levels, HUD is prepared to grant FMR exceptions up to 10 percent above the final FY 1995 FMRs for single-county FMR areas and for individual county parts of multi-county FMR areas. The flood-related FMR exceptions will be approved by the HUD field office with jurisdiction for: (1) Counties that qualify as disaster areas under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act; if (2) the PHA certifies that damage to the rental housing stock is so substantial that it has increased the prevailing rent levels. Such exceptions must be requested in writing by the responsible PHAs. Once approved by HUD, they will remain in effect until superseded by final FY 1996 FMRs. Other Matters A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4374) is unnecessary, since the Section 8 Rental Certificate program is categorically excluded from the Department's National Environmental Policy Act procedures under 24 CFR 50.20(d). The undersigned, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), hereby certifies that this notice does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because FMRs do not change the rent from that which would be charged if the unit were not in the Section 8 program. The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order No. 12606, The Family, has determined that this notice will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance, or well-being. The notice amends Fair Market Rent schedules for various Section 8 assisted housing programs, and does not affect the amount of rent a family receiving rental assistance pays, which is based on a percentage of the family's income. The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12611, Federalism, has determined that this notice will not involve the preemption of State law by Federal statute or regulation and does not have Federalism implications. The Fair Market Rent schedules do not have any substantial direct impact on States, on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibility among the various levels of government. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number is 14.156, Lower-Income Housing Assistance Program (section 8). Accordingly, the Fair Market Rent Schedules, which will not be codified in 24 CFR Part 888, are amended as follows: Dated: September 20, 1994. Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary.
