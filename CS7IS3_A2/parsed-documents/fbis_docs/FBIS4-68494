Indinok at the scientific-practical conference on 18 April 1994] [Text] Esteemed conference participants! When thinking over the structure of this report, considering the complex of difficult social and economic problems in the oblast, and trying to find the most notorious main link in this chain of problems, I discovered that many of my assessments, notes, and approaches are fairly closely correlated with ideas that lie at the basis of the president's recent Message to the Federal Assembly, "On Strengthening the Russian State," or, rather, with its main idea which is reflected in the actual title of this message. Its essence is on everyone's list--we must look for a way out of the economic crisis in the strengthening of state regulation of the economy. Obviously, this is also the link that will make it possible for us to undo the entire knot of economic problems. This being the case, we at the level of components of the Federation must, perhaps, without lapsing into sophistries, concentrate our efforts on implementing the idea of strengthening the state principle in regulating economic processes. In order to verify my conclusion I turned for advice to an assembly of leading scientists and specialists from various spheres of activity in our oblast whom we asked to attend a conference last Friday in order to discuss the outlines of the draft of the recommendations for today's conference. The opinion of this assembly of Novosibirsk intellectual elite was unanimous: In our oblast it is time to take regulation of the economy firmly into the hands of the state, since the so-called liberal but actually uncivilized market into which radical reformers have led us is ruining Russia and leading all of us to a socioeconomic disaster. This principle, I must admit, provided a clear orientation for the preparation of the present report. As an outline I took a number of constructive points from the president's message plus our own proposals, and in these areas and I have considered what can be done to realize the earmarked approaches at the level of a component of the Federation. Here, naturally, I proceeded from the realities of Novosibirsk Oblast, which are typical of many regions of Russia. First, in order to give participants in the conference an idea of the socioeconomic base used for developing our proposals, I will give a brief description of the condition of the economy of Novosibirsk Oblast and try to show the price it has paid for the radical reforms. The economy of our oblast and its social sphere have relied in past decades on branches that today have been driven into a situation of poverty. These are science-intensive industrial production, including the defense complex, agriculture, science, the higher school, and education. Of course, you are also well aware that the oblast's economic potential, its branch structure, and the dynamics of social processes, as with all other Russian regions, have been determined, unfortunately, not by local conditions but by directive centralized plans, many of which, unfortunately, have run counter to economic-geographic and, as is apparent now, market preconditions for the development of the territory. Nonetheless by the middle of the 1980's, in order to implement the most important state tasks in Novosibirsk, a powerful economic complex was created with a progressive economic structure, a very high proportion of science-intensive modern productions, and the most skilled work force. Although the extraction industry made up only 2 percent of it, in terms of volumes of the oblast industrial production it occupied fourth place in Siberia (after Tyumen and Kemerovo Oblasts and Krasnoyarsk Kray), in agriculture--second after Altay Kray, and in terms of total economic potential--fourth place on the territory of Siberia and the Far East. In a word, the oblast was one of the most important in Russia. The president's message devotes a great deal of attention to the cost of the reforms in Russia. The president is obviously right when he notes that economic reform is not painless and is not free and that losses are inevitable. But the painful phenomena turned out to be especially severe in our oblast and the cost of the reforms was so high that practically everything we had went to pay for them. It is difficult to explain to people what they paid for at such a price. Incidentally, it should be noted that Novosibirsk Oblast was not among the victims of the first stage of perestroyka when the sharp reduction of centralized investments and the depression in the raw material branches began. Right up until the end of 1991 it retained its positions in the Russian economy. The collapse began the moment the so-called market reforms began to be forced. During a little more than two years there was a sharp deterioration of our positions in the economy of Russia and our economic position in the main branches became intolerable. The reason for the high cost of reform lies in the peculiarities of the structure of the oblast economy to which I wish to draw your attention. In order not to be accused of local egocentrism, I shall use the analytical materials of the World Bank. Thus, according to information from this international financial institution, in 1990 Novosibirsk occupied third place in Russia in terms of degree of militarization of the economy. The proportion of people employed at enterprises of the defense complex in the overall number of industrial production personnel was 43.5 percent (the only ones higher than us were Udmurtia--55.3 percent and Saratov Oblast--50.9 percent). The overall number of workers at defense enterprises of Novosibirsk Oblast (according to World Bank figures) exceeded the number of people employed in the military-industrial complex of all of Eastern Siberia (we have 172,500, and Eastern Siberia--167,500) and was approximately equal to the number of people employed in the military-industrial complex of all of the Far East, where the figure was 176,200. Thus the blow dealt to the country during 1992-1993 by the reformers' policy in fighting against the military-industrial complex caused many regions damage of varying degrees of severity--in some places it was tolerable, but for our oblast and especially the city of Novosibirsk--it was murderous and largely irreversible. The conversion of defense enterprises, regardless of how fervently and at what a high level it was discussed, will remain on paper until real resources are invested in it. What is allotted from the budget for conversion is more like a propaganda experiment than target investments. In 1993 allocations for conversion in Russia as a whole amounted to 870 billion rubles [R], which is little more than the credit investments of Inkombank alone. And the distribution of these funds was extremely unfair and very subjective, mainly according to the criterion of proximity to the hand that gave them out (and Novosibirsk, as we know, is a long way from Moscow). The aforementioned investments were not only unable to stop the catastrophic decline of the defense industry; they could not even slow it down. During the past two years of reform the oblast military-industrial complex has managed to continue to exist without sources of development and almost without any structural rearrangement, scaring up loans and subsidies from time to time. Now that the last reserves of the enterprises have been exhausted and, as a result of the ill-considered reforms, the prices of many kinds of raw material have exceeded world prices, the collapse of all industry has begun--not only defense, but also purely civilian industry--a large part of the domestic economy has reached the verge of complete bankruptcy. The legal excesses and galloping inflation greatly exacerbated the investment climate. Commercial banks grant practically no credit for investment projects since it is disadvantageous to invest in the production sphere as compared to servicing short-term commercial operations. This leaves industrial production without any future. Among the main areas of specialization of Novosibirsk Oblast are science and personnel training. Before the beginning of perestroyka (1985) we had 85,000 people employed in the branch entitled "Science and Scientific Service." In terms of the proportion of science in the fixed production capital and the overall number of workers, the oblast occupied first place in the Soviet Union, outstripping Moscow and Leningrad. We were proud of our three academies, 15 VUZ's [higher educational institutions], and powerful branch science, justifiably assuming that this was our main capital, which was quite competitive by world standards. Let me note, incidentally, that according to assessments of the most eminent economists of the West, including Nobel prize winner Solow, over a long historical period 85 percent of the economic growth was provided as a result of scientific and technical progress. Therefore financing science is the most effective investment of money in the development of the economy. The surrealistic market in which we have now found ourselves has shown that there simply is no effective demand for rendering scientific services under the conditions of a total crisis. This pertains to both fundamental and applied research. Yet there has been a sharp increase in the demand for Russian and especially Siberian scientists abroad, which is causing an ever increasing brain drain from Russia to other countries. Centralized financing at best covers 30 percent of the expenditures in comparable prices compared to the level the same academy of sciences had in 1990. As a result world-renowned scientific schools and collectives are falling apart and the influx of youth into science has come to a halt. There is an analogous situation in higher education. Russia is losing its future and the oblast and local budgets contain no resources for supporting science and the higher school. The collapse of the economy was reflected most fatally in culture. While in past years it was financed according to the so-called residual principle, today nothing at all is left for culture. The destruction of the culture of Novosibirsk--the world famous music schools, the renowned theater collectives, artists, writers, excellent libraries--would cause harm not only to Russia but to all world civilization. God forbid that such a thing should happen. Another leading branch of specialization of our oblast is agriculture. Its share along with branches for processing agricultural products is approximately one-third of all the economic potential. To be sure, the agrarian branch, as in all developed countries of the world, has always existed under conditions of large state subsidies, and this has made it possible to keep consumer prices at a fairly low level so that these products are available to all the population. Now there are almost none. Today the sharp reduction of the buying power of the population and also the impossibility of really maintaining parity of prices between the city and the country are driving agricultural producers into an abyss. By the end of last year wholesale prices of means of production for the agro-industrial complex increased 13.3-fold, including for machines and equipment for animal husbandry--14.5-fold, and diesel fuel--18-fold. Procurement prices for agricultural products increased only 11.8-fold during that same period. The continued unrestrained growth of prices for energy sources, agricultural equipment, spare parts, fertilizers, and means of plant protection have led to a situation where even the strongest farms are unable not only to acquire new tractors and combines but even to repair the existing ones, which are in short supply. The fertility of the soil is being exhausted since the application of mineral fertilizers has practically stopped. Agriculture in the oblast has been thrown back decades. Late payments for bread, milk, and meat that have already been consumed and credit under extortionate conditions of 180-213 percent are destroying the financial base of agricultural production. Now that the banks are encountering problems of distributing credit resources even in trade, the existing rates for agricultural enterprises like, incidentally, those of industry, are simply ruinous. Even under conditions of the sharp reduction of production volumes, grain, milk, and meat produced on the farms at the present time are going begging because of the exceptionally low buying power of the population. In the food ration of the impoverished population there is a reduction of the consumption of biologically necessary products. Macaroni items, bread, and potatoes have become basic in the nutrition of residents of our oblast. The reform of agricultural enterprises has actually been reduced to changing signs without affecting the basic economic incentives in rural areas. Today the oblast, like all of Russia, has been faced with a dilemma: To have its own agricultural products, which are now more expensive, taking into account transportation costs and the price of energy sources, or to increase procurements from abroad of products that are less expensive and frequently of poorer quality. It would be more correct to put it like this: To encourage the hidden subsidization of importing foodstuffs through artificially maintaining the exchange rate of the ruble to the detriment of our own commodity producer. By following this path, you understand, we could arrive at complete dependency on the West for our food supply as well, so this is not only an economic issue but also a political one, and it cannot be resolved at the level of an individual oblast. Incidentally, the answer to it given in the president's message inspires hope. Indeed it is necessary to have (I quote) "a reasonable protectionist policy that protects the interests of domestic producers but without appreciable harm to the consumers." Let us hope that is the way it will be. Speaking about the price of reforms for Novosibirsk Oblast, let me note that in terms of formal indicators which the higher-ups like to use to evaluate the course of the reforms, we have considerable achievements in the main areas of reform. Privatization of housing, trade, and industry is proceeding more rapidly in our oblast than the average for Russia. Indicators of the creation of farmer-run farms are at a high level and we have created a multitude of banks, investment funds, intermediary enterprises, and other institutions of the market infrastructure. Alas, all this, unfortunately, has so far not contributed to economic growth in the oblast or to raising the standard of living of most of its residents. The conclusion from an analysis of the consolidated indicators of the development of the oblast is this: Its economy has actually entered a stage of reduced reproduction. In certain branches of the national economy the "eating up" of production capacities has become apparent and is reflected not only in the reduction of the residual value of fixed capital and the increase in the indicators of its wearing out, but also in the absolute reduction in physical terms. The elimination of the commodity deficit is considered to be one of the main pluses of the radical reforms that have been conducted. Indeed this deficit has disappeared. It is possible to buy almost anything both on the consumer market and on the market for raw and processed materials and also on the market for contracting work. Incidentally, even before the reforms there was no deficit on our market portrayed in physical items, which we call a flea market. The only commodity that is still in short supply is money, and the whole country, unfortunately, has become like a flea market. The lack of regulation of the processes, the failure to account for the turnover of goods and incomes, and the lack of quality control of goods have become typical for the entire economy of Russia. An analysis of the minimum consumer budget of the population of Novosibirsk Oblast shows that workers of the majority of branches do not have sufficient money to support at a bare minimum not only their children but even themselves. Only workers in transportation, communications, construction, and wholesale trade had wages at the level of the minimum consumer budget at the beginning of this year, that is, they could support themselves. At the same time workers of the financial-credit sphere, insurance institutions, and energy engineering had wages that averaged twice the minimum consumer budget. The consequences of such a state of affairs are extremely severe. For enterprises and organizations living on the sale of goods to the population this means ruin and ultimately liquidation. As an example one can give the state of affairs in consumers' cooperation. At the present time it is conducting trade in 1,231 population points which do not have a permanent trade network. The fact that one-third of the consumer cooperative stores (about 1,000) are operating at a loss becomes threatening since, as experience shows, the rural population points start losing population after the schools are closed and they die out after the store is closed. For the individual resident, the specific family, and society as a whole the situation in which monetary incomes are below the subsistence minimum means moral and physical degradation. As a result of the fact that prices of food products increased more rapidly than the nominal incomes of the population, there has been a marked deterioration of the structure of nutrition. I have already discussed this. Medical services and the condition of the environment have become worse and crime and the nervous-psychological strain on people have increased. As a result, practically all demographic indicators have gotten worse. In 1992 for the first time in many decades the death rate in the oblast exceeded the birth rate. In 1993 as compared to the preceding year the birth rate dropped by another 17 percent and the death rate increased by 25 percent. As a result, the natural attrition of the population in the oblast during the year (!) increased 16-fold. It is my deep conviction that under the conditions of peacetime no good wishes can justify such tendencies. Such is the price of the reforms in our oblast and, as I know from colleagues from other regions, it is just as great there. Here is the last thing I would like to say before moving onto my proposals. All of us, esteemed compatriots, must be clearly aware of the fact that the people's patience is at an end. The rate and level of social stratification of society in Russia today is worthy of the Guinness Book of Records. The ratio between the wages of the most highly paid 10 percent of the citizens and the 10 percent of the members of society with the lowest pay in our country is 27:1. For comparison: In Sweden this coefficient is 11:1, in the United States--14:1. Such a strong stratification of the standards of living of the wealthy and the poor is fraught with serious social upheavals. And they can arise if this process continues. Even the reserves of the majority of key technological systems are at an end--energy engineering, gas lines, railroads, aviation, etc. If we do not radically change the situation in the state for the better, in the very near future we will inevitably encounter not only social upheaval but also technological and ecological catastrophes. We have invited to the conference representatives of the government, federal ministries, the Soviet of the Federation, and the State Duma as well as leaders of many regions of the country in the hope that our concern will be understood correctly and measures, including those developed during the course of this conference, will find sympathetic support in the center as well. Analyzing the socioeconomic situation that has developed, the oblast administration as early as the eve of 1994 came to the conclusion that it was impossible to quickly and painlessly improve the economic situation on any individual territory through any radical measures. Therefore the administration's program of actions for 1994 are based on the task of stabilization in the oblast economy and the creation of preconditions for future economic growth. Scholars and specialists of a number of scholarly institutions of the Siberian branches of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Russian Agricultural Academy, the city's VUZ's, and leaders and workers of enterprises and organizations of various branches were enlisted to prepare proposals for this program. Most of these proposals are in the sections and therefore I request that participants in the conference consider the existing proposals and make additional ones during the course of the section meetings. Which of the main areas make up the backbone of the stabilization program in the region? First of all, I repeat, state regulation of economic relations. It says in the presidential message (I quote): "The creation of a system for regulation of the market economy is not a step backward but movement forward, development of the reform, strengthening of the Russian state. There will never be a real market order in a poorly managed economy." For the regional level regulation of the economy means the development of clear-cut priorities for the economic and social policy and the conclusion of intraregional and interregional cartel agreements aimed at the survival and socioeconomic survival of regions, the development of a regional budget policy adapted to existing economic conditions, the formation of economic mechanisms providing for support of commodity producers, and alleviation of the crisis in industry, the agrarian sector, and the credit-financial sphere. The president emphasized that if there were no structural rearrangement in the economy there would inevitably be structural degradation and that it has long been time for the government to straighten out its structural priorities and take action on the basis of this. In this area we are prepared to support any government actions. The oblast is already preparing and beginning to take measures for the development of a mechanization for streamlining, reprofiling, and reorganizing inefficient enterprises. Moreover, regional investment programs are being created in the main economic complexes. The Fund for Support of Entrepreneurship is selecting projects. In the complex of anticrisis measures, part of which are under oblast jurisdiction, a most important position is occupied by measures for improving the tax policy. We also expect that in keeping with the points in the president's message and the decree of the Soviet of the Federation, in the near future changes will be made in the tax system in the direction of encouraging material production and resource saving. As the president promises, 1994 should be a year of real state support for the producer. The tax burden can be eased only in combination with effective measures for fighting against unaccounted-for commodity and monetary turnover. What kind of state is it that will allow the existence of a growing volume of unaccounted-for turnover which is obvious to everyone and is incapable of performing its controlling function? It has long been time for our state to be cured of its powerlessness. In order to search for additional revenues and sources of financing expenditures from the oblast budget it is intended to use such measures as issuance of short-term funded loans, regulation of licensing activity, interaction between the administration and authorized banks, and new forms of direct and indirect tax regulation, taking advantage of the rights granted by Edict No. 2268 of the President of 22 December 1993. Our anticrisis program has reflected measures for controlling blocks of shares and oblast-owned enterprises. Developing the corresponding edicts of the president, the administration is contributing to the creation of financial-industrial groups in industry and the agrarian sector of the economy and the utilization of trust forms of management, in spite of the fact that federal legislation is imperfect. We intend to step up control over the fulfillment of conditions for competition during privatization of state and municipally owned facilities without, however, transforming this control into a campaign for reprivatization. The mechanism for support of rural commodity producers in the oblast is also changing. Based on the capabilities of the oblast budget, financial resources are being allotted only on the basis of agreements concluded for the delivery of products to the oblast food supply or the oblast food market. But there is not enough budget money to form a regional food fund in the necessary volume, even taking working capital into account. In keeping with the president's edict on liberalization of the grain market, the government will apparently have to accelerate the solution to the problem of sources of financing regional grain supplies. To this end it would be possible to use the funds allotted to the Roskhlevoprodukt Corporation last year for purchasing grain for regional needs. Of the measures having to do with the social policy I will mention only the introduction of nonbudget forms of investment in housing construction, including the use of mortgages and funds of enterprises in the population. I would also like to hear proposals from participants in the conference regarding a solution to another problem that is critical, at least for us--growing abandonment of the departmental social sphere by enterprises when the local authorities do not have the funds or technical base to support it. I want to discuss once again a couple of the most important issues whose resolution is possible only at the federal level because they are under the joint jurisdiction of the Federation and its components. Among the most crucial problems requiring immediate solution I will single out the problem of nonpayments. Let me remind you that in its Decree "On the Crisis of Solvency in the Economy of the Russian Federation" the Federation Council proposed that before 15 April (today is already the 18th) the government and the Central Bank submit to the Federal Assembly a program for resolving this crisis. Among the most important measures the government and Central Bank were also instructed to retire indebtedness of the republic budget for 1993 taking price indexation into account. The state's position regarding the inflation factor in the state debt to the enterprises is affected and shows disdain for the enterprises. The state, which regularly defaults on its debts to the enterprises for long periods of time, does not intend to pay them the generally accepted fines while the suppliers for these enterprises, the state budget, and nonbudget funds do not forget to demand from 0.7 to 1 percent for each day of defaulted payments, and the latter have the right to impose penalties without recourse to appeal. Frequently indebtedness of enterprises initiated by the state is covered by them with state funds, but they already have the character of credit at the same interest rate, which objectively cannot save the vast majority of enterprises of the production sphere. This kind of interaction between the state and the enterprises has nothing to do with economic methods of regulation, the goals of the reform, or the norms of the law. Additionally, it was suggested that the government of the Russian Federation pay back to Russian enterprises the debts of the CIS states. There is a proverb: If there is time to throw stones there is time to pick them up. The entire country is waiting for concrete and effective actions from the government in this area. As of 1 March of this year defaulted indebtedness of buyers to enterprises of the oblast alone amounted to R294 billion, and defaulted indebtedness of enterprises to the suppliers was R170 billion. Defaulted indebtedness to the budget--R44 billion, and bank credit (also defaulted)--R15 billion. As you can see, for one oblast the figures are immense, more than a month's volume of sales from industry. Since this disease has affected the entire country, the formula for recovery must be sought through joint efforts. Here one cannot forget that the nonpayments crisis is a result of the overall crisis that has affected the country's economy and the deep impoverishment of the population. Emerging from this crisis will require a change in the paradigms of the reforms in the direction of strengthening the role of the state. I hope that specialists on questions of taxes and finances will make recommendations for solving this problem. Let me note in passing that Novosibirsk mathematicians have developed a highly effective and precise algorithm that makes it possible to find on the spot and calculate sequences of mutual settlements for problems of practically any size and to optimize the directions and volumes of credit infusions according to the criterion of minimizing the bottlenecks in the payment system. In the government's plan of actions special attention should be devoted to the creation of a social structure with a high buying power for the majority of the population and elimination of all privileges that are not the direct result of higher labor productivity. Regarding questions of regional policy, it is impossible to bypass another subject that is painful to us--relations between the center and the region. Before perestroyka, when we were building a classless society and Moscow continued to build a model communist city, a rather lame joke was going around in Siberia: We have only one exploiter class in the country--the Muscovites. Everyone knew that the norms in Moscow were different, that there were more imports, and that their food products were better. But the differences were not egregious. According to statistical figures for February 1994, the level of monetary incomes of Novosibirsk residents lagged behind those of Muscovites by a factor of almost three. Moreover, according to estimates of experts of the Federation Council, such attributes of centralized power as federal taxes, the funds of branch ministries and departments, centralized nonbudget funds, and others brought about a concentration in Moscow of up to 80 percent of the financial and credit resources of Russia. Under market conditions, when money is of decisive significance for society, this kind of centralization, in my view, is worse than the administrative-command system. If one looks at such an important indicator as average budget support per one resident, it turns out that here too the people of Novosibirsk are being treated unfairly today. According to figures for 1993, this indicator amounted to 70 percent of the average federal level and 46 percent of the average for Western Siberia. Much needs to be changed here. For example, it is not permissible to have a single minimum wage for all of Russia when we have an imperfect system of regional coefficients that developed under conditions of a centralized economy. Taking advantage of Sergey Mikhaylovich Shakhray's presence here, I would ask the government to revisit the question of raising the regional coefficient to wages in Novosibirsk Oblast and the mechanism for financing costs of enterprises and organizations that are linked to this. Another example: The formation of territorial budgets and their relations to the federal budget, and also the Central Bank of Russia. So much has already been said about the harm caused by granting all kinds of benefits and privileges out of subjective motives or national indicators. Why are certain regions exempt from taxes and receive certain exclusive rights while others do not receive these rights and are not exempt from taxes? I would not ask this question if this kind of redistribution had been done openly and on a scientific basis as it is in civilized countries. But this is not the case. And seeing the draft budget for 1994 convinces us of this once again. At the same time the president in his speech in the Federal Assembly named "overcoming the obvious unfairness in benefits and privileges to the regions" as the task of the year. We support the government's intentions to establish standard principles for budget relations in Russia and to conduct a clear-cut and, I emphasize, open budget policy. In our view, this would contribute to strengthening the unity of Russia more than the most brilliant verbal declarations. Unfortunately, an analysis done on the basis of new approaches to the draft of the budget of the Russian Federation shows that the system of budget transfers adjusted by a fairly arbitrary subsidy to the regions that are called "especially needy," taking into account differences in volumes of centralized financing and capital investments, again leads us to the old results. What kind of equalization of conditions can there be if only additional subsidies to certain neighboring territories which are "especially needy" are sometimes comparable to the overall volume of revenues planned for the budget of Novosibirsk Oblast, including the notorious transfers. A couple of words about the problem of differentiation of incomes. I have just spoken about territorial differences. But interbranch differences in wages and incomes inside each oblast are even greater. Finally, within an individual firm or department there can be an immense, sometimes 10-fold difference in wages. The detonator for the social explosion could be a situation whereby in one village a milkmaid receives 8,000, a postman--60,000, and a worker in a tax institution--200,000, where a cleaning lady in a commercial bank earns more than an academician with a name recognized throughout the world. We are moving from one extreme--the idea of universal equality and brotherhood--to the other--glaring inequality. But this extreme is much more dangerous and immoral. The implementation of many of the tasks set in my report and others will require coordination of efforts of the center and the regions in carrying out state policy in all spheres of the life of society. In this connection during the period of preparation for the conference there arose the idea of creating in Novosibirsk a regional center for supporting Russian statehood and developing it. It is suggested that this center in the process of its activity would do prognosticatory-analytical research and development on draft laws under contracts with state organs at the federal and regional level and also through its own initiative. In order to clarify attitudes toward this and obtain your advice as to how best to organize the work of this center, a small questionnaire has been compiled and distributed among the participants. I hope that each participant in the conference will answer the questions on it, which will help us to correctly orient the activity of the center for support of Russian statehood. The proposed approaches to the stabilization of the economies of the regions require qualified discussion and detailed development. I believe that this discussion could take place at this conference. Nor shall I conceal from you that the social commissions under the oblast administration, which include leading scholars, experienced businessmen and entrepreneurs, and workers of financial-credit institutions, has already developed a package of concrete proposals for anticrisis measures. We have studied the experience in implementing anticrisis measures in Ulyanovsk, Voronezh, and Nizhniynovgorod Oblasts and the state of affairs in the neighboring regions. We are waiting for proposals from our guests as well. But after discussion it is important to act on what is proposed. Under the conditions of sharp socioeconomic fluctuations and chronic [word illegible] in federal legislation we in the oblast have arrived at the need to make maximum use of the rights granted by the new Constitution to components of the Federation in the area of norm setting. Based on the provisions of the new Constitution, the president's message, the experience of other regions, the Human Rights Declaration, and recommendations from the present conference, we shall begin to take extraordinary anticrisis measures on the territory of Novosibirsk Oblast. The measures we shall introduce shall envision: --state regulation of prices and rates for products of monopolists; --improvement of the system of taxation in the direction of increasing the buying power of the oblast's population; encouragement of the production of necessary goods; preservation of effective jobs; --a complex of measures for combating commodity and monetary circulation that is not accounted for; --commodity quality control, especially of foodstuffs, aimed at all-around support for the consumers; --active support for the agro-industrial complex; --regulation of the wage level in the direction of eliminating unjustified distortions, exercise of the citizens' right to equal pay for equal work as envisioned by the Human Rights Declaration and Russian legislation, the fight against unearned incomes, and other measures as well. Of course it is impossible to come up with a radical solution to these problems in an individual area without state support. Therefore we are waiting for the comprehensive government commission which Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin promised to send us. The goals we are setting in our own anticrisis program are aimed at stable development of the territory, they are clear, and they should gain support. Our program envisions that each person, young or old, each worker, in the rural areas or the cities, each student, graduate student, scholar, artist, painter, entrepreneur, hired worker, physician, teacher, and others will finally receive what every person deserves--the right and the chance to live in a worthy way, like a human being. And this is not a slogan. We are proceeding from a key provision of Article 18 of the Constitution of Russia to the effect that the rights and freedoms of the human being and citizen are immediately applicable and determine the meaning, content, and application of the laws as well as the activity of the legislative and executive powers.
