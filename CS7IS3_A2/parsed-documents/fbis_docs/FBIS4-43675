"Just as freedom and love for one's fatherland belong together, in the future patriotism and commitment to Europe must supplement each other," Kohl said in Munich on Sunday [19 June] when he accepted the 1994 Konrad Adenauer Freedom Prize. "Anyone who fans hatred against foreigners can never claim that he is a good patriot," the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] chairman added. Kohl received the award of the conservative "Germany Foundation" during a festive event in the Bavarian Minister President's office in Munich. "We need a new civic sense, active patriotism for which we remember virtues such as courage and reliability, industriousness and one's own responsibility, love for one's fellow-man and helpfulness," Kohl said. Patriotism must not be degraded with the insinuation that the borders between national pride and nationalism are blurring. "Let us also resist the temptation to despise patriotism just because this virtue got a bad reputation during the Nazi period and was abused at that time," the chancellor stated. In determining Germany's position so-to-speak, he emphatically opposed a loosening of the FRG's ties with the West after reunification. In view of the security policy challenges of the future, it is in Germany's interest to continue the policy of having ties with the West and of foreign policy integration. Kohl rejects a special German role also concerning future Bundeswehr missions to preserve and reestablish peace: "A people that is no longer willing to cooperate with its partners for peace and freedom has morally resigned from the world." According to the Foundation, Kohl received the Adenauer Freedom Prize for his life's work in the service of freedom, peace, and the unity of the German people in Konrad Adenauer's spirit. The award was presented to him by Max Adenauer, the son of the first German chancellor. Bavarian Minister President Edmund Stoiber, CDU, said in a greeting address that with his policy Kohl has found the answer to the greatest question of the German people in 200 years, "the answer to the question about unity and freedom."
