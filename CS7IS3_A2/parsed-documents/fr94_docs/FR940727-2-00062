FR940727-2-00062 FR940727-2-00028 Appendix A Summary of Important Medical Preparedness Considerations for Communities Surrounding Chemical Agent Stockpiles 1. Do the communities that surround chemical warfare agent depots have a disaster plan that details the role of the prehospital and hospital medical community during a chemical warfare agent emergency? 2. If medical personnel are designated to treat chemical warfare agent casualties, do they have adequate training to meet minimal standards for evaluating, decontaminating, and treating victims of a chemical warfare agent release? 3. Do medical personnel who are designated by State, local, and hospital disaster plans to use PPE in response to an emergency related to chemical warfare agents have the necessary OSHA level of training to use these devices effectively and safely? 4. If the local disaster plan has provisions to evacuate or transfer patients to other hospitals for further treatment and evaluation, do existing MOUs cover the transfer of chemically contaminated patients? 5. Do hospitals named in the State or local disaster plans have an adequate stockpile of antidotes and decontamination solutions to provide complete medical treatment to at least one chemically contaminated patient? 6. Are hospitals named in the State or local disaster plans able to decontaminate at least one nonambulatory patient exposed to chemical warfare agent? 7. Do the disaster plans of hospitals named to receive patients by State and local disaster plans have specific provisions which detail how they will control access to their medical facilities during a chemical warfare agent emergency? 8. Are all levels of the medical community that are designated by State or local disaster plans to respond to a chemical warfare agent emergency able to communicate via either the State or local disaster communication network?
