FR940816-2-00099 FR940816-2-00077 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket No. 50&hyph;341 Detroit Edison Company (Fermi, Unit 2); Exemption I Detroit Edison (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;43, which authorizes operation of Fermi 2 at steady state reactor power levels not in excess of 3430 megawatts thermal. This license provides, among other things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) now or hereafter in effect. The Fermi 2 facility consists of a boiling water reactor located at the licensee's site in Monroe County, Michigan. II Section 50.54(q) of 10 CFR Part 50 requires a licensee authorized to operate a nuclear power reactor to follow and maintain in effect emergency plans that meet the standards of 10 CFR 50.47(b) and the requirements of Appendix E to 10 CFR Part 50. Section IV.F.3 of Appendix E requires that each licensee at each site shall exercise with offsite authorities such that the State and local government emergency plans for each operating reactor are exercised biennially, with full or partial participation by State and local governments, within the plume exposure pathway emergency planning zone. The NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations which, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), are: (1) authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, are consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) present special circumstances. Section 50.12(a)(2)(v) of 10 CFR Part 50 indicates that special circumstances exist when an exemption would provide only temporary relief from applicable regulation and the licensee has made good faith efforts to comply with the regulations. III By letter dated April 19, 1994, as supplemented June 23, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from the schedule requirement of Section IV.F.3 of Appendix E to perform a partial participation emergency preparedness exercise for Fermi 2 during 1994. The licensee stated in the request that its response to the actual emergency event which occurred on December 25, 1993, demonstrated the adequacy of its emergency plan and its ability to successfully respond to an accident. Granting the exemption will allow the licensee to spend its resources to repair the damage to the plant and restart the facility. In the area of emergency preparedness and planning, the licensee's performance has been excellent. In the last two SALP (systematic assessment of licensee performance) rating periods, Fermi 2 has received category 1 ratings in the Emergency Preparedness category and in the new Plant Support category, which includes emergency preparedness activities. This reflects a consistent high level of onsite emergency preparedness.
