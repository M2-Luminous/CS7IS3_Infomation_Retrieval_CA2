It is expected to be promulgated very soon. Hu Kangsheng, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee's Legal System Work Committee who took part in the drafting of the law, said in Beijing the other day that the draft law stipulates that the state organs must undertake the responsibility for compensation in light of the "State Compensation Law" if state organs and functionaries are involved performing their functions in an illegal manner that encroaches on the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations. Hu Kangsheng said that the range of compensation mainly comprises two fields: First, administrative compensation, which is aimed at duly expanding the scope of administrative compensation on the basis of administrative procedural law and in view of the currently existing problems. Second, criminal compensation, which is aimed at compensating the innocent who were mistakenly detained, arrested, or sentenced in the criminal suit. Hu Kangsheng pointed out that the standard and method of state compensation are determined in light of the following principle: The losses of the victim must be duly compensated, the state's economic and financial capacity should be taken into account, and it should be easy to calculate. Regarding the organs responsible for making compensation, Hu Kangsheng said that the losses caused by administrative organs and personnel in performing their functions in an illegal manner that encroaches on the rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations should be compensated by that organ and those personnel. Criminal compensation for mistaken detention, arrest, and sentence is to be made by the organs responsible for making compensation. While discussing the procedures for state compensation, Hu Kangsheng quoted the draft provisions: The victims first should file an application to the organs responsible for making compensation and the latter should reach an agreement on compensation with the former within two months. The latter also may reach an agreement with the former on compensation right away, through consultations. When this State Compensation Law is made public soon, Hu said, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens will be further ensured. It also will impel state organs and their personnel to perform their functions according to law, to improve their work, and to run a clean administration.
