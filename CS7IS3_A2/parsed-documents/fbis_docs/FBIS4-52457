The Phnom Penh force led by 12th Division commander Gen Lai Virak deployed troops and six T-54 tanks against the Khmer Rouge's 450th Division which has its stronghold on Phnum Malai Hill. The fighting took place about five kilometer from Poipet, a town bordering Ban Nong Ian, 15 kilometers southeast of Aranyaprathet. On Sunday, the Burapha Task Force fired four M-81 mortar warning shots after artillery shells crossed the border. No casualties were reported. The task force is considering revising its strategy in an attempt to pressure Khmer Rouge guerrillas to pull out from border areas. In another development, Khmer Rouge forces launched a series of attacks on the villages near Highway Route 5, about 15 kilometers southwest of Sisophon. The guerrillas set fire to more than 150 houses, sending almost 1,000 villagers fleeing into Banteay Meanchey province where about 15,000 people from many war-affected zones have sought refuge. Highway Route 5 linking Poipet and Sisophon is unsafe for passage as fear looms over the possibility of KR guerrillas ambush.
