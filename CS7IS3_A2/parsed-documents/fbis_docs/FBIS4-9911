Will there be 15 or 20? We do not yet know. The vast majority of the people who will consider these various political parties are unemployed and barely surviving; the majority are exploited day laborers or street vendors, and all of them are not just kept on the sidelines of human existence, but are actually excluded from it. For the first time in Nicaragua's history, a party emerged whose fundamental objective was to make a radical change in that situation with the appearance of the Front. In the 1969 Proclamation of the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN), Carlos Fonseca wrote: "We intend to travel the difficult path of the combatants who have sacrificed their lives for the sake of freeing the oppressed and exploited, the abused and humiliated." And in the oath that the militants took at the end of "Zero Hour" (late 1969), they pledged to struggle for "national honor and the redemption of the oppressed and exploited people of Nicaragua." The subsequent history of the FSLN is drenched in the blood of thousands and thousands of Sandinists who gave their lives to honor this oath. Once we were in power, we made many different mistakes, but never at any time did we lose sight of our fundamental objective: the redemption of the oppressed. Paradox in the Front I sincerely believe that the FSLN is the only political party with the desire and the capacity, once it is in power, to build a society that is increasingly free of exploitation and social injustice. But there is a great paradox that is now becoming the principal challenge to the Front. On the one hand, we have the FSLN that is always committed in principle to the cause of the oppressed and exploited; however (and here lies the painful paradox), the majority of the oppressed and exploited do not support the FSLN. Seventy-seven percent of Nicaraguans do not now regard it as their party, according to the latest polls. What is happening to us? How can we understand and resolve this contradiction? It is imperative that we resolve it, because the party must win the 1996 elections. As the opposition we cannot change the political, economic, and social structures to benefit the majorities who are excluded from all material prosperity. To win the elections, it is of vital importance that, with our work, attitudes, behavior, and our entire way of life, we send a signal to those majorities. Platforms and political programs are not enough, though they are very important, and indeed necessary. Sending Clear Signals To resolve the above-mentioned paradox and win over the masses in Nicaragua, we must send them signals on a variety of subjects. Today I will focus primarily on two of them. a) With a renewed leadership, we must send clear signals of our sincere defense of popular causes; support for the masses' struggles; maintain a clear and constant opposition to the government' neoliberal economic measures; and lead our lives in a way that proves we are still loyal to our oaths and our historic commitment to the oppressed and exploited. b) With a renewed leadership, we must send clear signals that we are still true to the ethical values that are part of the historic tradition of our best cadres: honor, solidarity, sincerity, respect for Sandinists who do not share our ideas, using reason rather than insults to seek consensus and unity, managing the party's assets in a respectful and open way, and leading an austere life that brings us closer to the suffering people who are dying of poverty. And finally, I also believe that we must, with our attitudes and our entire way of life, send clear signals that we do not represent the threat that war and death, commercial blockades, barriers to internal trade, etc., will return to our soil. Because of our mistakes--and above all because of the adversary's propaganda--we have an image that must be erased from the minds of our people if we are to win the 1996 elections.
