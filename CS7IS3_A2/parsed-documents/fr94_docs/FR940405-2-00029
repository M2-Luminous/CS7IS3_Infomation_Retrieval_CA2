FR940405-2-00029 FR940405-2-00016 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Dawnbreaker, Determination of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance AGENCY: Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: DOE announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), it intends to issue on a noncompetitive basis a renewal to Dawnbreaker, Rochester, New York, to continue providing training, through individual instruction, to recipients of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program Phase II awards. The period of performance for the renewal will be one year. The estimated cost is $199,792. PROCUREMENT REQUEST NO.: 05&hyph;94ER80688.001. PROJECT SCOPE: This grant was awarded September 15, 1989, in response to DOE Program Solicitation No. DE-PSO5&hyph;89ER80688, and was renewed on March 15, 1991, and December 15, 1992, for a second and third year, respectively. The grantee will continue to provide assistance to recipients of SBIR Phase II awards in preparing business plans and business opportunity presentations, and in presenting these materials to potential sponsors in a Commercialization Opportunity Forum. Each company will also be provided with several contacts of prospective value. A secondary objective is to have these same companies well enough prepared so that they can pursue cooperative and other financial agreements with parties outside the Forum. In accordance with 10 CFR 600.7, it has been determined that the activity to be funded is necessary for the satisfactory completion of an activity that will enhance the public benefit derived and for which competition would have a significant adverse effect on completion of the activity. Dawnbreaker has developed an exclusive capability to perform the requisite training, both through its prior experience and through the training methods and tools developed under the initial grant. Also, the rights to intellectual property developed under this project pass to Dawnbreaker under the regulations which apply to small business. Eligibility for renewal of this award is, therefore, restricted to Dawnbreaker. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Samuel J. Barish, SBIR Program Manager, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Research, ER&hyph;16 Washington, DC 20585 (301) 903&hyph;2917. Issued in Oak Ridge, TN, on March 24, 1994. Peter D.
