I will not ask you to make comparisons, although I am sure plenty could be made, but to share with us your reflections concerning our new role as a country aspiring to membership of the free market. [Koebl] It is true that Brunei is a very rich country, but it is also quite small and situated as far from Poland as it is from Germany. Poland, on the other hand, is a large country which, together with France, is our closest and most important neighbor. That is why I believe that, in these post-German-unification days, my principal task in Szczecin will be to keep highlighting the fact that Poland is a most important partner for Germany. Thus, I am facing a major opportunity to engage my talents here, and the best thing about it is that it will not be routine work. As soon as the Berlin Wall fell, we faced new challenges, with the possibility of making new cross-border contacts, and with entirely new expectations from the people living on the two sides of the border. So I see it as my most important task in Szczecin to bring about the realization of all these aspects of our new neighborhood situation. [Palmirski] The Odra-Nysa border is now the frontier line between the European Union [EU] and Central Europe. What are the chances of making sure that it will not become a dividing line between a community of wealth and a community of poverty? [Koebl] I hope that that sort of dividing line will be abolished to the same extent that a similar line was abolished between Germany and France. That particular division does not exist any more. The whole process will, of course, take some time, just as in the case of our own western border. A significant impulse lending an impact to the transformation process was the association agreement between the EU and Poland which, according to our intentions, will eventually lead to Poland's full membership of the Union. This is something that we are striving for on both sides. Consequently, I hope that the dividing line between the present EU and Poland will gradually disappear in the future, and that Poland will enter more and more deeply into the Union's structures until finally it becomes completely integrated with the Union. Many new initiatives are springing up nowadays from the background of these concerns, and the authors of these initiatives attempt to accelerate the whole process of integration. I am thinking here of the campaigns to create new Euroregions on both the Polish and German sides of the border.... [Palmirski] But the proposed "Pomerania" Euroregion appears at the moment to be sunk in deep slumber. What impulses are necessary to wake it up and bring it to life? [Koebl] This will depend on both partners. Associations of parishes which have expressed the wish to create the new Euroregion have already been set up on both sides of the border. Both these associations are sovereign structures and it is entirely up to them when they decide to set a date for the creation of the Pomerania Euroregion. Nevertheless, if there are still some reservations on either side, we simply need more time for these to disappear. Patience is sometimes also needed in politics. It is just like in a good marriage: Before you enter into the contract, you should first consider your decisions very carefully, because the principle of the whole thing is that the marriage should be indissoluble. [Palmirski] Your predecessor in this post, Mr. Rainald Roesch, rendered many services to the cause of Polish-German cooperation. What, in your opinion, will be the main directions of further cooperation? [Koebl] It is the consul's brief during his mission to see to the development of economic cooperation. There is no need for me to dwell here on the more obvious consular concerns, such as attention to the legal and administrative problems affecting citizens who come into contact with us. However, it appears that political contacts will be among the most important matters for us to deal with in this particular borderland area. After all, because of the complete change in the political situation after 1989, our partners appear in an entirely new light to us. The fields of action mapped out by the new pacts and treaties between Poland and the FRG are new, too. We are still discovering many new things about each other and we are still learning how to understand each other. That is why I am very happy to have been so well received by the political leaders in your voivodship, from the voivoda down. [passage omitted] [Palmirski] Would you now be so kind as to comment on the case that keeps Everyone's emotions engaged: What is your position concerning Zhirinovskiy's declarations about the changes in European borders that he proposes to make? [Koebl] That particular issue belongs in the world of big politics. Everything pertaining to such concerns--and especially when these involve current developments in Russia--is within the competence of relevant figures at the Foreign Ministry in Bonn rather than a "minor" figure such as the consul in Szczecin. Consequently, I would prefer not to make any statements on these questions--which is not to say that I do not hold a personal opinion in these matters.... [passage omitted]
