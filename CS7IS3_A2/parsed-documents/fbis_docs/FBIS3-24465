Krasnenker, LogoVAZ director, by Yu. Skidanov: "Why Ladas Are Cheaper: Encountering Market Laws, LogoVAZ Chooses New Priorities"] [Text] While everything else has been getting more expensive, LogoVAZ declared a price reduction on its automobiles made at the Volga Motor Vehicle Plant (VAZ). A month has passed since then. Has this pricing policy been vindicated, given the situation of galloping inflation? Responding to this question is the director of LogoVAZ for the Zhiguli, Aleksandr Krasnenker. [Krasnenker] The February price reduction had a tangible economic effect: today we are selling about 100 automobiles per day. This was the choice: either drive up prices for VAZes sky high and take our income from the sale of 15-20 automobiles a day, or else win at the expense of large turnover, selling automobiles at relatively affordable prices. We chose the latter. And we weren't wrong. LogoVAZ is selling about 30,000 automobiles a year, which is equal to about 10 percent of VAZ's production program for the countries of the former Union. We have offices operating in more than 20 cities of the CIS--Moscow, St. Petersburg, Bishkek. . . . [TRUD] Nevertheless, currency prices for Zhigulis and Ladas are quite high. [Krasnenker] That depends on what you compare them to. If you buy an automobile from just anyone at a used car lot or at some dubious street outlet, you are scarcely safeguarded against all the various troubles you might have. Unfortunately, virtually everything connected with automobiles here is thickly overgrown with crime. Purchasing a car from LogoVAZ eliminates very many of the most likely troubles you might have. People know that. I will list only some of the benefits to our buyers. First of all, our cars come with an 18-month factory warranty. We guarantee complete security for our clients. It is no secret, after all, that if you get a new automobile from some middleman, you might barely be out of the parking spot when you fall into the hands of thugs acting in collusion. Furthermore, we can provide delivery of a car to virtually any point in the CIS, and if an enterprise or commercial structure purchases a good-sized lot of cars, we can offer a discount of up to $1000 per vehicle. [TRUD] Recently I spent some time at the Honda factories in Japan and was interested there in how they work with clients. Simple things amazed me: the buyer is always right. They love him. And they emphasize this in all sorts of ways, starting with a cup of coffee while they are discussing the purchase of one make of automobile or other and ending with advice about what upholstery to choose for the interior. Why doesn't it work like this here? Is it because LogoVAZ has a virtual monopoly on the sale of automobiles and you are not stimulated by healthy competition? [Krasnenker] We're doing fine as far as competition goes, I assure you. There are dozens of small firms trading in Volga motor vehicles. But people come to us. Why? Because for the same money we offer many advantages in the purchase of an automobile. I'm not going to talk about coffee, like at Honda, but here, for example, following the example of Western leaders, we are learning how to do custom work, gaining in quality of service, maximal good will toward the customer, and our ability to solve his problems. When you buy an automobile you can order, "without walking away from the cashier," additional equipment, an anti-theft device, anti-corrosion treatment, car cassette-radio, and so on. If you live, let's say, in Bishkek, again, then you can buy any model VAZ through your local LogoVAZ office. They will get it to you within an agreed-upon length of time. This is the system for custom work. Moreover, LogoVAZ specialists continue to pay attention to the car you buy even after the sale, unlike, say, the so-called re-export models. Think about the way people used to buy automobiles: once you had driven out of the gates, no one cared about your problems anymore. Should a serious defect be uncovered immediately after the purchase of the car, LogoVAZ makes an effort to resolve these problems without additional payment. You see, the time has passed when people bought automobiles indiscriminately, following the principle, "Thank God I got it." Now there is choice; the automobile market is well saturated. The only way you can be successful is by improving service. [TRUD] Or "lobbying," for instance. Let us recall the recent introduction of draconian duties on imported automobiles. [Krasnenker] Some people would really like to ascribe that service to the VAZ structures. But let's reason logically. LogoVAZ sells more than just Zhigulis; we have plenty of other lines as well--Volvo, Mercedes, Honda, used foreign makes, and so forth. Therefore, the new duties raised definite problems around the sale of those automobiles. Taking these circumstances into account, it is hard to see your suggestions as convincing. Moreover, VAZ automobiles don't need that kind of protection on the domestic market. Yes, you can find many advantages to foreign models. But for our roads, for our oil and gasoline, Ladas are better adapted. A VAZ can be repaired in virtually any city in Russia or the CIS, and any driver can give advice even on the highway about how to take care of a problem. With foreign makes, you'll agree, this is somewhat harder to do. [TRUD] We know that the auto industry in Russia, and AvtoVAZ in particular, are not experiencing the best of times. Nor is it any secret that investment in the development of transportation is highly profitable. This is obviously why the state, through the Aeroflot bank, has directed 1.7 trillion credit rubles into the reconstruction of the Moscow airports and updating air transport. Would this kind of policy be justified with respect to automobile building? [Krasnenker] Certainly. It could achieve a long-term economic effect. LogoVAZ and especially the Zhiguli management are operating on a commercial basis, so we rely on our own forces. We are interested in improving quality and updating models for VAZ automobiles. For this to happen regularly takes extensive investments. Naturally, as world experience shows, these expenditures are repaid with interest, allowing, apart from everything else, for an update in technology and production all along the chain of plants that tie in to the production of an automobile. This means dozens of major enterprises. It is just this kind of approach that has the right to be called an economically regulated policy. I think that sooner or later the manager of state credits is going to reach a similar conclusion. It would be good for this to happen sooner, though. After all, the rate at which Zhigulis are bought up is very high; demand for this make is not falling. The telephone numbers for the LogoVAZ showroom in Moscow are 249-00-51, 546-07-80, and 140-52-31.
