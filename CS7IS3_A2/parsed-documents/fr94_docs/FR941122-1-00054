FR941122-1-00054 FR941122-1-00015 21. For 800 MHz SMR MTA licenses, the Commission proposes to use application procedures similar to those used for licensing of PCS based on the common use of Commission-defined geographic areas and spectrum blocks to define the scope of licenses in both services. The Commission seeks comment on this view, and on any alternative procedural approach that commenters may consider appropriate. It also proposes (1) to treat all MTA applicants as initial applicants for public notice, application processing, and competitive bidding purposes, (2) to require applicants for MTA-based SMR licenses to file an initial ``short-form'' application to qualify for competitive bidding, after which the successful bidder files a ``long form'' application, and (3) to adopt rules analogous to its PCS rules with respect to application content, amendment and modification of applications, return of defective applications, waiver procedures, and petitions to deny. In addition, the Commission proposes to allow a limited opportunity for MTA applicants to cure minor defects in their short-form applications (but not to allow major amendments after the expiration of the short-form filing window) and to adopt rules regarding major and minor modification of MTA licenses and petition to deny procedures (including ``greenmail'' restrictions limiting payments that a petitioner may receive in exchange for agreeing to withdraw a petition) that are consistent with its PCS rules. 22. The Commission also seeks comment on licensing procedures for local SMR channels. If local licensing is based on defined service areas, the Commission proposes to use application procedures similar to those used for the licensing of MTA blocks. If, on the other hand, site-specific licensing is adopted for the locally licensed SMR channels, the Commission proposes to use application procedures similar to those recently adopted for non-cellular Part 22 licensees. To the extent that 800 MHz SMR channels continue to be licensed on a site-specific basis, the Commission proposes to classify the following as ``initial'' applications for new authorizations: all applications for new frequencies or for stations more than 2 kilometers from an existing facility using the same channel. 23. In addition, the Commission recently indicated that for CMRS providers licensed on a site-specific basis, major modifications include a change in frequency, an increase in the effective radiated power or antenna height above average terrain in any azimuth, or a change in location. The Commission seeks comment on the applicability of this definition to locally licensed SMR systems and whether there are other types of modifications that should be deemed major in this context. The Commission proposes that major modification applications would be subject to filing window and cutoff procedures and processed on a first-come, first-served basis, except that (1) modification applications that are mutually exclusive with initial or modification applications filed on the same day would be classified as members of a ``same day filing group,'' and (2) modification applications filed within the 30-day public notice period of a competing initial application would be considered part of the 30-day filing group. In both cases, the mutually exclusive group of applications would be designated for comparative hearing (unless the parties negotiate a legal settlement) because the Budget Act does not permit the use of competitive bidding procedures to determine whether a modification application should be granted. The Further Notice seeks comment on whether our proposed definitions and procedures for dealing with modification applications are appropriate for licensing of local SMR channels. It also proposes adoption of petition to deny procedures for local SMR licensing similar to those proposed for MTA-based licensing. The Commission seeks comment, however, on whether petitions to deny locally licensed SMR applications should be filed within the initial 30-day public notice period following acceptance of such applications, or only after an auction winner has been determined, as is proposed in the case of MTA applications. In either case, the Commission intends to review only petitions filed against the auction winner. 24. The Commission proposes to classify all MTA licensees presumptively as CMRS providers because they are likely to provide interconnected service as part of their service offering. It further proposes that such presumption may be overcome by demonstrating that their service does not fall within the CMRS definition. In addition, the Further Notice proposes not to apply this presumption prior to August 10, 1996 in the case of any MTA licensee who was previously licensed in the SMR service as of August 10, 1993, and is therefore not subject to CMRS regulation for three years from the Budget Act's enactment date. It also seeks comment on whether the presumption of CMRS status should apply to licensees authorized for the 80 locally licensed channels.
