In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, Bal'awi added that the savage massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque reaffirmed that the settlements and peace are two parallel lines that do not converge. Settlements are the antithesis of the peace process because they represent an occupation force; a settlement is a military barracks and an offshoot of the army. Hence, withdrawal of the [Israeli] army, as a military occupation force, must be accompanied by the removal of settlements, he noted. Bal'awi added that a settler is only an army reservist and that the perpetrator of the massacre was a clear example of a military settler. The massacre once again confirmed Israeli institutions have so far been raised on grudges and racism. The question posed is: Would this make it possible to achieve a just peace, and can work be done to prevent such a mentality? The Palestinian official said credible efforts for genuine peace require immediate discussion of these settlements as an urgent issue, and that international protection should be provided for the sons of our Palestinian people. Bal'awi added that the Israeli establishment, which was raised on rancorous instructions and education, should not imagine that the Palestinian resistance cannot continue its defiance, confrontation, and all forms of struggle, until Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories is terminated.
