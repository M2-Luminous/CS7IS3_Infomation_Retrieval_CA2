His lawyer appealed for Postelnicu's temporary release from prison after producing as evidence a medical certificate proving that the former top communist dignitary was suffering from eight severe diseases requesting surgical intervention. Tudor Postelnicu is part of the group of former high dignitaries under the Ceausescu regime -- together with Emil Bobu, Ion Dinca and Manea Manescu -- arrested shortly after Ceausescu's runaway, who were put on trial on 27 January 1990. After a military court convicted him to life imprisonment under a genocide crime on 2 February 1990, the Supreme Court of Justice accepted an extraordinary appeal on 26 April 1993, changing the charge to complicity at aggravated murder and complicity at attempted aggravated murder. The sentences were: 17 years of imprisonment for Tudor Postelnicu, 15 years for Ion Dinca, 10 years each for Emil Bobu and Manea Manescu. The court also ruled for the first three to be stripped of their military ranks. Tudor Postelnicu is the second former top communist dignitary that was granted a release on parole in the past two weeks, after ex-general Iulian Vlad, the former head of the Securitate, released at the end of 1993 after serving one third of his sentence.
