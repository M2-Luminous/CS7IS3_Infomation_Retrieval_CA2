The conference will be held during the last week of April in Havana and will include an exchange of opinions on a wide variety of topics, including the prospective participation of Cubans abroad in the country's public and economic spheres, the weekly GRANMA INTERNACIONAL has just announced. Observers and political analysts of the Cuban situation cannot but notice the importance of an event of this nature if they take into account the large number of Cuban immigrants residing in other countries due to economic, family-related, and other reasons. This sector of the Cuban population has traditionally seen their relations with the island hindered because of the U.S. Government's permanent hostility toward Havana as well as because of the direct, and many times violent, actions carried out by several anti-Cuban organizations that are against any kind of dialogue. Cuba's call, which was initially outlined by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina during his recent visit to the United Nations, was received with interest by many immigrant sectors, especially in the United States. However, the sectors who oppose the talks excluded themselves when they tried to impose conditions to obstruct the dialogue. The significance of the Cuban Government's call is even greater considering that the meeting will take place in the same year that the island's administration picked to implement a long line of measures geared to stabilize and reinvigorate its economy. The attempts to get closer to Cubans abroad have precedents in the process of the Cuban revolution's history. In 1978 efforts of this nature resulted in an increase in the family reunification movement, mainly between Miami and Havana. On that occasion, and as evidence of good will, the local government initially released approximately 3,000 counterrevolutionary prisoners and allowed them to join their relatives abroad. In the more recent past, Havana made it possible to multiply the air ties between the United States and Cuba and, much to the displeasure of the sworn enemies of the revolution, the number of visits to Cuba by U.S. residents increased significantly. Despite the obstacles to any type of exchange by the existence and intensification of the U.S. blockade, more members of the Cuban community in the United States are increasingly rejecting this measure and disregarding regulations that negatively affect their relations with their place of origin. Now, the meeting called has a wide horizon and those who come to Havana will be able to give their opinions and discuss something of great importance: How to consolidate the sense of an independent country that Cubans have traditionally defended and the future of their ties with their country of origin.
