In a statement upon arrival at Moscow airport, Hata said the aim of his visit was to reaffirm the principles of the "Tokyo declaration" concluded during Yeltsin's visit to Japan. He said he will hold talks with his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev on international issues, including some problems in regions near Japan and the Far East of Russia, a reference to the disputed four islands. The local press expected no significant progress during Hata's visit on the future of the Kuril Islands, held by the Russians since the end of World War Two but claimed by Japan. The territorial dispute is the biggest outstanding bilateral issue between the two countries. The Japanese foreign minister will also meet with Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the lower chamber of parliament.
