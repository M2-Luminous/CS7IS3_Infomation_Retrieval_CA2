However, he said that in the next few days he will review the situation with the national leadership of Convergencia. At a meeting held with Freddy Munoz, the MAS leader, Henrique Salas Romer, the governor of the State of Carabobo, repeated his concern about the removal from office of Edgar Sayago and Ovidio Gonzalez. He added that amending the Law on the Election and Removal of Governors is an urgent matter, since the "spectacle" of dismissing a state governor, in addition to cheapening the will of the people and deepening the feeling that there is a power vacuum, harms the prestige of the process of decentralization. Freddy Munoz, the secretary general of the MAS, stated that the removals of governors from office are "a sign of insanity, a sign of political machinations, a sign of illegitimacy" which should be ended. He added that his party would be actively engaged in preventing "the perversion of the democratic spirit" and in amending the Law on the Election and Removal of Governors. Salas Romer said: "The juridical foundations are solid enough, and our proposals to all political parties have been aimed at reaching agreement on a partial amendment of the Law on the Election and Removal of Governors. Therefore, the necessary constitutional urgency has arisen to place a more certain juridical framework around the exercise of the functions for which we were elected." On the other hand Deputy Jose Miguel Uzcategui stated that, although the amendment of the Law on the Election and Removal of Governments is important, his party will decide what to do "to prevent more elements of uncertainty from being introduced in connection with regional governments." Although he recognized that he has a favorable opinion of Salas Romer, he stated that he could give no guarantees regarding the approval of his "Memorandum of Accounts," since it should be reviewed and discussed with regional legislators. Salas Romer stated that if a political agreement is reached with all of the political parties, in a short time it will be easy to develop a legally acceptable way of helping the governors to manage their affairs on behalf of the people, without doing damage to the power of the legislative assemblies, given the fact that their functions "are important in watching over and checking on the performance of the governor." Salas Romer, as well as Jesus Rondon Nucete, governor of the State of Merida, reviewed with the Committee on Regional Development the political crisis caused by the latest removals of state governors, agreeing that "there should be a relationship of cause and effect in the removal of governors from office." The provision of a referendum for removing governors appeared to be a practical alternative, both for the governors as well as for the legislative assemblies. Despite the fact that Salas Romer has his reservations about the percentage of the vote to be required in such a case, Rondon Nucete, the governor of the State of Merida, indicated that it would be enough to add to the Law on the Election and Removal of Governors a "democratic standard" to regulate the referendum.
