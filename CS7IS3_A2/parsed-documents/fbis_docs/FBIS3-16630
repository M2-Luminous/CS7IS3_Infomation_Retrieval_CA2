He said the Russian side promised to speed up the ratification of the treaty which is of much importance for creating the legal grounds for cooperation between Russia and Czechia. The Czech parliamentarian said that meetings with leaders of the Russian State Duma and Federation Council, with representatives of the Russian Foreign Ministry and of Russian political parties indicated that changes had taken place in the Russian foreign policy. During meetings and conversations that the Czech parliamentary delegation had in Moscow the sides were not striving to convince each other of anything. They only exchanged opinions on matters of mutual interest, specifically, the attitude to the "Partnership for Peace", European security and prospects for economic cooperation. "We got convinced that Russia respects Czechia's sovereignty", Jiri Pein said.
