ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: On September 10, 1992, EPA exempted used oil inserted into crude oil pipelines from the part 279 used oil management standards. EPA is today clarifying the existing pipeline exemption and expanding the exemption to other petroleum refinery applications. Today's document clarifies that the exemption from the used oil management standards did not intend to exclude used oil mixed with crude oil or natural gas liquids (hereinafter referred to as ``crude oil'') in pre-pipeline units (e.g., stock tanks, production separators) prior to being introduced into the crude oil pipeline. In addition, today's rule expands the used oil exemption to include transportation and/or storage of mixtures of small amounts of used oil (i.e., less than 1%) and crude oil that are destined for insertion into a petroleum refining facility process at a point prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. Today's rule exempts from the part 279 standards, used oil that is inserted into the petroleum refining facility process after distillation or catalytic cracking operations provided that the used oil meets the used oil specification prior to insertion. Today's rule also exempts from the part 279 standards used oil that incidentally enters and is recovered from a refinery's hydrocarbon recovery system or wastewater treatment system (i.e., process sewer, storm sewer, or wastewater treatment units), if the recovered used oil is subsequently inserted into the petroleum refinery process. In addition, today's rule expands the definition of transfer facility to allow used oil to be held more than 24 hours but less than 35 days prior to specified activities. Finally, EPA is today amending the used oil processor standards to clarify that a specific set of on-site maintenance, filtering, and separation activities were not intended to be covered under the used oil processor standards. EPA is also correcting errors in regulations that appeared in the May 3, 1993, Federal Register. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 4, 1994.
