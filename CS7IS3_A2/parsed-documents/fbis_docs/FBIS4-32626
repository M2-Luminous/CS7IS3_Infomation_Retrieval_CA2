"We have requested that the Cairo document include our reservations in the section dealing with the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which we shall distribute via the Yugoslav mission in New York to the movement member-states and demand that it have the force of a U.N. document," Prime Minister Radoje Kontic told a press conference. Egypt, which hosted the June conference, barred Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) from participation, in a decision unprecedented in the movement's annals. The Yugoslav diplomacy saw this as a manipulation of the rules of procedure because of a fear that Yugoslavia's presence might substantially alter the climate at the conference, especially as regards the Bosnian crisis, which would not have suited the book of Egypt and many another Islamic state. In order to avoid this, they have, regrettably, aligned the movement behind one of the Bosnian warring sides, viz. the Moslems. The government took the position that Yugoslavia should retain its membership in the movement, regardless of its virtual suspension as a result of the manipulations and violation of rules of procedure which resulted in its not being invited to the Cairo conference, said Kontic. Yugoslavia's membership has virtually been suspended not as a result of a true consensus of opinion among the member-nations or of any concrete decision, but as a result of manipulations and outside pressure by individual militant Islamic countries, he said. The government has instructed the Foreign Ministry to draft the country's long-term platform on the movement which would serve Yugoslavia's interests, upgrade its international position and help lift the sanctions which the international community clamped on Yugoslavia in 1992 for its alleged involvement in the Bosnian war, and in addition help the movement adjust to the new conditions of a non-bloc world.
