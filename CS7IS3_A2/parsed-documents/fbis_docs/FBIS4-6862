FBIS4-6862 "dreas079__a94004" FBIS-EAS-94-079-A Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo, Washington Differ on Goal of Framework Tokyo, Washington Differ on Goal of Framework OW2404113294 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 9--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2404113294 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Japan and the United States will start informal vice-ministerial negotiations on the Japan-U.S. framework talks, which have been broken off, after the Golden Week holidays [from the end of April through early May]. It was revealed on 23 April that there are differences between Japan and the United States in their views on the connection between the goal of the framework talks themselves, and individual sectors. The point at issue is the overall goal of the framework talks mentioned in the joint statement about a bilateral agreement on a new framework for trade talks, which was reached between the Japanese and U.S. leaders in July last year. The statement stipulated that a goal of the framework talks is to "substantially increase access and sales of competitive foreign goods and services." While the United States believes that this goal is applied to every individual sector such as insurance, Japan understands this "is not applied to all sectors." The breaking of the deadlock in the framework talks will possibly depend on whether both sides can fill the recognition gap. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor met in Marrakech, Morocco, on 15 April. In making a new proposal during the meeting, Kantor stated that the framework talks would be resumed on the condition that progress should be made in three areas: macroeconomy; the overall goal; and objective criteria. There have so far been clear differences between Japan and the United States in their views on macroeconomy and objective criteria. However, Kantor's new proposal "indicated obviously for the first time that Japan and the United States differ in views on interpretation of the overall goal" of the economic framework talks (as stated by a top official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry). According a source at the negotiations, the U.S. understanding is that the improvement in access of competitive foreign products "is the overall goal of the framework talks and this applies to every individual sector." It is observed that this U.S. view has led to its demand that numerical targets be set in all of the three priority sectors, including automobiles and auto parts. On the other hand, Japan maintains: "Of the three priority sectors, the goal of the government procurement sector is the same as that of the framework talks themselves. However, while the goal of the insurance sector is deregulation, that of the automobile and auto parts sector is the improvement in chances for access." The handling of the overall goal will inevitably become an important topic at informal negotiations from now on. If Japan generally promises "increased sales of competitive foreign goods," the United States will be satisfied with it. Will Japan and the United States discuss individual sectors in light of the characteristics of each sector? Or, will they apply the overall goal to each individual sector and recall arguments on numerical targets? Attention will be focused on moves by both Japan and the United States.
