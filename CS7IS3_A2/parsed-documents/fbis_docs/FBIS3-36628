Vladimir Lukin, head of the foreign affairs committee of the State Duma, the lower house of Russia's new parliament, said on Monday that U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali should have made his appeal to NATO commanders on air strikes against Bosnian Serbs only after such an investigation had been completed. "It is necessary to find out what actually happened and who may benefit from this, and only after that can one take steps through the U.N. Security Council. Only the Security Council can endow the secretary-general with respective powers," Lukin said. "I would be extremely surprised if Russia is cut off from this process." Lukin stressed that the use of force in any conflict is fraught with serious consequences. Asked if the State Duma will make any decisions in connections with the explosion in Sarajevo, Lukin said "the Duma does not realise the Russian foreign policy. This is the prerogative of the president and the government." He recalled that the State Duma had already expressed its attitude towards the crisis in former Yugoslavia by urging all sides concerned to refrain from the use of force and settle all disputes only by peaceful means.
