As usual, the biggest topic is how to reduce Japan's trade surplus, which recently reached a record high of $140 billion. However, while Japan-U.S. economic frictions have been discussed under a hypothesis that "The Japanese economy is stronger than that of the United States," the framework has completely changed since the Clinton administration's inauguration. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will certainly be surprised if he actually sees a sudden recovery of the U.S. economy, since Japan has not yet found a way out of the prolonged recession. An economic expansion of the United States economy is good news for the Japanese economy. Generally speaking, the yen becomes cheaper against the dollar when the U.S. economy becomes strong. Expanded output by U.S. industries brings about increased machine and part exports from Japan to the United States. Since the exporting industries of Japan have been suffering from the rapid appreciation of the yen rates, they may be given a break. Of course, the U.S. economy has not yet become strong enough to allow Japan's economic recovery through boosted exports to the United States. On the other hand, Japanese industries' competitive power is currently too weak to resume violent exports to the United States. Japan must accelerate its efforts to revitalize its economy by stimulating domestic consumption. At the same time, it is about time Japan dealt with the United States as an equal partner, overcoming its passive manners in bilateral negotiations. In the last quarter of 1993, the real growth rate of the U.S. economy reached 5.9 percent. This demonstrated the United States is really heading for economic recovery. After the enactment of legislation for reducing fiscal deficits, private consumption and capital investments were triggered by a rapid decline in long-term market interest rates. According to U.S. President Bill Clinton's budget message to the Congress, the federal government's fiscal deficits in fiscal year 1995 (from October 1994 to September 1995) will drop to $170 billion. If the figure remains below $200 billion, it will be the lowest in the last six years. The reduction of fiscal deficits is a result of the budget cut and tax hike policies. Lowered interest rates and economic recovery are also positive factors in the sense that these bring about a reduction of interest payments on national bonds and an increase in tax revenues. Yet, we cannot be too optimistic about the future of the U.S. economy. The government's belt-tightening policy is a negative factor for further economic expansion. If the Congress rejects the government's medical insurance reform plan, long-term interest rates will rapidly pick up in anticipation of fiscal deficit growth. It is also uncertain how long personal consumption will remain brisk in the United States because individual consumption is already growing faster than people's income. Increased job opportunities are primarily for temporary employees of restaurants and other service industries, rather than permanent employees in manufacturing industries. The expansion of individual consumption will be limited when the economic recovery does not raise workers' earnings. It is not very easy to maintain high levels of economic growth through the domestic market's expansion when the nation is working on reducing fiscal deficits. So, the Clinton administration has an economic strategy to expand exports to boost the economy. This is why the United States is strongly urging Japan to open its markets and expand domestic consumption. Prime Minister Hosokawa is going to attend the summit with the new pump-priming package as a souvenir. At that time, the prime minister should not let the United States entertain too many expectations about effects from the pump-priming package because it cannot boost the Japanese economy or reduce Japan's trade surplus immediately. The prime minister should candidly explain the fact that the government has very limited control over the economy. The private sector's self-help effort is an indispensable condition for overcoming the recession. Also, U.S. exports to Japan cannot be increased without efforts by U.S. companies. If Japan accepts U.S. demands for setting numerical targets for increasing imports from the United States, it will only result in a reinforcement of governmental restrictions over business activities. The foundation for international policy coordination is sincerely seeking steady growth of one's own economy, not criticizing each other. We hope the two leaders reconfirm this point at the summit.
