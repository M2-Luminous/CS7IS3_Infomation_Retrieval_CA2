Middle and high level officials whose work is connected with the continuation of operations at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are anxious about the prospects of its possible closing. First, they launched their attack in the fall of 1990, in the times of the erstwhile USSR. A high commission from Moscow, checking the security of the blocks, proposed that the safe blocks that had not exploded in 1986 continue working. That was just the beginning. A direct attack began in 1992 when nuclear scientists forced the Ukrainian president to say: ``Nuclear power engineering has no alternatives.'' Having received ``carte blanche,'' the nuclear lobby launched a campaign against antinuclear forces and supported the president through various seminars and conferences. On 21 September, our deputies only had to sum up the numerical superiority of the influential lobbyists. Will the Supreme Council decisions help us live through a cold winter? I doubt it since the Chernobyl nuclear power plant produces only 2 percent of the electricity, and the three recently closed nuclear blocks are not going to start operating before spring 1994. At the same time, I can guarantee that the cost of their repairs will twist the inflation spiral. In addition, I want to remind you that our losses from operating the Chernobyl nuclear power plant stand at 200 billion karbovanetses [K] (in 1990 prices). The work on this power plant and its operation will cost us K12 billion additionally. This financial prognosis was prepared by former plant manager Shcherbina. Our deputies often cite Russia as an example of safely operating nuclear power plants. However, why not take the United States which has not been constructing nuclear power plants for decades now? As for United States citizens, they learn from their mistakes. After the Three Mile Island accident, they do not identify technical progress with the development of nuclear power engineering. Mankind has not yet created wasteless nuclear power engineering. V. Mikhaylov, Russian minister of nuclear power engineering, explained this tactfully at a Tokyo press conference. Thus, the waste from Russian nuclear power plants will be poured into the Sea of Japan and, according to Mikhaylov, it is no more poisonous than the Japanese nuclear waste. So, no problems.... Where are we going to spill our nuclear waste? Into the Dnieper River or the Black Sea? Currently, our children's destiny is in the hands of the so- called Chernobyl reanimators.
