According to local officials, the area sown in cash crops in the province experienced an increase of 11.4 percent compared with that of last year, while local farmers have also been urged to maintain a stable grain growing area. Among the cash crops sown, the growing area of cotton now reaches 778,800 hectares, 157,700 hectares more than last year's level, said the officials. To ensure the success of this year's spring farming, the provincial government held a working meeting early this year to work out detailed plans for spring farming. At the same time, the province also held a provincial-level briefing sending forth information concerning agriculture and helped to analyze market trends in connection with farm produce, as well as announcing to local farmers preferential policies from the central government regarding grain and cotton production. The endeavor has effectively aroused the initiative of farmers in growing grain and other cash crops. Local agricultural banks, supply and marketing cooperatives and departments of means of agricultural production have also moved in and managed to provide local farmers with necessary funds and means of agricultural production, such as chemical fertilizers, pesticides, plastic sheeting and seeds.
