The DPRK's Army Lt. Colonel Yu Yong-Chol made the notification on Tuesday at Panmunjom in his capacity as chief liaison officer for the newly-organized mission when he contacted UNC Lt. Colonel R. Flury. Pyongyang, however, told the UNC that it will maintain its telephone lines at the joint duty officers' room at Panmunjom. The spokesman said that the UNC plans to ask the DPRK to hold a senior secretaries' meeting of the Military Armistice Committee soon to discuss the issue. The DPRK unilaterally withdrew its representatives from the Military Armistice Committee on April 27, demanding the Korean armistice agreement signed at the end of 1950-1953 Korean war be replaced by a peace accord.
