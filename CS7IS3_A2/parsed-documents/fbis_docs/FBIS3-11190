The communique asks the national government to maintain diplomatic or commercial relations with this socialist country. "Our party had the honor of hosting a delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The delegation was headed by Vice Premier Kim Pok-sin and other North Korean Social Democratic Party members. The visit's purpose was to seek the opening of official relations with our government and counteract the biased disinformation and slander campaign against the DPRK that is disseminated by powers with world hegemonic interests in the region and that does not allow Korean brothers to seek their own solutions to their differences," the PRF communique says. The communique adds that the delegation, accompanied by PRF politicians, fulfilled an agenda that included meetings with national government authorities and leaders of political parties, social movements, entrepreneurs, and industry. The communique says the DPRK has made a 10-point proposal for Korea's reunification leading to the creation of a federative state encompassing north and south. The proposal says the new state will be established on the basis of mutual recognition and reciprocal tolerance of existing ideologies and regimes, with a unified national government where both states would have equal participation and similar prerogatives and obligations. The communique says the Korean people are a homogeneous nation whose people lived in the same territory sharing their blood and cultural links for five millennia. The note says that ideological and administrative differences cannot be obstacles to peaceful coexistence. "The PRF, as is well stated in its political ideology, is loyal to the principle of internationalism, the brotherhood of peoples, and their right to self-determination. This means that from the PRF's viewpoint, the national government must build links with all nations in the world within the framework of mutual respect. Peaceful coexistence feeds on these principles and relations between peoples must be funneled through cultural, technical, and commercial relations with due respect for each nation's idiosyncrasies," the PRF document stresses. We must recall that the Korean vice president and his entourage were not received by his Paraguayan counterpart, Angel Roberto Seifart. Vice Presidential Secretary General Victor Hugo Pena said the request for a meeting with Seifart was made in Seifart's capacity as vice president at a time he was acting president because of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's absence from the country. Another source said, however, that the meeting did not materialize because our country does not maintain diplomatic relations with the DPRK.
