Company spokeswoman Andrea Franke stated today in Oberndorf that Heckler und Koch only exported hunting rifles to former Yugoslavia with the necessary approval in the early 1980's. This would not come under the arms embargo, she said. According to the London paper, the Serbian authorities have confirmed that the arms factory supplied G3 weapons to Belgrade. The spokeswoman stressed that the company could not understand how these weapons, which come under the embargo, had come to be in former Yugoslavia. The newspaper's information is "untrue." Heckler und Kohl had "at no time" supplied arms to the war zone. The British arms manufacturer Royal Ordnance, which has belonged to British Aerospace since 1987, bought the Baden-Wuerttemberg factory in 1991. According to the paper, there were extensive contacts between the two firms before this time, however. The paper said that the British arms company acted as a kind of "mediator" and helped to export arms to the former GDR. The weapons were first transported from Oberndorf to London and from there shipped to Rostock. Heckler und Koch weapons have also been found in Nicaragua. Heckler and Koch were able to circumvent German export laws through the contacts with Royal Ordnance, the INDEPENDENT said.
