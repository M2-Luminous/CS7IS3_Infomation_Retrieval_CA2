The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation declaration on Tuesday is "not very clear and even contradictory," the paper said adding that "it carries no ultimatum, thus no firm decision to end Milosevic's campaign by the only possible means -- force." Slobodan Milosevic is the president of Serbia. The paper added that the mainly Moslem Bosnian army "would suffer nothing but harm if it trusted the NATO threat" and that Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has also dismissed the warning. The NATO declaration came at the end of the alliance's two-day summit Tuesday.
