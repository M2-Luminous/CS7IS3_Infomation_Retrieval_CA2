The report clarifies the U.S. demands in the priority areas, including insurance, automobiles and auto parts, and telecommunications, claiming: "The United States is not seeking the setting of numerical targets. This report was compiled to dispel any misunderstanding" (according to the U.S. Embassy in Japan). However, Japan remains suspicious, saying, "A careful reading of the report shows the U.S. stance of being preoccupied with numerical targets remains unchanged" (according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]). The report emphasizes: "The U.S. Government understands that trade should be determined by the market mechanism, and the framework talks are aimed at enhancing the opposite of managed trade [hi-kanri boeki] in Japan." However, the report does cite some figures in several passages, such as: "While the market share of foreign insurance companies in advanced nations is 10 to 34 percent, their share in the Japanese market is merely 2 percent." Regarding automobiles and auto parts, the report says: "We demand that" the target of increasing Japanese carmakers' purchase of U.S.-made parts to $19 billion in fiscal 1994 "remains in place even in and after 1995." MITI has reacted coldly to the report, claiming: "It merely avoids direct expressions; the U.S. stance of being preoccupied with numerical targets is still discernible."
