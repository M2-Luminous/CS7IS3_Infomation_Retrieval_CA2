[Dominik] I am here to restructure the state sector in our agriculture. Our agency is a fiduciary organ, whose principal brief is to privatize state assets by selling them or renting them out. [Debek] So, in the final account, it amounts to liquidation, does it not? [Dominik] You could say so, although a special section, Section XIV, of the agency has been set up in Warsaw to represent agricultural enterprises of particular significance to the national agriculture, such as stock-breeding farms, plant nurseries, and seed-production centers. These will either remain under state administration or be transformed into joint ventures, with the State Treasury as the dominant shareholder. On the whole, however, local divisions of the State Treasury Agricultural Property Agency take over the PGR's in order to liquidate them. Here I should add that, during the transition period, the agency, as the owner, extends financial assistance to at least some spheres of the PGR's operation, such as housing, or, in justified cases, helps with the purchase of seed material or crop-protection products. After all, we must not allow freshly sown crops to go to waste, and banks no longer provide credits for the PGR's. [Debek] You could get the impression that this is an ideological policy. Even the good PGR's are to be sacrificed because they are children of an ideologically incorrect system. The unfairness is compounded by the fact that most state farms suffer financial difficulties not because they have been incompetently or wastefully managed but as a result of the financial reform introduced by [former Finance Minister] Balcerowicz and the resultant astronomical interest on bank loans to agriculture, loans that are temporarily "frozen" in crop production and stock-raising ventures. [Dominik] Agreed, but, in the first place, these debts are very real, and no one will relieve the PGR's of them. Agricultural farms in lower Silesia owe almost 1.5 trillion zlotys [Z] to the banks, the state budget, and their contractors. And, even if interest constitutes the lion's share of that debt, that does not change the picture. Second, there have always been farms that are more successful and those that are less so--and this not only because of differences in soil quality, equipment, or location but because of different management systems, varying degrees of care taken over their assets, or prudence in making major investment decisions. It is no coincidence that, even in these difficult times, certain PGR's, mostly in Walbrzych Voivodship but also some in Wroclaw Voivodship, manage quite well on their own. The worst situation is currently with PGR's in Jelenia Gora Voivodship: All of them have by now lost their creditworthiness. [Debek] That is because they operate under the most adverse climatic and soil conditions. The previous authorities in power deliberately subsidized such farms in order to provide work for people in the area and utilize land that, on ideological principles, could not be left uncultivated. In addition, in the last analysis, attention was paid to the output obtained from those farms--that is, to the tons of livestock and grain--rather than to their cost-effectiveness. In addition, certain capital investments that still place great financial burden on state farms today are the result of earlier decisions imposed on them by the central administration. Ambitious powers-that-be would stipulate, quite arbitrarily, that a dozen poultry farms be built in one place, a huge dairy farm in another--more often than not in the middle of nowhere--and a massive stock production unit for 5,000 beef calves. They gave the orders and provided the funds.... [Dominik] Even so, some farm managers were also very eager for their farms to be earmarked for such major investment projects. They were brilliantly skilled at justifying the financial and general economic profitability of such undertakings, and, later on, at manipulating the results so as to justify allocation of high bonuses for the economic effects. I was employed in such PGR's for 10 years, and I know only too well how things were. [Debek] Such were the times and such were the conditions to which the PGR managers had to adjust. However, you are also aware that, regardless of the statistical manipulations of which they were guilty, given their trained cadres, their access to modern agrotechnology, and their financial resources, the PGR's provided models of modern agricultural technology and organization in Poland's rural sector. They were the first to introduce new varieties of crop plants and new stock-feeding systems; they persuaded the traditional peasant farmers that it was in their interest to apply fertilizers, to use crop-protection products, and so on. Who will assume the state's leading role in this capacity now, in our impoverished and fragmented rural sector? [Dominik] The PGR's are being transformed, but they will not disappear from the map of Poland's economy. Only a proportion of our agricultural land will go into the hands of individual farmers and be submitted to fragmentation. The general principle is that whole farming complexes should be sold or rented in their entirety, together with the land, which should go with them on a rational basis. In this way, our rural sector will retain large and modern farming complexes. The only difference will be that they will be owned privately and managed in a better way. And, in general, they will be able to remain whole precisely because they will be transformed: This is because they will be handed over by us to new owners without the burden of debts. That is precisely the chance they need! The debts will be taken over by the agency, and it will pay them off with money obtained from the profits it makes from the privatization scheme. [Debek] But where are you going to find those hypothetical new owners? The book value of the assets of the PGR's under liquidation in Lower Silesia is estimated at Z5 trillion--and that is without the value of the land. Where are all the capitalists with enough spare money to put into such an uncertain financial proposition? Is it not symptomatic that, out of the 163 agricultural complexes taken over by the State Treasury, your agency has to date managed to liquidate only 18? [Dominik] A vast proportion of our time is taken up with preparatory work: stock-taking, preparation of estimates, sorting out ownership documents and related paperwork, and so on. I can say that this year the process of ownership transformations will be definitely speeded up because we have already completed the documentation stage for many agricultural complexes. And there are enough prospective buyers already: More than 80 percent of auction sales we have organized recently ended with successful sale transactions. This also furnishes an answer to your other question: where to find the new owners with sufficient money. Prospective renters at PGR auctions are usually people who are already associated with the PGR's. They most often form employees' joint ventures, and they find the necessary funds by borrowing money--sometimes even against the expected harvests. This is because they must, of course, have the required 10 percent for the initial down payment and for the first installment, just as they must produce for us guarantees that they will be able to pay the following installments. Apart from that, we are willing to help them by negotiating the terms with them. This is, after all, in the common interest of the agricultural complexes, the agency, and the PGR work forces.... [Debek] Precisely. There are 12,000 people employed in the PGR's. For them, a PGR is not only a place where they work but also provides them with a whole environment--they live in PGR housing, their children used to go to PGR kindergartens, the PGR gave them the sheds in which they kept their hogs and the strip of field where they could grow their own potatoes, and each family was given its quota of milk from the farm's dairy. [Dominik] Of course. And it was such social welfare schemes that finished off the state farms. [Debek] But what will happen now? A new owner will take over the farm. He will work out that it would not be worth his while to raise cattle, and so he will dismiss his farm workers. He may at best promise them some seasonal work during the grain or potato harvest.... [Dominik] Not at all. One of the terms of the rent agreement is that all of the farm employees must have their jobs guaranteed for at least one year. What is more, the amount of rent payment offered by the potential leaseholder does not necessarily have to be the decisive argument in his favor against other candidates. It is equally important whether he can offer guarantees of maintaining the farm's full production profile. We will sign lease contracts only with those candidates who can offer us fully credible assurances that they will keep these terms. [Debek] In other words, they have to guarantee that they will cultivate the land, grow crops, and refrain from slaughtering all of the livestock on their farms and viewing the land solely as a profitable capital investment? [Dominik] Precisely. [Debek] Thank you for talking to us.
