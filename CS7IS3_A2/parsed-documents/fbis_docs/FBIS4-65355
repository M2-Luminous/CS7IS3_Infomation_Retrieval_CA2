[passage omitted] Rwanda was also on the agenda of the talks of the 12 foreign ministers in Brussels today. The Europeans have committed themselves to increase their humanitarian effort in favor of the victims of the civil war. They also want to try and give a fresh boost to the political negotiations process. This is what the French foreign minister [Alain Juppe] said after the meeting: [Begin Juppe recording] What is happening in Rwanda at the moment deserves to be called a genocide. In the face of this unbearable situation, what can the international community do, and what will France do? First of all, it must intensify its humanitarian aid. How can this humanitarian aid be forwarded, first of all to those Rwandan refugees in northern Burundi -- this is one of the points of implementation of France's humanitarian aid -- and then to Rwanda itself through the ICRC [International Committee of Red Cross], the nongovernmental organization which is most present on the ground right now in Rwanda? Secondly, we must do our utmost so that an international humanitarian force is deployed on the ground as quickly as possible. It must be a UN force, since it is the only one which has the required speed and efficiency. Thirdly, we must support mediators in the region. In that respect, the idea of a summit of the heads of state in the region -- which would make it possible to start fresh negotiations on the basis of the Arusha accords - is supported by France.
