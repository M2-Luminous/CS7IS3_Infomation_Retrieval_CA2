The Hebron massacre and the death of a demonstrator during the ensuing riots in Rahat tightened the links between the Bedouins and the Palestinians, according to MK al-Sani'. Al-Rujub denied he has said that the opponents of the agreement are entitled to continue the armed struggle. [Al-Rujub] I said that all citizens must honor the agreement signed by the PLO, because the PLO is the sole representative of the Palestinian people.
