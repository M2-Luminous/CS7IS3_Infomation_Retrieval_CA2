According to the opinion the diplomat expressed in an interview with ITAR-TASS, talk on sanctions is premature while appropriate negotiations are under way, and possibilities of the negotiating process have not been exhausted. Besides, this issue will be discussed by the forthcoming session of the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors. The international community should display flexibility on this question and should use all available possibilities, he stressed.
