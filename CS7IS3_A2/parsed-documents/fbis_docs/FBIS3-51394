I am not campaigning because of my status as senator, but if I was called, I would not hesitate to become the next prime minister, he stated. Moreover, he said he is competent for such a post. [Begin Larosiliere recording] "I must clearly tell you that it is not a matter of [word indistinct]. It is a matter of capability, it is a matter of sacrifice." At this time, Senator Larosiliere is a man who can perform the functions of prime minister in Haiti. If I could not, I would say: No, I cannot. But I feel I can. So, if I am invited, if this post is offered to me, "I will accept, and I believe it is one of the best choices that could be made. If some believe that I am taking steps just so I can become prime minister, I can say other things are involved." I think that I am here to serve the nation, but I will not take any steps because I have a mandate as senator; I am very proud to be a senator and I would be happy to remain in Parliament to do that job. I am repeating the following for you: If "they see that I can contribute to a way out of the crisis, I am ready; and I believe the people as well as President Aristide, the Armed Forces, and all sectors in this country will not send flowers to me--so to say-- because I do not hold the post, but I am sure that the results will be positive if I do occupy this post." [as heard] [end recording] This was Sen. Julio Larosiliere, who is available to occupy the post of prime minister.
