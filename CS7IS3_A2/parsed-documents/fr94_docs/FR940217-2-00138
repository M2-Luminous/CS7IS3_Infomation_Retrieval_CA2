FR940217-2-00138 FR940217-2-00080 B. Rolling Application and Selection Process At the request of the higher education community, the Secretary will employ a rolling application and selection process. As provided in the solicitation of applications in this notice, the Secretary has established up to three deadlines. The first is March 30, 1994. By June 15, 1994, the Secretary will select schools from all applications received by the first deadline, including applications submitted for the 1994&hyph;1995 academic year. If the loan volume of the selected schools represents less than 40 percent of the new student loan volume for the 1995&hyph;1996 academic year, the Secretary will select additional schools from applications submitted by July 1, 1994. The Secretary will select these schools by September 15, 1994. At this point, if the loan volume of all selected schools represents less than 40 percent of the new student loan volume for the 1995&hyph;1996 academic year, the Secretary will select additional schools from applications submitted by October 1, 1994. The Secretary will select these schools by November 15, 1994. Shortly after each selection, the Secretary will publish lists of selected schools in the Federal Register . The Secretary emphasizes that the Department will stop selecting schools for the 1995&hyph;1996 academic year as soon as the new student loan volume of the selected schools comprises 40 percent of the total volume for that academic year. It is possible that the 40 percent cut-off will be reached by the first or second application deadline. Thus, potential participants are strongly encouraged to submit applications early. Waiver of Rulemaking It is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. While the Secretary has consulted with members of the higher education community in the development of the standards in this notice, the timely implementation of the Direct Loan Program for the 1995&hyph;1996 academic year does not permit the solicitation of further public comment. The increase from five percent of new student loan volume in the first year of the program to 40 percent in the second year means that the number of schools participating in the program in the second year is likely to increase from 104 to over 2,000. Several thousand applications are expected to be reviewed. In order to determine each applicant's eligibility and evaluate its administrative capability, the Secretary must research several different types of records. The Secretary estimates that up to 75 days will be needed to complete the review of the expected volume of applications and make selection decisions. To ensure successful implementation of the Direct Loan Program in the second year, schools need to receive program and software training, integrate Direct Loan Program materials into school publications, and interface Direct Loan software and origination procedures with the school's own systems and procedures. The Secretary believes that the training of school personnel, the development and distribution of materials, and the updating of direct loan systems and procedures must begin by June 1994. These preparations require that the Secretary initiate the school selection process as soon as possible. In light of the preparations required to accommodate the dramatic growth in the Direct Loan Program in the 1995&hyph;1996 academic year, the Secretary finds that the requirements for the second-year implementation of the program do not permit the solicitation of further public comment on the standards for participation in that year. Therefore, the Secretary finds that such a solicitation would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). STANDARDS FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE DIRECT LOAN PROGRAM_1995&hyph;1996 ACADEMIC YEAR I. Eligibility Requirements A. In order to participate in the Direct Loan Program, a school must meet the eligibility requirements in section 435(a) of the HEA and in paragraph I.C. of these standards. If schools apply as a consortium, each school must meet these eligibility requirements. B. Under section 435(a), a school must have a cohort default rate of less than 25 percent for at least one of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available, unless the school is exempt from this requirement under section 435(a)(3)(C). That section provides that until July 1, 1994, (a) Historically Black Colleges and Universities are defined in section 322(2) of the HEA, (b) tribally controlled community colleges within the meaning of section 2(a)(4) of the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978, and (c) Navajo Community Colleges under the Navajo Community College Act are exempt from the cohort default rate requirement. C.1. In order to participate in the Direct Loan Program, a school must also have a cohort default rate of less than 25 percent for one of the two most recent fiscal years for which data are available at the time of the first selection decision following its application. 2. If a statutory exemption from the three-year default rate requirement in section 435(a) is extended beyond July 1, 1994, the Secretary reserves the right to waive the two-year cohort default rate requirement for any school exempted from the three-year requirement. II. Selection Criteria A. The Secretary selects schools to participate in the Direct Loan Program in the 1995&hyph;1996 academic year from among those that apply to participate. In evaluating an application from a school that is eligible to participate in the Direct Loan Program, the Secretary considers two factors: 1. Whether the school is willing to participate ( i.e. communicate with the Secretary) electronically. 2. Whether the school is capable of administering the Direct Loan Program. While the Secretary retains discretion to evaluate all relevant circumstances, any of the following factors would indicate that the school is not administratively capable: a. The school is on the reimbursement system of payment for any of the programs under subparts 1 or 3 of part A, part C, or part E of title IV of the HEA. b. The school is overdue on program or financial reports or audits required under title IV of the HEA. c. The school is subject to an emergency action or a proposed or final limitation, suspension, or termination action under sections 428(b)(1)(T), 432(h), or 487(c) of the HEA. d. In the opinion of the Secretary, the school has had significant deficiencies for any of the programs under title IV of the HEA, including deficiencies demonstrated by audits or program reviews submitted or conducted during the five calendar years immediately preceding the date of application. B. In selecting schools from among eligible applicants that are capable of administering the Direct Loan Program and are willing to participate electronically, the Secretary, to the extent possible, selects schools that are reasonably representative in terms of anticipated loan volume, length of academic program, control of the school, highest degree offered, size of student enrollment, geographic location, annual loan volume, and default experience.
