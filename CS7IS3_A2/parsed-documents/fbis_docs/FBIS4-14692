He said that these two principles may lay a foundation for talks on ending all combat operations. Azerbaijan lays no claims on foreign territories, including the territory of Armenia, he said. He also pointed out that Azerbaijan was the victim of Armenian aggression. Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov told the French representatives that the status of Nagorno Karabakh might only be discussed after the liberation of the occupied Azerbaijani territories. This problem must become the subject of talks between Karabakh's Azerbaijani and Armenian communities, said Hasanov.
