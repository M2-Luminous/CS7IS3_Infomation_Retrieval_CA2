Although he is not coming to discuss the issue of Hong Kong, he should be coming to improve Sino-British relations and resume friendship and cooperation. Otherwise, the visit will be meaningless. Some newspapers in Hong Kong have expressed a welcome for Goodlad's upcoming visit to China and have held that this is a sign of improvement in Sino-British relations. In the past few years, Britain has erroneously estimated the situation in China and has changed its policy toward China, thus harming the friendship and cooperation between China and Britain. China has not developed in the direction of the illusions cherished by Britain but instead, has become more open, more prosperous, and stronger. Practice has proved that the British Government's confrontation with China goes against the global tide, does harm to its own interests, and does not have the support of the people. China is a vast market with an extremely large potential and is a country that holds the balance of the world. Whoever ignores her or even has trouble with her will come to grief. Not long ago, the Clinton administration was uncompromising in insisting on linking human rights with trade and claimed that it would not extend China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status if China did not "improve its human rights" situation according to their instructions. The Clinton administration had no alternative but to succumb to the reality of China's extraordinary development and finally extended China's MFN status without any conditions attached, expressing its willingness to strengthen trade and economic cooperation with China. At present, some economically large countries in the world are trying to have closer ties and cooperation with China. Can the British people think of why their government wants to have confrontation with China instead of taking an approach in the interests of the people? Recently, the Conservative Party of the British Prime Minister John Major suffered a total defeat in the parliamentary elections, losing all five seats; this was followed by bitter defeat in the European Council elections in which nearly half of the original 32 seats were lost mainly to the opposition, the Labor Party. This has evidently shown the voters' dissatisfaction with the British Government and John Major's position is in danger. Under such circumstances, the Major administration has no alternative but to look for some way out. Trying to improve relations with China and to resume cooperation is one of the way out. The key to improving Sino-British relations is that Britain must abandon its erroneous policy of confrontation with China. A report issued recently by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the British Parliament discloses the situation of changes in the policy toward China by the British Government in recent years and also counsels the British Government about continuing its confrontation with China, thus adding fuel to the fire. If the British Government really wants to resume Sino-British cooperation, it must make an open statement on its stance toward that report. People will judge whether or not Britain has the sincerity to improve its relations with China by its actions. Although Alastair Goodlad's visit to China is not for discussing the Hong Kong issue, he cannot avoid touching upon the Hong Kong issue and his visit cannot have any impact on how to handle the issue of Hong Kong. What Chris Patten practices in Hong Kong will be an important expression of the change in the British Government's policy toward China. If Alastair Goodlad really comes to improve relations and to resume cooperation, he should urge the British side to create an atmosphere of cooperation on the issue of Hong Kong and to negotiate and solve together with the Chinese side, some pressing problems such as those concerning the new airport, the military use of land, and so on. Regarding the political structure, it is impossible to have Sino- British cooperation because the basis for such cooperation has been completely destroyed by the British side. Qian Qichen, State Council Vice premier and concurrently Foreign Minister, reaffirmed yesterday: "It does not matter whatever plan the 1994 and 1995 elections are carried out, the terms of office of those elected will only last till 30 June 1997 and after that, the councils concerned will be reorganized". However, China and Britain can cooperate in issues other than the issue of political structure, such as economic and social issues and issues concerning the people's livelihood. The Chinese side has always been sincere in such cooperation. So long as the proposals conform with the principle of state sovereignty and smooth transition and are in the interests of the economic and social development of Hong Kong and of the peaceful and contented lives and work of the residents, the Chinese side will adopt a positive attitude to negotiate with the British side and to solve all the problems in a fair and reasonable manner. Vice Premier Qian Qichen said that the breaking down of talks on the elections in 1994 and 1995 was something of the past and at present, the two sides should seek opportunities for cooperation on other issues. Regarding solutions to problems of the new airport and land for military use, Qian Qichen, State Council Vice Premier and concurrently Foreign Minister, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and Chen Zuoer, representative of the Chinese side on the Defense and Social Order Subcommittee, have in the past few days adopted optimistic attitudes. They all believe that progress has been made in the talks and hope that agreements can be reached earlier rather than later. This shows that the Chinese side sincerely hopes to cooperate with the British side. It seems the British side has been put to the test. If the British side shows a cooperative attitude at meetings of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group and is willing to listen to fair and reasonable views from the Chinese side, the two sides will be able to reach agreements on the new airport and land for military use and this will show Alastair Goodlad's sincerity to improve relations and resume cooperation in his visit to China. In short, since Alastair Goodlad wants to seek cooperation in Beijing, he should create a favorable atmosphere for cooperation before he starts his trip. This should be shown not only in words but also in deeds. Talking about Alastair Goodlad's visit to China, British Ambassador to China Robin McClaren said that the British side hoped to resume better relations but denied that the British side hoped to readjust the policy for Sino-British relations during the visit. We can only ask: Can China and Britain resume "better relations" if the policy toward China is not readjusted? What is the meaning of the remarks by the ambassador?
