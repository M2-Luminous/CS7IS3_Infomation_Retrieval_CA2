The government of President Soglo yesterday announced that it was offering a huge financial reward in exchange for information leading to the recovery of military weapons stolen from an Army base near the main city, Cotonou. From there, our reporter Karim Okanla takes up the story. [Begin recording] In an interview broadcast on the national radio, the minister of defense, Mr. Desire Vieyra, said that the government was offering a 2.5-million-CFA-franc reward to anyone who will provide information on last week's theft of weapons from the military base in Ouidah, located about 40 km north of Cotonou. Seven rocket launchers, assault rifles, and a large quantity of ammunition went missing from the base, and so far security forces have failed to track down the thieves. The minister of defense says that a special phone line is being made available at the Ministry of Interior so as to allow people to call in. This is an unusual situation and it requires a special solution, the minister of defense added. Mr. Vieyra also disclosed that a French military delegation is expected in Cotonou today to discuss security matters. For four years now, the Soglo government has had to cope with apparently unsurmountable security problems. Weapons have been stolen several times from different ammunition depots across the country, and according to Mr. Florentin Feliho, a former minister of defense, the Soglo government lacks the authority to enforce the law. Reliable reports also indicate that there is growing discontent within the Army ranks since the reshuffle of the military hierarchy last year. Now (?groups) like the military here are about to undergo a major reform program. [end recording]
