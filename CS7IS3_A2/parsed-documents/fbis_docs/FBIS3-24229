I think that in order to overcome this situation, we have tactical and strategic steps in reserve. I would relate to the tactical the fact that we first of all need a press center that feeds information to all of our newspapers and to our television. As for the strategic directions, they, in my view, are these: Of course, you cannot take the mass media by assault and frontal attacks. The previous Supreme Soviet tried to do this, but this attempt was not crowned with success. The powerful structures also did not succeed in tearing off their own "Parliamentary Hour" piece by piece. This tactic is futile. It is nonsense that the government--one of the branches of power--today monopolizes all state mass media as an instrument of public control over this very power. Therefore, we must correct the condition legislatively and create the kind of situation where the mass media works objectively, and no one interferes with it. We intend tomorrow to submit the draft of a federal law for review by the State Duma concerning the procedure for elucidating in the state mass media the activity of the higher organs of authority of the Russian Federation. [Shabalin] The problems about which you are talking are associated directly with articles of the law adopted by the Supreme Soviet, which, however, the president suspended.... [Poltoranin] The president suspended a lot of laws and many legislative acts. Committees (including ours also) will conduct an inventory of everything that has been suspended and will submit the question for Duma review. The mass media is an important force, the fourth branch of power, and we must do everything so that the press should cooperate with the State Duma. As for specific proposals and the adoption of decisions about renewing the transmission of "600 Seconds," etc.--these are not functions of the Duma. There is a separation of powers according to the new Constitution, there is a law on the mass media, and there are such structures as, for example, the television company "Sankt-Peterburg--Channel 5." There are also such substructures as "600 Seconds." This is their business, and not that of the State Duma: to produce or not to produce. Our business is to create the kind of law so that there would be no barriers for one or another television program or for articles in newspapers. [Shabalin] But in contrast to the former Supreme Soviet, the Federal Assembly, from a political standpoint, is quite heterogeneous. In accordance with your draft laws, will access to the airwaves be offered to all factions? [Poltoranin] Unquestionably, this will be reflected in the draft law on the procedure for elucidating the work of the higher organs of authority in the state mass media. I do not think that the resumption of the "Parliamentary Hour" will aggravate the situation. On the other hand, conducting this program in the form in which it came out has no future. I assure you: By no means everyone watched this "Parliamentary Hour." Therefore, it is necessary for us to acquire air time to illuminate the work of the State Duma, both on the first and second Ostankino channels, and on the St. Petersburg channel, and, it is quite natural, on the channels of the 80 regional television companies that today live on the federal budget. This is the objective. The entire population of Russia must be informed of our work.
