How will you find your place in the coalition of the two government parties that advocate a liberal economic policy? [Nagy] I can only tell you my personal opinion, which does not -- and should not -- influence the MSZP's decision in choosing its partner. As a trade union leader, I would not be happy if it was possible to describe the government's economic policy with one attribute, namely liberalism, because, in a simplified way, this would mean that the strong remain functioning while the weak fail. It would lead to conflicts if all this was even amplified by shock therapy ideas. As a matter of fact, in my view, the MSZP's economic policy is characterized by pragmatism rather than liberalism. [Karsai] I assume that the acceptance of the MSZP's nevertheless liberal-type economic policy concept prepared by Laszlo Bekesi was a condition of you becoming a deputy candidate. [Nagy] I have said many times that this program can be welcomed by the trade unions -- naturally, together with the employment, welfare policy, and other programs linked to it. At the same time, no one asked me to countersign every line of this program for the trade unions, as if giving a blank check to the future government. [Karsai] The MSZP finally accepted the fifth version of the Bekesi program. To what extent are the amendments a result of the agreement made with the National Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary [MSZOSZ]? [Nagy] We did not participate in the detailed preparation of the program, but, naturally, our views were known to the MSZP's leaders. During the debates within the MSZP, the formulations that are more attractive to us were included in the program. For example, the final version is more socially sensitive to the problems of the groups of society that are in the worst position and it sees the reduction of unemployment as a direct goal. [passage omitted] [Karsai] Do you agree with Bekesi's statement that it is impossible to give social democratic answers to the problems under the circumstances of the current crisis? [Nagy] I do. This period is not good for social democratic values; nevertheless, they have to be represented. The most serious social problems have to be remedied. [Karsai] Do you accept that the main goal of the next few years is to stop the deterioration of the financial balance and then to improve it? [Nagy] It is possible that we have to say this because of the timing of the tasks. However, it is more attractive for me to say that we have to strive for establishing the conditions for a financial balance and a boom, for improving the employment, reducing inflation, and handling the social problems. More precisely, for optimizing these partially contradictory goals. [Karsai] According to Bekesi, the reform if state finances will attract an annual 4 to 5 percent reduction of real incomes, and some half of this could be compensated for. What do these figures mean to you? [Nagy] According to the MSZP's economic policy program, for the majority of society, the reform of state finances has to be accompanied by full compensation. If the government does not consider this feasible, then it will have to discuss this with the trade unions. It would be too early to talk about numbers. It is certain that, in our view, it is indispensable to stop the reduction of the real value of incomes within a foreseeable time and to increase the real value of the lowest pensions. [passage omitted] [Karsai] In the autumn of 1993, the MSZOSZ published a statement on privatization in which it primarily emphasized the need for a more marked regard for employment considerations. Do you really feel that unemployment within the doors has already ceased to exist in the case of enterprises facing privatization, and they now structurally match the market requirements, in other words, further dismissals are unavoidable? [Nagy] We are against the current privatization practice that strives for maximizing the -- later actually wasted -- revenue, ignoring the future fate of the enterprises. Therefore, in our view, buyers who guarantee an employment level and the increase of capital should be given preference. [Karsai] On the one hand, I do not believe that buyers paying cash are generally not interested in the efficient future operation of the enterprises. On the other hand, the broader access of employees to ownership, which you also require, contradicts your concern about the future of the enterprises. The employees usually do not have any money to invest, and the delay of possibly necessary dismissals might lead to the bankruptcy of the whole enterprise. [Nagy] It is a misunderstanding to conclude that we are in favor of dominant ownership by the employees just because we support the employees' share program. In our view, it is more important for the enterprise to be in good hands and for the people to get well-paid jobs than for them to become owners. At the same time, we would find it expedient if the relevant industry's trade union representatives could be present at privatization decisions. Many misunderstandings could be avoided purely by exchanging information. [passage omitted] [Karsai] In recent months the current opposition parties and the MSZOSZ have advocated an economic-social pact. In your view, is there any difference in the issues the various trade unions wish to agree on? [Nagy] At the moment we can only talk about initial and rather fluid intentions. Obviously, the economic problems we have already mentioned -- namely nominal wages and pensions, inflation, taxes, the burdens of the reform of state administration, welfare benefits, and a predictable real value of incomes for many years -- will all be topics.
