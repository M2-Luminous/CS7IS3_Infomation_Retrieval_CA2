In a statement to AL-QABAS newspaper, published here today, Ambassador William [Hugh] Fullerton said Britain "puts great importance on its relations with the State of Kuwait and these relations have been characterized by consistency and strength." He added that on the political, trade, and defense level, the relations between the State of Kuwait and Britain were "progressing continuously as has been illustrated by the mutual visits of senior officials from the two countries and the visits of the British naval units to Kuwaiti ports and the royal airforce. For instance, seven trade missions visited Kuwait during the last few months at the end of which trade agreements were concluded. William Fullerton stressed the need "to continue the imposition of economic sanctions on the Iraqi regime in order to comply with the UN resolutions, on top of which is the recognition of Kuwait and its sovereignty and the release of the captives detained by the Iraqi regime." The ambassador made clear that "Kuwait enjoys a democracy with special vitality where Diwaniyahs [guest houses] exist alongside the National Assembly and there is an interest in human rights issue in Kuwait." William Fullerton stated "Britain is keen to have balanced relations with all the region's countries and believes that stability in the region does not come by waging wars."
