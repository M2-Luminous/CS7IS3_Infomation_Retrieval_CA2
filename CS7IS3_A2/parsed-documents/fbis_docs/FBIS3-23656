At the beginning of the conversation, in accordance with established tradition, he informed the journalists about what has happened in the Armed Forces of Russia since the last meeting. Let us remember that it took place at the end of December 1993. First of all, the Minister stressed that a reform process has continued in the forces in accordance with the plans and tasks that are included in the president's message to the Federal Assembly. Planned measures were taken to improve the administrative system, to establish new force groupings and naval forces, to improve the system to bring the army and navy up to strength, and to provide them with the necessary equipment and armament. The defense minister singled out several of the most important directions in the reform of the armed forces. Above all, he stressed, the improvement of the system of military legislation was continued. The Ministry of Defense has already prepared more than 20 bills and they are preparing bills for new laws "On the Military Status" and "On the Military Police." Other measures in the reform of the Armed Forces were also also being carried out strictly according to plan. One of the important problems continues to be that of the reduction of the numerical strength of the troops and forces. The Minister of Defense stressed that after a comprehensive analysis the decision was made to propose confirming a strength level of 1.9 million men. It is thought that the lower level that was proposed earlier is simply unacceptable. At the beginning of the year, it was also possible to reverse such a negative trend as the nonfulfillment of the plan for conscription. As of today, 88 percent of those drafted (from the existing plan) are fulfilling their constitutional duties in the ranks of the army and navy. It is proposed that the induction level be increased to 95 percent by the end of March. A significant improvement was also noted in the state of military discipline. The total number of crimes and violations has been reduced by one-quarter in comparison with 1993. Nonstatutory relations decreased by more than 22 percent and cases of evasion of military service by 20 percent. Overall, the defense minister stressed, the nature of the violations in the army and navy reflects the situation in society. The Minister of Defense expressed his greatest concern in connection with the formation of the military budget and the financing of the Armed Forces. He said that if the negative tendencies continue and no fundamental and decisive measures are taken in the near future, then it will be impossible to speak not only of the further reforming of the army but also of the security of Russia as a whole. Presently, the Ministry of Finance is proposing less than 50 percent of what is required for the needs and normal functioning of the army and navy. Naturally, such a situation is unsatisfactory. The Minister of Defense emphasized that he will continue to seek the budget necessary for the armed forces. He noted that even under these circumstances there are possibilities for additional financing of the forces, above all in connection with the right of the Ministry of Defense itself to determine quantities and to sell combat equipment, with the sale of surplus military property to the national economy, the reduction of orders from the military military-industrial complex, and the further reduction of the armed forces. Of course, the existence of this plan does not mean that the reform of the Army and Navy will proceed precisely in these directions. The minister of defense stressed that we will not permit a devastating reduction of the army, since this is disadvantageous for the state and in general. Furthermore, the Defense Minister emphasized that, as before, the established military budget will have a clearly expressed social orientation. It is proposed that more than 50 percent of all the budgetary funds allocated for the Ministry of Defense be directed to the social protection of service personnel. In the course of the press conference, Minister of Defense Pavel Grachev answered many questions involving the problems of military cooperation with the countries of the far as well as the near abroad. In particular, he noted the good prospects for cooperation with France, the United States, the FRG, and also with Belarus, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and other countries of the Commonwealth. Commenting on the latest events that took place with respect to the Black Sea Fleet, Pavel Grachev stressed that the present problems must not influence the unconditional fulfillment of the Massandra agreements, and that despite certain difficulties, he hopes for the close cooperation of the minister of defense of Ukraine. Just as in past meetings with journalists, there were also questions of a political nature. In particular, the Minister of Defense was asked whether his presence in Moscow at this time has to do with the need for a "strong hand" in the capital. Pavel Grachev categorically rejected the political nature of the question and emphasized that the army was busy resolving its own problems.
