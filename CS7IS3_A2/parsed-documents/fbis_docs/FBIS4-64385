Eleven members of the emergency aid group have been held at a Bosnian Serb barracks near Sarajevo since April 8. The organization issued a statement saying the Serbs "seem to have refrained from judging all 11 of Premiere Urgence's volunteers in order to bring charges against three members of the team." The organisation strenuously denied Serb charges that it had channeled arms to Bosnian Moslem forces. The group said it believed the other eight volunteers could be released before their colleagues go on trial. France recently demanded the immediate and unconditional release of all 11 aid workers. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has said he believes they have been framed by the Serbs. Several observers, including lawyers and also representatives of the International Federation of Human Rights and Amnesty International, hope to make their way on Friday to the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale, outside Sarajevo, where the three workers are to stand trial, Premiere Urgence added.
