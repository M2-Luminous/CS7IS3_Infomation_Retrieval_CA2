The UN- and Russia-brokered four-day talks were held in accordance with accords signed in Moscow early in April. The sides remained adamant in their approach to a proposed stationing of the UN peacekeepers. Abkhazia suggests they must be deployed along the border river of Inguri, while Georgia says peacekeepers should control the whole territory of the breakaway province.
