Its computational speed of 36 gigaflops exceeds that of general purpose supercomputers. They claim that the new computer could be used for simulating fluid dynamics and electromagnetic fields in addition to astrophysics. For now it will be used exclusively for analysis of many-body problems, as it is known in mathematics, including simulation of shape changes and unity of galaxies. The computation is done through a workstation by connecting 6 substrates in parallel, which were developed for solving this particular problem. Each substrate contains 8 LSIs (large-scale integrated circuits) which were developed jointly with Fuji Xerox. An astronomical amount of computation is required to calculate the gravities among many stars when it comes to simulation in cosmic science. Computation time increases twice squared with an increase in the number of the stars. Therefore, accurate analysis using general purpose supercomputers has been difficult. The new computer is able to handle complex calculation such as gravity using LSIs, while the workstation can handle the remaining processing such as display. As a result, its computation speed exceeded the maximum speed of 32 gigaflops attained by general purpose Japanese supercomputers. The LSI is especially structured with a combination of operational units which accommodates the computation procedures of gravity. Thirty calculations per each operation made the high speed computation possible. At 3 watts per gigaflop power consumption is minimal and requires no cumbersome coolant. The new computer set is small enough to be easily placed on desks, measuring approximately 25 cm long, 25 cm wide, and 40 cm deep. They plan to produce a 1-teraflop capacity set by about April 1995. An LSI designed exclusively for that purpose is already under development.
