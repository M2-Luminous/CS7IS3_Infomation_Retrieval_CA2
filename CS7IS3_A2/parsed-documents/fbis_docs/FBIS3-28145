Japanese-U.S. negotiations on such individual sectors as government procurement, automobiles and auto parts, and insurance which need to be settled prior to the summit talks are still encountering rough sailing. The government plans to swap the microeconomic individual sectors for macroeconomic stimulus measures by announcing a package of stimulus measures prior to the prime minister's visit to the United States. The U.S. Government's pressure on Japan, however, is moving in the direction of increasing. ASAHI SHIMBUN has analyzed the future of the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks using three scenarios. Failure What most concerns a senior Foreign Ministry official is having the working-level negotiations end after failing to hammer out any agreement, with this inconclusive finish leaving both sides unable to find ways to resume the negotiations at the summit talks. The most contentious point in the Japanese-U.S. negotiations on individual sectors is setting "objective criteria" to measure the openness of the Japanese market. The United States has pressed Japan to set targets designed to increase the share of foreign goods on the Japanese market to the level of the rest of the G-7 industrialized nations. In response, Japan has rejected the U.S. demand by saying, "We cannot accept the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets." In this way, the two countries have been locked in a showdown over the question of setting numerical targets. A high-ranking U.S. Government official has attacked Japanese bureaucrats by saying, "Japanese bureaucrats do not understand the Hosokawa government's aims in reform." The same high-ranking U.S. Government official also has urged Prime Minister Hosokawa to make a political decision. During a 29 January meeting, however, Prime Minister Hosokawa and Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, confirmed anew the principle that "matters to be discussed at the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks should be confined to what the government can do using its authority, and Japan will not set any numerical targets." If President Clinton sticks to the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets against the backdrop of mounting congressional pressure on Japan, it is highly possible that the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks will end in failure. An end to the Hosokawa-Clinton honeymoon could cast a shadow on the future of the Hosokawa government. Compromise The second case is: An agreement cannot be reached at the working-level negotiations on how to handle "objective criteria," and the unresolved proposals of both sides are included in the agenda of the summit talks. A compromise then will have to be formulated "based on the relationship of trust between Bill and Mori." They will probably decide on some specific "objective criteria," while with regard to the interpretation of such criteria, Clinton will say, "even if numerical targets are not met, there will not be any sanctions," and Hosokawa will use an expression such as "we will make efforts so that reforms to open the Japanese market will be reflected in the numerical objective criteria," thus reaching an accommodation. In that case, the United States can tell its citizens, "Japan accepted numerical objective criteria," while Japan can explain that "we were able to avoid setting numerical targets." Even in this case, however, the deadlocked automobile negotiations would be very difficult to resolve. While the United States demands that the Japanese automobile industry extend its commitment to purchase U.S.-made auto parts under a plan covering up to fiscal year 1994, Japan refuses to include this in the negotiating agenda, claiming "this should be left to a cooperative approach between the private sectors." Agreement There are also rumors about a "small package" agreement covering only issues where agreement can be reached, and shelving conflicting points. The new economic framework talks will continue up to summer 1995, and during this period, summit meetings are to be held every six months. Therefore, it is not impossible to set aside some issues for future discussion. This will depend on whether the economic-stimulation measures to be drawn up this week will receive highly favorable marks from the United States. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has pressed the Japanese Government by saying that "income tax cuts will have to be of a very considerable scale, and if they precede a consumption tax increase for only a short period, then this will not be effective." In this regard, it will be necessary for Hosokawa to overrule the Finance Ministry's "principle of fiscal balance." In this case, numerical targets can be shelved, while on the other hand, an action program for government procurement, covering not only the present areas under negotiation but also extending to the liberalization of the market as a whole, will be compiled to win U.S. approval. Which scenario comes to pass depends not only on the substance of the upcoming pump-priming measures but also on how the United States looks at the future of the Hosokawa administration. Because both sides by all means would like to avoid a breakdown in the negotiations, it is expected that efforts to reach an internal consensus -- and that negotiations between Japan and the United States -- will continue up to the last minute to achieve, at least, a precarious compromise or a small package agreement.
