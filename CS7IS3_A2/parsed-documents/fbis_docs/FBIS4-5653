Shunji Maruyama, addressing a working-group meeting to reform the UN Security Council, said the clause shows part of the chapter is outdated. In Article 53 and Article 107, the charter states that enforcement action can be taken against any "enemy state" without the authorization of the Security Council. "Enemy" states refer to countries that lost World War II -- Bulgaria, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan and Romania. Japan has strongly urged scrapping the clause. Germany has made no such a demand, saying it is already a de facto dead clause.
