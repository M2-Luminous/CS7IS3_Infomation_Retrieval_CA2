It is no coincidence that such attention has been devoted to AIDS: It is a disease of young people, and its wide spread, first, threatens to cause the degeneration of the human race and, second, is a heavy economic burden upon society. Treatment for AIDS, which can, at best, only prolong life somewhat, is very expensive -- according to U.S. estimates, approximately $80,000 a year. The disease is still incurable, with the majority of patients dying within five to 10 years despite all the efforts of medicine, and at present just one reliable means exists against it -- people's education. Information and literacy relating to all aspects of the problem -- this is one condition for prevention. This is why medics urge the press and representatives of various organizations, including religious ones, to assist them in propaganda and educational work in everything concerning AIDS. In Russia, as is well known, the incidence of infection with HIV is considerably lower than in the West. In the opinion of Vadim Pokrovskiy, leader of the Russian Center for the Prevention and Combating of AIDS, its slower pace is connected with our society's considerable isolation in the eighties. The situation is changing now. This year 80 cases of infection with AIDS have been registered. "This infection is now recorded in 53 of Russia's 88 administrative territories," Valentin Pokrovskiy, president of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, said. "This year 32 people have passed from the infected category to the sick category -- as is well known, AIDS develops slowly, and it takes several years for the disease to show itself. In all, we have registered 692 cases of AIDS infection since 1987, 124 people have fallen ill, and 96 have died. During the same time 435 HIV-positive foreign citizens have been detected and deported." Much has been done in Russia in recent years to organize the struggle against AIDS. Precisely 748 diagnostic laboratories are operating, and the Russian Scientific Methods Center, six regional centers, 73 territorial centers, and 128 anonymous screening clinics have been set up. A federal targeted program for 1993-1995 to prevent the spread of AIDS was adopted this year. Despite all the economic difficulties, its funding will begin in December. The draft law "On Preventing AIDS Sickness" has been prepared and is already being examined. How has the Russian public charitable organization "Association for Combating AIDS" marked World AIDS Day? "We have published AIDS references for physicians and distributed them to many medical establishments in the country," Yu. Malyutin, the association's responsible secretary, said. "A collection of articles for middle-level medical workers has been published, as well as masses of brochures, booklets, and other literature which is being distributed free to the population. Two special editions of MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA devoted to the problem of preventing HIV infection have been published, and an amateur talent competition for medical establishment students on the subject of 'All About AIDS and Drugs' has been held in conjunction with Moscow's Main Medical Administration. The students' best works -- posters, wall newspapers, photographs -- are being exhibited in the Satirikon Theater."
