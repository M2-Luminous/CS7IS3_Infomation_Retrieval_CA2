Carriba] [Text] Mexico City, 22 Mar (PL) -- The third Solidarity with Cuba caravan took advantage of its return to the United States to conclude a pending matter: sending to the island part of the humanitarian aid that had been detained by U.S. Customs. A day after returning from Havana, the members of the caravan went back to the U.S.-Mexico border, set up the portable satellite communications station that was not taken to Cuba two weeks ago, and nonchalantly moved it into Mexico. According to caravan members, the driver of the vehicle told the customs officers that the equipment was being sent to Cuba, but they "did not respond or stop the vehicle," which crossed the international bridge and headed into Mexican territory. Later, two members of the convoy who were riding in a station wagon behind the vehicle transporting the portable station were stopped and arrested by the municipal police. The station wagon was loaded with powdered milk and school supplies. The two persons arrested were Reverend Lucius Walker, executive director of the Interdenominational Foundation of the Communities (IFCO) and founder of Pastors for Peace, and Cuban-Canadian Camilo Garcia. Force was used to remove Walker and Garcia from the vehicle. During the incident the police fractured Garcia's nose. Garcia also suffered blows to his back and one of Walker's hands was injured. The two men were released on bail yesterday afternoon. On 9 March, Laredo Customs officials prevented the group from crossing into Mexico, from where they would go to Cuba. The excuse used by the Laredo customs officials at that time was the bans established by the Torricelli Law aimed at heightening the blockade imposed by Washington on Cuba more than 30 years ago. The communications system was part of the more than 140 tons of humanitarian aid for Cuba the third solidarity caravan had collected in Canada and the United States. Sources from Pastors for Peace, an organization that sponsors this type of action to help Cubans, pointed out that in addition to the communications system, 22 boxes of various products to be sent to Cuba were also taken across the border. The 22 boxes taken across the border contain computers, typewriters, spare parts for electrical appliances, a monitor for blood transfusions, toasters, and other supplies that had been retained by the customs officers. According to Tom Hansen, a Pastors for Peace director, the portable station will be installed at the Martin Luther King Center in Havana to receive U.S. programs that will later be distributed by the churches on the island. The Cubans have requested people-to-people diplomacy. Since the U.S. Government refuses to talk to the Cubans, with this system the peoples will be able to talk to one another. We can break the information blockade established by the U.S. Government on the people of the United States, Hansen said. When the second caravan crossed the border last summer, U.S. Customs officials also detained a school bus. It was released 23 days later after a hunger strike staged by some caravan members. Today, the school bus is being used by the Ebenezer Baptist Center in Havana.
