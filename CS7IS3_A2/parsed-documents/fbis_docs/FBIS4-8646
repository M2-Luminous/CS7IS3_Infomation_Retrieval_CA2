The Polish president has challenged almost every project making up the 1994 budget law passed on 5 March by Parliament, which remains dominated by the post-communists. On 12 April the President finally agreed to promulgate the budget. The government anticipates a $3.77 billion deficit (4.1 percent of GDP) and a 27-percent inflation rate. In an interview with "LE FIG-ECO," Lech Walesa explains why he has taken so long to approve the government's proposed budget. [Turowski] Do you agree with those who claim that the political situation is currently stabilizing in Poland? [Walesa] Absolutely. Poland has been carrying out economic reforms with a lot of rigor, but the lack of capital prevents us from making more headway, and the West is still pondering the same question: "to invest or not to invest in Poland?" [Turowski] Supposing you were a foreign investor, would you invest your money in Poland given the current political situation? [Walesa] Yes, because Poland is a large country which has been developing very dynamically, a country with 40 million citizens and free of ethnic, religious or other conflicts. [Turowski] Why would you not sign the 1994 budget, which had been approved by the IMF and the World Bank and would make it possible to reduce Poland's debt to the Club of London faster? [Walesa] Economically, the budget is sound, except for a few details. But it is a liberal budget which does not conform to the current government coalition's electoral promises. "Communist Methods" So I ask the coalition this crucial question: why did you lie to the Polish people? Why did you promise that economic policy would change, only to adopt now the same policies as those followed four years ago by the party born of Solidarnosc ? [Turowski] So it is politics above economics? [Walesa] No. But I would like, once and for all, that the Polish people be told the truth. On the other hand, the Solidarnosc union had asked me not to sign the budget passed by Parliament. This means it is opposed by part of the population, and I also had to take that into account. The budget is developed for the population, not the other way around. [Turowski] Although it is now seeking your protection, Solidarnosc had drifted a considerable distance away from you -- its charismatic leader -- at its last conference... [Walesa] ...And lost its place in Parliament as a result. Had Solidarnosc's leaders listened to me at the time, we would all be in a different situation today. So the union is now fussing about, trying a little blindly to define its direction and its place in a society that changes fast, very fast. [Turowski] The strikes sponsored by Solidarnosc over the last few weeks have not been a massive success... [Walesa] They can start again at any time if the population is not taken seriously. [Turowski] Do you really want to satisfy populist demands? This would lead to increasing the money supply which would lead to increased inflation in a very short time. [Walesa] I do not share such fears, as the Polish population has already given ample proof of its intelligence and patience. [Turowski] In a similar vein, you rejected the coalition's candidate for the position of deputy prime minister and economy and finance minister, a noted specialist who now works for the United Nations. Thus because of you the Polish economy has been leader- less for two months. Why? [Walesa] The government coalition has an excessive regard for communist management methods. The way things used to be was that the Politburo would make every decision and all the government had to do would be to carry out its orders. Today, things are not the same: The role of the President of the Republic is no longer to rubber-stamp and to keep his mouth shut. For various reasons, I do not trust the only candidate that was presented to me. There are even politicians who say that I have been destabilizing Poland; they are mistaken; I just want the men who steer the Polish economy to be above reproach and to be true to the promises made to the population. "Europe Bogged Down" [Turowski] Let us now talk about relations between Poland and Europe. You have been highly critical of these over the last few months. What are your main concerns? [Walesa] It are Western Europe's misconceptions about the interests of our Old Continent. Harmonious cooperation between Central and Eastern Europe is just as important for the latter as it is for the West. The association agreements between Poland and the European Union give Poland a privileged position and, two years into these agreements, Poland's trade balance is negative. How can you expect me to be satisfied? Nevertheless, Poland filed its formal application for European Union membership a few days ago. [Turowski] Within the European Union, there are those who say that Central and Eastern European countries must first strengthen ties between themselves, and then apply together for European Union membership. What is your opinion? [Walesa] I want to remind you here that two years ago I suggested that we should create our own versions of the EC and NATO. Cooperation among countries located between the Vistula [as published], Dnepr, and Danube rivers is essential, and it has been growing. In this respect, much remains to be done. Regardless of all good-neighborly relations and cooperation treaties already signed, we must never cease to strengthen economic relations. However, this is not something that can be imposed by the European Union or by ourselves. Only daily life and daily work can bring us closer to this ultimate goal. Today, Western Europe sometimes tends to look for rather strange solutions, because it does not comprehend the changes that have taken place in the East. There is no doubt that the communist system has collapsed, while Western Europe has yet to come to terms with the changes that take place every day in Central and Eastern Europe. It is Europe that is now bogged down while we are advancing at the double.
