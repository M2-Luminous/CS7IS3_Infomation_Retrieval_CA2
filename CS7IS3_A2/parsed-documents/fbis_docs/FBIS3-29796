Sen. Evans told parliament the government has given in principle agreement to an inquiry that will look into the operation and management of ASIS. There have been calls for such an investigation following allegations which two former ASIS spies made on a documentary screened earlier this week on the ABC [Australian Broadcasting Corporation] program, Four Corners. Among the allegations was that ASIS kept files on thousands of Australian citizens, that agents spied for Britain in the Middle East, and that secret payments were made to rebel army officers in the Philippines who had tried to overthrow the Aquino government. But Sen. Evans said the inquiry had been under active consideration for some time well before the latest allegations.
