FR941007-2-00012 FR941007-2-00006 Specifically excluded from the scope of this investigation are plastic and vinyl covered paper clips, butterfly clips, binder clips, or other paper fasteners that are not made wholly of wire of base metal and are covered under a separate subheading of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). The products subject to this investigation are classifiable under subheading 8305.90.3010 of the HTSUS. Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation (POI) is May 1, 1993, through October 31, 1993. Best Information Available As stated in the preliminary determination, we have based the duty deposit rate for all exporters other than the three identified above (the ``all others'' rate) on best information available (BIA). One exporter, Abel Industries, indicated that it would not participate in the investigation. Further, given that information has not been presented to the Department to demonstrate otherwise, Abel and all other PRC companies not participating in this investigation are not entitled to separate dumping margins. As such, because Abel decided not to participate in this investigation, we are basing the ``All Others'' rate, which will also apply to Abel, on BIA. This is similar to our use of the BIA-based ``All Others'' rate in other recent antidumping duty investigations. (See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less-Than-Fair-Value: Silicon Carbide From the People's Republic of China (59 FR 22585, May 2, 1994) (Silicon Carbide)). In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally assigns less adverse margins to those respondents that cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions for those respondents that did not cooperate in an investigation. As outlined in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate From Belgium (58 FR 37083, July 9, 1993), when a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company the higher of (a) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or (b) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation. Here, since at least one PRC exporter failed to respond to our questionnaire, and because we presume all exporters to be centrally controlled absent verified information to the contrary, we are assigning a margin of 126.94 percent (the highest margin in the petition, as recalculated by the Department for methodological inconsistencies at the time of the initiation of this case) as BIA to all exporters other than those responding exporters which have shown their independence from control in common with one or more other exporters of the subject merchandise. Separate Rates The three participating exporters, ZMEC, ZLIP and Lansheng, have each requested a separate rate. ZMEC and ZLIP are companies owned by ``all the people'' and for five of the six months of the POI, Lansheng also was owned by ``all the people.'' In the sixth month, Lansheng was restructured into a share company. To establish whether a firm is sufficiently independent to be entitled to a separate rate, the Department employs the criteria developed in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the People's Republic of China (56 FR 20588, May 6, 1991) (Sparklers) and amplified in Silicon Carbide. Under this analysis, the Department assigns a separate rate only when an exporter can demonstrate the absence of both de jure 1 and de facto 2 governmental control over export activities. 1 Evidence supporting, though not requiring, a finding of de jure absence of central control includes: (1) An absence of restrictive stipulations associated with an individual exporter's business and export licenses; (2) any legislative enactments decentralizing control of companies; or (3) any other formal measures by the government decentralizing control of companies. 2 The factors considered include: (1) whether the export prices are set by or subject to the approval of a governmental authority; (2) whether the respondent has authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements; (3) whether the respondent has autonomy from the government in making decisions regarding the selection of management; and (4) whether the respondent retains the proceeds of its export sales and makes independent decisions regarding disposition of profits or financing of losses ( see Silicon Carbide ).
