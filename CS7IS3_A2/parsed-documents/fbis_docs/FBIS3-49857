The offices will open and begin work on 15 February 1994. A joint statement signed by the two foreign ministers, Vladislav Jovanovic and Mate Granic, reads: "The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia, starting from the positive experiences in their joint efforts to speed up the peace process to resolve the crisis in the area of the former Yugoslavia, and guided by the provisions of the UN Charter and the basic documents of the CSCE, and aspiring to the establishment of good-neighborly relations, and in their desire to contribute in a decisive way to finding a just and lasting solution to the crisis in the area of the former Yugoslavia -- and to the reestablishment of stability in this part of Europe -- agree to embark upon the process of the normalization of mutual relations. As a first step in this direction it has been decided to open in Belgrade and Zagreb official representative offices of the two governments -- a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia office in Zagreb and an office of the Republic of Croatia in Belgrade. The opening of these offices should ease interstate relations and contacts, and contribute to the development of mutual trust, including the process of the normalization of Serbo-Croat relations, in the interest of peace, cooperation and stability in the region. The Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia will ensure the technical and other conditions enabling the offices to work efficiently, work which will begin on 15 February 1994."
