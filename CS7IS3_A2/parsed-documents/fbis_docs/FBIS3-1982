There are no difficulties or dangers which cannot be overcome, and there are no obstacles which cannot be removed. Lu Ping, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, made these remarks today at a ceremony to present certificates for the continuation of service of the first group of Hong Kong affairs advisers. Lu Ping thanked the Hong Kong affairs advisers for raising a large number of valuable opinions and suggestions through various forms and channels on a number of issues relating to Hong Kong's power transfer and steady transition since their appointment. Lu Ping said: On one hand, the appointment of the Hong Kong affairs advisers manifests their sense of responsibility for materializing "one country, two systems" and Hong Kong's steady transition in 1997 as well as for preserving Hong Kong's stability and prosperity; on the other, it also gives expression to the Chinese Government's determination to ensure the implementation of the policy of "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and to practice a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong. Lu Ping continued: Several days ago, the British Hong Kong Legislative Council ratified parts of the draft legislation formulated according to Chris Patten's "constitutional reform package," and the British Government published a White Paper on the substance of the Sino-British talks on the constitutional structure. These unilateral moves -- which undermine cooperation -- suggest that the British side will willfully continue to pursue a policy of confrontation during the transitional period of a little more than three years. This behavior will only drive all kindhearted people to heighten their vigilance and abandon any illusions about the British side's empty promise of so-called "cooperation." Lu Ping also cited Deng Xiaoping's remarks from 10 years ago: "We should believe that the Hong Kong Chinese can properly administer Hong Kong. The disbelief that Chinese people can properly administer Hong Kong was inherited from the old colonialist school of thought." "The prosperity of Hong Kong was created by the Hong Kong people, who are primarily Chinese." "The Hong Kong people are able to administer Hong Kong properly, and we must have this confidence." In conclusion, Lu Ping said: In the near future, we will invite a third group of Hong Kong affairs advisers, who will come from all social levels and fields in Hong Kong. The ranks of the Hong Kong affairs advisers are growing, and they will play a more important role in bringing about the recovery of Hong Kong's sovereignty.
