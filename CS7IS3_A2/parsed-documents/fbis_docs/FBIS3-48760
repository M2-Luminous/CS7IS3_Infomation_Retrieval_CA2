Takemura said the cabinet will make a final decision on the dispatch after receiving formal request from the United Nations. A peace accord was signed in January last year after a decade-long "proxy war" in El Salvador between the government, backed by the United States, and rebel troops, backed by the former Soviet Union. A Foreign Ministry source said the government is planning to send a team of between 10 and 15 people and is trying to enlist Spanish-speaking members, some of them from universities. A statement released by the secretariat of the international peace cooperation headquarters within the prime minister's office said the secretariat is preparing for the dispatch before receiving a formal request because of the estimated time needed to put equipment and personnel together to meet the departure deadline. Elsewhere, Economic Planning Agency Director General Manae Kubota told reporters "it's all right sending personnel to El Salvador, but we should think very carefully about sending (any) to the former Yugoslavia." El Salvador's President Alfredo Felix Christiani, in a meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Tokyo on November 4, asked Japan to send election monitors for the March poll. Japan previously sent election monitors to Angola, Cambodia and Mozambique, officials said.
