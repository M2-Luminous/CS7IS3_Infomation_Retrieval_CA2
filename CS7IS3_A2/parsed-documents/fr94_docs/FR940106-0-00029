FR940106-0-00029 FR940106-0-00008 On July 9, 1991, we published an NPRM proposing revisions to the medical criteria contained in parts A and B of the cardiovascular system listings (56 FR 31266), with provisions for a 60-day comment period. The complex issues raised by the numerous comments we received have required extensive analysis and careful consideration. In order to ensure sufficient time for this review, we are extending the date on which the current cardiovascular system listings in parts A and B will no longer be effective from January 6, 1994, to February 15, 1994. Regulatory Procedures The Department, even when not required by statute, as a matter of policy, generally follows the Administrative Procedure Act notice of proposed rulemaking and public comment procedures specified in 5 U.S.C. 553 in the development of its regulations. The Administrative Procedure Act provides exceptions to its notice and public comment procedures when an agency finds there is good cause for dispensing with such procedures on the basis that they are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. We have determined that, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), good cause exists for waiver of notice of proposed rulemaking and public comment procedures on this rule because it only extends the dates on which parts A and B of the cardiovascular system listings will no longer be effective and makes no substantive changes to these listings. The current regulations expressly provide that the listings may be extended by the Secretary, as well as revised and promulgated again. Because we are not making any revisions to the current listings, we have determined that use of public comment procedures is unnecessary under the Administrative Procedure Act. Regulatory Flexibility Act We certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Public Law 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required. Paperwork Reduction Act This regulation imposes no reporting or recordkeeping requirements necessitating clearance by the Office of Management and Budget.
