Kazannik is again a profesor at the law department of Omsk University. He devotes all his spare time to the elaboration of programmatic documents and organisational structure of the new party. More than 5,000 people have joined the party within three days in Yekaterinburg, the hometown of President Boris Yeltsin, Kazannik told ITAR-TASS. The most active support in forming the party is being given by scientists and faculty members of Novosibirsk and Omsk institutions of higher learning, the Academgorodok (science city) and other cities in Siberia, the Urals and the Far East, by entrepreneurs and the work collectives of industrial enterprises. Kazannik said he was prompted to found a party of his own by "the immorality and inefficiency of the present authorities at all levels and by the impossibility to combine efforts with all the already existing parties and movements for moral considerations".
