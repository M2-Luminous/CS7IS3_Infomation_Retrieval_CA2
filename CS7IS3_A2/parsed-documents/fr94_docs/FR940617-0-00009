FR940617-0-00009 FR940617-0-00003 However, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and the Michigan Department of Transportation opposed making the change in the Department's interpretation of farmland ``committed to urban development.'' In particular, HUD devoted the principal thrust of its comments to this provision, objecting ``strongly'' to the change and outlining the importance of retaining the Department's current interpretation that land under planning or zoning for nonagricultural use was ``committed to urban development.'' HUD stated: This procedure ignores and undermines a local government's land use decisions made through zoning, comprehensive planning, and subdivision regulations which are adopted to guide and direct urban development and growth *␣*␣* By changing the definition of `farmland committed to urban development' and requiring a Farmland Conversion Impact Rating (AD&hyph;1006) be prepared, which must result in an aggregated score of 160 points or less before it is considered `farmland committed to urban development,' certainly qualified USDA as taking a ``big brother'' approach to local land use plans and decisions. HUD explained that whenever an application for project assistance is submitted to HUD, it must receive approval of local authorities. Since 1985, HUD's principal method for issuing mortgage insurance on single, family homes in housing subdivisions has been to wait until the local government has approved the subdivision plan and construction of the necessary streets and water and sewer systems. Under the existing rule, HUD would not have to analyze this land as ``prime farmland'' under FPPA. HUD argued that under the proposed rule, it would be required to complete the AD&hyph;1006 form on this land, which it termed a ``useless exercise'' at that point. Aside from the mechanics of the proposed amendment, HUD made these comments about the general problem of farmland protection measures that the agency might undertake: In the single family housing program (which actions are most likely to be on the fringes of urban areas), preservation of farmland would require that we would have to either be involved in the local planning and zoning process at the earliest conceptual stages or by prohibitive and restrictive regulations which would withhold assistance for projects which had converted farmland to nonagricultural uses. Taking either action could easily be interpreted as an indirect way to regulate the use of private land or affect the property rights of the owners of such lands. We do not believe that to be the intent of Congress. Putting a penalty on the land, either directly or indirectly, could result in creating a greater housing shortage, especially for low and moderate income families who are the primary users of HUD mortgage housing programs. The FHWA, likewise, objected to the proposal on the grounds that it would require preparation of a site assessment on every project that requires rights-of-way. This would require ``an enormous amount of time and resources to be provided by Federal, State and/or local agencies'' and in many cases there would be ``no apparent justification.'' FHWA suggested that the same exclusion of farmland ``committed to urban development'' that the Department has applied to ``prime farmland'' should be applied to the other two categories in the FPPA, ``unique'' farmland and farmland ``of local or statewide importance.'' The Michigan Department of Transportation had similar objections. It explained that the current rule ``screens out many projects and constitutes a real time savings *␣*␣* If the local entities have designated the land for other uses, it doesn't warrant a high degree of protection as resource base at the federal level.'' On the other hand, if the rule were changed, it would require site assessments of ``each project that required rights-of-way.'' As noted in the preamble to the proposed rule at 52 FR 1467, the zoning and land use plans that are applicable to a particular site will be considered in conjunction with other criteria that are designed to assess the degree to which the site is committed to urban development. In this way, the prerogatives of state and local government, as exercised in zoning codes and land use plans, will play a role in determining whether a site should be given further FPPA review. Because the amended regulations will neither prohibit the providing of federal assistance to convert farmland nor preclude the conversion of farmland through non-federal means, the Department believes that the amended rule, as proposed, will not interfere with local land use planning, and will assure that prime farmlands will, to the full extent of the law, be given appropriate consideration. Under the current regulation, sites that contain prime farmland that otherwise would have been exempted due to being ``in or committed to urban development'' would have still been covered by the FPPA if the site also contained lands of statewide or local importance. The exclusion of lands ``in or committed to urban development'' would have limited effect. After consideration of the comments, the Department is amending the rule to apply the exemption for farmland ``in or committed to urban development'' to all four types of farmland. It is clear from the comments provided by a number of federal agencies that they are already applying the exemption to all four types of farmland. Section 658.2(a) is being revised to remove the word ``prime'' before the word ``farmland,'' thereby, making the exemption apply to all farmland.
