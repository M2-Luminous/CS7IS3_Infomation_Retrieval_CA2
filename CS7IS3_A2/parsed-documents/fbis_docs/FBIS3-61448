To this end, an experiment is carried out on 84 male rats with a mean weight of 220-240 g separated into six groups (with one control group) with different exposures to one or both agents. The condition of the test animals was ascertained by examining a complex of physiological and biochemical indicators and pathomorphological research. The status indicators of white rats after oral administration of DDVP and ethanol is summarized; the study indicates that the effect of ethanol upsets the behavioral reactions of the animals who displayed a tendency toward a decreased spontaneous motor activity (SDA) and a considerable increase in the latent period of cognitive reflex (LPPR); the summation threshold index (SPP) increased only in rats who received ethanol alone. A study of the mixed function oxidase (OSF) shows that it is induced somewhat in animals exposed to ethanol or the ethanol-and-DDVP mixture. The conclusion is drawn that the extent to which the two substances and their combinations affect the test animals increases in the following sequence: ethanol, DDVP, DDVP+ethanol, and ethanol and DDVP+ethanol against the background of alcoholization. Thus, given contact with an organophosphorous pesticide, ethanol may have an unfavorable aggravating effect, especially if taken regularly. Tables 1; references 10: 9 Russian, 1 Western.
