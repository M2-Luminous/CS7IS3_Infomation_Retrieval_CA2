More investment will be channeled to leading grain and cotton-producing areas and the less developed central and western regions, said Wang Xinjian, an official from the State Office for Comprehensive Agricultural Development Programme (CADP), yesterday. The government has decided to pour 1.9 billion yuan ($219 million) into CADP projects, including grain and cotton development. This figure is 200 million yuan ($23 million) more than last year, according to Wang. But the official did not reveal how much of this money would be used for grain and cotton development projects. The central government will also set aside another 1 billion yuan ($115 million) as special fund to provide work for the poverty stricken population from this year to 2000, said the official. A total of 25 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) has been injected into the programme from the central and local governments and other sector since the programme was launched six years ago. Seventy-five per cent of the fund was used for developing facilities aimed at bolstering the production of grain, cotton and edible oil, 15 per cent for meat, eggs and aquatic products, and 10 percent for forest and grassland construction. Most of the fund was used for infrastructure construction for agricultural production, while the rest has been poured into biological development projects and scientific and technological promotions, said Wang. The development of low- or medium-yield farmland into high-yield plots is the most important part of the programme. Usually the per-unit yield would double after the land is improved. A total of 8 million hectares of low- or medium-yield farmland has been transformed since 1988 and 1 million hectares of wasteland have been reclaimed. In addition, 1.2 million hectares of new forest farms have been planted and 350,000 hectares of grassland improved. These efforts have turned out an additional 18 billion kg of grain, 252 million kg of cotton, 700,000 tons of edible oil, 10 million kg of sugar, and 650,000 tons of meat during the last six years. The country inaugurated the CADP projects in 1988 by concentrating massive investment on selected agricultural areas and projects in a bid to tackle rural problems comprehensively. The thrust of the projects is the attempt to increase production of grain, cotton, edible oil, meat, and sugar, while ensuring an all-round, coordinated development of farming, forestry, animal husbandry, side-line production, and fishery. The first batch of the programme covered 10 provinces and autonomous regions, including the Three-River (Heilong-Wusuli-Songhua rivers) Plain in Northeast China, plains along the Yellow River, Huaihe River, and Haihe River, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
