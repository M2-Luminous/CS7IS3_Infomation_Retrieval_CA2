We are not worried in any way. Meanwhile, President Ezer Weizman said in Turkey: Israel is prepared to exchange information with Turkey on matters related to the struggle against terrorism. Turkey and Israel have maintained relations since the occupation of Palestine in 1948. Ankara's relations with the Zionist regime improved further after the PLO concluded an agreement with Tel Aviv and autonomous status was given to Gaza and Eriha [Jericho]. That was followed by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin's visit to the occupied territories. That was the first time a Turkish foreign minister had visited the occupied territories for 45 years. Several political experts believe that the improvement of relations between Ankara and Tel Aviv should be assessed within the framework of the U.S. plan for a new order in the Middle East. The experts are convinced that Washington is directing pressure on the Arab countries in the Middle East to force them to coexist in peace with the Zionist regime. As far as Washington is concerned, that will establish a kind of peace that will safeguard U.S. interests in the region. Considering that, the political experts in Washington are trying to draw up plans for a rapprochement among the countries of the region, using pretexts such as the establishment of the Middle East [words indistinct] or the establishment of a common market in the region. However, several political experts are convinced that the aim of establishing such organizations is to obstruct the strengthening of the activities of Islamic movements, such as the Hizbullah, which pose a threat to the interests of Western countries and reactionary forces in the region. The political experts are also convinced that, in addition to their struggle against the Islamic movements, the organizations will try to resolve the problems that threaten tranquillity in the region, problems that concern security, the water supply, and economic development. These organizations will be established through economic, military, and political cooperation between the Zionist regime, Turkey, and Egypt, the strongest allies of the Western countries in the region. They will be assigned two tasks to fulfill in the political and economic fields. Israel, Turkey, and Egypt have been assigned to cooperate to facilitate the establishment of a new order in the Middle East, as planned by the Western countries. However, the Western countries and their allies have failed to realize a fact in the Middle East: the existence of the Islamic revolutionary movements, which are strengthening regardless of the strong pressure on them. U.S. and Zionist designs cannot obstruct those movements, even if certain countries in the region cooperate with Washington and the Zionist regime.
