Under the agreement, Airbus, one of the world's three largest aircraft manufacturers, will further commission China's Xian Aircraft Industry Corporation and Shenyang Aircraft Industry Corporation to produce parts for it. Analysts said that the move is expected to expand cooperation between Airbus and China, as well as to increase Airbus' share in the potentially huge market of China. Airbus started its cooperation with Chinese manufacturers in 1985, when it delivered an A310 aircraft to the Shanghai-based China East Airlines. Parts produced for Airbus by the two Chinese corporations in recent years include protection hatch doors for A300s and A310s, carbon fiber-made vertical tail ribs and wing ribs, and emergency exit hatchways for A320s, as well as supplementary parts for A300s and A310s. To date, Airbus has sold 35 aircraft to China, 18 of which were delivered last year. Market forecasters said China is expected to purchase 620 airplanes between now and the year 2011, about 21 percent of the global demand during that period. Official figures show China's air industry expanded by 30 percent in 1993, despite a world-wide recession. To get to grips with the Chinese market, which Airbus considers its most hopeful business opportunity, Airbus has opened a new office in China, called Airbus Industrie China, to handle increasing business activities in this most populous country of the world. Airbus also plans to set up a training center in Beijing this spring in a bid to provide better services for its Chinese customers. Sources said that the recently signed agreement did not spell out what particular parts the two Chinese partners will produce for Airbus. But they said the new parts will involve more sophisticated techniques and more advanced technological know-how. Boeing Corporation of the United States also struck a big deal with Chinese manufacturers late last year.
