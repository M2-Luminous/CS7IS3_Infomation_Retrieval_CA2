The daily AL-INQADH AL-WATANI said the 11 had announced their defection during a meeting with Parliamentary Speaker Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah in Malakal. The news came after allegations earlier Monday by rival rebel leader Riak Mashar that the SPLA under John Garang was preparing to attack his forces despite a ceasefire agreement between the two factions. Riak, leader of SPLA United, which broke away from the SPLA, said the Islamic fundamentalist government was also massing troops for a new offensive against the mainly Christian and animist southern rebels. Fighting reportedly erupted between rebels and government forces near the Ugandan border last week, but details were unclear. According to the paper the head of the defecting rebels, Colonel Thomas Dut, said that he and his colleagues had decided to quit Garang's SPLA in order "to take part in rebuilding the country." Riak told AFP earlier Monday that Garang was preparing an attack despite a new agreement between the rival rebel factions to conduct joint negotiations with Khartoum. But a spokesman for Garang's group denied the allegation. "It is not true," said Philip Lomodong, the faction's east African representative. Meanwhile the Sudanese Government Monday launched an aid operation to deliver 62,000 tonnes of food to people in the stricken south of the country. Aid Commissioner Awad Khalifah said the deliveries would be made by rail from Babanoussa to Wau, or by river from Kosti to Juba. Ismail Moustafa, head of the department for displaced people, said 3,624 families currently living in camps around Khartoum would be able to go home. He added that 15,000 people had become refugees since the start of the civil war in 1983, and were now living in four camps around Khartoum, where the Sudanese parliament is based. [passage omitted]
