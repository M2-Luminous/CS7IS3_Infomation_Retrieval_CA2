David Kyd, spokesman for the nuclear watchdog body, said such a step would be taken if, for instance, the North Koreans removed seals placed on nuclear fuel rods by IAEA inspection teams. The rods are due to be changed in a five megawatt reactor in North Korea's Yongbyon complex, and the IAEA wants its inspectors there to ensure that nuclear material has not been diverted for military purposes. Pyongyang is resisting the IAEA's conditions, and Kyd said its latest reply in an exchange of messages on the subject, received last Friday, was unsatisfactory. The United States has warned that if North Korea does not cooperate in satisfying the international community that it is not developing nuclear weapons Washington would seek sanctions against it in the Security Council. North Korea has said it would treat such a measure as an act of war.
