The sources said that most of the generals appointed in zone commands and the General Staff "are advocates of dialogue, or at least, have adopted no positions on it." The sources stressed that these generals are loyal to Maj. Gen. Zeroual, who is also the defense minister. [passage omitted] The sources said that these changes means the beginning of President Zeroual's real rule. The march to be staged on Sunday will grant him a popular legitimacy he still lacks. The sources pointed out that the replacement of Gen. Abdelhamid Djaouadi, commander of the 5th zone (Constantine), confirms the decision to reduce the powers of those advocating "all-out confrontation." However, other sources said that his dismissal is part of the decision to punish those who were accused of negligence in connection with the great escape from Tazoult prison, which involved over 900 prisoners. The sources stress that these changes are a prelude to further changes in the next stage.
