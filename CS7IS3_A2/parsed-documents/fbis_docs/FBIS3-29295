The letter dated February 12 says the participants in the seminar confirmed the truth of the chuche idea that to firmly build up the internal political forces and enhance their role is the basic guarantee of the building of a new independent society and called for keeping heightened vigilance against the western-style "multi-party parliamentary democracy" aimed at disintegrating the patriotic forces. Noting that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the homeland of the chuche idea and a model in the building of a new independent society, the letter says the participants are convinced that only when they regard independence as the life and soul of the country and the nation and achieve unity of the patriotic forces by rallying the popular masses around the leader and the leading organization, as indicated by the chuche idea, can they defend the sovereignty of the country and win economic liberation. The letter wishes President Kim Il-song good health and long life.
