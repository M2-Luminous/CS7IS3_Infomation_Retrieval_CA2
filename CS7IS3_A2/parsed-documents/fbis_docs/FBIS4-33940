The project, providing for the creation of more than 8 million jobs over the 1995-98 period, assumes that "the central axis of the policy for reactivating jobs will be expanding the level of investment in the Brazilian economy, which in 1993 was 16 percent of GDP, to approximately 25 percent." During an interview, Lula and project coordinator Aloizio Mercadante admitted what the text of the project says in its final part: The private sector will have to create "the bulk" of the new jobs. "The private sector will have to make the bulk of investments, although I cannot specify the percentage of such investments," Mercadante said, adding that this will be possible only if the government creates the appropriate conditions. "If the government promotes development and reactivates growth, if it guarantees financial resources, and if it ends financial speculation, private investment will grow and will go to the productive sector," he said. Lula gave vague answers when asked whether there will be money for the project. "If there is no money, we will have to create it; we will make great efforts with the private sector, and will negotiate with entrepreneurs for a year to have them to join the National Solidarity Fund to be created in 1996 to promote the project, reminding them that the richest brackets are responsible for the recuperation of Brazil," he said. For the "urgent" creation of jobs, the project provides for the implementation of a basic sanitation program (from 250,000 to 375,000 new jobs), the repair and construction of 25,000 km of urban highways (70,000 jobs), the construction of storage facilities with 6 million tons' capacity (70,000), a "revolutionary" education program (300,000), the recovery of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro hospital beds (36,000), land reform (1,100,000), credits for investment in small estates (2,160,000), expansion of farm production (150,000), plus 500,000 jobs in urban areas caused by an annual 4 percent growth of farm production, 500,000 to 1 million new jobs created by increased production of small and mid-sized agricultural industries in the interior, investment in tourism (120,000), highway network maintenance (90,000), and a housing program (411,000). The PT also will encourage the creation of cooperatives, micro and small-sized enterprises, entrepreneurial partnerships, "enterprise nurseries," and the reduction of the work week to allow for the creation of new jobs. "The task of creating jobs will be mostly a private sector responsibility," the project text says, noting that the state will implement a development policy that will encourage the creation of new jobs. To this end the PT claims that it is essential to expand the offer of credits for productive investment. "This will call for a comprehensive reform of the financial system, to end financial speculation." Among the sources of funds, the project mentions the FTGS [Severance Pay Fund] ($4 billion annually), the Fund for Protection of Workers ($5 billion annually), constitutional funds ($1 billion), the Social Development Fund, the National Education Development Fund, the PIS/PASEP [Social Integration Program/Government Employee Welfare Fund], and official development agencies and banks. The project provides for the creation of two other funds: the National Solidarity Fund (made up of budget funds and the taxes on big fortunes), and the Productive Restructuring Fund. Lula said he also counts on foreign investment.
