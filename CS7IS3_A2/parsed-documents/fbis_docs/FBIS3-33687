In an article today, the paper, speaking for the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, notes the U.S. Senate decision prohibiting U.S. arms sales to any Arab state that adheres to the boycott of "Israel." The Senate's unanimous decision shows very clearly to what degree U.S. decisionmakers are under the control of the Zionist octopus at the expense of legitimate U.S. interests and U.S. taxpayers. The paper also highlights the U.S. Administration's attitude toward the Zionist lobby's domination, saying that the tentacles of the Zionist octopus are all over the White House and that the Presidential Office is not safe from Zionist influence. In this regard, the paper notes what happened when another nominee was appointed to replace the former Defense Secretary Les Aspin, who reportedly resigned for personal reasons. The Zionist lobby forced President Clinton to withdraw his nomination of the retired General Bobby Inman in favor of the Zionist candidate William Perry, Aspin's deputy who is known for his intelligence activities. The ban on arms sales and the withdrawal of Inman's nomination show that U.S. decisions are purely Zionist in terms of their substance, endorsement, and aims. No one can now dare to differentiate between U.S. national interests and those of world Zionism and its usurping entity in occupied Palestine. The paper says the Zionist octopus is ruling the United States through U.S. tools. It is enough here to note that four senior officials of the U.S. Administration, led by Vice President Al Gore, are well-known Zionists. The paper also reviews the effects of this situation on developments in the Arab arena. The Arab rulers who have tied their decisions to U.S. decisions are, in reality, carrying out the orders and decisions of Zionism. They should expect more humiliating and disgraceful decisions. The paper highlights the attempts of some Arab regimes to break and end the Arab boycott of the Zionist entity, saying that, in light of this, the U.S. Administration is in no need of such a Zionist decision to ban arms sales to countries that boycott "Israel". The paper cites Republican Senator Brown as saying that most Arab countries do not oppose such a measure, and that some of them have indeed dropped the boycott. In fact, there are some people in the region who are more eager than Brown to end the Arab boycott of the Zionist entity and tighten the Iraq embargo.
