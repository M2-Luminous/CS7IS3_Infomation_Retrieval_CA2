The presidents of Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan signed a number of documents defining the prospects for the further development of bilateral economic relations. Our correspondent says that the agreement on Kyrgyzstan joining the bilateral agreement between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan on setting up a single economic space is the main one. Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev had the following comments: [Begin Akayev recording] This is what our people, our whole region, needs. I think that it is a very bold step which may serve as the start button for getting an economic union to work on the scale of the whole CIS. I would like to stress once again that this is not a regional separation today. I think that this is happening thanks to decisive actions by Presidents Karimov and Nazarbayev. Today we formed a major economic union. That is, first of all, a single economic space in trade. Second, a single economic space envisages (?a unitarian) policy in the sphere of currency, in the sphere of taxation, in the sphere of pricing and in the sphere of investments. You can imagine what this means -- that now, we three states will agree all these questions. I think that this, to a certain extent, is the first historic step on the path from talks to concrete deeds. [end recording]
