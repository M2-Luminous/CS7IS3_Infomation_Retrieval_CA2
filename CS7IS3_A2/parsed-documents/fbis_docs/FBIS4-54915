This time we interviewed National Democratic Federation [NDSZ] Chairman Imre Pozsgay, who said that Hungary needs a broad coalition. [Szombathy] When establishing your party, you called it a center party open to the left and closed to the right. What program differences lie behind this unusual definition? [Pozsgay] Our party is characterized by greater freedom and greater political courage. We can offer society program points that others also know about but, because of the limitations of their roles and the historical precedence, they do not have the possibility of speaking about. Why, otherwise, would the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] speak about a national coordination congress, a party that was forced to give up the program of constitutional national assembly? Why would a number of parties speak about debt reductions and debt diplomacy, while they were accepting the payment burdens as fate? The NDSZ did not get involved in any of these restrictions and, thus, it can be more open to various methods of treatment. We focus on values and methods, and we only accept ideological considerations when absolutely necessary. The essence of our new economic policy is that the time has come to place our national economy on a growth path and find sources necessary for economic progress. We need a new constitution that would create a consensus and unity, also in carrying out the budget and state administration reform. [Szombathy] There are several parties that are talking about economic growth, but it seems that the issue of debt reduction is a taboo. What solutions does the NDSZ offer? [Pozsgay] The Polish example clearly shows that it is not the changes in course that determines the opportunities of debt diplomacy. Under the ruins of the Soviet empire, we are the last who are still paying. We know the counterarguments, but this is only an excuse and a defense mostly on the part of those who have been handling this debt for the last 20 years, and their chances are connected to preserving this ideology. I consider the debt issue to be a badly treated economic policy affair. We should get rid of superstitions. At the same time, other parties promising economic growth mention new credits as the source of financing this growth. This is where we differ from them. We do not exclude the possibility of new foreign credits to the Hungarian economic development, but these credits must not appear as state debts. The country should determine the role of foreign debt, and not the other way round. [Szombathy] How does the NDSZ's national character differ from that of the coalition and from that of other similar parties? [Pozsgay] We do not live in the constant fear of moral danger to the nation. In our view, the community form of the accepting nation is well compatible with the conditions of modernization. Regarding the European integration institutions, the national awareness of Western European small countries like Denmark are exemplary for me. The Danes first rejected the Maastricht agreement, and then voted in favor, because their conditions of participation had been met. [Szombathy] The MDF speaks of a leftist danger and Istvan Csurka called on the national forces to cooperate. What is your opinion of these efforts? Is the gathering of the national forces into a bloc necessary and is there any chance of restoration? [Pozsgay] The danger of a leftist restoration does not exist. We are witnessing an information disturbance here, something understandable in a country in which the people lived through a change in the regime that took place without the people, and even against the people. However, I, myself, see a danger of revenge. I follow the appearance of people on the side of the left who should have been called to account for their deeds long ago with concern. However, this phenomenon is, to a certain extent, normal in the struggle of political forces. One should not sound the alarm because of this phenomenon, because this only increases its danger. The conditions for a national bloc are not met, because it is impossible to form a government only based on alarm. The coordination of programs failed to materialize; on the one hand, it is too early, on the other hand the alarm is late, an alarm that weakens precisely the center forces because of the distancing. Every phase of these elections must be carried out, and the lessons should be drawn after the elections. [Szombathy] What role is your party facing after the elections? [Pozsgay] The NDSZ will make it into Parliament, and I hope we will set up a faction. The 100,000 nomination slips gathered under an eventful campaign show that there will be voters for the NDSZ. Many figures coming from the real sphere accepted an NDSZ candidacy. The new parliament will be a split one, with many parties present in the National Assembly. The small parties will also participate in the coalition talks. The NDSZ does not wish to form a coalition with extremist forces. According to the experience so far, the new coalition should not be based on program coordination, because this would bring inadmissible compromises and subsequent blackmail conditions into the government. It is a much better method to agree on two or three basic tasks, like working out a new economic policy for the benefit of economic growth, social policy consolidation, and a new constitution. It is not worth accepting more than that for one legislative cycle.
