Commenting on the FRB's decision, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno, said: I believe FRB Chairman Greenspan, who has asserted that interest rates have remained too low during the months of economic recovery, has concluded that it has become necessary to raise interest rates to keep the U.S. economy growing longer. I believe that the tight monetary control in the United States will have no major impact on international financial markets. In this way, Mr. Mieno indicated that tight monetary control in the United States will not bring about any drastic change to foreign exchange and stock markets.
