Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the Clean Water Act and is grounds for enforcement action; for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or for denial of a permit renewal application. a. The permittee shall comply with effluent standards or prohibitions established under Section 307(a) of the CWA for toxic pollutants and with standards for sewage sludge use or disposal established under Section 405(d) of the CWA within the time provided in the regulations that establish these standards or prohibitions, even if the permit has not yet been modified to incorporate the requirement. b. The CWA provides that any person who violates Sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318, or 405 of the CWA or any permit condition or limitation implementing any of such sections in a permit issued under Section 402, or any requirement imposed in a pretreatment program approved under Sections 402(a)(3) or 402(b)(8) of the CWA is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 per day for each violation. Any person who negligently violates such requirements is subject to a fine of not less than $2,500 nor more than $25,000 per day of violation, or by imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both. Any person who knowingly violates such requirements is subject to a fine of not less than $5,000 nor more than $50,000 per day of violation, or by imprisonment for not more than 3 years, or both. Note: See 40 CFR ยง122.41(a)(2) for additional enforcement criteria. c. Any person may be assessed an administrative penalty by the Administrator for violating Sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318, or 405 of the CWA, or any permit condition or limitation implementing any of such sections in a permit issued under Section 402 of the CWA. Administrative penalties for Class I violations are not to exceed $10,000 per violation, with the maximum amount of any Class I penalty assessed not to exceed $25,000. Penalties for Class II violations are not to exceed $10,000 per day for each day during which the violation continues, with the maximum amount of any Class II penalty not to exceed $125,000. 2.

Duty To Provide Information The permittee shall furnish to the Regional Administrator, within a reasonable time, any information which the Regional Administrator may request to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking and reissuing, or terminating this permit, or to determine compliance with this permit. The permittee shall also furnish to the Regional Administrator, upon request, copies of records required to be kept by this permit. 4. Reopener Clause The Regional Administrator reserves the right to make appropriate revisions to this permit in order to establish any appropriate effluent limitations, schedules of compliance, or other provisions which may be authorized under the CWA in order to bring all discharges into compliance with the CWA. 5.
