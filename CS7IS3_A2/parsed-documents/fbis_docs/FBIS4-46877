FBIS4-46877 "jpusr061___94048" FBIS-USR-94-061 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 7 April 1994 CAUCASUS ARMENIA Former Communist Party Chief Interviewed Former Communist Party Chief Interviewed 944K1297B Yerevan AZG in Armenian 7 Apr 94 p 4, 5 944K1297B Yerevan AZG Armenian CSO [Interview with Suren Harutyunyan, former first secretary of the Armenian Communist Party, by Ruben Hayrabedyan in Moscow; date not specified] [Excerpts] After his voluntary departure Suren Harutyunyan, the former first secretary of the Central Committee of the Armenian Communist Party, avoided any interviews with the republic's press. He did not wish to cast any shadow on the leadership of the republic or to play any destabilizing role in Armenia's political affairs. However, recently various rumors began to spread about him, some approaching the proportions of absurdity. First they said, to Harutyunyan's surprise, that he is a leading representative of Russian-American business (let us say that he goes to work at the Russian Foreign Ministry by metro). Then they linked his name with the leader of one of the factions of the Armenian Pannational Movement [APM]. Then they accused him of being a renegade within the Armenian Communist Party. When I called Harutyunyan to ask for an interview, he said that he considers it below his dignity to answer those charges, adding: "I have been in politics for too long to respond to them." However, he is prepared to talk and express his thoughts about Armenia, the destiny of his people and the most recent period of its history. [Passage omitted] [Hayrabedyan] Now it is possible to hear in Armenia "diatribes" that if Harutyunyan had been more decisive, the opposition would not have assumed power and thus would not cause so much damage to the people with the mismanagement it has demonstrated in its administration of the state and would not have turned a prosperous republic into ruins. [Harutyunyan] They acted "more decisively" in Georgia and Azerbaijan, and what happened? The fact that no blood was shed in the explosive environment of those days and things did not escalate into a civil war, was principally an accomplishment of Armenia's leadership at that time and not that of the opposition, as it is often portrayed. The latter approached matters with the principle of "the worse it gets the better it is for us" and tried to provoke the authorities. Recall the sieges laid to buildings during the meetings of the Supreme Soviet, the acts of violence against some deputies and so forth. One cannot enumerate all of them. There were many opportunities to use forceful methods. But deliberately we did not resort to such steps to avoid creating in the republic a conflict situation with tragic consequences. On the other hand I should not conceal the fact that they put much pressure on me from Moscow and in Yerevan to undertake the "decisive" steps you mentioned. I can only imagine how they would condemn me then and now if I had used force. [passage omitted] [Hayrabedyan] Mr Harutyunyan, let us now discuss a very sensitive subject: Armenia's independence. You were the republic's leader when it was under "Russia's yoke" and when Russia was "plundering our national treasures" and was "trampling" over our national feelings and so forth. We were able to win that independence, and now we are running from it as if it was the plague. And where do we run? Overwhelmingly to the detested "imperialist Russia." It always seemed to me that, given our geographical location and limited resources (especially energy), Armenia would be the last to leave the USSR--it had to. Please tell me how you view Armenia's independence. [Harutyunyan] I welcome the independence of our fatherland. The independence of any nation deserves respect. On the other hand when I look at today's poor Armenia, I begin to wonder whether this is what the struggle was for, whether this is what every Armenian dreamed of and whether everything was done correctly. To be frank, I have thought at great length about these issues and I have always always been told that I have a cautious approach with regard to the concept of independence for Armenia. As a consequence of my work, I knew well the republic, its capabilities and means and I often asked myself whether we can survive on our own. There is no need to look too far. Only 18 percent of our raw material needs came from local sources. Our entire supply of fuel, iron, and was imported. We imported 80 percent of materials needed for light industry. Our domestic farm production accounted for 25 percent of our grain needs, 39 percent of dairy needs and 60 percent of the meat we needed. One can enumerate such numbers ad infinitum. [Hayrabedyan] Yes, but did not the proponents of independence know about that? If they did, what did they rely on? [Harutyunyan] You should ask that question to them. If you add to what I said the unreliability of our surroundings and the lack of any access to open seas, then you find yourself facing an unpromising situation. It is wonderful when you achieve peace and prosperity with independence. Independence is preferable even when the situation does not get any worse. But when life turns into a complete hell and when tens of thousands of people are forced to flee the promised land... This automatically leads to the question: How did Armenia, the prosperous republic of not so long ago, end up in a pit of disasters? Do we not guilty when we seek self-sufficiency and when our own resources are highly exaggerated? The lessons of the last few years, as bitter as they may be, are very instructive for our people. Hrant Matevosyan is right when he writes: "Today we are settling old scores with the empire, but was it not that empire that fed and clothed us? Did we not smile and laugh? Were we not happy with our lives? Were we not in charge of our lives?" [Hayrabedyan] At a recent anniversary ceremony in Moscow [poet and activist] Silva Kaputikyan said bitterly that evidently the people can also make mistakes. [Harutyunyan] The truth is that winning independence is completely different from demonstrating it. How can you arouse the people and fight for an idea when you do not know how you can realize it and when you do not have a more or less realistic program for national development. I repeat: I am also attracted to the idea of an independent national state, but I knew well that political independence without economic independence is a hollow notion. [Hayrabedyan] For 70 years we said that Armenia cannot exist without Russia. Then, over the course of a few months, we "proved" unexpectedly that we can live better without the Russians. After all, "we have cognac, mineral water, and we are a talented people." There were even threats uttered against Russia. You have held leadership positions in Moscow and Yerevan. You know the domain of relations between the two countries well. What is the place of Russia in our nation's destiny? [Harutyunyan] "Having been liberated" from Russia we now turn to it--let us be candid--with begging hands. In the past we demanded even more. Could the well-fed and satisfied Armenian of Soviet Armenia ever contemplate going into exile? Today a degradation of the nation is under way. Its character is changing. We are losing our national dignity. We are becoming uninvited guests and making our hosts nervous. I think that Armenia must have good relations first with its neighbors, including Turkey, and it must have strong ties with Europe and the United States. However, every small nation must have its supremacies [as published] in its geopolitics. Whether we like it or not, we are condemned to be together with the Russians. I think that in the aftermath of the events of the last few years we realized once again Russia's role in the protection of Armenia's independence. To me this is very natural and does not need additional proof. In that context, I would like to say the following: I am terrified by even the theoretical possibility that what happened to the USSR may happen to Russia--that is the disintegration of that country. With whom will we be left then? Every Armenian must think about that. [passage omitted] [Hayrabedyan] Do you not think that in Armenia there are forces that wish to discredit you in order to isolate you from the republic's political life? [Harutyunyan] I feel very comfortable with regard to everything that is undertaken around my name. It would be surprising if my person were viewed unequivocally, perhaps for the simple reason that I had the task of governing the republic during an extremely critical period. However, it is another matter when there is inserious talk. Being unwilling to rise above their unrealized ambitions, my opponents sink to the cheapest levels of defamation. Experience shows that the "most demanding" critics are those who demand the impossible from others because they do not know what to do and how to do it. [Hayrabedyan] What would you say about Armenia's Communist Party? In general how do you view your past? Do you try to erase it? [Harutyunyan] The Armenian Communist Party was in a deep crisis in as early as 1988. It had been weakened in an organizational and political sense. But that was not a phenomenon that occurred in Armenia alone. The entire Communist Party of the Soviet Union was sick. The course that events took not only in Armenia but also across the entire Soviet Union can largely be explained by that phenomenon. Today, the Armenian Communist Party is being rebuilt on new foundations. I believe that it has quite promising capabilities to influence the process of extricating the republic from the jaws of this brutal crisis. My posture with regard to the work of the Communist Party as well as that of the other political parties in Armenia is one of supreme respect. I would only caution that a wave of orthodoxy does not overtake the Communist Party, especially given the fact that it is operating in the especially peculiar conditions of Armenia's reality. As for my past, we learn lessons from the past. What has happened is my life, and I would not run away from it under any circumstances. [Hayrabedyan] So, Mr Harutyunyan, what do we have today? We have a fatherland with a ruined economy, a population that is on the brink of bankruptcy and despair and horrifying levels of unemployment. Meanwhile the war goes on, and the country continues to lose intellectuals and entrepreneurs. The people are completely depoliticized. How can they live? What must be done? [Harutyunyan] It is useless to make any predictions, given Armenia's current situation. I would not want to come across as a self-proclaimed strategist who watches the battle from the sidelines. I have met not too few such individuals. The present Armenian authorities have made many mistakes and have many flaws. On the other hand, I understand the objective difficulties that loom before our nation and the leadership of our republic. There are many critics, but constructive approaches are missing. Today there are more questions than answers. The principal weakness of the present opposition is precisely that it, too, cannot answer the question "What is the way out?" Today there is an evident struggle for survival in the land of Armenians. Obviously everyone is doing that the best way he can. But we cannot be saved individually. I sympathize with those people who believe that a pannational program to extricate ourselves from the current impasse is our principal task. Armenia is stepping into the 21st century without a planned national program. The incompetence of Armenia's political mind is discouraging. In the present circumstances I support not the division of the public but its unity and national consensus. Today none of the Armenian political parties have the ability to extricate the country from its crisis. It is essential to bring together all patriotic forces and to form a united broad-based front for national salvation. The condition of the republic sometimes appears to be insurmountable. Even so, I am convinced that the country may be reborn and joy may come to the Armenian hearth. The only thing that is necessary is that that hope and belief does not die out in the heart and mind of every Armenian. [passage omitted]
