Wu told a press conference sponsored by the Information Office of the State Council here this morning that the bilateral trade relations are not bad on the whole, and the potential for their development is also great. Last year, the bilateral trade volume reached 3.59 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 86 percent over the previous year. However, Wu said, it is very difficult to say that the uncooperative attitude the British Government is taking would not affect the bilateral trade ties. The situation is what the Chinese side would not like to see, and the British side should shoulder the whole responsibility in this regard.
