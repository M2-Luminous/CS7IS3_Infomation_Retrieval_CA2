In such a situation, we would have been left outside the Western defense system and would have inevitably had to gravitate toward the CIS. Although it is not perfect from our viewpoint, since it does not offer us firm guarantees, the "Partnership for Peace" project gives us the opportunity to gradually move toward fulfilling the minimum requirements for our integration in the alliance. At the same time, the "Partnership for Peace" means that no discrimination is being made between the former communist countries in Eastern Europe. Romania has announced in advance its intention of accepting the "Partnership for Peace" formula. The only question mark remains whether NATO might not subjectively decide, in the forthcoming future, that the Visegrad countries are capable of qualifying, while we are not. Therefore, it is up to us to prove that we are a positive asset for the alliance in this part of Europe. Romania has now the possibility of proving that it deserves to be included in NATO. The responsibility is ours, hence our task is to prove that we can qualify for integration in the alliance. Petre Roman, NATO rapporteur for Eastern Europe: "The Time Factor Plays an Essential Role" The "Partnership for Peace" is a compromise between two obvious trends and situations currently prevailing in Europe. On the one hand, the very pressing request of the former communist countries, including Romania, to accede to the status of NATO member and, on the other hand, Russia's categorical rejection of an eventual expansion of NATO. The argument of the former communist countries -- an argument which I also sustained before various international forums -- is that Russia remains an exceptionally great power, with a very strong military machine and a pretty vague new military doctrine, while the old strategy linked to the Soviet imperialist spirit is still prevalent. Russia claims that the entire process of democratization and reform is going to be endangered by NATO's expansion, which would be tantamount to an expansion of the bloc policy, something that prevailed during the Cold War period. What is certain is that we are left with the feeling of a possible revival of Russian imperialism, for reasons that are well-known in our history. Therefore, I believe that the target of our integration in NATO -- until we become full-fledged members -- is the main task of the Romanian foreign policy. On the other hand, the solution with the "Partnership for Peace" only offers some thinking time off to everybody. The United States cannot accept the viewpoint of the Russian imperialism and is obliged to make all efforts to dissociate itself from such a trend. It is obvious that the time factor plays an essential role. The revival of imperialist trends would mean a lot of sorrow and material sacrifice for the Russian people. The "Partnership for Peace" also emphasizes another trend, that of concrete U.S. disengagement from Europe. The United States has major problems, economic and particularly social. The same applies to Western Europe. The problem is the following: In this precarious economic context, on what terms can security be ensured? One cannot forget that NATO is not only a political body, but mainly a military one. Therefore, ensuring a balance also presupposes deterrence, particularly deterrence of the Russian imperialist tendencies. Consequently, the functioning of the "Partnership for Peace" scheme implies the achievement of its declared goal. In practical terms, it means deterring any influences and tactics through which Russia may attempt to pull the ropes in Europe, particularly in Eastern Europe. Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu, Minister of National Defense: "The Romanian Military Is Capable of Integrating in NATO" In my opinion, the "Partnership for Peace" is a much better solution than the discriminatory admittance of East and Central European states to NATO, provided that it is a provisional step and permits access to the European defense structures. From our viewpoint, that is from the viewpoint of the Romanian military body, I believe that it is capable of integration in the military structures of the alliance's member states, thanks to the reform measures it has adopted thus far.
