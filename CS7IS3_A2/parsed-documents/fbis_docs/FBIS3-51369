There he was met by the Colonia mayor and then talked to the press. [Begin recording] [Sanchez de Lozada] Well now, we hope for informal and frank bilateral approaches and approaches with Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. We hope we will be able to approach this market that is so important for Bolivia and that will become more important in the future. [Unidentified reporter] The Uruguayan press announced during the past few hours that Presidents Lacalle, Menem, and Wasmosy [of Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay, respectively] reportedly have virtually accepted Chile's and Bolivia's entry in the near future. [Sanchez de Lozada] Well now, we have some problems because we are still part of the Andean market. We do not want to quit this pact. Nevertheless, we would like to become a hinge and actually be received by this agreement. If there is such a political will, it would be something good, but we will wait for this to become official. If it becomes official, we will consider it with much interest. [passage omitted] [end recording] [passage omitted]
