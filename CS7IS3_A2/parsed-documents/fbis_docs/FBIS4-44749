The research group Biosensors has been experimenting for quite some time with silicon sensors on which a layer of biologically active material was applied as a breeding gound for enzymes and bacteria. By accident the bacteria of the strain Coli Silica Etcherca appeared to affect the silicon material. This property is now being used to etch chips. The biological material is kept on the "right track" by applying lethal chemicals on the interfaces. Meanwhile, miniature microphones have been manufactured using this new method.
