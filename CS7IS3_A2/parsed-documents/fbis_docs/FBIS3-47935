Tokyo has not received such notification from the United States, Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry minister, told a press conference. Kumano said the reported visit by Kantor before the February 11 meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton would "not be realistic" in view of a tight political schedule in Japan up to the summit. Kumano dismissed reported U.S. accusations that Japanese bureaucrats are helping foot-drag progress in bilateral trade talks. Tokyo has not received specific U.S. requests to improve the situation, Kumano said, adding the government has responded appropriately by holding talks with the trade minister when necessary.
