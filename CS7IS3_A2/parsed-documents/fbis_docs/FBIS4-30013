According to a copy of the written agreement of these 10 Southeast Asian countries on an unofficial meeting (held in Manila in late May) obtained by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN's Manila Bureau, this was the first time the promotion of regional integration similar to the European Union (EU) through the early membership of Vietnam and the three other countries in ASEAN, and political cooperation, has been written into a formal document. While the meeting was an unofficial one, participants included senior government officials acting as personal representatives of each nation's leader, and academicians. The fact that a blueprint for the region's future has been clearly stated in an agreement is considered highly significant. The preamble of this document entitled "A Vision for Southeast Asia After the Year 2000," which was signed by representatives of the 10 nations, points out that: "Southeast Asia is one single community. In the 21st Century, this community will play a major political, economic, cultural and moral role." It argues strongly for the need to strengthen regionalism in Southeast Asia, modelled after the EU. The basic principles affirmed for the "Southeast Asian Community" concept are: 1) national and regional resilience; 2) harmony in diversity; 3) common national interests; and 4) open regionalism. At the same time, a multifaceted strategy is deemed necessary to realize the community. In the political and security aspect, the strengthening of bilateral relations between the 10 Southeast Asian countries, membership of the three Indochinese states and Burma in the Southeast Asian Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation (Bali Treaty, signed in 1976) and ASEAN, and their participation in the ASEAN regional forum are also sought. In terms of economics and technology, the document seeks to advance the implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), and the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) to the year 2000, and proposes the promotion of various forms of social and cultural cooperation, such as encouraging personnel traffic, and launching an ASEAN satellite. To materialize the "Southeast Asian Community" concept, the document suggests the following steps: early convening of a summit meeting of the 10 nations, taking the initiative to create a consensus among the 10 nations on lasting peace in Cambodia and the Nansha [Spratly] Islands issue, joint management of borders between the 10 nations, and assistance to the Mekong River Valley development project. The 10 Southeast Asian nations plan to hold their second unofficial meeting in Bangkok before the end of 1994. While the materialization of the Southeast Asian community concept "will be a slow process taking 20 to 25 years," (according to Philippine President Fidel Ramos), a summit meeting may add momentum to the process.
