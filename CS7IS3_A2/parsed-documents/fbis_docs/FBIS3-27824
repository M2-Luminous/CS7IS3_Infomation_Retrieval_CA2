The great leader also completely set forth the execution methods when he presented the militant tasks of this year for the socialist economic construction sector in his New Year's address. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: All economic guiding functionaries should overfulfill this year's people's economic plan by properly conducting the economic organizational work and production control in conformity with the demand of the party's economic strategy, and by highly demonstrating the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm and creative positiveness. Properly conducting economic organizational work and highly demonstrating the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm and creative positiveness with high responsibility are important methods for the economic guiding functionaries to overfulfill this year's people's economic plan. This year we face formidable tasks of economic construction. This year, as has been decided by the 21st plenary session of the party's Sixth Central Committee, we should implement the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy, push ahead with the coal and electricity industries and railroad transportation, which are leading sectors of the people's economy, and continue to develop the metal industry. To achieve the enormous task we are facing, economic guiding functionaries should first properly conduct economic organizational work. To properly conduct economic organizational work, one needs to scientifically, rationally, and concretely conduct all economic work down to the last detail, and this includes drawing up plans, and organizing and guaranteeing production. To properly conduct economic organizational work is a demand which evolved from the essential character of socialist society. A socialist society is a highly organized society where everything is organically in gear with each other. For a long time, the socialist economy has been tightly linked between sectors, production units, and parts of the people's economy that move together and develop according to plan. Therefore, socialist economy cannot advance a single step if it is not organized and economic and technical conditions are not sufficiently guaranteed for the production masses to carry out economic tasks well. Furthermore, under practical conditions in which the volume of socialist economy is growing incomparably and developing rapidly, only when all the economic organizational works, including economic management and production organization, are properly conducted down to the last detail can socialist economy be scientifically and rationally managed and operated so as to highly demonstrate the superiority of the socialist economic system. Properly conducting economic organizational work is also an immediate demand to mobilize and use all inner reserves without any waste. To discover all inner reserves and make the most of them is a firm method to successfully carry out the tasks of socialist economic construction that we face this year. Inner reserves exist in diverse form in various sectors of the people's economy and they grow as socialist construction progresses. However, inner reserves are not easily detected. They can only be unsparingly detected and used to the maximum in production and construction through the functionaries' keen economic organizational works. In other words, the production potential and inner reserves can be mobilized and used to the maximum only when the economic guiding functionaries conduct the management of enterprises and production activities more scientifically and rationally, and actively organize the works for detailed balance and guarantee linkage between economic sectors, production units, parts, and elements. Therefore, the firm guarantee for more successfully carrying out this year's economic task of forecasting massive efforts and consumption of materials lies in properly conducting the economic organizational works. As the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song made clear in his New Year address, it is one of the important methods in successfully carrying out this year's people's economic plan for economic guidance for functionaries to highly demonstrate the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm and creative positiveness. The production masses are the masters who are directly in charge of production. Without the production masses, production cannot be done and economic construction cannot progress by any means. However, even with the production masses, production does not come automatically and socialist economy does not progress at a high speed. It is ideological consciousness that regulates all kinds of people's acts. The economy can speedily progress when the production masses are firmly armed with revolutionary ideology and manifest all kinds of creativity and innovation. The work to demonstrate the revolutionary enthusiasm and creative positiveness of the production masses should become the first step of all the works. When all the functionaries firmly adhere to our party's ideological theory before executing any work and freshly carry out the political works and the works with the people to inspire the production masses's ideology in various forms and methods, they will achieve economic tasks given to their respective sectors and positions displaying revolutionary enthusiasm and creative positiveness. When the political work to inspire the masses' ideology is vigorously carried out, the spirit of collectivism will be highly displayed in the implementation of economic tasks, so that collective innovations will be achieved one after another and economic management will be carried out based on the principles of collectivism. Our party's revolutionary economic strategy presented at the 21st plenary session of the party's Sixth Central Committee is a revolutionary economic construction policy which reflects our party's idea to further display the superiority of our socialism and strengthen the great might of our socialist self-reliant national economy by enhancing the people's living remarkably in the near future through a new upsurge in economic construction. All the economic guiding functionaries should properly conduct the economic organizational work in conformity with the demand of our party's economic strategy and overfulfill this year's people's economic plan by always being deeply involved with the masses, sleeping and eating together with them so as to vigorously carry out political tasks.
