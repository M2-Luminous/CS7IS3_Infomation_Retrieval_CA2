Our countermeasures will depend on the sanctions applied by the United States and other countries," Son Song-pil, North Korea's ambassador to Russia, declared yesterday at a session of the State Duma Committee for International Affairs. The Korean representative called the whole Korean nuclear question "nuclear suspicions invented by the Americans," while the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, according to him, is "aimed at destroying North Korea's socialist system and the republic as a whole." According to the ambassador's statement, North Korea wants to resolve the problem peacefully but, given the slightest pressure or threats from America or other states, Kim Il-song's country is prepared to counter one blow with another. The DPRK's official representative took a great dislike to the Russian foreign minister's Friday Duma speech and to the 10 June Kozyrev-Christopher joint news conference, at which the possibility of the simultaneous introduction of sanctions and holding of a peace conference on Korea was reported. "There can be no question of simultaneous sanctions and a conference," Comrade Son Song-pil said, at the same time adding that the DPRK is seriously considering the Russian proposals and that meetings have already been held with representatives of the Russian Foreign Ministry. According to the ambassador's report, during his stay in the DPRK ex-President Carter conveyed U.S. proposals which include the U.S. abandonment of sanctions, the provision of a light water reactor to the DPRK through third countries or through international organizations, and consent to a third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. "If these conditions are fulfilled, Korea is prepared to keep inspectors at the nuclear installations. But a full-scale inspection cannot be carried out during the talks, since this would signify the DPRK's return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty," the ambassador declared, resolutely emphasizing: "If the talks are held on our terms, the nuclear problem will be removed!"
