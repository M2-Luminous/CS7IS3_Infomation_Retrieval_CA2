Dr. Mirzayanov was told that the case against him, on charges carrying up to eight years in prison, has been dropped for lack of evidence. At his flat in Moscow he said: "I was called to the Ministry of Justice by Lev Baranov, the prosecutor in my case. It was a five-minute conversation. He apologised to me on behalf of A. N. Ilyushenko, Prosecutor-General of the Russian Federation. I told him that I would be taking the `new KGB' to court for the great moral and material damage they caused me these past 18 months." Dr. Mirzayanov, 58, said that men were held at the Matrosskaya Tishina jail, sometimes for years, while their cases were investigated, with no visits permitted from friends or family. He described having to stand with 50 other prisoners, all naked because of the heat, in a cell infested with rats, cockroaches, bedbugs and lice, and so small that no one could lie down or sit. Dr. Mirzayanov worked for more than 25 years in a large military chemical research institute on Enthusiasts' Avenue in Moscow. In 1990 he was one of the first to resign from the Communist Party to join the democratic movement. In October 1992 he blew the whistle on his old firm, revealing that Russia's chemical warfare industry, despite the 1989 Bush-Gorbachev agreement to destroy all chemical weapons and end production, was producing a new binary substance in Volgograd eight times more poisonous than anything possessed by the Americans. He was immediately arrested. In early 1992, he said, field trials of the new gas were held on the Ustyurt plateau in what was by then the independent state of Uzbekistan, without the knowledge of President Karimov, the Uzbek leader. "In other words, we pulled the wool over the Americans' eyes good and proper," he said. When the Americans found out later that year what was happening, they said nothing for fear of making Mr. Bush look foolish in the run-up to the presidential election. Dr. Mirzayanov talked of past years in the Soviet military chemical establishment in Chapayevsk, where soldiers who were thought by the authorities to be of poor quality were put to work pouring lewisite, a deadly poisonous arsine derivative, from buckets and teapots into artillery shells. Many of them died. Then there was the great "white sea" accident when tons of poison were discharged into the Volga river, turning it white with the bellies of dead fish. Russian scientists and generals, he says, continue their terrible work on chemical warfare even today. Accidents are frequent. They carry on working because it is the only trade they know and because chemical warfare has no possibility of "conversion" into peaceful work. The Russian authorities have decided that the poisons to be destroyed under the Bush-Gorbachev agreement should be dealt with by those who made them. This is being done, he says, by burning the poisons in remote Russian localities, with disastrous results for the environment. It is estimated by Dr. Mirzayanov that up to 50 per cent of those in Russian labour camps may be innocent of the charges on which they were convicted. He attributes his own escape from a long prison term to "pressure by Amnesty International, the European Parliament, the American Academy of Sciences and the Russian democratic movement". Those who have no such friends are still wrongly convicted in large numbers. Aleksey Smirnov, the former Soviet dissident who is now chairman of the Centre for Human Rights in Moscow, said: "You must not imagine, just because the Soviet Union has gone, that Russia is now a country with monitors. We need observers. We need Western non-governmental organisations with staff and equipment. We need a civilised parliament. Then maybe we can make progress."
