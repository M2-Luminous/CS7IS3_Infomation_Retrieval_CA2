Warning that "unemployment is the most important social problem facing us at the present time," the Committee on the European Communities calls on the EU "to develop a strategy both for competitiveness and for employment." Restoring Europe's competitiveness is a necessary condition for sustained growth, the Committee says in a report on last year's Commission white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment. But competitiveness will not solve the problem of structural unemployment -- the type that will not be dislodged by economic growth and accounts for at least half of the EU's 17 million or more jobless. The report says structural unemployment is, "if anything, even more serious than the white paper suggests." The Committee says the EU has much to learn from the United States and Japan, which have better records of job creation. It cites inadequate growth and investment, high short-term interest rates over a long period, reduced competitiveness in terms of quality and cost, loss of "technological edge," high unit labour costs and excessive non-wage labour costs as reasons for the EU's high structural unemployment. Job creation can be achieved partly through improving productivity and partly through encouraging innovation. But the Lords point out that microeconomic measures to create jobs need to be carried out at a national, rather than at an EU level. These include simplifying regulations, reforming benefits and the use of lifelong education and vocational training to match skills to changing technological needs. The EU's role should be to act as a catalyst for the exchange of ideas; an advocate of best practice; a monitor, for example, of the effect of regulations on employment; and an umpire to prevent mutually destructive de-regulation between member states. The Lords report, which was agreed unanimously, says that recovery should be "the immediate priority" of macroeconomic policy in the EU. It urges member states to aim to achieve the tough fiscal and monetary convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty in the medium term. "They should not be strictly applied until the Community has recovered from recession," the report says. Although the report steers clear of a full assessment of the planned economic and monetary union, it is sceptical as to whether it will help solve the problem of cyclical unemployment. The report calls on the EU to complete the single market quickly and enforce it equally.
