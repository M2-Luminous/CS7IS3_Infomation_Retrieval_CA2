Speaking in Jerusalem after meeting Israeli leaders and senior Palestinians from the occupied territories, Mr Hurd said he had emerged from his talks convinced that both sides still had a strong incentive to work out their differences. "They all see the importance of getting on with it," he said. "Unless people in Israel or the occupied territories can see that there is actual progress, as opposed to the repetition of declarations, they will lose trust in the process. It is very important they should not." Although he emphasized that Britain was not directly involved in the peace negotiations, he said that the Government was willing to help Israel economically and to assist the Palestinians practically. In particular Mr Hurd pledged that Britain was in favour of liberalising trade between Israel and the European Community. He said that today, during a visit to the occupied Gaza Strip, he would unveil a package of technical assistance to help Palestinians establish self-rule. His visit has been dominated by the failure of Israelis and Palestinians to agree to the terms of their "land for peace" accord in the territories. Mr Hurd came face to face with some of the difficulties when he met Yitzhaq Rabin, the Israeli Prime Minister, who read out the entire contents of a fax received last week from the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Israel insists that the Palestinians reneged on earlier commitments to resolve three outstanding differences holding up the start of an Israeli withdrawal from the territories. The Palestinians who met Mr Hurd complained that Israel was using unfair tactics at the negotiating table, and said that daily life for the two million Arab inhabitants of the territories had changed little since the signing of the peace accord in Washington last September.
