The Federation Council's commission which has visited the conflict zone put forward a proposal to expand the state of emergency over the entire territory of North Ossetia. At present the state of emergency has been introduced only on a part of North Ossetia's and Ingushetia's territories. North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov disagreed with this proposal and declared that "the commission has not even tried to penetrate the essence of this problem." The Federation Council can promote the conflict settlement "if its resolution does not become another negative and illegal link in the chain of decisions adopted earlier," he said in his interview with journalists. Among these "illegal decisions" Galazov mentioned the decree on rehabilitation of the repressed peoples and the decree on the creation of the Ingush republic which, as he believes, actually legalizes the territorial re-division. During his conversation with journalists Ingush President Ruslan Aushev supported the recommendations of the Federation Council Commission on introduction of the state of emergency on the territory of North Ossetia. He also does not rule out the possibility of such a measure as establishing presidential rule in the conflict zone.
