In other words, a CNE member earns more money in two months than the amount that has been budgeted for the running of the Faculty of Economy. The unarmed opposition has often accused the government of a lack of clarity and austerity in public spending. They are quite right. However, so far none of the three members who represent the unarmed opposition in the CNE appears to have come forward to protest this proposal for such high subsidies and benefits. This CNE proposal is ideal for the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo], which has 10 members in the CNE. Those 10 people will be earning fabulous salaries -- particularly by comparison with the minimum wage -- and Joaquim Chissano can now start saying: "look, Frelimo costs so much but the opposition, if it wins the upcoming elections, will cost three times as much." It looks, therefore, like the CNE and its appetites may yet be the Cyclone Nadia that the General State Budget needed to become as ravaged as Nampula Province. [passage omitted]
