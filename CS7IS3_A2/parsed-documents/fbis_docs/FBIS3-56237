Ryabchikova; place and date not given: "New People Should Come to Leadership"] [Excerpts] [Ryabchikova] Why did you decide to run for president as an independent candidate? [Yermakov] Because I am convinced that only an independent candidate stands a good chance of becoming a popular president. This would also expand the basis for a prospective program and its adjustments, making it genuinely centrist -- I have centrist convictions -- and extracting whatever is good from the programs of different parties. Besides, if we talk about the need to form a coalition government, a president coming from a party will find that to be a much more difficult task. Instead of common sense or compromise, this president would be steered by the party as to what decision to make or who to nominate to this or that post. I have long realized the correctness of Stalin's slogan: Personnel are fundamental. Finally, it is my deep conviction that a reform-minded president must feel the support of all people, and of one party only. [Ryabchikova] But the people now seem to be concerned only with their dropping standard of living. Could we live at least a little bit better? [Yermakov] In my opinion, we have approached a line which is very dangerous to cross. People cannot even feed themselves properly. Yes, we could live better, but our perestroyka transformed everything into some kind of agony. We set out to mess up everything in sight without thinking about where we are headed. Everyone is to blame for this, especially communists. As a rank-and-file Communist Party member, I too am guilty. However, I am not ashamed of belonging to the Communist Party, which, by the way, I have not abandoned to this very day. [passage omitted] One should not again lie to people -- there is no turning back. But we all must admit that the process of economic stabilization and trying to get out of the crisis by ourselves is very much delayed in the Crimea. The peninsula has followed the lead of Ukraine's unpredictable policies lacking any sense of direction. This has led to extremely bad consequences. [Ryabchikova] What do you think about the idea of a Crimean state? [Yermakov] We have declared that the Crimea is a state and have written this into the Crimean Constitution. Our statehood, however, has to be defended and consolidated. Whether or not Kiev wants it, the Crimea has proclaimed itself an independent state. Without leaving Ukraine. One should reckon with this fact. Or else... everything has its limits, you know. [Ryabchikova] What do you think about the Sevastopol issue? [Yermakov] At present, the city of Sevastopol has the rights and responsibilities of an oblast. In fact, it is a little oblast. A strange situation has taken shape -- as it is directly subordinated to Kiev, the city is and at the same time is not in the Crimea. I believe that it should not be separated from the Crimea. We should eventually form a common entity. The time has come to unite. First of all, this would strengthen the Crimean state -- one out of every five Crimean residents lives in that city. It also has vast intellectual potential -- its five research institutes used to work for the entire Soviet Union -- as well as economic potential. Finally, it is the chief Black Sea Fleet base. [Ryabchikova] Will this task require calling a referendum, do you think? [Yermakov] I believe we can do without a referendum. It would be enough to conduct a public opinion poll, and based on its results, have the Sevastopol City Council adopt a resolution. After that, the council along with the Crimean Supreme Soviet would request that the Ukrainian Supreme Council recognize our unification. This is our inalienable right. [passage omitted] [Ryabchikova] How would you assess the activities of the Crimean Supreme Soviet? [Yermakov] Unfortunately, our sessions have looked more like political rallies, focusing on trifle matters and neglecting serious economic problems. No offense meant, but the present deputies are not capable of delivering any changes at all. New people should come to the Crimean leadership -- those who know their way through the dangerous thicket of the market jungle and can survive under new conditions. [passage omitted] [Ryabchikova] How should we begin our reforms? [Yermakov] Without a stable monetary system, it is impossible to boost the economy and introduce the market pricing system. To mend the financial system, we should devise a program intended to encourage production and stabilize the credit and financial system. We must determine the status of the Crimean National Bank with the possible transition to payment settlements conducted in Russian hard-currency rubles. This would immediately balance the supply and demand relations in the market and ease strains on society. [Ryabchikova] How is your program different from the programs of other candidates for Crimean president? [Yermakov] Let me present three main points, the implementation of which is completely different. First, we stand for a confederation of all former Soviet republics in one economic commonwealth based on a common military and political doctrine and the Commonwealth Armed Forces, which would consist of small national armies. This commonwealth would be free from internal borders and customs houses with the common ruble zone and energy sources. This would solve the issue of the Black Sea Fleet, dual citizenship, raw material supplies, components for Crimean enterprises, etc. [passage omitted] [Ryabchikova] How do you think the Black Sea Fleet issue could be resolved? [Yermakov] No one doubts that the fleet should not be divided. This, however, is a kind of triple problem consisting of three elements -- Sevastopol, the Crimea, and the fleet. If you settle only one of these elements, leaving the other two unaddressed, the problem as a whole will remain unresolved. All those commissions are only games conducted by politicians. I have more than enough of participating in them, and am convinced that no commission will ever resolve anything. It will take a forcible decision on the part of both states: "It is going to be this way, and that's that." We should not be afraid of this.
