He was speaking at a meeting of EU foreign ministers which was deadlocked over the voting issue, which is holding up the entry of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into the EU on January 1 next year. "The EU is heading towards a very serious crisis. This really is serious," Petersen angrily told journalists. EU enlargement is being blocked by London's demand, backed by Spain, that the entry of more small countries into the EU should not dilute the ability of bigger members like Britain to block decisions they do not like. The Danish minister suggested that it was a waste of time continuing to negotiate with Britain, because "it is out of the question that it will give in today." German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said he doubted whether a compromise was in sight, despite telephone contact earlier in the day between German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister John Major. But several ministers said agreement was near in a dispute between Spain and Norway over fishing catch quotas which threatens to stop Norway from entering the Union with the three other applicants. Austria, Finland and Sweden finally agreed on their terms of membership for joining the EU on March 1. The EU's negotiations with Oslo are still blocked by Spain's demand for access to Norway's fish-rich waters. Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos said: "We are very close to an agreement on fish. Diplomats said Norway, together with Spain's EU partners, might buy off the Spanish opposition to Norwegian membership with more fish." The more intractable balance of power deadlock hinges on the effect of enlargement on the EU's delicately-balanced system of majority voting. It provides that the bigger members such as Britain, France and Germany have more votes than their smaller partners, but fewer votes in relation to their populations. The current system allows one small and two large countries to band together in a blocking minority with 30 percent of the total votes. Most EU countries want to keep this proportion unchanged when the four applicants join the Union. But this would raise the blocking minority threshhold and three countries would no longer have the power of veto. It would mean that Spain, Italy and Greece, for example, can no longer block decisions they believe are bad for Mediterranean agriculture. Britain, Germany and Denmark or the Netherlands would lose their power to block trade regulations backed by the EU's more protectionist members. Britain's stand accords with its general policy to keep the EU's power as limited as possible. Its opponents accuse the British of wanting to paralyse the decision-making process. Spain is wary of any enlargement that would shift the EU's balance of power away from the agricultural south to the industrial north, which might be less inclined to subsidise Mediterranean farmers. The dispute heralds a wider ideological dispute between federalists and free traders at a 1996 conference to change EU rules before the Union decides on accepting such countries as Malta, Cyprus, Poland and Hungary.
