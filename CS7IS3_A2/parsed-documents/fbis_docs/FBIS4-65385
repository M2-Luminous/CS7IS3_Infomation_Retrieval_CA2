Roca's speech was a plea for the government and its prime minister to accept their responsibilities in the struggle against corruption, but accompanied by greater arguments than on other occasions in defense of CiU's stance, with repeated criticisms of those condemning it. "In some people's opinion," he said, "our conduct deserves to be described as blackmail, and this is also extended to Catalonia's citizens as a whole. This assertion is false, unfair, and offensive, but also -- and this is the worst thing -- irresponsible. Stirring up territorial apprehensions and resentments may be advantageous, but history disqualifies those raising these flags." "I will not enter into the controversy," he added, "because that would be for us to enter slippery ground, very far from the calm that befits the country right now, but I wish to point out that it would be valid to maintain, with the same legitimacy that that accusation is leveled against us, that there are strategies that are based on the idea of the worse the better; that is, if the economic recovery were cut short, it would not be bad news for some people's election prospects." Roca maintained the dual aim of explaining his own stance and criticizing that of those who condemn it in asserting that many of the criticisms that CiU is now receiving are being put in a bitter and offensive way. He added that the nationalist coalition does not disregard the criticisms it receives; it reflects on them, but "I must admit that they would make a greater impression on our spirit if those leveling them were not those who have always criticized us." "They are not doing so just now," he asserted: "They have always done so; their criticisms have old reminiscences of historical continuity." These passages provoked shouting and booing from the People's Party seats, which also broke out when Roca stated that CiU facilitates stability through its support, and that the economic situation is not deteriorating, as was recently acknowledged by one of the news media -- and he showed a page from EL MUNDO -- which "is characterized by a strongly critical stance on our group's policy." "So you will not be surprised," he continued, "if I say that we are more pleased by the opinion of those who demand of our group a demanding stance that will at the same time bring calm, which requires of us very particularly that we try to serve the immediate aims of an economic recovery, without on that account forgoing demanding of the government a determined struggle against each and every cause of corruption." Roca also stated that "nobody will dictate our policy to us from outside our coalition," and that "we accept the responsibility that we undertook." "We accept it as long as we believe that our effort serves some purpose, as long as the struggle against corruption is not called off, and as long as the the guidelines of economic and social policy that have made possible the current change of trend are not altered. If through this we achieve positive results for society as a whole, we will be satisfied to have done so, and if this were not so, we would accept our responsibility, but we would find ourselves obliged to renew our stance, because our commitment to this country's governability and stability has those aims."
