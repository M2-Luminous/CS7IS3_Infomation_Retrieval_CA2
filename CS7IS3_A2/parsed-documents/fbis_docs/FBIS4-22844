I. Dmitriyev, S. P. Falaleyev, Laboratory of Mathematical Physics of the faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics; UDC 519.6:517.958] [Abstract] This article develops a numerical algorithm to model electromagnetic fields (magnetotelluric sounding) in quasi-stratified media using three-dimensional potentials. The quasi-stratified medium is considered to be a conducting structure consisting of homogeneous layers of variable thickness. Outside the local anomalous area the medium is a plane-parallel stratified medium with a normal electric conductivity distribution. When the algorithm is used in magnetotelluric sounding, the impedance of the field at the Earth's surface is measured over a wide range of frequencies. Thus, the electrodynamic problem must be solved for a large number of wavelengths, which takes a great deal of processor time. A method is presented to reduce this by a factor of five. The algorithm is written in FORTRAN 77 for an IBM PC/AT computer. Figures 2; references 14: 10 Russian, 4 Western.
