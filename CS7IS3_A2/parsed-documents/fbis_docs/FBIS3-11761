Referring to Luis Donaldo Colosio's murder before members of the six congressional political parties, Chretien said: "I am sure they (Mexicans) will bear this tragedy and will continue to advance in democracy." Chretien addressed Congress following a one-hour meeting with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari that was held this morning at Los Pinos Presidential Residence in Mexico City. Chretien underscored in his speech: "In moments such as these, we are all brothers and sisters, and I am confident this tragedy will bring us even closer and that Mexico will continue to fight to defend its democratic values." Minutes before, in his welcome speech to Chretien, PRI Senator Silvia Hernandez said with a weak voice and tears in her eyes that, unfortunately, he "came at a time of national sorrow which under other circumstances would have been a time for celebration." Hernandez conveyed the respect Mexicans feel for Canada due to its democratic and multicultural background and for being a nation that has always offered its support to developing countries, showing its concern for the respect of human rights and the environment. At the end of his speech, members of the various parties asked Chretien questions regarding NAFTA, the situation of Indians in Canada, and Quebec's separatist movement. Regarding NAFTA, Chretien explained it substantially improves the bilateral agreement Canada had with the United States and it will help improve living standards in North America. He said he is convinced of the advantages free trade entails, recalling the Canadian economy has been able to rank among the seven most developed economies in the world because its export sector is the leading source in job creation. Chretien said Canada is the main exporter per capita in the world, clarifying the NAFTA members (Canada, the United States, and Mexico) must still work on the definition of subsidies and dumping to establish more clear rules and a more just trade. Regarding the situation of Canadian Indians, he said the solution has been and should be "cultural diversity in unity" so that instead of trying to westernize the Indian peoples, "they prefer to guarantee them their autonomy." In this sense, Chretien said Quebec's separatist movement has always existed, and although it might be legitimate, he is confident people in Quebec prefer to remain members of the Canadian federation. Chretien began today a three-day official visit to Mexico where he had planned to attend a dinner in his honor offered by President Salinas de Gortari. The event was canceled, however, due to the attempt against Colosio Murrieta, who was shot in the head and abdomen following a political meeting in the northwestern city of Tijuana. Three hours after the attack, Colosio Murrieta, 44, died in Tijuana General Hospital despite the efforts of a team of doctors to save his life.
