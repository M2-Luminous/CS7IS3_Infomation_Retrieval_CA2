Chernomyrdin said that Russia is going to continue, despite problems and setbacks, on the reform line it has chosen. Our reporter Jukka Palmen has been following Viktor Chernomyrdin's news conference. [Palmen] Here at the State Banqueting Hall, or the Smolna of Helsinki as it used to be called, the news conference of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin has now taken about 30 minutes. The matters raised have mainly been economic questions. This visit seems to very strongly concentrate on economic questions. The unceremonious character of the visit became clear in the morning, when Prime Minister Chernomyrdin was received without any official welcoming ceremonies, and he has during the whole day had talks with Prime Minister Esko Aho and had lunch with President Martti Ahtisaari in between the talks. No significant news has come up yet today except that Russia will cover part of its debt to Finland with arms deliveries. How big these arms deliveries are is not quite clear yet. According to Prime Minister Aho, the deliveries are so big that they will cover the Russian debt on the clearing account of the Bank of Finland. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also visited the Confederation of Finnish Industry and Employers and four fairly urgent projects were taken up there; projects that Finnish industry would like to get off the ground. These are the diesel engine factory in St. Petersburg, the production of railway carriages, and the Outokumpu mining company project to open mines on the Kola Peninsula, among others. Nothing concrete was agreed on these either. Of foreign policy questions, the question of the Baltic countries was taken up briefly at this news conference when a Swedish reporter asked whether Russia will really impose sanctions on the Baltic countries if it is of the opinion that the human rights of the Russians are not secured in the Baltic countries. Chernomyrdin denied all sanctions but said that the human rights of Russians, like the human rights of everybody else, must be secured in the Baltic countries. I am ending my report here, now back to the studio in Pasila.
