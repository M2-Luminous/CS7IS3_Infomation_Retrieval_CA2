[Begin recording in English with simultaneous translation into Spanish] [unidentified reporter] This afternoon, the official conversations between Cuba and Zambia began. What is the result of this first session, and what types of cooperation will be established between Cuba and Zambia? [Chiluba] The discussions were held in a very cordial atmosphere. We learned a great deal from President Fidel Castro in all areas. We discussed cooperation in the fields of health care; agriculture; the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, of course; as well as the field of tourism. We believe there is much that we can do to develop these areas. We also looked at matters of common interest in the global politics of today; the problems of Angola, which are about to be resolved now; and the problems of Mozambique. [words indistinct] that today they have begun voting in South Africa in the first democratic elections. We believe there will be more peace in that area. We also looked at the development of Third World countries. We should begin to rely on our own efforts, and with a bit of sweat and toil and commitment, as well as perhaps a little help from outside, we may manage to build strong foundations for the development of all countries. [end recording] At the center for genetic engineering and biotechnology, Frederick Chiluba received a detailed explanation from Manuel Limonta, the director of this scientific institution, and expressed interest in the diverse areas of research conducted at the center. At the Finlay Institute, he visited one of the plants for the production of vaccine and was accompanied by [Politburo member] Dr. Concepcion Campa, director of the Finlay Institute; and Gustavo Sierra, deputy director of that center. For tomorrow, Zambian President Chiluba is scheduled to visit health care centers, and in the evening is scheduled to meet with the African ambassadors accredited in our country.
