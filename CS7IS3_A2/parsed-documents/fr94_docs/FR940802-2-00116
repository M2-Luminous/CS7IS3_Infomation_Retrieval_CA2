FR940802-2-00116 FR940802-2-00059 Ask each individual to record each result as being one of the following: ``at .00 BAC''; ``above .00 and below. 02 BAC''; ``at or above .02 BAC''; or ``can't tell''. Dosing of devices and interpretation of results will be accomplished within a twenty minute period. To conform, with each interpreter, no positive results at .000 BAC, not more than one positive result at .008 BAC, not more than one non-positive result at .032 BAC and not more than one ``can't tell'' result. If the device is capable of providing a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less than 0.020 BAC, with each interpreter, not more than one such result at .000 BAC. 4.4␣Test 3. Light Conditions (only interpretive devices which require that results be checked through a visual inspection) Perform Tests 1 and 2, in accordance with 4.3, under each of the following light conditions: incandescent light; mercury vapor light; sodium vapor light; and daylight. Under each light condition, the device must meet the criteria established in 4.3: To conform, with each interpreter, no positive results at .000 BAC, not more than one positive result at .008 BAC, not more than one non-positive result at .032 BAC and not more than one ``can't tell'' result. If the device is capable of providing a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less than 0.020 BAC, with each interpreter, not more than one such result at .000 BAC. 4.5␣Test 4. Cigarette smoke interference (only breath and saliva test devices) Perform five trials at 0.000 BAC. Select an alcohol-free person who smokes cigarettes for this test. Ask the person selected to smoke approximately one half of a cigarette. Within one minute after smoking, or after a waiting period specified in the manufacturer's instructions, administer the alcohol screening device test according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then ask the person to smoke another inhalation and repeat the test to produce a total of five trials. To conform, no positive results. 4.6␣Temperature Test at low and high ambient temperature. 4.6.1␣Test 5.1 Low Ambient Temperature Perform 40 trials at 10 ○C, including 20 trials at 0.008 BAC and 20 trials at 0.032 BAC. Use a calibrating unit for this test for breath devices and preparations of bodily fluids or scientifically acceptable substitutes for non-breath devices. To conform at 0.008 BAC, not more than one positive result. To conform at 0.032 BAC, not more than one non-positive result. 4.6.2␣Test 5.2 High Ambient Temperature Perform trials of 40 devices at 40 ○C, including 20 trials at 0.008 BAC and 20 trials at 0.032 BAC. Use a calibrating unit for this test for breath devices and preparations of bodily fluids or scientifically acceptable substitutes for non-breath devices. To conform at 0.008 BAC, not more than one positive result. To conform at 0.032 BAC, not more than one non-positive result. 4.7.␣Test 6. Vibration Perform 40 trials, including 20 trials at 0.008 BAC and 20 trials at 0.032 BAC. Use a calibrating unit for this test for breath devices and preparations of bodily fluids or scientifically acceptable substitutes for non-breath devices. Mount the screening device on a shake table and vibrate the table in simple harmonic motion through each of its three major axes, as specified below. Sweep through each frequency range in 2.5 minutes, then reverse the sweep to the starting frequency in 2.5 minutes. The 40 disposable testers may be placed in a suitable box mounted on the shake table. Test after vibration. ␣ 1Frequency (hertz) 1Amplitude (inches, peak to peak) 10 to 30 0.30 30 to 60 0.15 To conform at 0.008 BAC, not more than one positive result. To conform at 0.032 BAC, not more than one non-positive result.
