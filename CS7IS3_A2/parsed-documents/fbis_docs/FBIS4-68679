In the past three-four months the heads of administration of such big Russian cities as Omsk, Saratov, Vladivistok and Nizhniy Novgorod have been removed from office. The circumstances of their removal were various, but in every case it took place under pressure from the oblast governor. A standard set of accusations was made against practically every one of them: attacks on the oblast administration, the collapse of Russian statehood, links with the opponents of reform, corruption, a one-time flagrant violation of job duties, etc. The same sort of situation is emerging today in a number of other cities. We are very much concerned by the fact that the people leaving their work are honest, decent people who are deeply concerned over the interests of their cities and have actively defended the rights of local government established by the Russian Constitution and guaranteed by your edicts. The main thing is that the dismissals were not preceded by objective checkups on the work of the heads of city administrations, they received no written explanations, the grounds for their removal were not examined in any commissions, and some of them were denied the right to the personal meeting with the Russian president that is guaranteed by your edicts. Today most governors are doing everything they can to subordinate local government to themselves, which is directly contrary with Article 12 and Chapter 8 of the Russian Constitution. Those who resist this are either dismissed or leave on their own accord. One gets the impression that local government is a fiction and is not needed by the federal authorities, although we are convinced that local government is, in an objective sense, an ally of the Russian president and the central authorities in the political and economic reform of our country and protection of the public's interests. Esteemed president! We propose that you: 1. Take local government under your protection and guardianship. 2. Meet with the representatives of the unions and associations of Russia's cities. 3. Speed up the drafting of normative acts delimiting the jurisdiction of the bodies of state authority of the Federation's components, on the one hand, and of local government, on the other. 4. When heads of administration are removed from office, schedule elections for heads of local government with multiple-candidates. 5. On the basis of petitions by heads of administration who have been removed from office, carry out checkups and publish their results. Adopted at a meeting of the Union of Cities of Northwest Russia in Kirov. From the Editors V. Pyshkin, executive director of the Union of Cities of Northwest Russia, asked us to publish this letter to the RF president. In satisfying his request, we refrain from any commentary on the positions of the letter's authors and their assessment of the cases of the removal of the heads of administration of big Russian cities, which really have become more frequent. Here it is necessary, as the saying goes, to look into each specific case. We would like only to recall the article of the Constitution that is cited by the participants in the meeting of the cities of Northwest Russia: "... Local government is autonomous within the limits of its powers. Bodies of local government do not belong to the system of bodies of state authority." And while it is in the embryonic stage, as it were, it would probably make a lot of sense for the president to take it "under his protection and guardianship.
