The U.S. dollar hit a record post-war low and fell below 100 yen. Although there was certainly some rebound afterwards, the market is still generally taking a bearish view of the dollar. Even after the central banks of the major industrial countries joined hands to intervene, little result was achieved in reversing the trend. Due to a chain reaction, the world's stock markets generally slumped. It seems that the central banks may again take action after the market reopens today. The situation is noteworthy. After the end of World War II, the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen was pegged at 1 to 360. Some people said that this was because the United States deliberately arranged a low exchange rate for the yen in order to boost Japan's exports and help Japan's economic recovery. Some people said that the rate was set by MacArthur to seek a "perfect circle" for the yen, because 360 represents the number of degrees in a circle. Anyhow, the fixed exchange rate mechanism was maintained until 1973. After that, the dollar has declined continuously. It has fallen below the symbolic 100 yen mark and has reached another significant milestone. Last August, the dollar once dropped to the low level of 100 yen. Two days after this fall, the U.S. Federal Reserve intervened in the market and forced the dollar to rebound by 5 yen after selling only $100 million of its reserves. However, the present situation is quite different. First, the United States was quite indifferent to the dollar's decline, and only Japan's central bank intervened. While the market watched for U.S. action, people could only hear Clinton, Greenspan, and Bentsen making irrelevant remarks. Three days later, when the central banks of the major countries took joint action, the dollar had become too weak to recover. The Federal Reserve alone spent more then $1 billion of its reserves fund, but the result could hardly compare with last year. This made people more worried that the United States will have to raise interest rates again to support the dollar, and that this would have an adverse impact on stock markets and cause substantial falls. The United States has shaken off economic recession ahead of the other Western countries this time. It is generally believed that the economic recovery in the United States is still stronger than that in Japan. However, the dollar exchange rate continues to face downward pressure, and this seems to be contrary to the country's actual economic conditions. Some economists say that the United States has shown symptoms of the "British disease." Britain used to be an economic power in the past. However, after its colonies gained independence in the post-war period, overseas markets for British products began to shrink in the 1960's. Every time strong economic growth arose in Britain, the nation increased its imports and the trade deficit increased too. Then, the government was forced to apply the brake, and this slowed growth. After three such cycles, Britain finally announced the devaluation of the pound, although this did not fundamentally solve the problem. At present, there is high consumption inside the United States, and the savings rate of the American people is very low. The competitive power of American goods in overseas markets is rather weak. What is accompanying economic recovery is an increasing trade deficit. Facing a weakening U.S. dollar, Clinton could only say that the foundation of the U.S. economy was healthy and the United States would continue to strengthen its economy in order to seek a favorable reaction from the markets. He did not express his determination to stabilize the dollar, and did not even show an understanding of the market. The outside world does not understand U.S. monetary policy and foreign exchange policy either. The United States has reopened the trade talks, but people still suspect that the United States has not given up its practice of pushing up the yen in order to restrain Japanese exports and reduce its own trade deficit. On the part of Japan, a further revaluation of the yen is certainly a bitter experience. When the Japanese economy, which has been insipid for a long time, was just showing certain signs of improvement, the continuing revaluation of the Yen (the market looks forward to a level of 1 dollar to 95 yen) has dealt heavy blows at the weak recovery. Japan could not but take solo action to support the dollar. The current round of yen revaluation has coincided with instability in the Japanese political situation and also precedes the G-7 summit. This has caused people to speculate that the United States has deliberately taken this opportunity to exert pressure on Japan. On the other hand, the role of the U.S. Federal Reserve is also under suspicion. Earlier this month, the famous American journalist Bob Woodward, who revealed the Watergate scandal, published a new book entitled "The Agenda." In it, he exposed many of the Clinton administration's scandals [as published] and mentioned that Greenspan "in some aspects was the ghostwriter of Clinton's economics." If this is true, the independent position of the Federal Reserve has changed, and it might have changed by relying on spending cuts and deficit reduction to achieve its purpose. The recent weakness of the dollar began precisely from the revelation of this inside story on the front page of THE WASHINGTON POST. While the market remains unclear about the orientation of U.S. monetary policy, it seems that the U.S. dollar will continue to fluctuate sharply in the near future. Because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the weakness of the U.S. dollar will cause the exchange rate of the Hong Kong currency to fall against other major currencies. As a result, in order to avoid losses caused by fluctuating exchange rates, foreign capital and ordinary investors have decided to reduce their holdings of Hong Kong stocks. This is a major reason for the fall in the Hong Kong stock market. The pegged exchange rate system has undoubtedly played a positive role in stabilizing the Hong Kong currency. However, there is no panacea in the economic field. Before the 1960's, the Hong Kong dollar was pegged to sterling, and the peg was removed after sterling's devaluation. Future changes in the value of the U.S. dollar and its impact on Hong Kong's economy are something we should pay close attention to.
