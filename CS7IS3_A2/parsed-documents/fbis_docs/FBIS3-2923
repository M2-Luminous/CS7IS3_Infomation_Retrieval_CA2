The motion, a copy of which was made available to KYODO NEWS SERVICE, appears only days before Hosokawa begins a three-day visit to Beijing Saturday, his first as Japan's top leader. The document clearly states the strong dissatisfaction of the Chinese victims of Japanese wartime aggression, while demanding a formal apology and compensation from Hosokawa. Signed by a 32-member delegation from Hubei Province and led by Liu Napeng, the motion declares that despite the Chinese agreement to give up demands for war reparations in the Japanese-Chinese joint declaration of 1972, Chinese victims still have the right to be compensated for civilian losses. The document claims more than 10 million Chinese victims were savagely murdered by Japanese forces during the so-called "Nanjing massacre" alone, causing over 300 billion dollars in economic losses. The motion appeared at the NPC in 1992 on the eve of the "historic" visit of Japanese Emperor Akihito, but authorities refused to act at the time, due to political considerations. The drafters of the document say the time is now ripe to demand payment for war losses, as many Japanese already support Hosokawa's position on apologizing for Japan's war behavior and the new government and the Social Democratic Party have taken a positive attitude toward compensating civilian victims of Japanese war crimes. Besides asking Hosokawa to apologize and promise war compensation to Chinese victims, other demands include the establishment of a committee for civil compensation from Japan, which would include Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and overseas Chinese, the acknowledgement and publication of a legal basis for demanding payment from Japan, and an open and published denunciation of Japanese aggression and war crimes. The document also says the right to formally register the victims should belong to the Chinese Government and that Japanese yen loans should also be used to compensate victims. While visiting Japan in 1992, Chinese party secretary Jiang Zemin, now also the nation's president, indicated that the Chinese Government would not interfere with demands for civilian compensation. This has led to an increase in such demands.
