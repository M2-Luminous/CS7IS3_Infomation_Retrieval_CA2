FR941021-0-00035 FR941021-0-00002 The set-aside program allows eligible borrowers to move one FmHA annual installment for each loan to the end of the loan term, thereby quickly eliminating the immediate financial stress. The installment set-aside may be the one due immediately after the disaster or, if that installment is paid to the neglect of other creditors or family living and operating expenses, then the next scheduled installment may be set-aside. Borrowers who received primary loan servicing after the disaster will not be eligible for the disaster set-aside, as restructuring of the account already resolved the financial distress for the current and next production/marketing period. Borrowers whose farmer program loans have been accelerated will also not be eligible for disaster set-aside as their financial situation is much more severe than the borrower who is only one installment behind. These type of borrowers have already been processed through 1951&hyph;S primary and preacquisition preservation loan servicing resulting in no servicing granted. The disaster set-aside program cannot offer more favorable options than those provided in subpart S of part 1951. Based on past experience, the Agency has found that a borrower needs a minimum of one to two years to recover from a disaster. Therefore, in order for an installment to be set-aside, the term remaining on the loan must equal or exceed two years from the date on which the installment set-aside was due. This requirement automatically eliminates all one-year loans and any loans that will mature in less than two years. Borrowers with less than two years remaining on the loan will receive greater benefit from the servicing options available under subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter as restructuring could possibly provide longer repayment terms for the entire debt. The set-aside amount will include unpaid interest and any principal that would be credited to the borrower's account as if the payment were paid on the due date. This amount will not exceed the annual scheduled installment being set-aside minus any portion of the installment paid prior to the set-aside addendum being signed. The unpaid interest is set-aside in order that the remaining amortized installments can be credited properly to principal and interest. Interest will continue to accrue on any principal amount set-aside at the same rate charged on the non-set-aside portion of the note. The amount set-aside, including interest accrual on any principal set-aside, will be due on or before the final due date of the loan. The interest amount set-aside will not accrue interest, as permitted by section 331A of the CONACT. Borrowers who apply for both set-aside and 1951&hyph;S servicing, must choose which program they wish to accept. Borrowers cannot choose both because the options are overlapping servicing tools geared toward borrower financial stability. The program not chosen will automatically be withdrawn once the borrower either signs the set-aside addendum or the promissory note(s) restructured under 1951&hyph;S, whichever is applicable. This assures the borrower's eligibility for the program chosen prior to the other request being withdrawn. If the set-aside program is chosen and any 1951&hyph;S request is withdrawn, the borrower will not lose any future servicing rights under subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter. The borrower may re-apply for 1951&hyph;S servicing at any time after the set-aside addendum is signed. However, if a borrower is offered servicing under subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter while waiting for notice of eligibility for the set-aside and the time limits for 1951&hyph;S servicing expire without timely response by the borrower, the borrower will lose the rights to 1951&hyph;S servicing.
