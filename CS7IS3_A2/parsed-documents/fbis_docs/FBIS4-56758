In a statement to Barbados' CBU [as received] Television that was broadcast today by Cuban television, Castro said: "The effort made (by the Cuban fighters) helped safeguard Angola's independence and hastened the independence of Namibia and the elimination of apartheid." Castro also extolled the sacrifices made and the struggle waged by the South Africans and the Namibians to reach their objectives, saying: "Sooner or later, Namibia would have been independent, and apartheid would have disappeared anyway." Castro praised African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela (who won the elections). He mentioned Mandela's leadership capabilities and wisdom, which allowed him, the Cuban leader said, to remain firm but at the same time flexible to reach "this political miracle," which I view as a very great victory for the people of South Africa, the world, and the progressive forces. The Cuban leader has been in Bridgetown, the capital of Barbados, since 4 May. He went there to participate in the high-level sessions of the first World Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island States, which concluded yesterday. When asked about conditions for normalizing relations between Cuba and the United States, first, Castro cited the end of the economic blockade Washington has imposed on Cuba for more than 30 years, a blockade he characterized as hard, unjust, and cruel. Second, the Cuban leader also believes it is necessary for the White House to understand Cuba is an independent and sovereign country. Third, the Cuban people's right to have the political, economic, and social system they consider best must be respected. Saying it is not Cuba who is besieging another country and that Cuba does not want to change the social system or install socialism in the neighboring nation to the north, Castro affirmed: "We have nothing against the United States." The Cuban president praised the recently concluded conference in Barbados. In his opinion, it made politicians and industrialized countries aware of the need to prevent the degradation of the environment.
