The Community delegation is led by Mr. Benavides (DG I, External Relations) and the Russian delegation is led by Mr. Ivanov (Vice-President of the Russian Agency for International Cooperation). After a month and a half of reduced activities for reasons both political (government reshuffling in Russia after the December elections, time for reflection by the Twelve on the results of the talks obtained at the time of President Yeltsin's visit to Brussels on 9 December) and substantive (compromise solutions for the outstanding problems were to be examined by both sides), on Wednesday and Thursday the EC and Russian negotiators are essentially examining the three principal outstanding problems, namely: - The nuclear sector, especially rules and provisions governing trade in enriched uranium between the EC and Russia; - The opening of the Russian banking sector to foreign banks. Russia insists on transitional limited access to its financial market, but apparently could be satisfied with a sort of "voluntary limitation" by the EC; - Maritime transport.
