Addressing a session of the National Committee for the Promotion of Italian Culture Abroad at the Foreign Ministry, he said the new policy would strive to give greater stress to interactions between science, technology, economics, political science and culture. According to Martino, in this perspective, the promotion of culture would be an important factor in lending credibility to Italian activity on the international stage. He also said this would mean giving the Foreign Ministry the appropriate tools and means for achieving the target in which he said he expects the committee to produce concrete and appropriate proposals in the very near future.
