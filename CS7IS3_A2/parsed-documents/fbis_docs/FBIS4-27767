FBIS4-27767 "dreas108_l_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-108 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 Philippines Government To Support UN Sanctions Government To Support UN Sanctions BK0606051694 Quezon City Radio Filipinas in English 0230 GMT 6 Jun 94 BK0606051694 Quezon City Radio Filipinas English BFN [Text] President Fidel Ramos strongly indicated on Sunday the Philippine Government will support the initiative of U.S. President Bill Clinton to seek United Nations economic sanctions against North Korea to force it to allow inspections of its clandestine nuclear program. In a statement released by Malacanang [presidential office], Mr. Ramos said Manila may have to reverse its position on the Korean nuclear standoff as a result of the inability of international inspectors to gain access to Pyongyang's suspect nuclear site. Under a Cabinet Cluster E position approved by Ramos last February, the government said it must not support at this time the imposition of economic sanctions against Democratic People's Republic of Korea since it would only provoke Pyongyang to resort to military confrontation. The president said the Philippine Government may have to review its position on the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula. Such a review may be rendered necessary by the announcement of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] on 2 June of the inability of its inspectors to determine whether there has been any diversion of fuel from North Korea's five MWA experimental nuclear power reactors. The government's announcement of a review of its position on the nuclear standoff in the Korean peninsula indicates a possible reversal of its diplomatic agenda and may even mean support for the Clinton administration's confrontational stance in dealing with the reclusive North Korean military regime. With the IAEA's latest failure to gain access to Pyongyang's nuclear sites, particularly its top secret plant in Yongbyon, members of the UN Security Council lead by the United States and France are pressing for the imposition of sanctions with North Korea. According to President Ramos, it is in the light of this new situation the Philippines state in the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and its responsibility as a member of the IAEA board of governors that we are now undertaking a serious review of our policy of this matter. Earlier, the U.S. Defense Department gave North Korea till this month to comply with international nuclear inspections, an ultimatum that is likely to result in a possible military confrontation in the Korean peninsula. Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo has expressed fears that the eruption of military hostilities in the divided Korean peninsula would deal a serious blow to Asia-Pacific economies, particularly the Philippines which is gearing for economic takeoff.
