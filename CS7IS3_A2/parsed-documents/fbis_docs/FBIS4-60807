According to information from competent sources, this visit is an unplanned one and its purpose is to clarify two issues: The postponement of the date of the visit by Shim'on Peres, Israel's foreign affairs minister, which had been planned for 4-5 May, and clarification of the situation with the Jewish "Sochnut" agency. This agency was set up in 1929 as the executive body of the World Zionist Organization, which represents Jews of the land of Israel at talks with the British authorities, foreign governments, and international organizations. Today, this is the main link uniting Israel with Jews of the diaspora. In Ukraine, "Sochnut" implements several educational programs, in accordance with which children from our state have the opportunity to study directly in Israel. Because several students expressed a wish not to return home, Ukraine's Ministry of Justice issued a note of protest. "The idea of the Israeli state is based on the repatriation of Jews from the diaspora, Tzvi Magen, Israel's ambassador to Ukraine, reported. We cannot refuse a single person of Jewish descent citizenship of our country. At the same time, Ukrainian legislation envisages the freedom to choose one's place of residence for each person. There are no problems with Sochnut. There are nuances there." By nuances Israeli diplomacy understands the uncoordinated legislation of both states in certain issues, particularly educational ones. Apropos of this, Vasyl Onopenko, Ukraine's minister of justice, met a group of Israeli lawyers today, headed by Hayim Klugman, director general of Israel's Justice Ministry. Tzvi Magen and Yuriy Shcherbak also met today. Israel's ambassador to Ukraine reported that the visit by Shim'on Peres, Israel's minister of foreign affairs, which interalia was to have resolved the "Sochnut" situation, had been postponed to approximately the middle of June. "This does not signify misunderstandings between Ukraine and Israel, but is only a result of the excessively speedy signing of peace with the Palestinians, which cannot take place without the minister of foreign affairs." According to information from Tzvi Magen, a visit to Ukraine by Yitzhaq Rabin, Israel's prime minister, who visited Moscow a week ago, is also planned for the summer.
