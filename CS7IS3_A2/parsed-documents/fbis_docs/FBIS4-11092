Upon his arrival he made exclusive statements for this newscast. His tour through Uruguay, Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay allowed him to make the reality of our country known to those countries and opened new channels of communication in Cuba's relations with other Latin American countries. [Begin Robaina recording] I believe that being able to talk about Cuba's truth and being able to learn of the continent's reality represents a lot. For me there is no greater satisfaction than having been able to transmit, and sometimes I fear not having been able to do so with enough intent, the respect, authority, and love that is generated by the way that the Cuban people not only resist, but by the way they resist, live, work, walk, and triumph. [end recording] Besides meeting with high-ranking officials, party leaders, and friends of Cuba, Robaina's visit awakened great interest among the business community of those countries. [Begin Robaina recording, in progress] ...the large number of businessmen with whom I met, and the doubts that may arise from the debt were not the main issue in these business meetings. These doubts would arise from within determined structures of the government that wanted to make the issue of the debts the center of their negotiations, but the great majority of businessmen asked about the possibility of investments. They asked about judicial guarantees. They asked about constitutional, and financial guarantees and about the different line of goods. To all this, Cuba has much more than answers. I believe that this... [pauses] First of all, they know that Cuba is a market, that there are possibilities, and they know that it is a country that, like very few in the world, has an established infrastructure with an unprecedented level in education, science, and technology. [end recording] Regarding "The Nation and the Emigre Community" conference which will begin on 22 April, in Havana city, Robaina stated: [Begin Robaina recording] In the extent that the reality of that community abroad begins to express itself in a different way, and the reality of the nation begins to change, we take steps which are derived from a new situation. A new situation which I insist demonstrates the audacity of our project and of the country that summons the meeting because we continue having abnormal conditions as in the past. I believe that under abnormal conditions one cannot ask that relations with the emigre community be normal. Once again Cuba is putting itself above all those abnormal situations and is capable of finding a solution and a topic for these times. I believe this is what brings us to this conference. For me the most important thing remains the path that is being opened and the way in which in a responsible and civilized manner, and, above all, with much comprehension and mutual respect, we will be able to discuss common issues from this point on.
