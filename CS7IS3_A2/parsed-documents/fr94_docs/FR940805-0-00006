FR940805-0-00006 FR940805-0-00003 Food Safety and Inspection Service 9 CFR Part 317 [Docket No. 94&hyph;024N] Nutrition Labeling of Ground Beef and Hamburger: Extension of Compliance Date AGENCY: Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice of extension of compliance date. SUMMARY: The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is announcing an extension of the date for enforcing compliance with its nutrition labeling regulations for ground beef and hamburger. The compliance enforcement date for the nutrition labeling regulations published on January 6, 1993, is August 8, 1994. FSIS is issuing this notice to clarify its policy on the enforcement of nutrition labeling of ground beef and hamburger pending publication of a final regulation concerning percentage labeling for lean and fat on ground beef and hamburger. DATES: The compliance enforcement date is extended indefinitely until further notice. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles Edwards, Director, Product Assessment Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, (202) 254&hyph;2565. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 24, 1994, FSIS issued a proposed rule (59 FR 26916) with a shortened 45-day comment period to permit percentage labeling on lean and fat on ground beef and hamburger. On July 5, 1994, FSIS announced that it was granting a request filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest to extend the comment period of the proposed rule for an additional 45 days until August 22, 1994 (59 FR 34396). Extending the comment period will allow additional survey data to be collected and submitted to FSIS concerning consumer perceptions of terms such as ``percent lean,'' ``lean,'' and ``reduced fat.'' As a result of the extension, the comment period of the proposed rule on labeling of ground beef and hamburger now extends beyond the nutrition labeling compliance date of August 8, 1994. On June 16, 1994, FSIS announced that although the effective date of the nutrition labeling regulations was July 6, 1994, the Agency would not take enforcement action on meat and poultry products until August 8, 1994 (59 FR 30875). FSIS has received several requests to clarify its enforcement posture for nutrition labeling policies for ground beef and hamburger pending the completion of the rulemaking process. Many of those requesting clarification contend that extending the comment period on the proposed rule caused confusion regarding FSIS' enforcement posture for nutrition labeling of ground beef and hamburger. After carefully considering the issue, FSIS has decided to extend the effective date for enforcing compliance with the nutrition labeling regulations for ground beef and hamburger until evaluation of comments received on the May 24 proposed rule is completed, and a final rule is issued. FSIS believes such action is reasonable and practical because the Agency extended the comment period on the proposed rule (59 FR 34396) in order to collect information about consumer understanding of nutrition labeling terms on these products. Extending enforcement action on nutrition labeling of ground beef and hamburger should avoid the situation of having three potentially different labeling schemes for ground beef and hamburger products within several months, and will prevent a lapse of information that consumers might expect or want on ground beef and hamburger packages. The extension will also allow manufacturers and retailers to use existing label inventories during this interim period. FSIS will publish a final rule on ground beef and hamburger labeling in the Federal Register after it analyzes the public comments and consumer survey results received in response to the proposed rule. Done at Washington, DC, on: August 2, 1994. William J. Hudnall, Acting Administrator, Food Safety and Inspection Service.
