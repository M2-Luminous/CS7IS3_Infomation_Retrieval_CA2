Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] officials have started sounding out automobile companies about whether such a proposal would be acceptable. The MITI does not consider this to be a numerical target. It will also ask the U.S. auto industry to present export plans to break the deadlock in the framework talks. However, some Japanese automakers have already indicated opposition to this idea, believing that it will, in fact, amount to a numerical target. When former President George Bush visited Japan in January 1992, Japanese automakers had formulated their voluntary plan to import $19 billion worth of U.S.-made auto parts in fiscal year 1994. Because this purchase plan was eventually incorporated into the action program announced by the Japanese and U.S. Governments, the United States regards the purchase plan as an "official commitment of the Japanese Government" and demands it be fulfilled. It is also asking for an extension of the purchase plan in the framework talks. The most likely proposal being considered for the new purchase plans asks each automaker to issue a yearly plan stating not only the procurement volume but also specific items to be purchased -- for instance, electrical equipment. The Japanese companies will provide this information to the U.S. automobile industry voluntarily. The agreement to be reached at the framework talks on this will not include the amount of money involved in these purchase plans, on the premise that the governments of both countries are not directly involved. It is believed that this way, MITI will be able to argue that it is not a numerical target. The framework talks have been stalled on the issue of the objective criteria to gauge the participation of foreign companies in the market. The Japanese Government has insisted that it is opposed to criteria involving numerical targets, such as amounts of money and future market shares. MITI would like to urge the U.S. Government to compromise by proposing this plan for automobile companies to present their parts purchase plans voluntarily, and to avoid making the proposed objective criteria -- such as the number of imported finished cars and the number of dealers of imported cars -- numerical targets. On the other hand, it will also ask the U.S. automobile industry to present export plans itemizing products that they can export to Japan.
