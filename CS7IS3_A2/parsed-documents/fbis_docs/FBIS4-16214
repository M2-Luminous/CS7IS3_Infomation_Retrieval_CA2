These documents provide that all credit and monetary policy in the common Russian-Belarusian zone will be determined by one body -- the Central Bank of Russia. This provision comes into conflict with the Belarusian Constitution, which entrusts the Belarusian National Bank with all functions of determining credit and monetary policy on Belarusian territory. This was pointed out by Belarusian National Bank Chairman Stanislaw Bahdankevich, who signed [as received] the mentioned treaty with appropriate remarks. In addition to him, the treaty was signed by Russian Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, as well as Prime Ministers Vyacheslaw Kebich and Viktor Chernomyrdin. According to V. Kebich, it is necessary to introduce appropriate amendments to the Belarusian Constitution and other legislative acts to make the final step toward unification. He believes that this can be done by means of a referendum. Most probably, this referendum can be held along with Belarusian presidential elections on 23 June. Under the provisions of the Moscow documents, the unification of monetary systems will proceed in two stages. In particular, from 1 May 1994, trade customs duties will be lifted, the transit of Russian shipments through Belarus will be free of charge, and Russia will lease Belarusian facilities, which are occupied by Russian strategic forces, free of charge. The second stage -- the actual exchange of Belarusian National Bank tenders for Russian rubles -- should be preceded by the Belarusian people expressing their political will regarding the unification of the two monetary systems. A one-to-one exchange rate will implemented with respect to every person for a sum not to exceed 200,000 Belarusian rubles in cash and 1 million Belarusian rubles in bank deposits and deposit certificates as of 1 April 1994. Belarusian rubles over the mentioned sum will be exchanged according to a rate determined by the national committees of statistics comparing baskets of consumer goods, as well as according to the cross-rate in dollars. With regard to legal entities, their assets and liabilities will be exchanged according to the cross-rate, as well. Beginning from the time of the actual unification of the monetary systems of Belarus and Russia, trade between both countries will be implemented with the use of the mechanism for regulating prices, which is being used on the internal market. As of 1 July, Belarus will begin receiving credits valued at 200 billion Russian rubles. The bilateral agreements, which were signed at the same time, are an integral part of the treaty on monetary unification. They include an agreement on a single mechanism for controlling budget systems; an agreement on trade and economic relations in the first stage of monetary unification; and protocols on the introduction of single procedures and tariff regulations in trade, on a system of free trade without confiscations and restrictions, and on the conditions and procedures for using temporary restrictions in mutual trade. An agreement on certain conditions for maintaining military units and formations on Belarusian territory was also signed. "We removed many obstacles which curbed relations between our countries," Viktor Chernomyrdin told journalists after the signing ceremony. The Russian prime minister emphasized that it is the first time two states within the CIS economic union have achieved such a close level of cooperation.
