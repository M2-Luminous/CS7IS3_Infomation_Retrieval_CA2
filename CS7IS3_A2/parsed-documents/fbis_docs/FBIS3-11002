He emphasized that he does not have any evidence but only a report from a "respectable" person. Nevertheless, Amorim believes there actually exists money illegally entering Brazil to finance politicians. Reportedly, the financing mainly comes from Italy, but also from France, Germany, and even Poland. He noted that he is not aware of the party that reportedly benefited from this financing. If I were aware, Amorim said, "I would not have to ask the Italian courts for help." On 8 March, Amorim hinted he actually was aware of the party involved. He said: "It is a party that might gain power in October." The judge denied that he had stressed that the money came from Mafia criminal activities or from drug trafficking activities. In remarks to Brazilian journalists at the Vitorio Mele attorney general's hall in Rome, Amorim on 10 March said: "I never said that." [passage omitted]
