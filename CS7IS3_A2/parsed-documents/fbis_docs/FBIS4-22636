Why is the crisis worsening? The questions that many reputable economists attempt to answer most often draw quite fuzzy answers. The "Gaydar team" appears to have done everything properly at the outset: It liberated the economy from the Gosplan [State Planning Committee] and the Gossnab [State Committee for Material and Technical Supply] and other legacies of the old system, decontrolled prices, and put production under the power of the "invisible hand" of the market. However, we have somehow gotten stuck at the accomplishments of summer 1992.... This is fraught with consequences! As is known, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy has his own view of what is happening, his own predictions for the future, and also his own program for overcoming the crisis. Grigoriy Alekseyevich believes that the main point is for us not to break under the burden of debt. [Yavlinskiy] At present, the economy of the country is under pressure from a powerful spring of inflation which was compressed precisely by the Gaydar government. Total debts for last year by virtue of state procurement and settlements with sectors receiving money from the budget now comes to about 5 percent of the gross national product. In the fourth quarter alone, the growth of credit outlays came to 75 percent of growth during all of 1993. It comes to approximately 15 trillion rubles [R]. All this is a consequence of decisions made previously. [Vishnevskaya] However, public opinion is that the "fathers of reform" have left the government, and the latter is now rolling back slowly but surely. Preferences for the military-industrial complex and subsidies for agriculture have already been promised.... Could it be that the past two years have been in vain? [Yavlinskiy] That the new government could lead Russia back is not the trouble. There is no way back anymore. However, not only does the new government lack a program, it also hardly has any idea of the situation that is beginning to emerge this year. It is this situation that conceals the danger! The danger is that, with its vision of reforms, the new government may embark on a path of extensively handing out easy credit and subsidies from the budget. Trillions of rubles have already been promised to various sectors. To be sure, it has not yet come to making payments; they are talking about stage-by-stage payment of the debt. However, how long will the government be able to resist powerful pressure from sectoral lobbyists and evade meeting its own obligations? The temptation to become a kind and good government is great; besides, sectoral lobbies are very strong in the government. To be sure, the latest events indicate that the government expects to stay the old course for a while longer. Under such circumstances, our analysis outlined above may end up shifted in time somewhat in the direction of delay; on the other hand, the projected crisis may turn out to be deeper.... [Vishnevskaya] So, what may lie ahead for us? Under the circumstances, what scenario for the development of events do you see for the coming year, especially because the first quarter is already coming to the end, and its preliminary results can be assessed? [Yavlinskiy] The first quarter took pressure from the credit outlays of last year and the need to pay back the debts of the budget which, in turn, were induced by a chain of nonpayments throughout the economy. This is why the spring will apparently become the first critical mark this year. A quite sharp upsurge in inflation is possible in the spring in conjunction with the infusion of money in the first quarter. The budget deficit will grow considerably. Spring will be difficult and this will, of course, provide the background for changes in the political sphere. Summer could be relatively stable, but then at a new level of the critical phenomena which I discussed. The fall, the second critical mark, gives rise to the greatest concern. At this point the risk of losing control over inflation and a slump in production is high. In the fall, inflation may exceed the 50 percent level, and it will be very hard, if not impossible, to manage. [Vishnevskaya] Why should this definitely happen in the fall? The government intends to pay the debts back to rural residents virtually right away. Besides, procurement of agricultural products by the state is far less now.... [Yavlinskiy] The volume of state procurement is large enough to cause both an aggravation of the budget deficit and an increase in effective demand. However, this is only the first alarming factor of the coming summer. An increase in energy resource prices is the second. The pressure of cost-push inflation through energy resources will be extremely serious and very extensive by this fall. [Vishnevskaya] What awaits us by the end of the year in your scenario? [Yavlinskiy] The slump in production may exceed 52 percent of the 1989 level--the last year of growth. The absence of investment will become the fundamental, root cause of the slump. [Vishnevskaya] This cause has been affecting the status of production for a long time.... [Yavlinskiy] Its effect is exacerbated by another cause, which does not appear to be new. It is the loss of markets for sales. We have lost not just Western markets. Markets in the CIS have been lost in conjunction with the cancellation of an economic treaty with the republics of the former USSR and an unwise attitude toward economic integration with them. Beginning 15 June of last year we managed to lose at an accelerated rate our own, Russian market for our industry because of the situation with the exchange rate of the dollar. As the sharp growth of prices continued, the Central Bank maintained the artificial exchange rate of the ruble against the dollar for so long that it became more advantageous to import goods rather than have them produced by domestic industry. The loss of domestic markets by the latter has virtually become an accomplished fact. Of course, we can recover these markets. However, it is now going to cost us in the form of a sharp decline in the exchange rate over a quite lengthy period of time. [Vishnevskaya] However, yet another weighty factor which induces a drop in production has appeared or rather become sharply more pronounced: Labor collectives are increasingly striving to use available funds for consumption rather than investing them in the development of production. [Yavlinskiy] This is a new problem generated as a result of the kind of privatization of large enterprises the Gaydar government accepted and conducted, and which the Chernomyrdin government is continuing. Therefore, rather than referring to a structural fall which is generally necessary, we are compelled to refer to a general slump which has advanced to such a stage that it has now become a factor in the accident rate, various production stoppages for technical reasons, and other major troubles which call for 10-fold expenditures from the budget. [Vishnevskaya] To your mind, what can be done to prevent, after all, the development of events in keeping with the quite gloomy scenario outlined here? [Yavlinskiy] Trying to keep inflation to a rate of 20 percent a month in 1994 is the foremost among many urgent tasks. To this end it is necessary, first, to bring the exchange rate of the dollar into line with the dynamics of inflation. If the dynamics of the market rate do not correspond to that projected, the government should compensate for the difference those with whom it has concluded futures transactions. Second, by no means and under no circumstances may there be a transition to a policy of easy credit and direct subsidies. Instead, I am proposing a painful measure, but the only correct one under such conditions: a reduction in the interest rate, with the volume of credit being administratively regulated. Enterprises are simply not in a position to take out loans given the current interest rate! This would be a temporary measure because in principle it is necessary to strive for an interest rate that exceeds the rate of inflation in the country. Third, the policy of preferences for exporters should be revised sharply in order to prevent the outflow of foreign exchange from the country. Of course, the tax on the difference in exchange rates, the most powerful incentive for the exportation of funds, should be canceled immediately. [Vishnevskaya] However, whether we like it or not, the problem of debt due to state procurement remains. Will this inflationary mine be rendered less dangerous if the measures you are proposing are implemented? [Yavlinskiy] The signing of contracts for the delivery of foodstuffs to the state stocks in the fall should begin right now! This would make it possible to spread all transactions and expenditures throughout the year and not accumulate the entire backlog of debt in the fall. Reductions in the volume of state procurement for current consumption should also begin without delay. It is necessary to privatize the entire procurement infrastructure, primarily the elevators, right now. These are absolutely urgent measures which would make it possible to bring inflation under control within a year if they were taken immediately. [Vishnevskaya] And if they were not? [Yavlinskiy] Then we will mark time again and endlessly complain about "the forces hindering reforms...."
