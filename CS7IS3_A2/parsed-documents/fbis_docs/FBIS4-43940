While, in Luxembourg, the Twelve's ministers were deciding to tighten the screws, Minister Antonio Guidi was in fact in Casal di Principe (Caserta province) attending a meeting organized by the CNEL [National Council for Economy and Labor] on non-Community immigration into the south. Here, in one of the areas with the highest proportion of immigrants, the minister announced his intention to deal with legal and illegal immigrants into Italy. For Guidi the problem is a general one, namely, how to safeguard the rights of immigrants "whether regular or irregular." Irregular immigrants, the minister remarked, also "generate wealth, because they work and produce an income: They must therefore have the same rights and the same duties. Immigrants from outside the Community must be safeguarded as people and, as such, considered centers of rights and duties." Guidi recalled that "organized crime is the connective tissue for the exploitation of immigrants from outside the Community." This situation had to be considered more closely and seen as part of "the broader problem area of safeguarding immigrants' rights." According to the minister, priority measures must include providing health care for all immigrants, although he warned against demagogy: "I want to implement a gradual policy, but one which will mark a turn for the better. This is a serious problem, and we cannot perform miracles." In Caserta province, up to 20,000 foreign workers throng to take part in the fruit and tomato harvest every summer. Guidi stated that his own presence in the area indicated the government's "concern and commitment." Initially, the minister will propose setting up a "working group" with regional and local government representatives "in order to verify how the funds earmarked for aid and counseling centers were used throughout the country."
