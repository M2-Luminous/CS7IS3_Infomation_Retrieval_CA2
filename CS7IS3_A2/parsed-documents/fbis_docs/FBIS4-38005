Where have these contacts reached and what is the agenda of negotiations? [Al-Tarifi] The Cairo agreement is not a detailed agreement. There are economic, security, civil, and other committees which are following up the implementation of this agreement. Palestinian-Israeli contacts and non-negotiating sessions are being held, but they all revolve around the appropriate method to implement the agreement in the best possible way. According to the Oslo agreement, the phase of negotiations on early jurisdictions and redeployment of the Israeli Army should commence immediately after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord. This redeployment should be outside the residential areas--cities, villages, and camps. Regarding the early negotiations, intensive contacts are underway to resume negotiations as soon as possible. I think negotiations can begin within two weeks on early jurisdictions, which include five areas. These are tourism, social affairs, education, health, and direct taxes. However, following the Hebron massacre and the Cairo agreement, it has become clear that in addition to the five early jurisdictions there should be agreement on other jurisdictions. This is what we are are going to do within the next few days, God willing. ['Abid] In the light of Hebron incidents, is there a new negotiating agenda? [Al-Tarifi] The early jurisdictions were five, in addition to what the two sides may agree on. However, it emerged after the Hebron incidents that there should be more jurisdictions and we should agree to the nature of these additional jurisdictions. This is what we will negotiate very soon. ['Abid] How do you evaluate the start of the formation of the Palestinian authority and the performance of the national security forces in Gaza and Jericho? [Al-Tarifi] I can say that every Palestinian and Arab takes pride in the performance of the Palestinian forces. In spite of the shortage of available means, these forces performed splendidly and the Palestinian people embraced them right from the beginning. We were afraid that the people's zeal over the return of the Palestinian security forces would soon abate, but now that the Palestinian celebrations marking their return are over, the citizens continue to be satisfied with their good performance. Our people under the Palestinian authority are psychologically comfortable. They are aware of the difference between occupation and the new situation. There are no more curfews, freedom restrictions, arrests, or storming of houses. ['Abid] Some speak of Israeli violations of the Cairo agreement. The latest was made by Dr. Sha'th. What is your comment? [Al-Tarifi] The agreement exists and certainly there will be some violations from both sides. There are Israeli violations and there may be violations on our side. What is important is to resolve differences through the coordination committee without leaving any traces on which any future misunderstanding might be built and eventually affect the agreement. ['Abid] What about the Jericho crossing point? The agreement was signed more than one and a half months ago, but the situation at the crossing points is still the same. [Al-Tarifi] It is known that independent Palestinian offices with a Palestinian flag will be established at the Jericho and Rafah crossing points. These offices will house a director, an administrative and security deputy, and Palestinian policemen. There will also be Israeli offices. I believe the relevant arrangements will be finalized within a week or 10 days at most, after which Palestinian policemen will arrive at the Rafah crossing point. As for the King Husayn Bridge, the arrangements will be discussed during a meeting between President 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin in the near future. ['Abid] Why do you think President 'Arafat's arrival in the self-rule area has been postponed? [Al-Tarifi] To begin with, we want the president to arrive in this area as soon as possible, so the sooner he arrives the better. However, I have this to say: Any Palestinian official who tells the media that the president will arrive in one or two weeks, and also any Palestinian official arriving in the territories claiming that he will prepare for the president's arrival is not telling the truth. 'Arafat has never announced that he would arrive after a certain period of time or that he would postpone such an arrival. As far as I know, President 'Arafat will arrive in the near future. We in the territories need his early arrival, and I believe that 'Arafat understands the situation well. No doubt, arranging the Palestinian people's situation is very important, particularly with regard to the institutions, the cadres' entry, and the securing of financial aid to the Palestinian forces, institutions, and authority. President 'Arafat is working for these objectives day and night. ['Abid] You are leaving for Tunis. Are you carrying Palestinian or Israeli ideas or messages to the Palestinian leadership on the coming negotiations? [Al-Tarifi] I am going to Tunis, and I shall be discussing many issues with President 'Arafat. In fact, we are in daily contact with 'Arafat to brief him on the situation in the territories. However, some issues are difficult to discuss on the telephone, so they should be discussed face to face. These issues are related to the coming negotiations, specifically the early jurisdictions, the overall situation in the territories, and the Palestinian authority. I would like to say that I am not carrying Israeli ideas. As head of the Civil Coordination Committee, I meet with Israeli officials several times a week to follow up on implementing the civil aspects of the Cairo agreement and also on future negotiations. However, there is no Israeli concept apart from the one expressed as part of both the overall peace process and the issues proposed for discussions. ['Abid] Frankly speaking, what is your comment on the recent developments in the negotiations on the Jordanian-Israeli track? [Al-Tarifi] In fact, we welcome the Jordanian step, and we believe that it complements the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. This confirms that we did not sign a separate agreement with Israel and that we support completing the peace process on other Arab tracks. It was clear, however, that the Palestinian side did not let anyone decide its own destiny. The Palestinian people have a leadership that coordinates with all Arab parties . It is true that the Oslo agreement was not publicized because the talks were held in secret, but all Arab parties were fully briefed on the Cairo negotiations. I would like to emphasize that our relationship with Jordan is an integral one, and that we are one people. Consequently, we believe that the Jordanian approach is correct, and we hope it will bear fruit soon. As Palestinians, we are interested in joining the Arab ranks and we do not want to rush westward. We, however, want to go westward along with our brothers in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt after reaching an understanding on agreed issues. ['Abid] What is your comment on the remarks made by His Highness Crown Prince Hasan the Regent regarding the establishment of a federal state [dawlah ittihadiyah] east of Israel on the two banks of the River Jordan? [Al-Tarifi] This is a purely Jordanian matter, into which we will not poke our noses. For His Royal Highness Prince Hasan has the right to choose the name he likes for his country. The name the United Hashemite Kingdom is fine with us if the Jordanian people and leadership endorse this. As for us, the successive sessions of the Palestine National Council [PNC] have endorsed confederation between the two banks of the River Jordan. A confederation is based on two separate political entities that complement one another. [passage omitted] ['Abid] Some believe that there has been a delay in the return of the PLO cadres, particularly civilian cadres, to Gaza and Jericho, and that the promises made to the Palestinians have not been kept. In your opinion, what is behind all this? [Al-Tarifi] There are attempts to brand the Palestinian authority as impotent, to say that it will remain so, and that it will fail. Well, we are not sitting at doorsteps, begging for aid. Nonetheless, we believe that Arab and foreign countries owe us certain rights, particularly since the Palestinian debacle is the outcome of Arab and international developments. I believe that some aid has been received. At the recent conference held by donor nations, it was agreed to provide the self- rule authority with $42 million, with the understanding that the aid will be resumed so that Palestinian institutions can perform their tasks. The picture is not so bleak or gloomy. But, there are many parties that seek to depict us as failures. These parties want to say that what has taken place on the Palestinian territories has been no more than ceremonial events that have come to an end. By the way, I would like to say that the Palestinian leadership has concluded a telecommunications agreements with an international firm so that we may not remain tied to the Israeli telecommunications corporation. A similar agreement has been concluded with an international electrical firm to supply the Gaza Strip with electric power so that we may not remain hostage to the Israelis. A third agreement has been signed with another firm to supply the Palestinian authority with oil from the international market. This firm has obtained a concession, and it will have huge storage tanks in Gaza. Additionally, the Palestinian authority has signed two tenders for the construction of two airports, one in Gaza and the other in Jericho. A contract has also been signed to construct a fishing port in Gaza. Another contract has been signed to build housing units in the autonomous areas. Within the next few weeks, efforts to carry out these tenders, the overall cost of which exceeds $1.5 billion, will begin. [passage omitted] ['Abid] The Cairo agreement has not thus far been endorsed by the Palestinian legislative bodies. Have any arrangements been made for the holding of a PNC session? [Al-Tarifi] I believe that the PLO Central Council, and not the PNC, may hold a session in the territories. Right now, all our efforts are focused on entrenching our presence in the territories. The Israeli authorities have approved the repatriation of most members of the PLO Central Council. So, the PLO Central Council may convene in Palestine. And consequently, it could debate the agreement.
