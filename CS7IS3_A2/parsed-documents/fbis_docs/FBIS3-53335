He stressed the need for teaching and learning the Holy Koran. In these ceremonies which lasted for more than two hours, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i described the Muslim Iranian nation's familiarity with and love for the Holy Koran as a great divine bounty. He said: Koranic studies are daily increasing among our nation. The Koran should penetrate the hearts more than ever before and should be implemented in the society. Stressing the close ties existing between the Koran and the Imamate [etrat--Shiite term referring to imams who followed the Prophet] and the need for the greater reliance of Muslim nations on these two inseparable entities, the esteemed leader of the revolution said: Today the slogan of "Koran, Islam, and the call of God" has spread among Muslim nations. If other Islamic nations and governments remain together like the Iranian nation and government and if they rely on the Holy Koran, arrogant powers cannot dominate such governments. Referring to the importance of the issue of Palestine, the esteemed leader described Palestine as a part and parcel of the Islamic homeland and a land which was the first qiblah [direction in which Muslims turn during their prayers] of the Muslims of the world. He said that the influence of the hands of arrogant powers over the Islamic governments is the main reason why the issue of Palestine has been forgotten. He added: The enemies of Islam and Muslims by exerting pressure on Islamic and Arab governments have taken them out of the arena of struggle, so much so that these governments discuss minor issues in their meetings, but the issue of Palestine which is among the most important issues of the world of Islam is forgotten.
