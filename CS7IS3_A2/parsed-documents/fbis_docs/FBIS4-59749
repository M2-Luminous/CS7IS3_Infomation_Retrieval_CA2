Muslims Worldwide DEATH OF LAWYER The 11 May issue of AL-NUR leads off with a 1,500-word editorial on page 1 by chairman al-Hamzah Di'bis commenting on the death in police custody of lawyer 'Abd-al-Haris Madani following his arrest on 26 April 1994. The editorial has the following Koranic verse as its headline: "In the Law of Equality There Is Saving of Life to You, O Ye Men of Understanding That Ye May Restrain Yourselves." This verse refers to the death penalty that Di'bis urges against "the killer of lawyer 'Abd-al-Haris Madani." The editorial extols the lawyer's profession as "defending righteousness and righteous people and jihad against injustice and unjust people" and defends the integrity of Egyptian lawyers. It goes on to mention the Egyptian Human Rights Committee's suspicions that Madani was tortured while in custody, despite official denials. Di'bis praises the late President Anwar al-Sadat for ordering a stop to all torture and regrets the return of this practice after his death. He urges President Husni Mubarak to issue a similar order and reminds him that torture is contrary to human rights principles and the teachings of Islam. He then calls for the resignation or dismissal of Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's government because of the incident. DISH ANTENNAS The second major item on page 1 is a four-column report by "AL-NUR's artistic editor" extolling the Saudi Arabian Government's decision to ban the private use of satellite dish antennas in order to avert the danger that foreign broadcasts pose to that Islamic nation. The writer exhorts Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi to follow suit but sees little chance that he will do so. He praises Damietta Governor Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahim for banning satellite dishes in his Governorate and blames AKHBAR AL-YAWM's chairman and chief editor Ibrahim Sa'dah for criticizing the governor's move. The report criticizes the secular magazine ROSE AL-YUSUF for accusing Saudi Arabia of buying off Egyptian journalists. A 200-word box on page 3 carries the Saudi mufti's fatwa banning dish antennas. FATWAS, VEIL CONTROVERSIES A 300-word item on page 1 reports on an ongoing lawsuit between Egypt's mufti Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi on one side and two al-Azhar academics and AL-NUR's chief editor 'Ali Faruq on the other. The mufti is accusing Faruq, Professor Shaban Muhammad Isma'il, head of al-Azhar's Shari'ah Department, and Dr. 'Ali al-Salus, professor of Jurisprudence at Qatar University, of slandering him in articles commenting on his fatwas on banking transactions, the importation of alcoholic beverages for non-Muslims, and opening gambling houses for tourists. The court action continues. Another 300-word report on page 1 says that the State Council's Administrative Judicial Court has ruled in favor of school and university female students who wish to wear the veil, contingent on their submission to identity checks by female security personnel. A shorter one-column report next to this article indicates that the Education Ministry has ordered all school students to wear the school uniform and remove the veil. The report says some female students are not complying and are not going to school. AL-AZHAR SCHOOLS A 3,500-word report by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hadi on page 3 discusses the plight of elementary and secondary students in al-Azhar institutions -- schools controlled by al-Azhar and leading to higher education at al-Azhar University. Various al-Azhar academics and administrators say the students' heavy workload, involving religious studies and learning the Koran by heart in addition to the secular curricula set by the Education Ministry, causes high rates of failure and produces students who do not know good Arabic. Some educators and administrators say that learning the Koran by heart should be left to secondary school and university students but AL-NUR disputes this and says it is easier for young children to learn the entire Koran. The paper urges further state assistance to al-Azhar institutions to help overcome the problem. BAN ON AUTHOR'S WRITINGS URGED On page 3, 'Abd-al-Rasul al-Zaqqani reviews a book entitled "A Critique of Dr. Nasr Hamid Abu-Zayd's Aspersions." The book, penned by Professor Isma'il Salim, includes contributions by several Al- Azhar academics, who dispute Nasr Abu-Zayd's views on the text of the Koran. They call for banning the two books in which Abu-Zayd expounds his view that the Koran was a product of its era's culture and calls for liberating Muslim minds from slavery to religious texts. They say the two books should be withdrawn from circulation to Cairo University students. One essay included in "A Critique of Dr. Nasr Hamid Abu-Zayd's Aspersions" is written by Dr. Mahmud Mazru'ah, former dean of al- Minufiyah's School of Religious Disciplines and the Islamic Call; Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Hawwas, assistant professor of comparative jurisprudence at al-Azhar University; and two other Islamic academics. The essay declares that the authors are not accusing Abu-Zayd of apostasy but are urging him to reconsider his "dangerous excesses" and "correct his errors." AL-AZHAR ROLE IN LICENSING ARTISTIC PRODUCTIONS On page 6 AL-NUR carries the 4,500-word "text" of the fatwa issued by the General Assembly of the State Council's Fatwa and Legislation Department pertaining to the issue of whether the Culture Ministry or al-Azhar has authority to license or ban artistic audiovisual material. The fatwa, dated 10 February 1994, is in the form of a letter to the al-Azhar shaykh and is a response to an inquiry he sent to the above department on 10 July 1993. After outlining the pertinent constitutional provisions and laws issued over the years in Egypt in connection with the dissemination of the material in question, the fatwa concludes that the Culture Ministry is the body authorized to license or ban artistic audiovisual material when no question of Islamic content arises. It notes, however, that when the material to be disseminated has an Islamic aspect, al-Azhar has a "binding opinion on the Culture Ministry" in connection with issuing or withholding a license for such artistic audiovisual material. OPINION ON TERRORISM In the opinion section on page 5, a 600-word article by Hasan Mukhtar Baghdadi, a pharmacist, says Israeli intelligence services are behind terrorist acts in Egypt. They choose as perpetrators of these acts people with weak characters and no jobs. To fight unemployment, he urges the government to collect an alms tax, confiscate the wealth of "drug traffickers, low-quality art merchants, bribe takers, and thieves," and encourage the investment of Egyptian capital inside the country by offering tax breaks. ISLAMIC COUNCIL OFFICIAL DISCUSSES MUSLIM ILLS In a 2,000-word interview on page 4, Kamil al-Sharif, a Jordanian national who is secretary general of the International Islamic Council for Call and Relief, ascribes the current ills of the Muslim world, including backwardness in comparison with other countries, to the lack of Ijtihad in modern times--that is, drawing up codes of conduct based on Islamic precedent or analogies with Koranic and Sunnah teachings. He says Ijtihad was interrupted by centuries of foreign rule and as a result modern Muslims are now divided over many issues and do not have "a unified understanding or unified view of modern Islam". He blames traditions for attributing a lesser role to women than Islamic shari'ah actually gives them and calls for distinguishing between shari'ah itself and mere traditions. He says many reformers are cautious about addressing this point to avoid accusations and suspicion because "there is also intellectual terrorism, even among Islamic groups." He warns that "erroneous applications" of Koranic or Sunnah texts leads to "ignorance, chaos, and fanaticism." Al-Sharif says he believes women can do any job men do except fill the highest posts of authority. Referring to the important roles played by early Muslim women in war, nursing, and even Ijtihad, he supports working women and says that the best protection of their virtue comes from internal conviction. MUSLIMS WORLDWIDE AL-NUR publishes on page 2 a 2,000-word interview with the mufti of Singapore's Muslim minority. He notes the absence of religious persecution in that secular country and speaks of the Muslim community's efforts to upgrade the education of its children, improve its economic conditions, and build more houses of worship. A 1,000-word report on page 2 is entitled "The Hardships of Muslims in India". It speaks briefly of "the Muslims' persecution by Hindus" who attempt to "exterminate or assimilate Kashmir's Muslims." The rest of the report speaks disapprovingly of various other religious beliefs and practices in India.
