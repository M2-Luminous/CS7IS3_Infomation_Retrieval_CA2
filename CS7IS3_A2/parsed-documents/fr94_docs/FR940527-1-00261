FR940527-1-00261 FR940527-1-00014 Medicare payments to nursing facilities are adjusted by the hospital wage index to reflect geographic differences in labor costs. Yet the geographic differentials in the cost of labor for hospital employees differ from those for employees of nursing facilities. This may be because there are state variations in regulations affecting staffing of nursing facilities that differ from those of hospitals. Further, through their Medicaid programs and certification and oversight roles, states have a major impact on the costs and structure of nursing facilities. Some of this variation is being reduced through provisions in OBRA 1987 that mandated stepped-up Federal oversight of nursing facilities. Another potential reason why the geographic differentials in hospital wages do not adequately reflect variation in nursing facility wages may be skill mix differences. Compared with hospitals, nursing facilities employ more aides. The relative differences in the salaries of aides and nurses may not be the same across geographic areas. These differences in the employee mix and relative wages are not reflected by the hospital wage index. An accurate wage index is necessary to account for geographic differences in wages. As with the hospital wage index, the method used to collect wage and hour data for nursing facilities should be prospective. Further, the Commission suggests the Secretary phase in the use of the nursing facility wage index to allow facilities to adjust. ProPAC recognizes that collecting nursing facility wage data and developing an index may take several years. The Commission investigated an interim approach of separate cost limits for each Census division to account for geographic cost differences. (See Appendix A for a more complete discussion.) This technique substantially changed the distribution of payments compared with the way payments were allocated under the current hospital wage index or a simulated nursing facility wage index. It inappropriately adjusted for cost variation caused by differences in state Medicaid payment policies and rates and other state certification requirements. The Commission thus rejects the interim measure, recommending instead that efforts focus on the development of a nursing facility wage index. Recommendation 18: Improving Outlier Payment Policy The Commission believes the outlier payment provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 will improve the current policy for identifying outlier cases and determining outlier payments under PPS. However, the following changes also should be implemented for fiscal year 1995: •The estimated cost of the case and the outlier payment amount should no longer be adjusted to reflect the hospital's indirect medical education and disproportionate share status. •The marginal cost factor for cost outliers should be increased to 80 percent. •These changes would further increase the effectiveness of outlier payment in protecting against the risk of large losses on some cases. They would also improve the distribution of outlier payments across hospitals, including hospitals that receive a large number of transfer cases. The DRGs used to determine PPS payment are designed to group cases with similar resource requirements. The hospital's payment for each case is based on the nationwide average cost of patients in the DRG. The hospital is at risk for the difference between the cost of the case and the payment it receives. However, costs for individual cases in any DRG may vary widely, due to patient-specific or treatment-specific factors that are not incorporated in the current classification system. Even an efficient hospital, therefore, may have some cases with much higher than average resource requirements. These cases represent large financial losses to the hospitals that threat them. In general, most hospitals should be able to offset losses from more costly cases with gains from less costly ones. However, this averaging principle does not adequately protect hospitals with a small number of admissions, because they may be unable to offset the losses associated with an occasional very costly case. It also fails to protect certain hospitals that regularly care for a greater than average share of costly patients. To recognize this, additional payment is provided to hospitals for cases that are exceptionally resource intensive. Outlier payment is also intended to protect against incentives that may adversely affect certain types of patients or cases that are perceived to be associated with a greater likelihood of financial loss. Definition of Outlier Cases _Currently, hospitals receive additional payment for cases that have exceptionally long stays (day outliers) or high costs (cost outliers). Cases that qualify as both day and cost outliers are paid according to the formula that yields the highest payment. Over time, there has been increased emphasis on cost as a criterion for identifying outlier cases and determining outlier payments. The estimated proportion of outlier payments based on the day outlier formula has fallen from 85 percent in fiscal year 1984 to 32 percent in fiscal year 1994. The Commission consistently has supported the increased emphasis on cost outliers relative to day outliers because the cost criterion better identifies the cases associated with the largest losses to the hospital. In its March 1993 Report and Recommendations to the Congress, ProPAC recommended eliminating day outlier payments over a three-year period. In OBRA 1993, the Congress required that payments for day outlier cases be phased out beginning in fiscal year 1995 and ending in fiscal year 1998. As the emphasis on cost outliers grows, however, it becomes more important to measure case-level costs accurately. Because costs are not reported for individual cases, the only way to identify cost outlier cases is to adjust reported charges. The Commission intends to analyze alternative methods for estimating case-level costs, their relative accuracy, and their implications for the distribution of outlier payments. Outlier Thresholds _A case does not qualify for outlier payment unless it exceeds the day or cost outlier threshold. One problem with the current threshold is that the loss incurred before outlier payments begin is not the same for every DRG, because DRGs have different payment amounts. Further, the loss is not the same for every hospital, because the cost of each case is adjusted by the hospital's IME and DSH payment adjustments. A threshold based on a fixed loss_that is, one that is set so that the loss incurred before outlier payments begin is equivalent for every case and hospital_would be more effective in reducing the impact of large losses associated with individual cases. In its March 1993 Report and Recommendations to the Congress, the Commission recommended that the cost outlier threshold for each case at each hospital should be a fixed amount (adjusted for differences in area wages and cost of living) above the DRG payment rate for the case. In OBRA 1993, the Congress enacted this change, to begin in fiscal year 1995. Another issue is whether estimated costs and outlier payments should be adjusted to reflect the hospital's teaching and disproportionate share status. Currently, the estimated cost for each case is reduced by the hospital's IME and DSH payment adjustments. For example, a case costing $50,000 at a teaching or disproportionate share hospital is considered less costly for the purposes of outlier payment than one costing $50,000 at a non-teaching, non-disproportionate share hospital. The amount by which the estimated cost exceeds the outlier threshold (which determines the outlier payment amount) thus is smaller for the case treated at the teaching or disproportionate share hospital. The resulting outlier payment amount is then increased by the hospital's IME and DSH adjustments, but this generally is not enough to offset the loss in outlier payments resulting from the reduced cost estimate for the case. ProPAC's analysis indicates that these adjustments result in substantial underpayment for outlier cases treated by teaching and disproportionate share hospitals. The IME and DSH adjustments should apply to the base payment amount that hospitals receive for every case. Outlier payments, on the other hand, are intended to defray the loss incurred beyond some threshold in treating exceptionally expensive cases. Teaching or disproportionate share hospitals should not have to bear greater losses before outlier payments begin than do otherwise similar hospitals. Moreover, outlier payments should be based on the loss incurred on the case rather than the hospital's teaching or disproportionate share status.
