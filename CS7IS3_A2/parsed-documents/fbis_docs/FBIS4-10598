Today, as has happened several times since our independence, we find ourselves alone, undergoing a severe, pitiless, and murderous universal quarantine. We cannot help remembering that it was also like that during the first half century of the existence of a dearly won independence, because we are alone. We are duty-bound to gather the scattered pieces of a torn nation for which nothing has ever been easy and in which nobody has ever been spared. It is at such moments that the men and women of this nation have always found the sense of compromise, of realism, and of the proud vision characteristic of our will to live together. Haitian sisters, Haitian brothers, I make a point of addressing every one of you today because it is really necessary that a legitimate authority of this nation do so. This kind of dialogue is essential, especially in these difficult moments and because the ultimate resort is you. As for us, we are only your representatives. It is you who elected us. We must give you explanations, not only at the end of our respective mandates, but also and especially at this very important watershed and in view of the particularly perilous choices vis-a-vis our continuing existence as a sovereign nation. I address you today as president of the Chamber of Deputies and vice president of the National Assembly. The National Assembly constitutes the legislative power and is the joint securer of the national sovereignty. In view of the extended absences of a president of the Republic and a prime minister; in view of the endless division prevailing within the Senate, it is my duty to talk to you about the peril that today threatens our existence as a sovereign people. This peril is all the greater because our days are numbered. Between now and 9 May, the parliament must close the seventh session of the 45th Legislature and ensure the opening on 13 May of its eighth and final session. We must meet these constitutional requirements. It would be irresponsible on our part to mortgage the existence of an institution which represents today one of the last ramparts of our fragile and imperfect democracy. This peril is all the greater because the Dominican presidential elections scheduled for 15 May look tumultuous. It has become even more essential that Haitian society be governed. This peril is all the greater because new elections aimed at renewing one-third of the Senate and the totality of the deputies and communal elected representatives are due to be held within only seven months. Haitian sisters, Haitian brothers, since the beginning of the existence of our nation, we have experienced long periods of misgovernment; but for the first time, we have found ourselves -- since the resignation of Prime Minister Robert Malval, which has been accepted by the president of the Republic -- facing a complete absence of the executive. A resigning government can be in charge of dealing with day-to-day business, insofar as a date is set for its replacement. How can it deal indefinitely with day-to-day business when the higher authority from whom it comes does not seem to be overly affected by the incongruity of this situation? Governing does not consist of dealing with day-to-day business. Governing is, first and foremost and especially, foreseeing, preparing, and facing the great collective rendezvous provided for by our laws and customs and especially by our fundamental law, the Constitution. It is not just a matter of the legitimate authorities' organizing great masses to celebrate the anniversaries of our Constitution. The sole responsible attitude consists first of doing what the Constitution orders done at the proper time and place. For exactly five months, our country has had no government. The division that can be observed within the Senate, the Supreme Audit Court, and the administrative litigation cannot leave any citizen indifferent. One might say that they are autonomous entities that must be able to conduct themselves as grown-ups. But life also teaches us that no entity, no organization is safe from open conflict. It is therefore important that a supreme authority be concerned about using all powers of persuasion available to achieve an inevitable compromise. This moral and legitimate supreme authority exists. It is the president of the Republic. He has the duty to be concerned with the smooth running of all the institutions and to intervene in a noncoercive way. Should the nonfunctioning of all these fundamental institutions not interfere with the sleep of a responsible president of the Republic? Should the absence of a prime minister and of a government not interfere with the sleep of of the president of the Republic? The president of the Republic has attached a number of conditions to the choice of a prime minister. Even our mother law does not set any particular conditions. The only stipulation to the spirit and the letter of the Constitution is that following acceptance of the prime minister's resignation, the president of the Republic, in consultation with the presidents of the two chambers, must fill the governmental vacuum. It is in this spirit that the parliamentary plan, inspired from the international conference in Miami convened by President Aristide, was developed and presented to the president of the Republic. As president of the Chamber of Deputies and vice president of the National Assembly, I am assuming my right to observe that President Aristide obstinately refuses to fill this institutional vacuum. This vacuum does not prevent him from sleeping or from traveling around the world. On the other hand, it is comforting to find that some political formations, some socioprofessional organizations, groups of citizens from all social categories are becoming alarmed by the persistence of this dangerous vacuum. I am therefore taking this opportunity to pay tribute to all those who, in the face of this established fact, concerted themselves democratically to address their resolution or their petition to the legislative power. Our country needs and will increasingly need those conscious patriots who are closely following the evolution of public affairs. However, a large vision of this crisis commands us to clearly and firmly express our disagreement with some ways and means of filling this vacuum. We said it and are repeating it today: Our country committed itself, with the adoption of the 1987 Constitution, to building a state of law and institutional democracy. The permanence of the organs provided by this Constitution concerns all of us. Just because President Jean-Bertrand Aristide persists in ignoring the spirit and letter of this Constitution does not mean that we should follow him and do the same. This is why we understand the meaning and impact of the latest resolution voted by an assembly of senators gathered at the initiative of the Honorable Senator Bernard Sansaricq. We can only have reservations about the crisis resolution option implied by this resolution [as heard]. This option sweeps away with the back of its hand the obvious, unavoidable fact that the political Haitian crisis arising from circumstances has been internationalized. We must accept the fact of this internationalization. Like everything, it has both good and bad sides. In the context of the globalization of events and interdependence of nations, our job and our duty as political officials consists of doing our best to maximize the good and minimize the bad. As this political crisis has been internationalized, we have lost exclusive control and exclusive power to define the resolution options and make them effectual. We must also reckon with slowness, which is less the result of our crisis as such, than of the Department of the Interior data and policy of such and such a foreign concerned nation. Maximizing the good side means to be always ready to hold constructive dialogue with our foreign partners who bother to take honest steps to know our reality and our culture. To minimize the negative is to again refuse excessive interference and insincere gifts. We have refused and will always refuse the crumbs of humanitarian aid that France has deigned to throw at us like one throws a bone to a dog. France wishes to maintain its prestige in international politics. We can certainly understand that. But why must France -- in the absence of a true policy toward our country and our international conflict -- use our children's hunger and our youths' distress as a pawn in international politics? It is even worse: By what perverse twist can one imagine that the people of Martinique are demanding French military occupation of our country? Do those people from Martinique have enough historic memory to remember the nobility of the address of General Dessalines [Haitian national hero who proclaimed Haiti's independence on 1 January 1804] to them in 1084? We refuse and we will always refuse to believe in the good faith of the leading light of the Black Caucus, who has found nothing to propose but military occupation of our country. The Haitian nation has a long history of exchange and solidarity with black Americans. All our governments -- from Toussaint Louverture [Haitian national hero who paved the way for Dessalines] to Dessalines, and from [Jean-Pierre] Boyer [president of Haiti from 1818 to 1843] to [Fabre Nicolas] Geffrard [president of Haiti from 1859 to 1867] -- did their best to bring constant support to the struggle for emancipation of black Americans. But our governments and politicians never tried to intervene in national U.S. political space. Our country has scrupulously respected the pace of emancipation of black Americans in their own national space. Why can they not be as reserved with our internal struggles? Perhaps because they have become rich while we have remained poor. Franz Fanon [a writer from Martinique, author of the book, "Peau Noire, Masque Blanc"] was right: Those people, unfortunately, are still black skins, but with white masks. For that reason, it is necessary today to continue, with all our bona fide partners, to attempt to define as accurately as possible the outlines of a realistic plan for a solution to the political crisis arising from the present juncture, by applying the necessary wisdom and pragmatism. The Governors Island agreement constitutes a framework, a reference, and a mechanism aimed at achieving an inter-Haitian dialogue between Haiti and the international community. At the same time, within the framework of our national space, we must take into account the daily management of public affairs and the collective appointments provided by our law. I am convinced that it is possible for us to define a consensual option for the safeguard of our republican institutions. I am convinced that no Haitian citizen living in Haiti can imagine that it is through further weakening of, if not eliminating altogether, the current institutions that a democratic and consensual solution to the peril threatening us will be found. A democratic solution necessarily implies reinforcement of the state and of the institutions in charge of offering services to the population. It necessarily implies disengagement of the Haitian Armed Forces from their traditional tasks and methods. The persistence of the institutional vacuum can only worsen an atmosphere of insecurity and increase the already too great number of violations of the fundamental rights of citizens. Haitian sisters, Haitian brothers, the slowness that characterizes the search for a solution to the political crisis arising from the present juncture is crippling our country and is wearing all of us out. It has become imperative for us that we work on filling the current governmental vacuum and that we ascertain the feasibility of the coming electoral deadlines. The constraints inherent in the difficult period we are facing force us to refuse any unilateral approach. That is why, as the vice president of the National Assembly and president of the Chamber of Deputies, enjoying the support of the majority of deputies and strong with the bloc [not further identified] of the Senate, I intend, beginning this week, to start a series of consultations with all sectors of our collective life on two points: First of all, how to fill the current vacuum in the executive power, taking into account the deadlock that the parliamentary plan is facing due to the stubborn refusal of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to appoint a prime minister. Second, how to solve the upcoming problem of the expiration of the mandates of the entire Chamber of Deputies, of a third of the Senate, and of all the communal elected representatives. We will neglect nothing so all sectors of our society can be consulted. This means we will consult with the great bodies of the state as well as the employers' and union associations, the socioprofessional associations, the Episcopal Conference, the Protestants, and the various political formations. I would like -- in concluding this address -- to tell you that I continue to believe that with the complexity and incredible entanglement of our political crisis, there is no royal path for anyone. I also remain convinced that reasonable compromise solutions can be identified and applied. One might as well say that we are duty bound to move toward the definition of a political pact for the preservation of the institutional bases of Haitian democracy. I want to take this opportunity to solemnly call on you, Haitian sisters and brothers in general, and all important and unavoidable actors in our crisis, in particular. My call goes out to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. I ask him on your behalf to assume his responsibilities toward the Constitution that he swore to respect. My call goes out to Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras. I ask him to refuse to listen to the perverse songs of the sirens and to do what his duty and his word of honor as a soldier order him to do. Haitian sisters, Haitian brothers: I tell you of my admiration. I tell you the Chamber of Deputies is going to do what its duty orders it to do for you and for the well-being of our nation. Thank you.
