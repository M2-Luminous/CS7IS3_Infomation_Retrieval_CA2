Sarkisyan and M. Mamedov, Armenian and Azerbaijani defense ministers, with the mediation of their Russian colleague, General P. Grachev, and V. Kazimirov, Russian Federation Foreign Ministry special envoy, ended with a protocol on a full cease-fire in the Nagorno-Karabakh zone. Nagorno-Karabakh representative B. Saakyan also took part in the meeting; he sat separately from the state delegations, a fact which symbolizes the autonomous participation of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in the conflict. We were told by the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense that a definitive date for the cease-fire would be established later, following coordination with the political leadership of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh. According to the testimony of an officer from the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, who took part in the talks, the atmosphere was entirely amicable. Although the full text of the signed document will not be published for certain reasons, the officer made it clear that the protocol also contains more specific agreements. Which specific agreements? Ramiz Rizayev, Azerbaijani ambassador in Moscow and participant in the talks, stated in an interview with PRAVDA that the withdrawal of the Armenian troops from the occupied areas outside Nagorno-Karabakh has also been coordinated and that this is an indispensable condition of the truce. The approximate deadline -- 1 March -- was also determined, but the schedule and other details are still being discussed by the experts. The status of Nagorno-Karabakh and the fate of the enclave as a whole were not the subject of the talks and will be resolved later on during the peace process. Despite the first optimistic results of the quadripartite meeting, so far it is difficult to judge whether serious progress has been reached in untying the tight Karabakh knot. There are no clear guarantees of how the commitments that have been assumed will be observed, and when and in what form peacekeeping forces will be put into operation. B. Yeltsin and N. Nazarbayev already tried to reconcile the opponents in Zheleznovodsk in fall 1991 (and, it seemed, not without success), and there have been several hopeful agreements within the framework of the CSCE. However, in the attempt to move from words to action, each time the peace signal turned out to be false. Will today's protocol stand the test of time?
