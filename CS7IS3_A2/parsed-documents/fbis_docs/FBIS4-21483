That is what the EU Eco-audit ordinance stipulates. But it is obvious even now that many firms are being compelled to implement the eco-check. Banks, insurers and customers are applying pressure. In mid-November, last year, the presidents of the Federal Association of German Industry [BDI] and the German Industrial and Trade Association [DIHT] addressed a letter to the federal environmental minister. In their letter to ``Dear Mr. Toepfer,'' Tyll Necker and Hans Peter Stihl condemn the turnabout in government environmental policy. According to the three-page document, the private sector expects the government to seize the opportunity afforded by the eco-audit ordinance to ``refashion the relation between self-responsibility and oversight.'' The leaders of Germany's private sector would like the federation and the laender to confine themselves to their core responsibilities. The eco-commitment at summit sessions should henceforth promote environmental protection and no longer new laws and regulations. The corporate eco-check that the EC ordinance outlines in 21 articles and five appendices was vigorously opposed for years by German industry. Since then, private sector groups, gnashing their teeth, have struck up a friendship with the new instrument of Brussels' environmental policy. They have reconciled themselves to the ordinance on two grounds. Otherwise than originally stipulated, no firm is strictly obliged to take part in the audit. Besides that, the text of the ordinance is amply unspecified. It is up to the national governments to regulate what, how and by whom the detailed audit should be conducted. So that in the future the government will not get involved in regulating corporate environmental management any more than at present, in Germany the BDI and DIHT are pushing for a solution ``that is private sector-friendly and based on the principle of self-administration.'' In their conception, the Accreditation Sponsorship Society [TGA], that is entrusted, among other things, with the licensing of quality certifiers, should examine and oversee the suitability of environmental auditors. Since formal appointment of the auditors is a sovereign act, they are proposing a joint Chamber of Industry and Commerce center for it. Ultimately, according to the associations' plans, the central Chamber of Industry and Commerce [IHK] would also be responsible for registering the firms participating in the eco-audit and reporting to Brussels. Such extensively conjured self-administration goes too far for environmental minister Toepfer. He would like for the auditors to be appointed by the federal environmental department and registration of the examined business sites turned over to the laender. What seems to be a petty bureaucratic squabble at first glance is in fact of some significance. For the examining and monitoring organizations that the ordinance requires will ultimately decide how high to set the criteria for the eco-audit. Environmental protection groups like BUND [expansion not given] suspect that the ordinance will be watered down if the private sector implements its proposals. Dr. Adolf von Roepenack who is involved with the EC ordinance at the BDI, does not share such fears. The requirements for the auditors have to be ``pitched very high.'' In fact, the private sector would hurt itself if lax examinations led the eco-audit ``to degenerate into an elegant method for worming out of environmental protection,'' as Dr. Gerhard Feldhaus, head of the NAGUS [expansion not given] environmental committee at the German Industrial Standards [DIN] in Berlin, expresses it. Hence, only if the eco-audit is undertaken earnestly will the federation and the laender be prepared duly to reduce pollution. Anyone participating in the eco-audit could be relieved of the reporting obligation for it. Shorter approval times might also be conceivable. NAGUS chairman Feldhaus, however, considers bureaucratic muscle-flexing justified only once the audit has proven its worth in practice for several years. First of all, the legislative groundwork for it has to be laid. Experts from the environmental ministry and private sector associations are currently consulting on the moot issues. But even were a solution to be found in upcoming weeks, no one in the federal environmental ministry expects an ``eco-auditor and site registration bill'' can be passed in this legislative session. At most, a cabinet decision may be possible. According to the EC ordinance, however, the member countries will have to create a feasible certification system at the latest by April of next year. The new administration therefore will be under time pressure. If the Social Democratic Party [SDP] has the say-so in Bonn after the election in October, the BDI and DIHT will not be able to implement their self-administration model. Social Democratic environmental spokesman Michael Mueller gives minister Toepfer encouragement on this issue. For this reason too, something augurs that the federal environmental department will chime in with something important to say on the licensing of auditors. Many corporate consultants are annoyed by the squabble between the minister and the industrial lobby that has been simmering for months. The consultants scent a big deal. Dr. Marlies Sander of Roland Berger & Partner concedes: ``Of course we have an abiding interest in moving the issue along.'' The Munich consulting firm, one of the majors in the branch, with nearly DM300 million in annual turnover, has not yet decided if it will have itself accredited as an independent eco-auditor or confine itself to the consulting business. At the moment, Marlies Sander estimates that Roland Berger is earning ``in the single-digit millions'' with eco-consulting. In her opinion, so far only a few firms in Germany are involved in the issue of eco-management. The Brussels eco-audit could now change this. If not from conviction, then under the more or less gentle pressure of the market, many firms will participate in the examination process. By as early as next year experts are projecting several hundred firms will. Large companies like Daimler Benz are presently checking out the ecological fitness of a number of sites. If certification is possible by 1995 they will be the first to have their environmental friendliness checked by the EU. But medium-sized outfits too are well advised soon to cast a glance at EC ordinance 1836/93. Automobile suppliers, above all, will have to expect pressure on them from the manufacturers for the eco-check, according to the conclusion of an in-house study by Roland Berger. After all, vehicle manufacturers in turn will be under pressure. Eco-certificates will be required with increasing frequency from abroad in the government's award guidelines. Banks and insurance firms too will be taking an interest in the eco-risks of their clients. Dr. Hans-Juergen Advena, managing director of Cologne's Gerling Consulting can therefore well imagine that a successful eco-audit will be taken into consideration in setting premiums and awarding loans. In Advena's words: ``Ultimately, the confirmed eco-report from a neutral auditor facilitates an objective risk impression.'' For this reason too, Gerling Consulting is unwilling to exclude the fact that after a successful trial period the eco-audit will become obligatory for all businesses. On the basis of article 20 of the ordinance, in any case, the entire system will be on the test bench by 1998 at the latest. Even Dr. Klaus Heuvels of Frankfurt's Metallgesellschaft [MG], who took part last year with a lead works in a Brussels pilot audit, expects ``effectively, what is an option will become an obligation.'' On the basis of his experience at MG subsidiary BSB Recycling in Braubach the EC concept has ``fully passed the first practical test.'' What does the audit contribute to the firm? Heuvels mentions four items above all: all essential eco-data are documented, weaknesses are identified, employees are sensitized to ecological problems. Also, according to the eco-jurist, the expert examination can reduce civil and criminal legal liability risks. For Volker Brennecke who is preparing the ``eco-management'' project at the Association of German Engineers [VDI] in Duesseldorf, the eco-audit affords the firm an additional opportunity: ``The operational eco-checks should be seized by the firms as an opportunity, based on the comprehensive analysis of processes and procedures, both to avoid future pollution and also to initiate technical and organizational innovations. In this context synergistic effects are possible that will pay off in business terms.''
