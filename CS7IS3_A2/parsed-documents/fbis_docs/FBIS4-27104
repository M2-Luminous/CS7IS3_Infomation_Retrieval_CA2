FBIS4-27104 "dreas104_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 28 May 1994 North Korea Remarks by ROK Unification Minister Denounced Remarks by ROK Unification Minister Denounced SK2805114194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1058 GMT 28 May 94 SK2805114194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] issued a statement today denouncing the undisguised moves in South Korea against the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. The "unification minister" of South Korea, groundlessly vilifying the North at the "foreign affairs and unification committee of the National Assembly" on May 23, said "the North-South joint declaration on denuclearisation has become invalid in actuality" and declared they would "discuss the declaration from a new angle." The statement brands these remarks as an open perfidy to the North and an unpardonable anti-national criminal act making the prospect of North-South relations gloomier, saying: "They meant a unilateral nullification of 'joint declaration on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula' adopted and effectuated between the North and the South." "The arbitrary abrogation of the joint declaration vital to the nation is a very grave challenge which endangers peace in the country and the security of the nation," the statement says, and continues: "With no excuse can the South Korean authorities justify their act of abrogating the declaration, taking issue with the North. There is no justification for the South Korean authorities to slander the North over the fictitious 'nuclear issue', while keeping mum about the U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea for scores of years. "It is not fortuitous that they unilaterally scrapped the hard- won joint declaration on denuclearisation. "Truth to tell, the South Korean authorities have never been interested in the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. "At a time when the uprightness of the North's nuclear policy is being proved more clearly, the South Korean authorities openly nullified the declaration, blaming the North. Their main purpose in this is to remove the declaration which stands in the way of their nuclear arms development and openly promote it. "But the South Korean authorities must ponder over what serious impact their perfidious nullification of the declaration will have on the North-South relations in the future and what catastrophic influence their reckless attempt to promote nuclear arms development, free from the declaration, will have on the situation in the Korean peninsula and northeast Asia. "They will have to bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from their nullification of the declaration."
