Current Foreign Minister Qian Qichen may resign from the office in March next year and Luo Gan, current secretary general of the State Council, may take over the post. It is also said that Wu Jianmin, current director of the Foreign Ministry Information Department, will be transferred to the Netherlands and named Chinese ambassador to that country. Chen Jian, China's deputy representative to the United Nations, may take over Wu Jianmin's current post. The informed sources in Beijing said that Luo Gan has recently appeared on more diplomatic occasions and that this was irrelevant to his current duties as secretary general of the State Council. Therefore, it is believed that the central leadership is making preparations for transferring him to the foreign ministry. However, diplomatic circles in Beijing are doubtful about the appointment of Luo Gan as foreign minister. An official who has good knowledge about the operation of China's foreign affairs system said that Luo Gan is Premier Li Peng's right-hand man, but Luo has no foreign affairs experience. It will be difficult to convince people if he is named foreign minister. He said: At present, in the State Council, Li Peng takes charge of foreign affairs. The rumor about the transfer of Luo Gan to the Foreign Ministry may be related to Li Peng's intention to strengthen his control over the ministry. As Zhu Rongji is now in charge of economic affairs in the State Council, it is normal that Li Peng wants to designate his own right-hand man to control the Foreign Ministry. Qian Qichen, who is now rumored to resign from office, is 66 years of age. He was born in Jiading, Jiangsu (now in Shanghai). He was a second secretary at the Chinese embassy in the Soviet Union in 1955 and then in succession became director of the Education Ministry Student Affairs Section, deputy director of the Education Ministry Foreign Affairs Department, counsellor at the Chinese embassy in the Soviet Union, ambassador to Guinea and Guinea-Bissau, director of the Foreign Ministry Information Department, and vice minister of foreign affairs. In 1988, he became foreign minister and in 1991, he became state councillor and concurrently foreign minister. Inside the CPC, he was elected alternate member of the 12th CPC Central Committee and became full member of the Central Committee at the party's national conference of party delegates; at the 13th party congress, he was again elected a member of the Central Committee; and at the 14th party congress, he was elected a member of the Central Committee Political Bureau. Luo Gan, 59, was born in Jinan, Shandong. He was a research group leader in the First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry Machinery Research Institute in 1960 and then successively became deputy director of the Machinery Science Research Institute in Zhengzhou City, deputy director of the Henan Provincial Import and Export Management Commission, director of the Henan Provincial Science and Technology Commission, vice governor of Henan Province, and secretary of the Henan Provincial CPC Committee. He was then appointed minister of labor in 1988 and secretary general of the State Council in the same year. He was vice chairman and a member of the secretariat of the 10th National Federation of Trade Unions and deputy chairman of the Executive Council of the Foundry Branch of the Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society. At the 12th CPC National Congress, he was elected alternate member of the Central Committee; at the 13th and 14th party congresses, he was elected a member of the Central Committee. Wu Jianmin, 55, was born in Chongqing, Sichuan. After graduating from Number Two Middle School, Nanjing, in 1955, he studied in the French Language Department of the Beijing Foreign Languages College. In 1961, he was sent by the Communist Youth League Central Committee to Budapest as a French interpreter for the Chinese representative to the World Democratic Youth Federation. He returned to China in 1965. In his 30-year diplomatic career he worked in the UN headquarters for about 10 years and with the Chinese delegation to the United Nations on two occasions. He first worked there in the early 1970's as third secretary and second secretary and was responsible for Middle East and Southern African affairs. In 1979, Wu Jianmin was transferred to the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and took charge of European affairs and protocol affairs. Four years after that, he returned to the foreign ministry and worked with the political research group. On 21 March 1991, Wu Jianmin appeared for the first time in his capacity as spokesman at a routine foreign ministry news briefing, which was held in the Beijing International Club. Wu Jianmin's wife Shi Yanhua is currently director of the translation office in the foreign ministry. She graduated from the English Department of Beijing Foreign Languages College and was assigned to work with the foreign ministry education department translation section on graduation. Between the late 1970's and the early 1980's, Shi Yanhua was Deng Xiaoping's interpreter at almost all meetings with important U.S. officials.
