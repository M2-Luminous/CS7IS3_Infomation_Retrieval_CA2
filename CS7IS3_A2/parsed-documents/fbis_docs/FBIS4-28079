[governor] Masahide ta will urge the U.S. Government and military to reduce its bases in Okinawa during a 13-day trip to the United States starting Thursday [9 June], prefectural officials said Tuesday. Ota, who has visited the U.S. twice over the issue, is scheduled to meet commanding officers of the Hawaii-based U.S. Pacific Fleet. In Washington he will have talks with representatives for Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry as well as with members of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees. Some 75 percent of U.S. military facilities in Japan are located in Okinawa, Japan's southernmost prefecture. Ota hopes to convince Washington that a partial withdrawal from Okinawa, which would make more land available for nonmilitary purposes, will help the prefecture's economic development. On Ota's wish list are the return of the U.S. naval port in Naha, and the abolition of parachute training and live-ammunition exercises. The governor also plans to meet former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who served as the late U.S. President Richard Nixon's adviser during the negotiations for the return of U.S.-held Okinawa to Japan. Okinawa was reunited with Japan after a 27-year occupation on May 15, 1972, under the condition that U.S. forces would be allowed to continue to use Okinawan bases. Ota plans to ask Kissinger for more details about a secret document guaranteeing the reentry of U.S. nuclear weapons and transit rights in Okinawa in case of emergency. The pact was signed in 1969 by then Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and Nixon as revealed in a recently published book, the officials said.
