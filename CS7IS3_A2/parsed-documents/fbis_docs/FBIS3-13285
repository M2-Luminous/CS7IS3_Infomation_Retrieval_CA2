He said houses continue to be stormed, arrests made, and some citizens denied employment at the orders of the security organs. He added that passports are withheld and various forms of harassment are practiced, and this radically conflicts with the tenets of democracy. In a statement to AL-SABIL, he said the security organs claim to have arrest warrants from the general prosecutor, but in fact these organs have empty arrest warrant forms that do not contain the names of the people carrying out the arrest, the person who should be arrested, or even the general prosecutor. All this is taking place at a time when King Husayn expresses eagerness to maintain democracy and says democracy is an irrevocable option. Dr. 'Uwaydah recalled that King Husayn recently said, in an address to the House of Representatives, that he wants the Jordanian and Arab citizens to feel that they are human beings. Deputy 'Uwaydah asked: How can all these practices be described? Dr. 'Uwaydah witnessed the arrest and search of the house of Engineer 'Abd-al-Majid Diyyah, secretary of the Islamic Action Front's branch in Suwaylih. He said he saw with his eyes an empty arrest warrant after he asked to read Diyyah's arrest warrant. He said he saw a security man filling out the arrest warrant. Dr. 'Uwaydah said political parties and forces are not immune from the official organs' pursuit. He asked: What is the meaning of seizing books and leaflets that belong to the Muslim Brotherhood taken from Diyyah's house? He added that if a citizen is brought to account for having a book that is available in the market and that is approved by the publication authorities, and if that book deals with a group that is officially licensed, then what liberties are left?
