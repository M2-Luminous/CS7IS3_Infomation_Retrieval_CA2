We have had fruitful discussions on matters relating to the future organization of the work and activities of the group as well as on further evolving its perspectives on global issues of common concern. When we began the summit, we were set to impart a new dynamism to this group and enable it to more meaningfully serve the interests of its constituents. We sought to clearly establish a direct correlation between our interests in the group and the benefits that we can derive from it. We believe that we have been able to provide the wherewithal and direction to the group in terms of institutional framework and agenda that, given rigorous monitoring and follow up, could achieve this objective. We have decided to broaden the scope of intra-G-15 economic cooperation through the establishment of a Committee on Trade, Investment, and Technology, which will work toward evolution of transregional arrangements. Key elements of these arrangements would be liberalization, facilitation, promotion of trade to demonstrably increase economic interaction within the group. The success of our efforts would, in turn, simulate such exchanges in the vital areas of trade, investment, and transfer of technology with and among other developing countries. The private sector will have a crucial role to play and will therefore be closely associated with this venture. This committee will also establish interactive links with related projects such as the South Investment, Trade, and Technology Data Exchange Center -- SITTDEC -- payments, arrangements, infrastructure, sectoral, and techno-economic projects such as solar energy and gene banks. This approach will not only bring our complementarities to the fore, but will fully utilize them to enlarge markets and accelerate growth and development in our countries. Above all, this approach provides an altogether new dimension to our firm commitment to further implement our cooperative projects and establish more vigorous linkages between them and our national institutions and policies. This would then make South-South cooperation a truly vibrant component of G-15. The business forum which has been held in tandem with the summit has provided new insights to expanding trade, investments through joint ventures, technological exchanges, and tourism. It drew up time-bound action plans for strengthening transport, financial, and information infrastructure for intra G-15 trade. The trade committee would help achieve these objectives through its own work program. We recognize that the availability of objective, balanced, extensive, and timely information about political, cultural, economic, and social developments in G-15 countries is an essential prerequisite of effective cooperation. We, therefore, agreed that G-15 should harness the information and communication revolution to promote better understanding and knowledge about the problems and experiences, capabilities, and potential of our countries. This could best be achieved by establishing telecommunications and media link-ups and coordination of efforts in these areas. A group to evolve appropriate strategies in this regard, including recommendations on information infrastructure and communication systems -- existing and new -- that may need to be established will be set up. We are asking the troika foreign ministers to facilitate the setting up of such a group and develop its terms of reference. The summit reaffirmed support for the continuing operation of SITTDEC and agreed that member countries should meet their financial obligations. To ensure viability, the summit recommended that SITTDEC should be commercially oriented and accept subscribers directly from all developing countries. In this regard, it was felt that a board meeting should be convened at the earliest. Our group has considerable technological resources and expertise, which we are keen to put to the service of industrialization, rural development, employment generation, and building of social infrastructure in developing countries. Cooperation in the setting up of small scale industries, especially in Africa is of particular relevance and we agreed to extend full support through appropriate projects. We welcomed the offer by the government of Senegal to coordinate a project on the transfer of technology and development with a focus on food production, energy, and health. We welcomed the proposal by the government of Egypt on establishment of South-South Renewable Energy Promotion Center, which is geared to exchange of information and the use of existing capabilities in member countries in this field. We also welcomed the proposal of the government of Egypt for cooperation in the design, execution, and management of petroleum, gas and petrochemical projects. We agreed to hone our consultative mechanisms by providing for meetings of our ministers of foreign affairs, economy, trade, agriculture, environment, and science and technology on a regular basis in the intersummit period. This would not only deepen our understanding on these policy areas, but also lay the practical foundation for cooperation among our countries. We are aware that our decisions will have to be continuously followed up and translated into action on the ground. We expect that the summit's declared commitment will ensure that our national administrations with the active support of our industry and business would involve themselves in this task and produce results. We would use ministerial and other consultative mechanisms to coordinate our approaches on specific global issues of common concern. The group's mandate of engaging in a substantive dialogue on such issues with our partners in the north will be actively pursued through interactions at multilateral fora. The G-15 initiative on a constructive and focussed dialogue with the G-7 will be carried forward. The summit provided us an opportunity to evaluate the international situation and exchange perceptions on issues of critical importance to peace and development in our times. We undertook a [words indistinct] of the economic, political, environmental, and social changes that we, the developing countries face in common and shared our experiences in meeting these challenges. We affirmed the equal importance of attention to peace and development in a restructured and democratized UN, if we are to realize more equitable, prosperous, and secure world order. The world trading order that is emerging after seven long years of negotiations in the Uruguay Round engaged our attention. We expect that the round will fulfill its promise of propelling our growth through new and expanded market access areas of current and potential interest to us. Further, we look to the WTO [World Trade Organization] as a guarantor of the rights of the weaker trading partners and as a safety net against arbitrary, unilateral, and discriminatory protectionist action. In the coming months and years, we would have to work together for this. At the same time, while we are fully conscious of genuine social and environmental requirements and the need to fulfill them in our specific context, we will have to guard against new trade restricting tendencies in the developed countries using the pretext of social and environmental concerns with the real aim of nullifying the comparative advantage of the economies of the south such as raw materials, simple life styles, climate, wage structure, et cetera. Keeping these factors in mind, it was agreed that our ministers could meet at Marrakech on the occasion of the concluding conference on the Uruguay Round with a view to ensuring coordination amongst us. Our discussions on the substantive and organizational aspects of the group have yielded positive results and it is my hope that the group will influence policies, decisions, and events that directly impinge on our individual and collective well-being. We welcomed the offer made by the president of Argentina to host our fifth summit meeting and look forward to meeting in Buenos Aires in 1995. We also welcomed and accepted the offer made by the president of Zimbabwe to host our sixth summit in 1996. As this summit draws to a close, we look forward to the future. We are confident that under the wise and able stewardship of President Menem, the G-15 will prosper and advance toward the realization of its potential. I would like to assure him of our fullest cooperation in this noble endeavor, which is the cherished goal of all our countries and peoples. I now invite His Excellency Mr. Carlos Menem to make his acceptance statement as the host of the fifth summit of G-15. Thank you.
