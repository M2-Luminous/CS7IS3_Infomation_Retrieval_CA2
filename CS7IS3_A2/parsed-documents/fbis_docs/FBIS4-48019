According to Joao da Costa, chairman of the Party for Renovation and Development [PRD], the alliance, in addition to the PRD, includes the Democratic Front, the Social Democratic Front, the Ecological Protection League, the Movement for Democracy, and the Democratic and Progress Party. This alliance will soon elect a single presidential candidate, Mr. da Costa disclosed, announcing on the occasion his decision to step down from the presidential race. After a first postponement in 1992, President Joao Bernardo Vieira again postponed Guinea-Bissau's first multiparty presidential and parliamentary elections indefinitely on 22 March -- a week to the scheduled date -- for "technical reasons." President Vieira is standing for reelection. No firm date has so far been announced for the holding of these elections despite the completion of a population census on 23 April.
