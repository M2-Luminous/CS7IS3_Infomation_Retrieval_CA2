FR941026-1-00038 FR941026-1-00014 The language of proposed §773.15(c)(13) ``(t)he applicant has demonstrated that the approved permit area contains only lands for which the applicant has established a right-to-enter and conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations'' and similar language in proposed §773.17(a) are intended to prohibit the inclusion of uncontrolled land in the permit area of approved permits. OSM's oversight of those State programs allowing uncontrolled land in the permit area of approved permits has shown that the validity of the operation and reclamation plans required by 30 CFR part 780 may be substantially compromised by the applicant's subsequent inability to gain access to blocks of land within the permit area upon which the plans were predicated. Examples exist where central elements upon which approval was based required modification when the applicant subsequently was unable to obtain access to required land. In various instances, proposed spoil and soil storage areas, borrow areas, and facility areas have been unavailable for use. Sediment control strategies have been compromised when land for sediment ponds and diversion ditches in the approved operation and reclamation plans was unavailable. Changes have occurred which require recalculation of the bond amount. While OSM recognizes the need for operation and reclamation plans to be dynamic enough to accommodate new information and unexpected conditions that may develop, changes such as those described militate against the credibility of OSM's regulatory scheme which is to be based upon the approval or rejection of accurate and reliable operation and reclamation plans. Accordingly, and in partial response to industry's comments discussed below, OSM is also proposing that §773.15(c)(13) include the requirement that compliance with the operation and reclamation plans be based upon activities to be conducted solely upon lands for which the applicant has the right-to-enter and conduct surface mining and reclamation operations. This language is intended to put all parties on notice that operation and reclamation plans included in the approved permit cannot be based on activities to be conducted on uncontrolled land. Several commenters opposing the petition argued that the inclusion of uncontrolled land in the permit areas of permit applications and approved permits is necessary to accommodate the complexities of real estate transaction involved in mine plan development and to allow for environmental planning based on a more conceptually complete mining and reclamation plan. While OSM acknowledges that inclusion of uncontrolled lands in an approved permit may allow the formulation of a comprehensive and cumulative operation and reclamation plan and environmental analysis, such plans and analysis may not prove reliable and, therefore, may not provide the regulatory authority with a reasonable basis for concluding that the lands for which the applicant has right-of-entry can actually be mined and reclaimed in accordance with the Act and in compliance with its implementing regulations. 30 CFR 773.15(c) (1), (2) and 780.2. Neither would the commenter's suggestion that the approved permit be conditioned to authorize mining only on lands for which right-of-entry is obtained address this potential defect in the permitted operation and reclamation plans and associated environmental analysis. Proposed §§773.15(c)(13) and 773.17(a) would not preclude inclusion under §778.15(a) of a reasonable amount of uncontrolled land in the permit application thus accommodating the need for continued real estate transactions during the permit review process and facilitating the development of environmental projections based on mining and reclamation on a scale the applicant plans to achieve. However, under the proposed rule permit issuance would be predicated upon the existence of a clearly discernible and finite permit area in the operation and reclamation plans where the applicant's ability to obtain right-of-entry is not a variable that would influence the execution of the plans as approved. In practical terms, the requirement of proposed §773.15(c)(13) that ``compliance with the operation and reclamation plans is based upon activities to be conducted solely upon such lands'' means that immediately prior to permit issuance the regulatory authority must reassess the legitimacy of the applicant's operation and reclamation plans taking into account the impact of the applicant's lack of access to any uncontrolled land. Loss of a piece of land necessary for the accomplishment of the operation or reclamation plan could require permit modification or permit denial. It is anticipated that the §773.15(c)(13) requirement will militate against inclusion in the permit application of properties for which the applicant is unlikely to obtain right-of-entry by the time of permit issuance. This should in turn accrue to the benefit of landowners who never wanted their properties included in the permit application. It should also accrue to the benefit of the environment as planning would be based on more plausible real estate projections. Proposed §§773.15(c)(13) and 773.17(a) are seen as striking a reasonable balance between not unnecessarily burdening the legitimate mining industry and protecting the rights of landowners while providing the regulatory authority with the accurate, comprehensive and reliable information it needs to comply with its responsibilities under 30 CFR 773.15(c)(1), (2) and 780.2. These proposals are not intended to alter existing standards for establishing right-of-entry. They merely require that the applicant must demonstrate that the permit area of the approved permit contains only lands for which he has established a right-of-entry.
