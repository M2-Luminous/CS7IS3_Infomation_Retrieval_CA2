FR940902-0-00006 FR940902-0-00001 In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the United States Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this final rule. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 553) because this rule should be implemented prior to the beginning of the shipping season in mid-September. Further, handlers are aware of this rule, which was recommended at public meetings. Also, a 30-day comment period was provided for in the proposed rule.
