This is no violation of the agreement." These remarks were made last night by Justice Minister David Liba'i in response to the decree by Yasir 'Arafat regarding the cancellation of the Israeli laws in Jericho. Minister Liba'i added: "'Arafat tends to favor symbolic and demonstrative acts instead of coming down to the territories and starting to run the inhabitants' life and worrying over real needs. He did nothing by issuing a statement announcing that he is canceling the Israeli laws. According to the agreement between us, we have restricted the validity of their laws so that they cannot pass laws which contradict the agreement. He is no legislator, and has not presented an alternative or introduced order. All that he has done so far is make a statement." The minister noted that the Palestinian Authority has the right to cancel some of the laws. It would not be a violation, he said, but the question is whether this is wise and how will it impact on the territory.
