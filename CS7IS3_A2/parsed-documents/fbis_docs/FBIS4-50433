To further tighten price management, concerned departments are planning to continue increasing the force of regulation and control. Some relevant measures are expected to be unveiled around June and July. These measures are understood to include: First, strict controls over the scale of fixed-asset investment, firmly cutting and stopping a number of construction projects, no more approval this year for large and medium-sized infrastructure projects not listed in the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," and strict controls over high-class office buildings, villas, and upmarket entertainment facilities. Second, strict control over the excessive growth of consumption funds. There are plans to slow down the growth rate of consumption funds by reducing corporate consumption power with methods such as strengthening the finances of enterprises and nonprofit-making institutions and taxation and controlling and cutting back administrative expenditure, while turning the purchasing power and consumption of urban and rural residents into savings and mid and long-term investment. Third, make great efforts to pursue agriculture and "food basket" projects, increase the cultivated area for major agricultural products, such as grains and cotton, and ensure that materials and funds supporting agriculture reach their destination. Fourth, make further efforts at building and perfecting means to regulate and control prices and markets, including reserve systems for several key commodities and a risk fund system in order to increase the state's regulatory and control powers. Fifth, arrange well this year's production and supply of key commodities. To stabilize grain and oil prices, the state will, if necessary, release quantities of reserve grain and oil. Furthermore, the State Planning Commission is drafting rules and regulations against profiteering.
