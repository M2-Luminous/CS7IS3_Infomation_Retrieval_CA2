He said he hopes the measures taken to resolve the energy crisis throughout the nation will be effective and will end the constant power rationing to which people have been subjected. The measures include purchasing electricity from countries such as Panama, which began sending 13 megawatts through the Central American interconnection system this Friday for an initial period of three months at a cost of $3.8 million. A power-generating barge will be leased and will arrive in the coming days in the northern port of Puerto Cortes. Private plants will also be used to generate electricity. According to official reports from the National Enterprise for Electric Power (ENEE), the country's daily deficit is over 80 megawatts, which has prompted the creation of a rationing schedule. Reina appealed to the people to conserve energy while the crisis is overcome. "I am working as hard as I can so the Honduran people will not suffer so much with these problems," he added. Also, he said the state will collect $26 million in arrears maintained by "wealthy" businessmen for several years with the ENEE, which might help to solve the current problem. "To achieve this, we must cut down on our energy use. It is time for people to help solve the crisis," the president stated. The current energy crisis is the result of a lack of water at the Francisco Morazan hydroelectric plant, the country's largest such plant, which supplies 63 percent of national demand. According to the same sources, a lack of foresight by previous governments and neglected maintenance of the thermoelectric plants that also generate power are also to blame for the problem. The government trusts that Central American countries, like Nicaragua and Costa Rica, will supply electricity to Honduras, but these nations have reported that they also face problems because of the drought.
