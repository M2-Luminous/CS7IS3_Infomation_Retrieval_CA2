The elections are scheduled to start on 26 April. According to a concrete plan, a group of about 20 monitors which is mainly composed of Foreign Ministry personnel and civilian volunteers who participated as monitors in the Cambodian elections will be sent as independent government monitors. Moreover, five monitors will be sent by nongovernmental organizations (NGO), and 15 others will go as individual participants in the UN Observer Mission to South Africa (UNOMSA). The first group of these monitors to be sent by the government will leave for South Africa on 8 April. Other members will leave around the middle of this month. Moreover, Japan also plans to send an advisory election monitoring group composed of Diet members. With regard to the upcoming dispatch of the election monitors group, the government does not plan to apply the UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) Cooperation Bill. In this connection, the election monitors to be sent will not participate directly in the UNOMSA, but they will act while maintaining close contacts with the UNOMSA.
