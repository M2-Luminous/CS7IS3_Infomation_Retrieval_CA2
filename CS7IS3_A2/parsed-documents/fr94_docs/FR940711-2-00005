EFFECTIVE DATE: July 11, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Beck, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC, 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;3464. Preliminary Determination We preliminarily determine that fresh garlic from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV), as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Case History Since the notice of initiation on February 22, 1994 (59 FR 9470, February 28, 1994), the following events have occurred. On March 17, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary determination. Departmental Efforts to Obtain Information During March and April 1994, the Department requested information relating to producers/exporters of the subject merchandise in the PRC, as follows: •On March 3, 1994, we sent an abbreviated section A questionnaire to China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC); •On March 4, 1994, we sent a cable to the American Embassy in Beijing; •On March 11, 1994, we sent a cable to the American Embassy in Tokyo, and to the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong; and •On April 7, 1994, we sent an abbreviated section A questionnaire to the China Chamber of Commerce of Imports & Exports of Foodstuffs, Native Produce, and Animal By-Products (China Chamber) Having received no response to our initial inquiries, follow-up requests for information were made as follows: •On April 7, 1994, to MOFTEC; and •On April 15, 1994, to the American Embassies in Beijing and Tokyo, and to the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong. Respondents and Status of Questionnaires On May 11 and 12, 1994, the Department received information from MOFTEC and the American Embassy in Beijing, respectively, containing the names and addresses of 40 producers/exporters of the subject merchandise in the PRC. Based on an analysis of ships' manifest data (PIERS), the Department estimated that the named respondents accounted for approximately 40 percent of exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period of investigation. Consequently, on May 18, 1994, the Department sent 40 antidumping questionnaires to the named firms, with additional copies sent to MOFTEC and the China Chamber. Following an entry of appearance by counsel for a previously unnamed producer/exporter, the Department sent a questionnaire to this additional firm on May 31, 1994. Finally, at the request of a second previously unnamed producer/exporter, the Department sent a questionnaire to this additional firm on June 21, 1994. Other Events On June 2, 1994, the Department issued a decision memorandum which stated that we would not postpone our preliminary determination. Based on reasonably supported allegations submitted by petitioner on June 10, 1994, the Department initiated an investigation on June 14, 1994, of whether critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of fresh garlic from the PRC. On June 14 and 21, 1994, the Department requested monthly shipment data for exports to the United States from questionnaire recipients. Scope of Investigation The products covered by this investigation are all grades of garlic, whole or separated into constituent cloves, whether or not peeled, fresh, chilled, frozen, provisionally preserved, or packed in water or other neutral substance, but not prepared or preserved by the addition of other ingredients or heat processing. The differences between grades are based on color, size, sheathing and level of decay. The subject merchandise is used principally as a food product and for seasoning. The subject garlic is currently classifiable under subheadings 0703.20.0000, 0710.80.7060, 0710.80.9750, 0711.90.6000, and 2005.90.9500 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. The scope description provided above differs from the scope description used by the Department in its notice of initiation of this investigation (59 FR 9470, February 28, 1994). Changes to the scope include (a) the addition of more concise language (and additional HTS subheadings) related to the packing of the subject merchandise, and (b) additional language to exclude further processed products. The revisions are a result of comments received from the Customs Service on March 17 and June 30, 1994, and from counsel for petitioner on June 29 and 30, 1994. Period of Investigation The period of investigation (POI) is August 1, 1993, to January 31, 1994.
