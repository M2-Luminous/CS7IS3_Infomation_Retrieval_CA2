Groznyy says that the reason for this decision is that Russia has extended the state of emergency zone in Ingushetia and North Osetia to cover regions which are directly adjacent to Chechnya. Russia has not yet officially proposed holding summit talks with the Chechen Republic. The only knowledge we have of a possible meeting between Boris Yeltin and Dzhokar Dudayev is what we have read in the press. This was stated to our radio station by Chechnya's Deputy Prime Minister Mayrabek Mugadayev. He stressed that Groznyy does not even know who precisely in Moscow is engaged in preparing the summit talks. And any other talks, at government or Foreign Ministry level, will not do any good, Mugadayev considers. The Russian prime minister also agrees with this point of view. [Begin Mugadayev recording] Viktor Stepanovich [Chernomyrdin] told me straight: He said he approved all seven points or questions which we put forward and the draft agreement which I showed him. It is necessary for Presidents Yeltsin and Dudayev to resolve the political aspect of the question. One can regard the government-level talks as having been completed since the governments have no complaints against each other. [end recording] [Announcer] And here is another report from Groznyy. Dzhokar Dudayev today stated that the Russian special services are preparing a plan to organize a local nuclear explosion in Chechnya. Representatives of Russia's foreign intellignece service have denied this report.
