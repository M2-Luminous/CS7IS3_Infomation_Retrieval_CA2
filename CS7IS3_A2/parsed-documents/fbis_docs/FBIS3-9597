They held talks for almost two hours. Nedzad Leko has a report. [Leko] Following the talks with Charles Redman, President Izetbegovic told journalists the following: [Begin Izetbegovic recording] As you can see, you waited for a long time. We had rather long talks. This was one in a series of talks on peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, on restoring peace. This is a kind of search for solution to the problem in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course, we touched on the unavoidable question of territories. We also mentioned the problem of Sarajevo and Mostar. We agreed that, as far as Sarajevo and Mostar are concerned, we will proceed with the planned solution, that is, the administration of Sarajevo by the United Nations and of Mostar by the European Community. I think that we will stick to these solutions. (?Representatives of the EC) have already visited Mostar and I believe that Mostar representatives will go to Brussels as early as next week to resume talks. We are, therefore, still searching for a peaceful solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and these talks are part of the efforts in that direction. I believe that they were very constructive and useful. [end recording] [Leko] Speaking about the Bosnia-Herzegovina parliament session tomorrow and the Assembly of Citizens of Serb Nationality in Sarajevo today, Charles Redman said: [Begin Redman recording, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] All of these meetings are very important. They demonstrate that the political leadership in Bosnia is actively involved in the search for a solution for the future. As the president said, there are many issues on our agenda. Many of those things refer to a short-term improvement in living conditions, the improvement of the situation in Sarajevo, Mostar, and other areas in Bosnia, but we all know that we have (?an important task), which is to try to find a comprehensive solution to this war through talks. That is a very difficult issue. (?The president) has been dealing with it for months. I know that the Bosnian Government is permanently committed to this aim, and I believe that the Bosnian Croats are also interested in that, as we can see from the agreement on the federation which will be discussed tomorrow at the [Bosnian] parliament session. I hope that there is the same type of constructive standpoint among the Bosnian Serbs. It is only through a joint action by all three sides that we will reach an effective and acceptable solution. These meetings are an important part of that process. I have heard a lot of encouraging statements at today's meeting of Citizens of Serb Nationality, and I hope that the session of the Bosnian parliament tomorrow will be equally encouraging. [end recording] [Leko] Asked about the decision of the self-proclaimed parliament in Pale to refuse to join the Bosniak-Croat Federation, and whether he considered that decision final, Charles Redman said: [Begin Redman recording] I do not know whether that is the final decision. We have known since the meeting in Geneva last August that the Bosnian Serbs wanted a high degree of autonomy. That led to the idea of a constitutional union which will preserve Bosnia-Herzegovina, but which will give its constituent parts a high degree of autonomy [words indistinct]. I have not heard anything from any side here in Bosnia that indicates that they want something else. So, while the Serbs perhaps do not want to become member of the federation in the same way that the Bosnian Croats and the Bosnian Government organized themselves, I heard nothing that indicates that they would not be interested in the idea of a constitutional union which preserves Bosnia.
