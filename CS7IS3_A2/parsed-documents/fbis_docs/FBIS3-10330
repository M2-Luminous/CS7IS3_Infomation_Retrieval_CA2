FBIS3-10330 "drlat044cc_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-044 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Mar 1994 NAFTA Swedish Firms Cut Mexico Investments 94P20453 94P20453 Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] Swedish companies which had established operations in Mexico as a means of gaining access to that market, are now reducing their operations, according to the 2 February Stockholm business weekly VECKANS AFFARER. The weekly notes that many of these firms had originally invested in Mexico when its economy was based on import substitution and that they are now encountering competition from imports from the United States. The Swedish-Swiss electronics and engineering giant Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), which has seen its sales fall 50 percent over the last two years, has closed two of its five plants and slashed its Mexican work force by half. Atlas Copco, a mining equipment manufacturer, has also reduced its Mexican staff and production and increased its imports from the United States. While Tetra Pak has expanded its Mexican operations and is increasing its share of the milk packaging market, it expects increased competition from imported U.S. milk. Even Ericsson, which has long been the largest Swedish investor and a leading telecommunications manufacturer in Mexico, now has to defend its position against competition from AT&T, Northern Telecom, and Motorola. It also has cut back its work force in an effort to control costs. Ericsson's head of Mexican operations, Gerhard Skladal, expects the company to replace many of its Swedish-made components with U.S. inputs and he hopes that at the same time Ericsson will be able to increase sales from its Mexican plants to the rest of North America. The weekly also reports complaints by businessmen that Mexico needs to improve its infrastructure and productivity levels, which at present are not comparable to those of industrialized countries. Skladal notes: "We figure that we will need to hire at least 3-4 times more employees to do a certain job here than would be necessary in the United States." The chief of Atlas Copco's Mexican branch expects that company to increase its production in the United States, because "it is hardly logical for us to invest in Mexico right now." Both ABB and Ericsson hope that infrastructure improvements in Mexico will open new markets for their products. Ericsson wants to upgrade the Mexican telecommunications system to Western standards, and ABB is optimistic about opportunities in the growing Mexican automobile industry and in the cement and steel sectors. The revolt in Chiapas is apparently having little effect on investment decisions, according to the report. "Those of us who have been here for a long time and know the country are not scared off," says ABB's head of Mexican operations, Luiz Bring.
