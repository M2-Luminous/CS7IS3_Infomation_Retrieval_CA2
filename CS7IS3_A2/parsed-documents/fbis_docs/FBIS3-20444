The majority of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are from Fujian Province, and we designated the deputy director of our agency, Cao Weilian [2580 1218 1670], to particularly work on having Fujian Province render assistance to the Overseas Chinese. Guo Henian [6753 7729 1628] was a rubber plantation owner in Malaysia, but had gained fame and fortune mainly in the sugar business. He was renowned as the "King of Sugar" and had excellent connections to the Huarun Company. We worked on him through the intermediary of the Huarun concern, and Guo gradually transferred the base of his business operations to Hong Kong. He achieved considerable success in Hong Kong, and from there, furthermore, penetrated China and invested in China proper. Huang Tingfang [7806 1694 2455] was in the real estate business in Singapore. At one time in the past, he had served as general manager of the Singapore Branch of the Bank of China; he is well acquainted with Xue Wenlin [5641 2429 2651], who is the present deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the Bank of China. In the early 1980's, when the high tide of real estate business in Singapore had passed, Huang extended his business interests to Hong Kong. That was precisely the time when real estate business in Hong Kong was at a low ebb. At that time Huang bought up much land in Hong Kong, using his good connections to Xue Wenlin. We, on the other hand, were at that time just preoccupied with measures to restore confidence among the residents of Hong Kong, and our attitude toward Huang's daring and large-scale purchases of land was therefore very supportive. The Bank of China was actively loaning him funds for these purchases. With this support, Huang went all out in land purchases, acquiring almost as much land as Guo Desheng [6753 1795 0524], the giant in the real estate business. Soon thereafter land prices recovered, and Huang was able to earn huge profits. What he had not accomplished in Singapore, he accomplished in Hong Kong, namely to score a tremendous success. Huang Tingfang, having seized the right opportunity, had acquired a fortune by buying up cheap land and had risen to the ranks of prominent real estate merchants, just after Li Jiacheng [2621 0857 6134] and Guo Desheng. Huang Tingfang was also among the first large real estate merchants who went into China and invested in real estate in China proper. Prior to the 4 June incident, he had invested in real estate in Fujian Province and in its city of Xiamen. He had signed a contract with the Xiamen City government, undertaking to upgrade Xiamen's busiest street, and he also engaged in real estate developments in his native place, Changle county in Fujian Province. When others stopped doing business in China after the 4 June incident, Huang continued. Huang Tingfang had confidence in Hong Kong, that was the most important element contributing to his success. In 1983, he publicly expressed approval of China recovering Hong Kong and also expressed full confidence in Hong Kong's future. This made him a unique figure at that time. We had been actively supportive of the desires and plans of Overseas Chinese to expand their business operations to Hong Kong. Mao Junnian [3029 6874 1628] had a classmate by the name of Ke [2688], who was also a native of Fujian Province, and who, after graduating from Hong Kong University, had gone to the United States and had been doing well there, prospering in his industrial undertakings. Mao Junnian introduced him and brought him to see me. He put forward a novel plan, namely to build a subterranean electric walkway below Kowloon's busiest tourist center from Tsim Sha Tsui and all along under Nathan Road, as an additional attraction for tourism. The subterranean electric walkway would entail construction of a subterranean metal roadway with a conveyor belt, on which the people would stand. Instead of walking, they would be moved along on the conveyor belt. Space on both sides of the walkway could be developed for shops and the service industry, and markets or buildings with other purposes could be built at both entrances to the walkway. He was prepared to invest in the scheme and hoped for cooperation from Chinese capital. This novel idea of his has had my full support, and I promised to cooperate with him, but the crucial prerequisite would be to get the consent and approval of the British Government of Hong Kong. I asked him to pursue the matter in the normal social order, first to consider the feasibility, prepare a feasibility report, and then to apply to the Hong Kong government. After he quickly finished this preparatory work, I asked Zheng Hua [6774 5478], deputy director of NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, to contact the relevant department of the Hong Kong government, to tell them of our interest in the matter, and to discuss the matter with them over a dinner, pointing out to them that it would be beneficial for developments in Hong Kong and hoping that the Hong Kong government would give the matter its attention. However, throughout 1985 and 1986, and all the time up to my departure from Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government was never heard of again in this matter. This is really regrettable. (4) Course of Growth in Strength of China's Capital Involvement (1st of 5 pts). Provinces and municipalities appeared in Hong Kong to set up representations; reform had to adopt the principle of opening to the outside world. China's investment of capital funds in Hong Kong has occurred in stages. During the initial stage, its purpose was the covert protection of underground work and to start up all kinds of commercial enterprises to provide funds for the expenses of underground activities. Later and gradually, it was providing funds to develop some organizations to further its import-export trade. After the withdrawal of the Kuomintang from the mainland, some of the organizations left behind by them were taken over; for instance, the China Merchants Company, and were made to serve further developments. Following initiation of the reform and opening-up policy, departments and commissions in charge of industrial production and trade of the central authorities and of the various provinces and municipalities of China proper had become very eager to establish their own organizations in Hong Kong. However, the guiding ideology of the Central Committee tended to favor restrictions in this matter. Some members of the Central Committee suggested to let the various provinces, municipalities, ministries, and commissions establish appropriate bases in Hong Kong. Others again were against allowing more such components to be established as there were already, in their opinion, quite a sufficient number there, and that it instead should be a time for reorganization and retrenchment. In 1983, on the initiative of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [MOFERT], the State Council issued a document that restricted the establishment of new organizations in Hong Kong by the various provinces, municipalities, ministries, and commissions and ordered the reorganization of those formerly set up there. Prior to my assuming my duties in Hong Kong, Li Hou [2621 0683] showed me the said document and asked me to enforce its provisions after my arrival in Hong Kong. I have been originally working at the local level, and I thought from the standpoint of relevant departments and commissions of provinces and municipalities, it would have been quite necessary to establish bases in Hong Kong, since the policy was to be one of reform and opening up. For instance, the province of Jiangsu maintained a small outfit in Hong Kong, attached to the Huarun Company, consisting of only two or three persons. They were unable to do much, while; on the other hand, the local people at home base urgently required information to better understand the situation outside their home province, required expanding contacts with foreign and Hong Kong business firms to increase their import-export opportunities, as well as learning about appropriately responding to conditions and experiences in outside market activities. I disagreed with the spirit of this document and tended to favor expanding the organization of China's capital. At that time, Liao Chengzhi [1675 2110 1807] was still alive, and I proposed to him and Li Hou that enforcement of these provisions be delayed until my transfer to Hong Kong, when I would have gained a better understanding of the situation there. They both agreed. After I had been in Hong Kong for some time, I again proposed to them to ask Beijing to send someone to Hong Kong, so that we could jointly review the situation. The State Council agreed and sent a vice minister of MOFERT to Hong Kong to investigate. After two to three months of investigation, a new report was submitted, which was quite different from previous reports. It reflected a very externally oriented attitude and suggested that the State Council permit provinces, municipalities, ministries, and commissions to establish, within conditions, additional organizations in Hong Kong. In response to my urging, the deputy minister soon revisited Hong Kong, leading a delegation of representatives from most of China's provinces and municipalities to open a trade fair of unprecedented scale. Several hundred people from China proper attended the fair, which had a considerable impact on Hong Kong. In the past, China unifiedly transacted all its foreign trade through the government's foreign trade agencies. The production departments were essentially ignorant of foreign market conditions. The government's foreign trade agencies transmitted the trade plan, did the ordering of purchases, and all marketing. Establishment by the various provinces, municipalities, and other localities of their own organizations in Hong Kong practically destroyed the former centralized system, as these agencies would inform themselves of market conditions, do research and decide on production plans, thus effectively initiate a reform of China's entire foreign trade system.

Various obstacles building up against an expanding role of China's capital involvement in Hong Kong. Considering the way developments were taking place in Hong Kong, the interests in Hong Kong in British capital, foreign capital, the local Chinese capital, Overseas Chinese capital, and Taiwanese capital deserved to be protected and offered opportunities for continued growth. However, China's capital should also have had a certain share. China's capital could, and also had to strive for a certain measure of participation in the developments, without claiming any prerogative, but merely by studying and applying Hong Kong market experiences, and on the premise of not "stealing the rice bowls" from the people of Hong Kong, while also not adversely affecting their interests. If by chance an element of instability should appear in Hong Kong some time in the future, reliance on this foundation, the use of capital from China, could mitigate the potential negative effects on Hong Kong. In my opinion there should be continuous growth in the strength of China's capital. Why can't we have in Hong Kong a Chinese "Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation," a Chinese "Jardines," and a Chinese "Buterfield & Swire"? We must not replace them or drive them out, claiming certain prerogatives, but must act in the mutual interests of both, co-existd, and on this premise, do our utmost to develop our own affairs. Is that not possible? However, some among my Hong Kong comrades did not agree with me, and some leading cadres in Beijing were also against me. When I submitted my first report to the Central Committee on work done in Hong Kong, in September of 1983, as mentioned earlier, Li Xiannian [2621 0341 1819] felt that China-financed organizations in Hong Kong must not expand their activities. He furthermore expressed disapproval of any stock transactions, which he considered "speculation and profiteering." He was against investing in Hong Kong real estate, and wanted the Bank of China to pay attention to and exercise control over all real estate loans. Following the mentioned report, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office called a conference at the end of 1983 to discuss economic work in Hong Kong and Macau. Leading cadres of relevant departments of the central authorities and leading cadres from provincial and municipal departments in charge of foreign trade participated at the conference. Leading cadres from China-financed agencies in Hong Kong and Macau, who also participated at the conference, and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office designated myself and Li Chuwen [2621 0328 2429] to chair the conference. There has never before been this kind of an all-China conference to discuss in particular the economic work in Hong Kong and Macau, and it was for the first time too that the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, representing the State Council, chaired a conference of this nature. Two documents were produced at the conference. One was a report by the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office to the Central Committee. The report based on the various speeches and directives by Chen Yun, Li Xiannian, and other leading cadres of the Central Committee, and also on my work report from Hong Kong, that time in September. This was edited into several paragraphs of opinions of a policy character, requesting in response instructions from the Central Committee and suggesting to hold a nationwide conference for their implementation. Several members of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, among them Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, Li Xiannian, Hu Yaobang [5170 5069 6721], and Zhao Ziyang [6392 4793 7122] initialled the report, thereby signifying their consent and approving the conference. The other document was a draft resolution, which was submitted to the conference for deliberation and amendment, which would then, in its final form, also be submitted to the Central Committee and the State Council for approval, to become an official resolution. Almost 200 persons participated at the conference. As I remember, no one delivered a speech at the start of the conference, and there was then a discussion of the documents. Most participants dissented from the contents of the documents. The provisions of a policy nature in the documents were condensed by the participants into what amounted to "ninefold prohibitions." I remember more or less the following: they did not allow anyone to proceed to Hong Kong and set up new foreign trade organizations, they did not allow China-financed investment activities, they did not allow China-financed organizations to engage in "speculative" undertakings, they did not allow to speculate in shares, in foreign exchange, in real estate, and in gold. Foreign exchange held by China-financed organizations must not be deposited with foreign banks, but must be deposited with the Bank of China. They were against opening markets for Hong Kong products in China and against marketing such products inside China. In sum, Chen Yun's directive, "don't have others pocket all the profits," signified the main spirit of this policy, a policy that erected all kinds of obstacles against the expansion of China-capital financed undertakings in Hong Kong. Most of the participants at the conference were highly dissatisfied, I too was dissatisfied. Jiang Wengui [5592 2429 2710], director of the Hong Kong and Macau Administrative Office of the Bank of China, asked me: "Why does the Central Committee hold this kind of a conference?" I replied: "I also don't know why." Throughout the entire duration of the conference, I maintained complete silence. (End of Installment No. 76) [20 Jul 93 p 2] [Text] Course of Growth of Strength of China's Capital Involvement (3rd of 5 pts) Li Qiang [2621 1730] had once engaged in "speculation and profiteering" and had reaped a profit of 600 billion for Mainland China. Zhao Ziyang froze the "ninefold prohibitions" directive and China's capital escaped a disaster. I suggested that China's capital in Hong Kong should emulate the Hong Kong merchants and use all the tricks of capitalism in active business operations. I remember, when I had just arrived in Hong Kong, the minister of the MOFERT, Li Qiang, stopped over in Hong Kong on his trip abroad and inspected the Huarun Company, which was an organization directly under the MOFERT. We two were fellow townsmen and old friends. He was almost 70 years old and in good health. He liked to eat candied haws on sticks and the shoulder of pork; and of the latter, if plainly fried, he could eat three to four kilos at one sitting. It was really frightening. Whenever we met in Jiangsu, he asked me to get him shoulder of pork. This time in Hong Kong, he had not changed. I found a cook from Jiangsu Province and satisfied Li's craving. During the meal, we talk leisurely and came to talk about the Hong Kong merchants and how they got rich by trading in shares and gold and could lead a life of abundance. We could only do business in the old ways, were not to "speculate and profiteer," so our country could not get rich. Then, Li Qiang mysteriously said: "Who says we don't know how to do some "speculating and profiteering, I myself have once done some `speculation and profiteering'! Once I `speculated' in gold and earned for the state a profit of 600 million. We looked at each other and laughed hilariously. As to the document that was presented to the conference for general discussion, almost all the units present at the conference raised objections, but the sponsors of the conference would not take note of them. After the conference I went to see Zhao Ziyang. Zhao Ziyang received me at his Zhongnanhai home. His library there was about 30 or 40 square meters, with several bookshelves filled with old and modern books. I told Zhao that this conference had been conducted badly, and he asked me, why? I said: "In the matter of China's capital funds engaging in economic and commercial activities in Hong Kong, the conference would disallow this and forbid that. The conference did not start out from active developments, but was negatively defensive, not at all in accordance with the need to expand from a centralized position to the outside, and not at all utilizing the spirit of Hong Kong." Zhao said: "Why did you not raise objections?" I said: "You members of the Standing Committee all initialled the report which the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office had submitted to the Central Committee, how could I openly voice opposition at the conference? I can only report this to you and state my objections." Zhao Ziyang pondered this for a while and then asked me: "What are we then to do? Should we hold another conference and again issue another document?" I understood that he personally could not very well immediately invalidate the conference we have had. However, I was concerned that if things were not immediately remedied and if the "ninefold prohibitions" were enforced, as a consequence of the conference, much more and significant damage would be done. I therefore said: "It will not do, I am afraid, to handle the situation in this way. I suggest that the documents from this conference not be issued to lower levels, and that when we go back we also do not relay them to anyone else." Zhao Ziyang did not clarify his position at that time. I thought he tacitly agreed, but did not feel he should immediately declare his consent. After all, he still wanted to go on working as a member of the Standing Committee. After I returned to Hong Kong, I notified those leading cadres in organizations working with China-provided capital funds who had attended the conference: For the time being, don't relay anything of the spirit of the conference, but await the receipt of the documents before you implement anything. Later, sure enough, the documents were never transmitted, and the "spirit" of the conference was never disseminated. China's capital in Hong Kong thus escaped a disaster. In addition to giving my full support to the establishment of Hong Kong organs by the various provinces, municipalities, ministries, and commission, I also suggested that their leading cadres more frequently visit Hong Kong, broaden their horizon, and learn from market experiences. At that time, I had only a superficial knowledge of market economy, I only knew some aspects of it in the buyer's market and the seller's market. In China proper it was essentially a seller's market with production regulated by plan, but in a buyer's market production is determined according to consumption needs and marketing conditions. When I passed through Hong Kong on my visit to Australia in 1979, some Hong Kong capitalists informed me of the ways of trade, how to adapt to the needs of the market and how to participate in the competition according to the law of the survival of the fittest. They said, enterprises are not only a matter of production and management, the main thing is effective business operations. If products are produced in excess and cannot all be sold and have to be stockpiled, the enterprise will sooner or later collapse. On my return, I emphasized in my report to Hua Guofeng [5478 0948 6912], who was at that time leading cadre in the Central Committee, that it simply would not do that China's factories concern themselves only about management and not about effective business operations. Hua Guofeng agreed with my opinion and in one of his speeches he brought up the problem of more effective business operations of enterprises. (End of Installment No. 77) [21 Jul 93 p 2] [text] Course of Growth of Strength of China-Provided Capital Funds Economic reform led to the "Shekou [Shek O] Incident," Yuan Geng [5913 1649 was personally accused. Diversification in the business of the Huarun Company; reforms and improvements also carried out in the Bank of China. After I started to work in Hong Kong, I felt even more strongly that leading cadres inside China should come to Hong Kong and look around how Hong Kong people conduct trade. I did my very best to suggest that the checking procedure should be more liberal, allowing more people to visit Hong Kong. As mentioned earlier, in the past the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office had exercised strict controls, and I had repeatedly requested that they should relax these controls, but they never took notice. Up to 1986, the Central Committee had delegated the right of approving business trips to Hong Kong to the Hong Kong and Macau Commission. Nominally, the State Council had entrusted the Hong Kong and Macau Commission to give approvals on the State Council's behalf, thereby resolving the problem. I again and again urged the executives of the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY to have the checking procedure relaxed, allowing more people from inside China to visit Hong Kong and study things there. Developments were fastest in the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian, especially in Guangdong because of its more favorable location. The China-financed organizations also experienced very rapid development at this stage. Reform and opening up to the outside world, as it was taking place within China, also posed problems for some of the Chinese capital-financed organizations which had been well-established "old Hongs" in Hong Kong, as to how to adapt to the new situation. The new task they were now facing was how to improve and reform their business operations to conform to the new requirements of China proper. One who has done outstanding work in this respect was Yuan Geng of the China Merchants Company. Yuan Geng built up a new district at Shenzhen-Shekou. Although the area is part of Shenzhen, the way it was developed right from the start was quite different from Shenzhen. In Shenzhen emphasis was placed on tourism, the service industries, and real estate, while Shekou placed emphasis on small industry. Its subsequent development about matched that of Shenzhen. In administrative respects, Shekou is a ward of Shenzhen City, but it is independent; its cadres are allocated by the China Merchants Company itself. Yuan Geng knows how to choose the right person for the right job, and he also employed new management tactics. He regularly employed some scholars and experts from inside China to explore and work out economic reform problems. The well-known "Shekou incident," which occurred later, was indeed due to the fact that a "Youth Education Experts and Shekou Youths Symposium" was held in Shekou. Some new problems were brought up which offended some of the oldsters in Beijing. At a meeting of the Central Committee Standing Committee, someone pointed to Yuan Geng personally as being an instigator of bourgeois liberalism. Although the Central Committee never officially notified me, someone told me that Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang actually protected Yuan Geng at the Standing Committee meeting and prevented the affair to have further consequences. I have a friendly hello for Yuan Geng: the reform has to be pursued, but with some care, so that others will not give you trouble. Shekou developed very fast, and the China Merchants Company itself developed rapidly. Yuan Geng adopted the business methods of the capitalist world. Tonnage of China Merchants' ocean transport fleet rapidly increased, and their other business undertakings also flourished. The Ministry of Communications was very satisfied, and Ye Fei [0673 7378], who was then minister of the said ministry, came to hold esteem for Yuan Geng even more highly because of his successes. Under the pressure of circumstances, the Huarun Company also began to diversify its business activities. Formerly, it was the main foreign trade organization in Hong Kong of the MOFERT, in fact Huarun monopolized China's foreign trade in Hong Kong. Currently, the various provinces and municipalities are themselves taking up business operations, and Huarun's monopolistic position is gradually being undermined, so that Huarun is compelled to diversify and to somehow enhance its business operations. Zhang Jianhua [1728 1696 5478], Huarun's chairman of the board, is very reform-minded, and has also had much success. They expanded their operations not only in Hong Kong, but also toward the United States and Europe, where they set up branch organizations. The China-financed group has already become a large and influential enterprise in Hong Kong. Even the Bank of China group, traditionally very conservative, has instituted some reforms and improvements. When I first came to Hong Kong, I heard many reports about the excessively cautious way in which the Bank of China granted loans, and that they were not eager to get involved in large projects. On the other hand, Zhuang Shiping [8369 0013 1627], chairman of the board at the Nanyang Commercial Bank, had an excellent reputation and was believed to be a very active businessman. I sought confirmation from Jiang Wengui [5592 2429 2710] and Huang Tingyen [7806 1694 1484] of the Bank of China, but they both disagreed with the opinion of the general public. They acknowledged that Zhuang Shiping was a man of great courage, but that he also had a lot of loans that went bad. I contended that they give more thought to the impressions held by those outsiders. The fact that the leading cadres of the Bank of China are thoroughly versed in the banking business, are continuously expanding the scope of their business, and reforming and improving their procedures, has a powerful influence on Hong Kong's financial affairs and economic development, is supportive of the reform in China proper, and is also particularly influential in efforts to rally Chinese capital in Hong Kong for united action.
