For instance, for the last elections in Britain they said the Labour Party was winning. Before the first elections in Zimbabwe they predicted that Nkomo and Muzorewa would win. In my own experience the opinion polls have never been very accurate. Secondly we do not know what criteria were used. We do not know who was approached. For instance I have never been approached by the so-called analysts. It seems as if the bulk of the electorate is never canvassed, hence the discrepancies. We are working with the grassroots we know who they are supporting and why (PAC support) is far higher and everybody will be shocked by the election result. Our aim is not to come with claims of support but to win the election. We are not coming up with predictions. On the structure of the PAC and rumours that the PAC is cash- strapped: The PAC has never been a rich organisation, but we manage somehow because we work with our people and they are the people who are supporting the organisation. There is talk that the playing field should be levelled for the election but this is mere talk. We don't see this in practice. What you are witnessing is the international community together with big business and the media supporting one party, the ANC [African National Congress]. Yet these are the people who are said to be promoting multiparty democracy. We feel that in the long run our country will be turned into a one-party state under this arrangement. On whether ANC promises to the electorate are realistic: Our position is that we don't have all the answers. We are putting our case to the people to come forward with their ideas so that we can see what we can implement. The ANC is talking about millions of houses, of jobs etc...(this) is dangerous. On the position of APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army] and the possibility of resuming the armed struggle: We did not willingly embark on armed struggle. We were forced into it. But if we are forced to again, we will have to consider that position. If our demands on a number of issues are not met...we have been economically exploited, politically oppressed and socially degraded. Unless that situation is addressed we can never say our country has been freed. On whether the PAC leadership has control over APLA: The highest organ of the PAC is the national conference. This is the body that gives the money to APLA. But it is not the policy of the PAC that APLA should be obliged to tell us who they are going to strike and where. These are the details that are left to APLA. On the question of land redistribution, whether it applies to blacks only and how it is to be achieved: We don't have blacks in the PAC, only the African people. The African people have been deprived of their birthright for centuries and this is the situation we are promising our people to address immediately we are in power. There are various ways of doing it. There are various instruments that can be applied. For instance, we don't talk of nationalisation. In countries where it has been applied it had the tendency of robbing the elite for the benefit of another elite, not the grassroots people who have had promises made to them. On the controversy about the slogan "one settler, one bullet" and the PAC leadership's attitude to it: Firstly, it is not the PAC that has initiated this term settler. It is the whites themselves, but when we call them settlers they get annoyed. If you go to Grahamstown today you will find a monument to the 1820 British settlers. It was not the PAC or APLA who named them settlers. If you drive from D.F. Malan airport to Cape Town you drive along Settlers Way and it was not the PAC again who called that road Settlers Way. Near Pretoria there is a small town called Settlers and once again PAC and APLA had nothing to do with this. On whether the term does not have a racist connotation: It has no racist connotation whatsoever. According to our definition the African is the aboriginal of this country. All who show allegiance to Africa and are prepared to abide by the rule of the African majority are Africans regardless of colour. We do not look at your complexion whatsoever. We do not have the word "black" in the PAC. On the future: One has to hope that the elections will be free and fair but I am afraid that up this moment I do not think that will be the position. The PAC has committed itself already that we will honour the results of that election if they are free and fair. But in order for elections to be free and fair the playing fields should be levelled now, and not after the elections. This is what is not taking place in our country at the moment. The media is totally opposed to certain parties especially the PAC. The business community and international community has the same attitude. I don't know how the playing fields can be levelled unless those attitudes are changed. On whether he has the time to relax and how he does it: There is very little time for me to really relax these days because I have so many engagements. I happened to be a farmer but now that belongs to the past because I no longer have time. I do a little reading whenever I have time but I seldom do. I am always engaged. I read everything I can lay my hands on. I love history.
