"When the secret arms deal was enacted, our friends in the West were interested that Estonia's governing circles wouldn't completely fall through this into the Israeli-Russian sphere of influence. Therefore also many secret services started trying to find out who and how much earned from that deal at (the government residence of) Toompea," Aasmae said. He said Israel and Russia were not interested in the success of Estonia's foreign policy, since the principles that the Baltic country's foreign policy is based upon may negatively affect the interests of Russia and Israel. In Aasmae's words Israel had also gained a certain lead on the weapons market before the Western countries, especially the United States, who only recently lifted its arms sales embargo on the Baltics and three Balkan states. "There have also been reports that Russian banks are buying up the bills of exchange issued by the Estonian side to cover the cost of the arms deal, and which Russia can use as an argument against Estonia at the talks," the Estonian opposition politician said. Aasmae said both Russia and Israel are likely to have certain common interests on the international arena in prospect, because also Israel will have to start defending the interests of its settlers in its so-called near abroad, in view of the possibility that Palestine may gain its independence. Aasmae also pointed out common features in the development of the town of Sillamae in Estonia and the Israeli settlements on the occupied territories. Taking into account the whole background of the arms deal, we can state that this became the nail in the coffin of the Estonian foreign policy, he said. The Estonian Government signed the 60 million U.S. dollar arms deal with TAAS Israel Industries Ltd. on Jan. 7, 1993.
