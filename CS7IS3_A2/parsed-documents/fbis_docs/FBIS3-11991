Brazil first established diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Cambodia in 1961, establishing representation in Phnom Penh concurrent with the Brazilian Embassy in New Delhi, India. Afterward that representation became concurrent with the Brazilian Embassy in Bangkok. According to the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, the representation in Phnom Penh was closed down in 1966, but not because relations had been broken between the two countries. Following the internal pacification of Cambodia under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, which was endorsed by Brazilian diplomacy, the Brazilian Government suggested the normalization of bilateral relations, which was confirmed on 25 March with the joint communique. Brazil will open an embassy in Phnom Penh concurrent with the embassy in Bangkok.
