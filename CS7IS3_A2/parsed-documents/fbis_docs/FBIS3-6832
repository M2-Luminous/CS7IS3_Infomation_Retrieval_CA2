"About 200,000 tons of rice will be further imported this month, and the supply is being steadily boosted," Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Hata told a meeting of cabinet ministers. He said there are fewer calls about rice from the public on the emergency telephone lines set up within the ministry and nationwide at the Food Agency's branch offices. "At one time, all the lines were full, but we got only 29 calls on Monday," Hata said. Hata admitted to reporters after the cabinet meeting that his ministry's response to the rice shortage was inadequate. "We should have told the public at an earlier stage about the prospects of supply in the upcoming month," he said. He also conceded that there were problems with the way the ministry ordered the much-criticized blending of domestic rice and imported rice. "We ought to respond with more flexibility since changes in the economy and the trend among consumers are proceeding at a rapid pace," he said. Later in the day, the farm minister apologized to an agricultural committee at the house of representatives for having gone on with reducing rice production last year when the harvest was hit by the bad weather. He indicated, however, that the government will go on cutting down on the amount of land devoted to rice production in the years ahead. "If we discontinue with rice reductions, there will be an oversupply that would have an effect on rice prices and on the incomes of farms," the minister said. Asked about the issue of revising the food control law, Hata said that its structure will be maintained, but that the government will actively adopt the principle of competition.
