ACTION: Interim final regulations with invitation for comment; Correction; Extension of comment period; Compliance with information collection requirements. SUMMARY: On April 29, 1994, the Secretary of Education published in the Federal Register interim final regulations with an invitation for comment for the Student Assistance General Provisions, Federal Family Education Loan programs, and the Federal Pell Grant (59 FR 22348). The final regulations listed the comment period end date as June 20, 1994. Members of the financial aid community have requested an extension of the comment period. The Secretary agrees that a longer comment period would give the financial aid community a better opportunity to thoroughly evaluate the final regulations and submit more comprehensive comments to the Department. Therefore, the Secretary extends the comment period to July 28, 1994, which is 90 days following the April 29 publication date. This document also clarifies the Secretary's intent in publishing ``interim final regulations with invitation for comment,'' adds an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number to certain sections of the regulations, and corrects the effective date statement and corrects an error in the preamble in the final regulations published in the Federal Register on April 29. DATES: Comments must be received on or before July 28, 1994. The corrections to the April 29 regulations and the addition of OMB control numbers in §§668.3, 668.8, 668.12, 668.13, 668.14, 668.15, 668.16, 668.17, 668.22, 668.23, 668.25, 668.26, 668.90, 668.96, 668.113, Appendix A to 34 CFR part 668, 682.414, 682.416, 682.711, and 690.83 are effective July 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments concerning the final regulations should be addressed to Greg Allen and Wendy Macias, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW. (Regional Office Building 3, Room 4318), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;5342. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Greg Allen and Wendy L. Macias, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW. (Regional Office Building 3, Room 4318), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;5343. Telephone (202) 708&hyph;7888. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The final regulations published on April 29 had an effective date of July 1, 1994, in accordance with 20 U.S.C. 1089(c), which required that the Secretary publish such regulations ``in final form by May 1, 1994'' to be in effect for the 1994&hyph;1995 award year, which begins on July 1, 1994. Under the terms of 20 U.S.C. 1089(c), any regulatory changes that the Secretary published after May 1, 1994, could not take effect, at the earliest, until July 1, 1995. Thus, the April 29 regulations are final and effective at least with respect to the period July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995. The ``interim'' nature of the April 29 regulations reflected the possibility that changes might be made to take effect on July 1, 1995. The Secretary solicited public comment in the April 29 final regulations to determine whether any changes should be made to take effect on July 1, 1995, the earliest that any such changes can take effect under 20 U.S.C. 1089(c). In order for any such changes to take effect by July 1, 1995, the changes would, under 20 U.S.C. 1089(c), have to be published in final form by December 1, 1994. Compliance with the information collection requirements in certain sections of the regulations published on April 29 was delayed until those requirements were approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1990, as amended. On June 23, 1994, OMB approved those information collection requirements, and affected parties must now comply with those requirements. The Secretary corrects the effective date statement in the April 29 regulations to reflect this more accurately.
