In February and March 1994, the "Democratic Initiatives" center conducted an opinion poll, which involved 1,799 respondents. It revealed that just 2 percent of the respondents have full confidence in the government, 4 percent -- in the president, 2 percent -- in the Supreme Council chairman, and 2 percent -- in the leadership of local power structures. The level of confidence in Vyacheslav Chornovil, the opposition leader, is not much higher -- just 4 percent of the respondents were fully in his favor. Somewhat higher is the prestige of the militia (6 percent), and 20 percent of the respondents trust the Army. Furthermore, 13.6 percent of the respondents stated their unwillingness to participate in the elections; 63 percent said that they would not like to vote for the same candidate as in the previous elections; and just 13 percent have not changed their preferences. The decision to vote for a particular candidate may be positively influenced mainly by the fact that the candidate is... in favor of a union between Ukraine and Russia. This was pointed out by 48 percent of the respondents. Negative attitude was expressed by 27 percent and yet another 25 percent showed indifference. Some of the respondents considered the candidates' sex as one of their "virtues": 36 percent of them are ready to vote for a female deputy. Thirty-one percent of the respondents like candidates who are in favor of a capitalist economic development, 30 percent -- if they have support of entrepreneurs, 25 percent -- if they are not members of any party. Nineteen percent of the respondents prefer those candidates who assert that authoritarian rule (the "iron" order) is the best road toward democracy. Physical attractiveness of the candidate encourages just 2 percent of the voters. Among the respondents, 54 percent believe that Ukraine will most likely maintain its integrity and independence in the future, 22 percent do not believe in that, 42 percent assume that our country will unite with Russia and Belarus within a Slavic Union, 31 percent believe that it will become a constituent part of a single CIS state (a renewed union), and 28 percent find it plausible that Ukraine will become a part of Russia. At the same time, just 8 percent of respondents positively assessed Russian President Boris Yeltsin. It is of interest that even CPSU General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev got a higher rating -- 16 percent.
