During a conversation with journalists following the inauguration of an artificial limb-making center in Phnom Penh, the prince indicated that the guerrillas had destroyed a bridge and an administrative office of Mongkolborei District, but it was just a "lightning" operation. The radio of the Khmer Rouge affirmed that three columns of guerrillas had attacked government positions on 15 May near the Mongkolborei bridge in the town's market and along the river south of the town on National Route 5. According to the radio, the "liberation" of Mongkolborei enables the Khmer Rouge to control the transport and communications between Battambang and Sisophon and between Sisophon and Poipet. The radio also affirmed that on 14 May the guerrillas had occupied Sangkum Thmei District in Preah Vihear Province, north of Mongkolborei.
