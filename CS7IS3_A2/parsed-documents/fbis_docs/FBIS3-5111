Following is the full text of the statement: As already made public, four immediate steps of simultaneous action for a package solution of the nuclear issue were agreed upon at the DPRK-USA contact in New York on February 25. These steps cover the questions of discontinuing "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises, resuming inter-Korean working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys and starting inspection of the International Atomic Energy Agency for the continuity of safeguards, and the question of holding the third round of DPRK-USA talks in Geneva from March 21. Most of the agreed steps have already entered into a stage of practical implementation. Thus, new prospects have opened for bringing the process of a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue which had been derailed temporarily back to its original track. It is lucky, indeed, that although it seems belatedly, both sides in the agreement confirmed again their stand to seek a negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue on the principles of the DPRK-USA joint statement and decided upon concrete steps and timetable of action. The agreement on the steps of simultaneous action, however, has not been reached through a smooth process. In the past, we have advanced reasonable proposals for a solution of the nuclear problem and made all sincere efforts to carry them into effect and shown a flexibility. Since the second round of DPRK-USA talks we have fulfilled the obligations we assumed voluntarily, as far as we could, in the matter of negotiation with the IAEA and in the matter of North-South dialogue. It is well worth noting that, with a view to removing obstacles in the way of the talks, we put forth a new proposal that the nuclear issue be solved completely in a package deal based on the principle of simultaneous action by both sides. If a solution of the nuclear issue had been promoted as proposed by us from the very outset, it would not have undergone such serious twists and turns in its course, and it would not have taken such a long time to reach a basic agreement on the steps of simultaneous action. In fact, when we take into consideration the fact that half a century long history of confrontation and distrust has lasted between the DPRK and the United States, it is self-evident that either of them is not in a position to urge the other to show confidence first. That is why we have held that if the sides wanted to find a reasonable solution to the problem on an equal and fair basis, they should not urge the other to move first but act simultaneously, and so, have repeatedly urged the U.S. side to respond to simultaneous action in this direction. In the past, however, the U.S. side, far from sincerely accepting our just demand, raised unreasonable preconditions and resorted to delaying tactics, trying to force us to accept its unilateral demand and constantly seeking insidious political aims. As is known, since it accepted our proposal regarding the steps of simultaneously action at the 18th DPRK-USA contact at the end of December last year and arrived at an agreement in principle, the United States openly came out in defence of the IAEA Secretariat which demanded we accept inspection equivalent to routine and ad hoc inspections pursuant to the safeguards agreement. Only recently, it tried to solve the problem by pressure after setting a deadline identical with the February meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors. Such arbitrary and faithless stance of the other side toward the dialogue whipped all our people into fury, and we could not but make a legitimate self-defensive decision. We expressed our firm will to take the road of our own choice, not bound to the promise with the United States, if it persisted in its policy aimed at stifling our Republic, reversing the spirit of agreement with us. The United States requested resuming the New York contact before we carried this will into action. This was a good thing not only for a solution of the nuclear issue but for peace and security in the region around the Korean peninsula, we may say. But the United States created new difficulties in the working out of the agreement, making it conditional on the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South of Korea, an internal affair of our nation, even after the scope of inspection for the continuity of safeguards was agreed upon between the DPRK and the IAEA. We have rejected such persevering argument of our dialogue partner and warned them not to miss the opportunity of saving the dialogue from a crisis. When they withdrew the precondition and said yes to the text of agreement, we appreciated it deservedly. The agreed conclusions on the steps of simultaneous action between the DPRK and the United States this time has created a favorable condition for the third round of talks and a package solution of the nuclear issue. The DPRK and the United States, according to the formula of package deal agreed upon between them, must now take steps for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue such as the termination of the U.S. nuclear threat and hostile policy against the DPRK, the introduction of light water reactors, the improvement of bilateral relations, the resumption of the IAEA's routine and ad hoc inspections of the DPRK's nuclear facilities, and put them into effect. The package deal based on simultaneous action is the only practical and reasonable way for both sides to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue on a completely equal footing, not through confrontation. This has been clearly proved by the whole course of the DPRK-U.S. talks, especially by the latest contact in which the sides agreed on simultaneous action. If the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is resolved in a package deal, it would be decisively conducive to ensuring peace and security in the whole of the Asia-pacific region. We will honestly implement the steps for simultaneous action agreed on recently and make every possible effort to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in a package deal. The solution of the issue now depends on how sincerely the United States, a dialogue partner, works to fulfil its promise. It is only too clear that, no matter what reasonable solution may be adopted, if a party obliged to implement it has no willingness to solve the issue, it is impossible to expect any substantial results. Though just a few days have passed since the publication of the conclusions on simultaneous action reached between the DPRK and the United States in New York, ill-boding moves have been reported one after another, giving rise to doubt about the willingness of the United States to implement the conclusions. The U.S. side made an official announcement that the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South and the IAEA's inspection are preconditions for the suspension of the "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises and the opening of the third-stage talks between the DPRK and the United States On March 3, it expressed full support for the decision of the South Korean authorities not to stage the "Team Spirit 94" conditional on the exchange of special envoys between the two halves of Korea. All these are dangerous acts to endanger the implementation of the DPRK-U.S. agreement, which can never be justified. As everyone knows, the DPRK and the United States set no precondition in agreeing on the steps for simultaneous action. The conclusions reached at the New York contact only mentioned the resumption of the working contact for the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South as a step for simultaneous action. But it did not touch on the fulfilment of the exchange. As for the exchange of special envoys, the DPRK was the first to propose it, motivated by a noble intention to put an end to the tragedy of national division and realise the fellow countrymen's desire for reunification. To make it a success is our consistent position. The exchange of special envoys has not been carried out, however, because the South Korean authorities have distorted the significance of the exchange by contending that it is aimed only at the solution of the nuclear issue, and tried to balk at the DPRK-U.S. talks through it and exacerbate the North-South confrontation blaring that they "will not rule out even a military action." Only when the South Korean authorities stop such unreasonable acts as impudently poking their nose into the discussion of the nuclear issue without their own political view or authority to discuss the matter and make a clear turnabout towards seeking national reunification, the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South will be realised. We are also willing to sincerely implement the agreement on the IAEA's inspection for the continuity of safeguards. A group of inspectors of the IAEA began its activities on March 1 and the competent organ of the DPRK is rendering a proper cooperation in its activities. At a time when the agreement has entered the stage of implementation, however, the U.S. side has brought forward again the unreasonable preconditions which it had failed to include in the conclusions, while fully supporting the conditions raised by the South Korean authorities. All this cannot be construed otherwise than factors which may lead to collapse the full implementation of the conclusions. We take a serious view of the fact that the United States has set inter-Korean exchange of special envoys and the inspection by IAEA as preconditions for the renunciation of the "Team Spirit 94" and the opening of the third round of talks, because it will obviously result in reversing again the agreed conclusions on steps for simultaneous action. Worse still, if those preconditions are accepted, it will cause the grave consequence that the right of decision at the DPRK-U.S. talks would pass to some seditious forces which hate it. As prescribed in the agreed conclusions, unless all the steps of simultaneous action are implemented fully, all the agreed points will automatically go amiss. We have agreed to the inspection by IAEA and the resumption of inter-Korean working contact on the premise that the agency will not take an unreasonable attitude in the course of the inspection for the continuity of the safeguards and the South Korean side will not abuse the exchange of special envoys for such insidious purposes as putting brakes on the DPRK-U.S. talks. It is clear that, if the agency and the South Korean authorities bring forward complicated matters contrary to this and the United States gives up halfway the decision to renounce the "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises and delay the opening of the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks under an absurd pretext, we can not satisfactorily ensure the IAEA's inspection that has already begun, nor can pin any more hope on the DPRK-U.S. talks itself. It is high time that the DPRK and the U.S. faithfully implemented the agreed conclusions on steps for simultaneous action published a few days ago, conscious of their responsibilities and obligations in the solution to the nuclear issue. We will watch the future acts of the dialogue partner.
