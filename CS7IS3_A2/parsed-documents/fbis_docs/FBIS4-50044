The Main Current Problems in Rural Economic Development 1.01 Since the late 1980's, the deep-seated contradictions and problems which had long existed in China's rural economic development, gradually emerged. These contradictions and problems are mainly reflected in the sluggish growth of peasants' income in recent years. Since the beginning of 1992, given a new period of speedy growth in the national economy and an unprecedented thriving market economy, the sluggish growth of peasants' income has not changed. On the contrary, this has made the various new circumstances and new problems which are unfavorable to agriculture and peasants salient and once again is drawing people's great attention. These problems include: The continuous deterioration of trading conditions for agriculture, the issue of IOU's for the purchase of farm products, the outflow of agricultural funds, the holding up of farmlands by development zones, and the added burden on peasants. In the meantime, given the further removal of price controls on farm products and the conditions of a market economy, the questions of whether or not there is a need to protect agriculture and how to protect it have become new hot topics in policy research. All these problems, which have occurred as China changes to a market economic system, seem to imply that the development of China's agriculture and rural economy has entered a crucial period of change. The Importance of Achieving Growth in Peasant Incomes 1.02 Compared with that at the previous stage, the growth of the rural economy during the 1989-1992 period had some totally different characteristics, namely that the growth in peasant incomes basically stagnated despite the fact that the supply of farm products picked up. Between 1989 and 1991, excluding the price factor, the per capita net income of peasants across the country only grew by 0.7 percent. Together with the 5.9 percent in rehabilitation growth in 1992, the average growth rate during the four years was only 1.88 percent. During the same period, calculated at constant prices, the total agricultural output value had an annual average increase of 5.1 percent and grain saw an increase of 2.9 percent; other major farm products, except cotton whose production decreased in 1992 as a result of insect disasters and which only had an average annual growth of 2.2 percent, such as oil-bearing crops, sugar-bearing crops, meats, fruits, vegetables, and aquatic products had increases ranging from 6 to 10 percent. The increased output of farm products unaccompanied by a growth in peasant incomes, by little growth, or even by negative growth in certain years, has been seldom seen since reform and since the PRC was founded. 1.03 Another phenomenon which attracts the same attention as the excessively slow growth in peasant incomes is the continuously widening income gaps between the cities and the countryside and between different regions. For eight years running since 1985, the income of urban residents grew much quicker than that of peasants. Between 1989 and 1992, the annual growth calculated by actual incomes showed that cities were 5 percentage points higher than the countryside. This has once again widened the income gap between cities and the countryside which had been narrowing for some time since reform. In 1978, the ratio between peasants' per capita net income and urban residents' per capita living expenditure income was 1:2.37. In 1984, it narrowed to 1:1.71, and in 1992, it widened again to 1:2.33. The gap has returned to the pre-reform level. 1.04 The income gap between peasants in different regions has also increased very obviously. In 1992, the ratio between peasants in the west, central, and eastern regions was 100:115:166 and the highest-income province (Shanghai) had income 4.49 times higher than the lowest-income province (Gansu). In 1983, the figures were 100:126:144 and 2.69 times respectively. During the period of slow growth in peasant incomes between 1989 and 1992, the annual growth in peasant incomes in the eastern region was 2.29 percent and that in central and the western regions 1.44 and 1.27 percent respectively. This shows that the income gap between peasants in different regions still tends to widen continuously and that the growth in peasant incomes in many regions has stagnated or even decreased in recent years. 1.05 The slow growth in peasant incomes not only directly affects the upgrading of peasants' quality of life and agricultural reinvestment but also has a negative influence on the growth of the entire national economy. In the three years between 1989 and 1991, the actual per capita living expenditure of peasants across the country only increased by 0.07 yuan each year. We can see from this that in many regions, peasants' living standards virtually have not improved and the so-called added burden on peasants is related to this. During the same period, peasants' per capita expenditure on the purchase of productive fixed assets (excluding the price factor) decreased by 22.2, 35.4, and 18.2 percent from 1988. Peasants' expenditure on purchasing chemical fertilizer, pesticide, and sheets of plastic film in recent years have also decreased and this will have an adverse and sluggish influence on agricultural production. 1.06 It is also necessary to point out that peasant incomes are becoming an increasingly important variable in the flowing course of the national economy. As the degree of commercialization and monetization of the rural economy is continuing to rise, the proportion of money income in peasant incomes has risen from 40 percent in the pre-reform period to nearly 70 percent at the present time. This means that an increase or decrease of one percentage point in peasant incomes has a much greater influence on the demand expansion of the national economy than in the past. Due to the sluggish growth in peasant incomes, in 1992, the proportion of rural retail sales volume in the total volume of retail sales decreased by 5.5 percentage points from 1984 and by 3.1 percentage points from 1988. In the four years, peasants refrained from purchasing 82 billion yuan's worth of commodities and this is one of the main reasons why the home market has been sluggish during the past few years. 1.07 For a long time, due to the absolute short supply of farm products, the guiding principle in formulating rural policy was always to give priority to ensuring the supply goal of farm products. However, following the radical changes in the supply-demand pattern of farm products in the mid-1980's, the growth of agricultural production no longer simply corresponded to the growth in peasant incomes and the importance in peasant incomes as a motivation for growth had greatly increased. Furthermore, at the microscopic level, since reform, peasants can expand supply only on the premise of increasing income and, if the peasant incomes are as bad as expected, the government will find it very difficult to achieve the supply goal. Therefore, like maintaining the growth of a balanced supply-demand structure for farm products, maintaining the sustained growth in peasant incomes should become the basic goal for the formulation of China's agricultural and rural policies in the 1990's. The Main Factors Restricting Growth in Peasant Incomes 1.08 It is generally held that two factors have resulted in the sluggish growth in peasant incomes since 1989. First, the trading conditions for agriculture have worsened. Compared with 1988, the price index of farm products rose by 10.87 percent in 1992 (prices on the grain market have fallen since 1989, reaching their nadir in October 1992), whereas the price index of agricultural capital goods rose by 33.59 percent. Second, during the period of economic rationalization, the speedy growth of township and town enterprises was curbed. Between 1989 and 1991, peasant incomes from nonagricultural sources fell by 25 percentage points from the previous years, the percentage basically remaining at the 1988 level. 1.09 However, a deeper analysis shows that in addition to the unfavorable factors, which are caused by the abovementioned short-term policies, there are deep-seated reasons for the sluggish growth in peasant incomes in recent years. In order to demonstrate this, we can compare the changes in the main sources of peasant income growth at different stages since 1978. The speediest growth in peasant incomes was in the 1978-1984 period when the actual average per capita income growth was 15.1 percent annually. The same period also saw farm products having their speediest growth, an average annual growth of 6.5 percent. At this stage, the growth in peasant incomes mainly benefited from the supernormal growth in farm products in the early years of reform and iis characteristics were that agricultural production increased as did peasant incomes. At the second stage, namely between 1985 and 1988, despite the fact that the growth rate of agriculture lowered to 4.1 percent, peasants' per capita actual income retained an annual growth rate of 5 percent. The main reason for this was that township and town enterprises began to emerge during this period and income from nonagricultural sectors supported the continuous growth in peasant incomes. The characteristics of this stage can be summed up as the slowing down of agricultural growth and the continuous growth in peasant incomes. However, during the 1989-1992 period, the growth rate of agriculture rose to 5.1 percent but the actual per capita income of peasants only grew by 2 percent, representing an increase in agricultural production unaccompanied by an increase in peasant incomes. This "increase in output unaccompanied by an increase in income" in fact means that the major motivating factors which had supported the sustained growth in peasant incomes in the first two stages, namely the growth patterns in agriculture and in township and town enterprises, have already undergone some phased change. In fact, as the analysis given below shows, the real challenges we are faced with are that the previous growth pattern of the rural economy has difficulty in supporting the sustained growth in peasant incomes and that, if radical readjustment measures are lacking, then the sluggish growth in peasant incomes in recent years will probably become a long-term tendency. Below, we are going to analyze the major phased changes facing rural economic development. 1.10 First, there have been profound changes in the supply pattern of farm products and in the form of agricultural growth. Prior to reform, China had been short of farm product supplies for a long time. The speedy growth of agriculture motivated by rural reform reversed this situation in just a few years. In approximately the mid-1980's, China's farm-product supply pattern began to radically change. This was first reflected in the changes in the consumption level and consumption structure of urban and rural residents. Following the improvement in the supply of foodstuffs, in 1983, the per capita daily calorie intake from food by peasants in China exceeded 2,400 kilocalories for the first time. In the mid-1980's, the daily calorie intake from food by urban and rural residents had already reached 2,900 kilocalories. After urban and rural residents steadily passed the point of simply having enough food and clothing, Engel's Coefficient began to steadily lower, the per capita direct consumption of grain by urban and rural residents began to fall in 1986 in absolute terms, and food consumption began to change from an increase in quantity to the upgrading of the quality structure. Second, following the change of the consumption structure, agricultural growth began to feel the restriction of demand and the income elasticity of major farm products began to decrease. According to estimates by relevant experts, comparing the 1985-1992 period and the 1979-1984 period, the income elasticity of grain fell from 0.63 to -0.15, that of oil-bearing crops fell from 2.94 to 0.49, that of pork from 1.34 to 0.53, that of poultry from 3.06 to 0.75, that of sugar-bearing crops from 0.94 to 0.09, and only the income elasticity of aquatic products rose from 0.52 to 0.86, that of eggs basically remained the same, and that of cloth fell from 0.76 to zero. Since the mid-1980's, it has been difficult to sell farm products. Although China's per capita grain output in the 1990-1991 period was basically the same as in the 1983-1984 period, prices on the grain market fell considerably and grain did not sell easily, a clear sign that agricultural growth was restricted by demand. The change from the restriction of supply to the restriction of demand or, rather, from mainly aggregate contradictions to structural contradictions is a historical change in China's farm products supply-demand structure. This change began in the mid-1980's and will play a role for a long time in future agricultural growth. Precisely because of the motivation of the change in this pattern, China's agricultural growth pattern will change from the previous pure quantity-type growth to a type of growth stressing both quantity and quality. 1.11 The restriction of demand is not all bad. Rather, it makes it possible to use market mechanisms to effectively allocate resources. However, what we have to say here is that the sluggish growth in peasant incomes in recent years, and the prospects for peasant income growth in the future, are directly bound up with the changes in this pattern. First, given the short supply of farm products in the early years of reform, the "sponge effect," namely where an increase in supply is immediately swallowed by demand, no longer exists. This means that the growth in peasant incomes no longer simply corresponds to the growth in agricultural output. Second, given the existence of the restrictions of demand, if the supply structure of farm products does not adjust to the changes in their demand structure, it also means that an increase in output is not accompanied by an increase in income. In fact, the readjustment of China's agricultural production structure already lags behind the changes in the supply-demand pattern. This is reflected by the very salient structural contradictions in the supply-demand structure in recent years. Third, once China officially rejoins GATT as a member, the pressure from external competition will increase and this also means that it will be much more difficult to support peasant incomes with agricultural growth. Lastly, if the course of agricultural transformation is not accompanied by technological progress, the effect of decreasing marginal returns from agricultural investment will occur conspicuously and peasants' efforts to increase income will be partially invalidated by the accelerated increase in agricultural costs. 1.12 Therefore, we have come to the viewpoint that the characteristics of great phased changes have already begun to appear in China's agricultural development and this is a token that agricultural development is stepping into a new period. We can conclude from this that if we are unable to effectively promote structural reform, it is already impossible for the current structural framework of agriculture to sustain a continuous fast growth rate in peasant incomes, although peasants derive 60 to 70 percent of their income from agriculture at the present time. 1.13 We are now going to analyze the profound changes facing the development of township and town enterprises. As for the question of increasing peasant incomes, people set more hope on township and town enterprises. As the great invention by Chinese peasants in the 1980's, township and town enterprises really play a vital role in opening employment channels for peasants and increasing their income. The development of township and town enterprises in recent years has been not slow. In 1992, their total output value reached 1,700 billion yuan, of which 1,300 billion was in industrial output value and represented more than one-third of China's total industrial output value. However, since the late 1980's, the tendency has obviously appeared in the development of township and town enterprises that their capital is becoming increasingly intensive and their ability to employ labor has weakened. The output value of township and town enterprises in 1992 doubled that of 1988, while the number of their employees only increased by 10.9 percent, showing a decrease in employment elasticity from 0.35 to 0.13. Since 1988, the fixed assets of collective enterprises at the township and village levels have increased by an annual average of 18.4 percent, while the number of employees hired per 10,000 yuan of assets decreased from 3.1 in 1988 to 1.8 in 1991. Between 1984 and 1988, township and town enterprises employed 12.6 million people from the agricultural sector, while only an annual average of 2.6 million were employed during the 1989-1992 period, representing a fraction of that during the former period. 1.14 There will be an annual increase in surplus manpower by over 10 million people in China's rural areas in the future. The question of how to dissolve this huge unemployment pressure and fully utilize and develop these rich labor resources is the most challenging one for rural development in the 1990's. The problem now is that the manpower not absorbed by agriculture cannot be absorbed by township and town enterprises, which we have always considered the best Chinese-style way to resolve unemployment in rural areas! Does this indicate that there is a need to reassess our previous understanding all over again? 1.15 In fact, some recent analyses have already pointed out the inherent weaknesses in the structure and composition of township and town enterprises. The following are the two major weaknesses: First, township and town enterprises are extremely scattered and are not in step with urbanization, so they are unable to effectively nurture the development of tertiary industry and this in turn leads to the unbalanced development of secondary and tertiary industries among township and town enterprises. This is an important point which restricts township and town enterprises from expanding employment. Second, the community-based nature of township and town enterprises restricts the flow of production elements and, coupled with other factors, leads to the distortion of the prices of production elements, thus causing the township and town enterprises in some developed regions to "replace labor with capital" too soon. 1.16 We have come to the view that the contradictions covered up in the early years of the development of China's township and town enterprises are being gradually exposed. This means that, like agriculture, township and town enterprises are also faced with major phased changes in their further development. From this, we have come to the conclusion that if we fail to effectively readjust the strategy for township and town enterprises, the present pattern can no longer effectively resolve the unemployment problem in rural areas nor can it continue to support the comparatively quick growth in peasant incomes. Price Protection and Structural Readjustment 1.17 According to estimates by the quarters concerned, in order for peasants to lead a comparatively comfortable life by the end of this century, their per capita net income should reach 1,200 yuan (at 1990 prices) which requires that peasant incomes increase at an annual rate of 6.3 percent from 1993 onward. Obviously, under the restrictive conditions mentioned previously, it is very difficult to achieve this goal. In other words, in order to promote the continuous growth in peasant incomes for a period of time to come, it is necessary to make a policy choice about opening up new sources of income. In discussions in recent years, various different views have gradually concentrated on a choice between two policies: The first is that we should adopt a price protection policy for major farm products and the second is that we should formulate and adopt a new policy which promotes structural readjustment. 1.18 The price protection policy we are talking about here is whereby, after controls on grain prices have been lifted, the state should fix minimum protective prices for grain purchases to stabilize grain production and simultaneously increase peasant incomes. Most people agree with this policy proposal but some disagree and have raised several questions worthy of further discussion. The first is the question of whether or not we are able to grant subsidies. They maintain that financial subsidies are needed to form a price higher than the market price; that if the protective price is inappropriate, its protective role does not work; and that if the protective price is too high, the financial burden will be very heavy. In adopting price protection policies, North America, the EC, Japan, and Taiwan each have only a small agricultural population which is approximately 20 percent of the total population. That is to say, the majority subsidizes the minority. China's present agricultural population accounts for 70 percent or more of the total and, in these circumstances, it is very difficult to pursue a price protection policy. The second question is that of efficiency. The price protection policy inevitably causes price distortions and leads to the loss of efficiency in resources allocation. In this respect, developed countries have also drawn a lesson. While creating a huge burden, subsidies also lead to a great surplus of farm products and an excess waste of resources. Moreover, given the serious unemployment situation in China's rural areas, the interests of the price protection policy will be shared by the large rural population and will in fact increase the cost of shifting rural manpower from the agricultural sector and will, in turn, cost us the opportunity for structural readjustment. In addition, there is the problem that agricultural costs chase prices, namely the "return of price parity." In short, before adopting the price protection policy, we need to consider various factors and weigh all advantages and disadvantages. Our basic view is that it is, after all, necessary to pursue the protective price system at the present stage. We should at least ensure that peasants do not make a loss from growing grain crops. This is also out of consideration for the country's grain security. However, we must know that this policy is very limited in resolving the problem of peasant incomes and that it is very unrealistic if we set all our hopes of increasing peasant incomes on protective prices in the future. 1.19 In our opinion, it is a more practical and positive idea to seek and open up new sources for increasing peasant incomes in the future through adopting a new policy or measure which promotes structural readjustment and through promoting the further reform of the rural industrial structure. The structural readjustment we are talking about here not only includes the readjustment of the agricultural structure and the internal industrial structure of rural areas but also the readjustment of economic structure between cities and the countryside. It not only means readjusting the industrial structure but, more fundamentally, changing the current employment structure through the readjustment of the industrial structure so that the free flow, rational combination, and optimum allocation of all production elements and resources within a greater scope can be achieved. In light of the inherent demand of rural economic development and of past experiences, the main points of the new policy which can promote structural readjustment are: We must not limit it to rural areas but should carry it out in both cities and the countryside. We should combine the internal structural readjustment of rural areas with the drive for urbanization and pursue a new round of structural reforms with urbanization as the central issue. We must intrtoduce more extensively market mechanisms and let price mechanisms play a better role in regulating the allocation of resources. We must pay more attention to the promotion of advanced and practical farming technology and support the efficiency of structural readjustment with technology. We must insist on making innovations in the organizational system to seek and establish the new organizational form and order of the future mobile society. In short, in our opinion, structural readjustment is a major force promoting economic development and China's rural development which takes structural reforms as the central issue has totally different characteristics from the past and richer contents. II. Create a Macropolicy Environment Which Suits Structural Readjustment 2.01 The rural industrial structure in the 1980's was basically readjusted in the rural areas themselves and under the condition of not changing the original urban and rural economic patterns. Whether the readjustment of the crop-farming and agricultural structures in the early years, or the rise of township and town enterprises which came afterward, the basic focus of the policy is to resolve the problems in the rural areas themselves. Such being the case, the readjustment of the industrial structure in rural areas is still often restricted by the macropolicy environment. As we said earlier, the question remains: Is it okay to limit structural readjustment to rural areas themselves? This involves one fundamental point, namely, whether or not there is the need to readjust the traditional economic development strategy and its policy environment and whether or not we have come to the time for the readjustment and how to readjust it. In fact, discussions and arguments by the relevant quarters over this question have continued since rural reform but it was not until recently that this question was put on the agenda for policymaking. The Necessity To Readjust the Traditional Development Strategy 2.02 For a long time, the strategy for developing the national economy has been that the development of heavy industry takes precedence over others. This form of traditional development strategy is of historical necessity. In the early years of the PRC, and under the prevailing international environment, the most important task was to build as quickly as possible a complete industrial system with heavy industry as the pillar. As the task was put forward, it was first necessary to solve the problem of primitive accumulation for industrialization. Obviously, under the prevailing historical conditions, in order to complete the task of primitive accumulation, it was impossible to rely on China's own weak light industry, still less on international aid, but on agriculture and rural areas. Therefore, in the process of national industrialization which followed, we gradually formed a whole set of macropolicy environment and economic management systems suited to this strategy, which gave priority to the development of heavy industry and special accumulative mechanisms. 2.03 For various historical reasons, in order to extract accumulations from agriculture and the rural areas and convert them into capital for industrialization, our specific practice was to adopt the system of state monopoly for the purchasing and marketing of farm products. Under this system, we lowered the cost of industrial raw materials and the wage costs through the monopoly purchase of farm products at low prices and acquired an excess profit through raising the prices of industrial manufactured goods. This excess profit kept changing into funds for industrialization through financial means. According to expert analyses and calculations, from 1952 to 1978, owing to the exchange of industrial and agricultural products at unequal prices, the funds flowing from agriculture to industry amounted to 391.7 billion yuan and the funds diverted from revenue income sources to industry totaled 93.5 billion yuan giving an overall value of 485.2 billion yuan. After deducting the financial returns to agriculture, the net flow of funds from agriculture came to 312 billion yuan, equivalent to 73.2 percent of the original value of the nonagricultural fixed assets of state-owned enterprises during the same period. 2.04 In order to guarantee the realization of this special accumulative mechanism, a policy environment and structural conditions which matched it were needed. This was mainly reflected in the following three aspects. The first was the artificially distorted prices of products and production elements. Given an extreme shortage of capital, in order to quickly develop capital- intensive industries, the state adopted the policy of: Suppressing the prices of farm products and raw materials, wages, and the prices of daily necessities and labor services; maintaining low interest rates and exchange rates; and raising the prices of industrial manufactured goods, thus maximizing the industrial profit rate and accumulative capability. Second, given the price distortions, it was necessary to allocate resources through a highly centralized planned system and administrative means and to strictly limit the free exchange of products and the free flow of production elements. In order to suppress the prices of farm products in rural areas, market prices and the market were eliminated altogether. In order to keep the opportunity cost of agricultural labor low and to control the scope and effectiveness of low-price welfare distribution in cities, China adopted a strict identity and household management system and firmly bound peasants to their land through a strict city-countryside segregation system, excluding them from the process of industrialization and urbanization. The third was to establish a microfoundation which suited the planned management structure. In rural areas, China instituted a people's commune-based collective economic system, integrated government administration with commune management, and deprived peasants of their decisionmaking power to ensure that agricultural production and management were placed under the government's direct intervention. In the cities, China built an economy with state ownership and state management as the mainstay, in which the government exercised planned management of enterprises and enterprises were merely production and labor units. 2.05 The traditional development strategy relied on the accumulations of rural areas and on the government's very strong capability to mobilize resources. This enabled China to basically establish a comparatively complete industrial system within a fairly short time. Its historical contributions and positive significance deserve affirmation. However, after the industrial system was basically established, following the diversified and specialized development of materials production departments and the increasingly complex national economic life, the weaknesses in the original structure and policy environment became increasingly obvious. In this process, although the goal of the strategy whereby the development of heavy industry took precedence over others was revised to some degree, its structure and policy environment remained basically unchanged. The microscopic low efficiency and the waste of macroscopic resources allocation seriously hindered the normal development of the national economy. In particular, under this traditional strategy, agricultural productive forces remained stagnant as a result of a long-term inability to make accumulations and a high degree of tension developed between the population and the land as large numbers of the rural population and work force were unable to shift smoothly in keeping with the industrialization process. All this shows that the traditional development strategy and its policy and structure could no longer be continued and had to be radically changed. It is not difficult to understand why rural reform unexpectedly took the lead when this kind of readjustment began. 2.06 The point is that, after 15 years of rural reform, extremely profound changes have occurred in the rural economy and its microscopic operational mechanisms, whereas the macropolicy environment, though having been relaxed, has not been radically changed. This is first reflected by the relationship between industry and agriculture and the distribution of national income. To date, the pattern of supporting industry with agricultural accumulations has not been radically reversed. In the process of industrialization, countries around the world have to have agriculture nurture industry. However, general experience shows that the nurturing time cannot be too long, otherwise a huge cost has to be paid. China's past experience has already explained this. Under the new condition of extensively introducing market mechanisms, the government should and must adopt a necessary support policy and protective measures for agriculture, which is a special sector, otherwise history will repeat itself. 2.07 More importantly, the current macropolicy environment already seriously hinders the development of the rural economy and its change into a market structure and has become a difficult point in reform. As we have said previously, in order to guarantee the further growth of agriculture, the rural economy, and peasants' income, we must launch a new structural readjustment and this demands market mechanisms play a fuller role so that production elements can freely flow and recombine within a greater scope. However, in the macropolicy environment, the distorted prices of products and production elements, the administrative intervention which is sometimes strict and sometimes loose, and the various manmade limitations on the flow of production elements hinder the normal growth of the products market and the production elements market and are becoming major limitations to the further development of the rural economy. In rural areas, this is mainly reflected in the planned purchase and marketing system which has not been thoroughly abolished and the city-countryside segregation system. In addition, this distorted macropolicy environment has led to the excessive number of frictions and contradictions in the process of changing the structure. This is because reform has created a new market-oriented mainstay of operations [jing ying zhu ti 4842 3602 0031 7555]. On the other hand, because the macropolicy environment which conforms to the form of the previous development strategy has not been changed accordingly, the two inevitably have acute frictions and contradictions, leading to special difficulties during the period of changing the structure. Therefore, it is high time the traditional development strategy and its macropolicy environment are changed. Smash the Key Links of the Old Economic Pattern 2.08 According to the experiences in countries and regions whose economies have developed in a sustained and speedy way since World War II, the development strategy which increases the speed and stability of economic development and possesses inherent structure-optimizing mechanisms is a one with a comparative advantage. By a strategy with a comparative advantage, we mean that we confirm an industrial structure in keeping with a comparative advantage in resources and readjust the industrial structure in keeping with the dynamic changes in the comparative advantage in resources, to ensure that we can fully use resources with a relative advantage to promote the development of the national economy at every stage of economic development. 2.09 The key to readjusting the relationships between industry and agriculture, and between cities and the countryside, does not lie in how we should "subsidize" or "protect" agriculture or other industries through government but in how we should develop the products market and production elements market so that the relative prices of all production elements and products can accurately reflect their relative scarcity. This way, the development of all industries can be rationally laid out in keeping with market price information, their own economic advantages brought into play, and equal competition achieved. Viewed from the angle of readjusting the traditional development strategy, in deepening rural reform we must mainly make breakthroughs in two things at the present stage, namely: Thoroughly smashing the planned purchase and marketing system and the city-countryside segregation system to promote the growth of the products market and the production elements market. 2.10 Thoroughly reforming the planned purchase and marketing system. Since the central authorities announced the abolition of the planned purchase and marketing system in 1985, the scope of planned purchase and marketing of farm products has shrunk greatly. However, the planned purchase and marketing of grain and some industrial materials is still, to varying degrees, being continued and this still has a very great influence on the development of the rural economy. Owing to the stagnant growth in grain output at one time, the purchase of grain has returned from the contract purchase as confirmed in 1985 to state purchase. Despite the fact that grain prices are close to the market prices after their prices were raised on several occasions, state purchase means that grain still cannot be totally regulated by the market. State purchase has the sense of obligation and taxation and is compulsory. In the process of implementing state purchase, it is apportioned among all peasant households. This, in fact, limits peasants from readjusting the industrial structure and rationally allocating resources in keeping with market price signals. Moreover, by retaining the form of state purchase, we in fact retain the government's right to use administrative means from time to time, and purchasing organizations which are performing the purchase tasks can continue to treat peasants haughtily. This leaves room for a structural relapse. Although this situation has changed a little in recent years since the removal of grain price controls was announced, it is still there. Therefore, we should quicken the reform of the grain purchasing and marketing system as we set up the grain risk fund and the reserve system and we should lift price controls over cotton and silkworm cocoons as soon as possible. 2.11 Break the city-countryside segregation system. Central Document No. 1 of 1984 allowed peasants intending to set up industries, do business, and offer services to take care of their grain supplies and to settle in small towns. In practice, this encouraged the rural population to migrate to small towns and promoted the development of these small towns. Later, however, this trend did not continue following the widening gap between the parity price and negotiated price of grain, the various unmatched urban management and development policies, and the changes in the macroeconomic environment. In recent years, following the development of the small industrial districts for township and town enterprises and of small towns run by peasants themselves, and the upsurge of the "wave of migrant workers," the hot wave of peasants flocking into cities has reappeared, having an impact on the old order in which cities and the countryside are segregated and loosening the city-countryside segregation system. The segregation between cities and the countryside inevitably distorts the prices of production elements making it impossible to fully develop the rich labor resources. On the other hand, it makes it impossible to use capital rationally and effectively. It not only limits the development of rural areas but narrows the room for the structural readjustment of cities themselves. Therefore, in order to promote interaction between cities and the countryside and readjust the industrial structure in a concentrated way, it is necessary to reform the various economic and social policies which segregate cities and the countryside, including those for household management, employment, housing, education, social security, and city development. The first step in breaking the barriers between cities and the countryside is that the state must no longer continue to foster and protect the sense of superiority of city residents, must not protect the privileges of cities at the expense of the interests of peasants and rural areas, and gradually cancel "shifting agriculture into nonagricultural sectors [nong zhuan fei 6593 6567 7236]." Second, while allowing peasants to enter and settle in small towns and in medium and small cities, we should also allow them to come into big cities and megacities and improve and perfect city management methods accordingly. The Probability of Creating a New Macropolicy Environment 2.12 Reforming the macropolicy environment which suits the traditional development strategy means a readjustment of all vested interests. If this is not done properly, it will lead to social contradictions. However, with the past dozen years or more of reform, China's comprehensive national strength has continuously increased and the people's living standards have greatly improved, people have a stronger psychological endurance for the reform of their own interests, and everyone tends increasingly to sympathize with market structure reform. All this has created the basic preconditions for pursuing this reform. 2.13 Owing to the changes brought about in the industrial structure by the speedy economic growth in the 1980's, especially the speedy development of light industry, China's industrial accumulative capability has obviously strengthened. With the readjustment of the prices of major farm products on several occasions, the exchange of industrial and farm products already tends to be at equal prices. Following the speedy increase in the income of city staff and workers, the Engel's Coefficient of food consumption began to decrease. In 1991, grain expenditure only accounted for 6.5 percent of the living expenses of urban residents. This meant that low-priced farm products no longer played a decisive role in maintaining low labor costs. The contribution of farm products supplies to urban society has already had a change in nature, namely that it has changed from offering accumulations for industry into offering security for society. In view of this, there no longer exist preconditions for continuing the policies of planned purchase and marketing and of city-countryside segregation. 2.14 Since reform, there have been noticeable changes in the accumulative form of national income and in the course of capital flows. Following the growth of enterprises' incomes and personal discretionary incomes, banking and credit have accordingly replaced finance as the main channel of financing and investment; securities, insurance, and real estate have opened up new areas of investment; and banks' savings-absorbing ability has greatly strengthened and a diversified investment pattern has already been formed. On this basis, we not only find it necessary to deepen monetary system reform but we also have increasingly ripe conditions. As long as we straighten out the monetary system and policy and maintain the stability of the state's various basic reform policies, coupled with the people's inherent tendency to save money, the accumulation rate and utilization rate of national income will not decrease overall. In the meantime, since we have straightened out the distorted policy environment so that the comparative advantages of different sectors and different regions can be fully released, it will greatly increase the overall efficiency of the national economy. 2.15 Quickening the development of the products and production elements market is also badly needed for further opening to the outside world, and participating in international competition, and for the government to establish new regulating and controlling mechanisms. China's rejoining GATT as a member will mean that industrial and farm products will, without exception, participate in international competition. If we do not perfect the market regulating and controlling mechanisms as soon as possible so that all sectors can enhance their own competitiveness according to market rules, then we will lose the relative economic advantage we have or even let our national income drain away through irrational prices. Viewed from the level of the state's macroscopic regulating and controlling mechanisms, the original purchase and marketing system which guarantees the supply of accumulations from agriculture to industry has already become a big burden on the government's expenditure. As a result of the fact that controls over the purchasing prices of major farm products have been lifted while the sales prices in cities lag behind, the amount the government has to allocate from its budget to subsidize the price difference between purchase and marketing comes to tens of billions of yuan and the efficiency this produces is becoming increasingly low and the state will find it increasingly difficult to support it financially. 2.16 In the forthcoming structural readjustment, the most active force is still the hundreds of millions of peasants. In fact, in recent years, peasants have begun to take advantage of the current reform environment to tackle the deep-level composition of the irrational traditional development strategy. What is most noteworthy is the trend wherein peasants are breaking the barriers between cities and the countryside and directly participating in urbanization. According to expert surveys and estimates, the migrant population flowing from the countryside into cities has rapidly increased since the mid-1980's. In 1988, the total number of migrant population had already reached 70 million with 59.34 percent flowing from rural areas. In 1992, the migrant population coming from the countryside into cities remained at 35.75 million per day, most of whom were job seekers. The unstoppable migrant population has created the "wave of peasant workers" which is worsening annually and has become a hot point of concern to society and the media. Peasants' entry into cities has not only quickened the development of tertiary industry but also spurred the reform of the city management structure. In megacities like Beijing there are already residential areas for the migrant population such as "Zhejiang Village." In the villages in these cities, the autonomy of residents in the real sense has begun to emerge. Special economic zones and development areas like Shenzhen, Xiamen, Haikou, and Beihai have a comparatively high proportion of migrant population. They have become migrant cities which are different from other cities. Their development and management have also become more suited to the population flows. In places where township and town enterprises are comparatively concentrated, a number of small cities and towns are quickly emerging, even such new cities as Zhejiang's Longgang Township which was all built by the pooling of funds among peasants themselves. 2.17 Another notable phenomenon is that since price controls on grain have been lifted, the nongovernmental circulation channels formed under the previous "double-track pricing system" for grain purchase and marketing have been rapidly expanding. State-owned grain stations find it "difficult to purchase grain." On the other hand, nongovernmental grain dealers are unprecedentedly active. According to surveys, in typically big agricultural provinces, the volume of interprovincial grain exchange through nonstate channels already exceeds one-fourth of the total. In the entire circulation of farm products including grain, there is an active large sales force consisting of tens of thousands of peasants. A number of wholesale markets run by peasants themselves have been set up, forming a new and noticeable pivot for farm products circulation channels. The wholesale volume of vegetables in Beijing's Dazhongsi Wholesale Market, for instance, already accounts for over one-third of the city's total supplies. 2.18 Following the reform of the city industrial enterprise system and the monetary system, the segregation in reciprocal investment between cities and the countryside is being broken through. At present, it happens that in various localities peasants go into cities and contract on state-run or collective enterprises and that township and town enterprises and city enterprises carry out joint operations, cooperate, and buy or even hold each other's shares. Moreover, some enterprises in cities, especially some food processing enterprises, are beginning to change from dependence on the government to directly establishing affiliated or cooperative relationships with peasant producers. They play a very positive leading role in the production of some farm products. 2.19 To sum up what we have talked about above, we can conclude that China's rural economy in the 1990's will enter a stage of change in its development strategy. At this stage, the structural readjustment for the establishment of new relationships between cities and the countryside and for a development strategy for the national economy will be the basic characteristics of rural economic development. Changing the traditional macropolicy environment and promoting the further growth of the products market and the production elements market in order to complete this strategic change, will be the mainstream of rural reform in the 1990's.
