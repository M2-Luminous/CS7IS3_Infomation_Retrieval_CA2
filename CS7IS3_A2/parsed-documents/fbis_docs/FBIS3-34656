Are you pleased? [Al-Zaydan] We are not pleased. It is not an agreement we are proud of; you should be proud of it. It is better for you than for us, that is clear to everyone. [Einstein] Why? [Al-Zaydan] Because you got everything you want, and we the Palestinians, received everything you offered us. I regret to say that due to the situation we were forced to accept it since we could not get anything better. If the Israelis had taken a bold decision to evacuate the settlements in the Gaza Strip, the whole predicament the police minister has referred to about the need for coordination between the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the Palestinian police force would not have been necessary. You would have simply put up a fence near the Gaza Strip. There would not have been differences of opinion about the crossings and the police. [Einstein] Does that mean that what is upsetting you is that the settlements are staying in the Gaza Strip? [Al-Zaydan] Believe me, that not only disturbs us, but also you, and deep down you know that it will complicate matters. We Palestinians view this agreement as a start, a new opening, a step forward, in the direction of a comprehensive, just peace. But this agreement on its own is not comprehensive peace and it cannot be relied upon to bring full peace. That is not possible. [Einstein] You know, as I do, that it is an interim arrangement based on Israeli-Palestinian cooperation in many fields, and in fact its success will be tested through that cooperation. Do you believe cooperation will be fully achieved? [Al-Zaydan] I see it as a test for the Palestinians and Israel. Can we make progress, take several more steps, or remain deadlocked, that is the test. I hope that both of us will succeed and we will go forward. [passage omitted]
