Usov, president of AKPO joint-stock company, and President Nursultan Nazarbayev -- from the "Novosti" newscast] [Text] The world's first fast breeder reactor at Aktau, the center of Mangistau oblast, has been shut down, just like many other industrial installations in the Republic. The reason for this is that there is no fuel -- or, to be more precise, there is no money with which to buy it. This despite the fact that the Republic has its own fuel resources. Debts and nonpayments within the Republic are increasing. Suppliers themselves have no funds. The economic crisis is hitting specialists worst. You cannot survive without a proper salary here. [Usov] A quarter of our staff have left the works during the last four months. It is not just that we cannot pay wages, the two main problems are: 1) We cannot pay railway charges; and 2) We cannot pay customs duty. But we cannot keep our telephones going, either. We cannot get any work done. [Nugmanova] In this situation President Nazarbayev offers a stark solution. He says all subsidies to enterprises from the budget should end. Loss-making plants must be declared bankrupt. It is cheaper for the state to pay unemployment benefit to workers made redundant when these plants close than to subsidize them. [Nazarbayev] [words indistinct] so, the state will not issue any worthless money.
