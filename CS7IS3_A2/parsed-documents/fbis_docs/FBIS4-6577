In his speech he charged that the United States was using the United Nations as a tool for suppressing the people and abusing it for the attainment of its aims. "The confrontation today is a confrontation with imperialism," he said. Saying he did not pin any hope on the UN Charter which had already been violated and destroyed, he went on: "Has North Korea occupied Kuwait? Or has it reached the nuclear arms on the earth? Is this the reason why they abuse and threaten North Korea and attempt to strike it? Aren't they going too far? "We must fight a bloody fight against imperialism. We will fight to the last man to defend our rights."
