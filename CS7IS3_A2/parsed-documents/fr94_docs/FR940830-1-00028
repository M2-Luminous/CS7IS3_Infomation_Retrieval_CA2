FR940830-1-00028 FR940830-1-00002 (3) *␣*␣* * * * * * (g) Formal technical evaluations. Except for the procedures prescribed by subpart 36.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations for architect-engineer services, SBA will not authorize formal technical evaluations for sole source 8(a) procurement requirements. *␣*␣* * * * * * (i) Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs). (1) For purposes of the 8(a) program, a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) is not an 8(a) contract award. Each order to be issued under the BOA is an individual contract. As such, there must be a separate offer and acceptance of each BOA order before it may be issued through the 8(a) program as an 8(a) contract award. The 8(a) Participant must be eligible to receive each new order at the time of the order. For example, a concern's size status does not relate back to the time that the BOA was executed. Instead, a concern must be small at the time of the issuance of each new order. (2) Once a concern's term of program participation expires, or the concern otherwise exits the 8(a) program, new orders cannot be issued through the 8(a) program because the concern is no longer eligible to receive new 8(a) awards. §124.308 [Amended] 38. Section 124.308 would be further amended by removing the words ``approved 8(a) business support level or the'' contained in paragraph (e)(1)(iii). 39. Section 124.309(c) would be revised to read as follows: §124.309 Barriers to acceptance. * * * * * (c) Adverse Impact. SBA has made a written determination that acceptance of the procurement for 8(a) award would have an adverse impact on an individual small business, a group of small businesses located in a specific geographical location, or other small business programs. The adverse impact concept is designed to protect small business concerns which are performing or are seeking to perform Government contracts awarded outside the 8(a) program. (1) In determining whether or not the acceptance of a requirement would have an adverse impact on an individual small business, SBA will consider all relevant factors. (i) In connection with an individual small business, SBA presumes adverse impact to exist when a small business concern has performed a specific requirement for at least 24 months, it is performing the requirement at the time it is offered to the 8(a) program or its performance of the requirement ended within 30 days of the procuring agency's offer of the requirement to the 8(a) program, and the dollar value of the requirement that the small business was performing is 25 percent or more of its most recent annual gross sales (including those of its affiliates). (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, adverse impact does not apply to ``new'' requirements. A new requirement is a requirement which has not been previously procured by the relevant procuring agency. Where a requirement is new, no small business could have performed the requirement and, thus, an impact determination need not be performed. Construction contracts by their very nature (e.g., the one-time building of a specific structure) are new requirements. The expansion or alteration of an existing requirement shall be considered a new requirement where the requirement is materially expanded or modified so that the ensuing requirement is not substantially similar to the prior requirement due to the magnitude of the expansion or alteration. (2) In determining whether or not the acceptance of a requirement would have an adverse impact on a group of small businesses located in a specific geographical location, SBA shall consider the effects of a procuring agency bundling various requirements being performed by two or more small business concerns into a larger contract which would be considered a ``new'' requirement because of the magnitude of its expansion as compared to any of the previous smaller requirements. In such a case, adverse impact may be found if one of the small business concerns meets the presumption set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. (3) In determining whether or not the acceptance of a requirement would have an adverse impact on other small business programs, SBA will consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to, whether or not SBA's acceptance of a proposed 8(a) requirement is likely to result in SBA taking an inordinate portion of total procurements in the subject industry to the detriment of the small business set-aside program. §124.309 [Amended] 40. Section 124.309 would be further amended by revising the phrase ``a sole source 8(a) contract'' in paragraph (d) to read ``an 8(a) contract.'' 41. Section 124.311(a)(2) is amended by removing the following sentence from the end: ``For purposes of indefinite quantity/delivery contracts, the thresholds will be applied to the guaranteed minimum value of the contract.'' 42. Section 124.311 would be further amended by removing paragraphs (b) and (g), by redesignating paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f), (h) and (i) as paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g), respectively, by adding a new paragraph (a)(3), and by revising newly redesignated paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), (f)(3), (f)(4), and (g) to read as follows:
