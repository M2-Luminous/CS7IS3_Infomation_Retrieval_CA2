FR940208-2-00105 FR940208-2-00074 [Release No. 34&hyph;33557; File Nos. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;93&hyph;04 and SR&hyph;ICC&hyph;93&hyph;03] Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Options Clearing Corporation and The Intermarket Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing of a Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Acceptance of Mutual Funds as Margin Deposits January 31, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on February 26, 1993, and on November 9, 1993, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') and The Intermarket Clearing Corporation (``ICC''), respectively, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule changes as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by OCC and ICC. On November 11, 1993, and on December 29, 1993, OCC filed amendments to the proposed rule changes. 2 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule changes from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s (1988). 2 The November 11, 1993, amendment sets forth Global Settlement Fund's (``GSF'') agreement to advise OCC on a daily basis the total asset value of each portfolio whose shares OCC accepts as margin collateral. The December 29, 1993, amendment presents OCC's representation that with respect to GSF portfolios that are denominated in other than U.S. dollars, OCC will not accept more than 50% of the total value of each such portfolio for margin purposes. The amendment also includes a resolution by GSF's Board of Directors whereby the investment advisor of each portfolio denominated in other than U.S. dollars will seek to insure that at least 50% of the portfolio's assets will be invested in securities for which the settlement time is not longer than the time for redeeming shares in the normal course. I. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Changes The proposed rule changes will expand the acceptable forms of margin collateral which clearing members may deposit with OCC and ICC to include mutual fund shares that are denominated in either U.S. dollars or in a foreign currency designated by OCC and ICC. II. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes In its filing with the Commission, OCC and ICC included statements concerning the purposes of and basis for the proposed rule changes. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. OCC and ICC have prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes The purpose of this rule change is to expand the acceptable forms of margin collateral to include shares of mutual funds that are denominated in either U.S. dollars or in a foreign currency designated by OCC and ICC. In order to be eligible as a form of margin collateral mutual fund shares must meet the standards prescribed in proposed OCC Rule 604(b)(2) and ICC Rule 502(a)(5). Pursuant to these proposed rules, OCC and ICC will accept redeemable mutual fund shares that are issued by an open-end management investment company that is registered with the Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``1940 Act''). 3 Approval of each mutual fund as an eligible form of margin deposit will be made on a case-by-case basis by each of OCC's and ICC's board of directors, and such approval may be refused or revoked at any time for any reason. This reservation reflects OCC's and ICC's right to determine whether a particular fund is acceptable to OCC or ICC and to ensure that OCC and ICC may act expeditiously in the event a change in the financial or operational condition of a particular fund puts OCC or ICC at risk. 3 15 U.S.C. 80a (1988). A fund whose shares are denominated in U.S. dollars will be required to maintain its portfolio investments in accordance with the provisions of proposed OCC Rule 604(b)(2)(A)(1) and ICC Rule 502(a)(5)(A)(1), which incorporate the conditions of paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of Commission Rule 2a&hyph;7 under the 1940 Act. 4 Paragraph (c) of Commission Rule 2a&hyph;7 generally sets forth the formulas that may be used in calculating the current price per share for purposes of distribution and redemption. Paragraph (c)(1) specifies that a fund's board of directors must determine that it is in the best interest of the fund to maintain a stable net asset value and paragraph (c)(2) requires the fund to limit the maturity of its portfolio investments to the terms set forth therein. Paragraph (c)(3) requires that a fund's portfolio investments be limited to instruments that present minimal credit risks and, with certain exceptions enumerated in paragraph (c)(3), be ``eligible securities'' 5 at the time of their acquisition. Paragraph (c)(4) limits to 5% the percentage of the fund's total assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer (except for U.S. government securities). 6 4 17 CFR 270.2a&hyph;7(c)(1)&hyph;(4) (1992). Rule 2a&hyph;7(b) [17 CFR 270.2a&hyph;7(b) (1992)] establishes parameters pursuant to which a registered investment company must operate in order to hold itself out as a ``money market fund'' or the equivalent thereof. Specifically, Rule 2a&hyph;7(b) requires an investment company to meet the conditions of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of Rule 2a&hyph;7. OCC and ICC will require such investment companies to also meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1). 5 Under Rule 2a&hyph;7(a)(5) of the 1940 Act [17 CFR 270.2a&hyph;7(a)(5) (1992)] the term ``eligible security'' means a security with a specified remaining maturity that is rated or is issued by an issuer that is rated with respect to its short-term debt obligations in one of the two highest rating categories for short-term debt obligations by the requisite nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations (``requisite NRSROs''). Under Rule 2a&hyph;7(a)(13) (17 CFR 270.2a&hyph;7(a)(13) (1992)), the term requisite NRSROs means (i) any two NRSROs that have issued a rating with respect to a security or debt obligation of an issuer or (ii) if only one NRSRO has issued a rating with respect to such security or issuer at the time the fund purchases or rolls over the security, that NRSRO. 6 Under Rule 2a&hyph;7(c)(4)(i), a repurchase agreement is deemed to be an acquisition of the underlying security, provided that the obligation of the seller is collateralized fully, as that term is defined in Rule 2a&hyph;7(a)(3). For a discussion of the term ``collateralized fully,'' refer to note 9 below and accompanying text.
