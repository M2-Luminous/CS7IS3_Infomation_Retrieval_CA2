This was the first time that NATO had bombed ground forces since its establishment 45 years ago and the first time NATO attacked one side in the Bosnian conflict. They destroyed several tanks in Bosnia- Herzegovina's Serbian ground forces and bombarded a command center. NATO's attacks show that it has taken off the mask of "neutrality," siding with one side and taking military action and armed threats against the other. This has cast a shadow over the prospects for a political resolution -- which all sides are working for -- has worsened and complicated the Bosnian situation, and has drawn the serious concern of the international community. Judging from the military viewpoint, the military effect of the two air strikes were insignificant, but their political impact is huge. The fact that NATO took military action against Serbian armed forces for the first time shows that it has in reality abandoned the neutral position -- a position which it had tried its best to retain in the Bosnian conflict -- and it has become more deeply involved in the conflict. NATO has attempted to use this to show its strength and force the Serbs to submit. U.S. President Clinton said: "We will launch air strikes again if we are requested to authorize UN troops to give 'effective air support' in accordance with UN resolutions." The NATO air strikes were launched in the name of the United Nations without prior discussion at the Security Council. They were a precedent ushered in by NATO to expand its power to launch air strikes under the name of the United Nations and will harm the prestige of the United Nations. NATO's action reflects the United States' changed policy toward Russia and compels Russia to choose between NATO and defending its traditional ally. The air strikes in fact have encouraged Bosnian Muslims to ask for a higher price in the resolution of Bosnian conflict, have aroused the Serbs' dissatisfaction and feelings of resistance, and have further aggravated the Bosnian situation. Bosnia-Herzegovina's Serbian military headquarters published a bulletin saying that NATO's air strikes represented "brazen aggression" and that it has decided to break off all contacts with the UN peacekeeping forces in former Yugoslavia. What the prospects will be in the wake of the air strikes are a disturbing question of concern to the international community. On 11 April, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry said that the U.S. administration opposes unilateral interference -- sending U.S. ground troops -- but does not rule out the possibility of launching air strikes. Some people in the West are worried that the Serbs will retaliate, rendering all the previous efforts of the UN peacekeeping forces futile. NATO officials are generally adopting a wait-and-see approach. Russian President Yeltsin favors the resolution of all problems in strict accordance with UN resolutions. Yeltsin said that, during a telephone conversation with Clinton, Clinton could not answer his question on whether the UN secretary general had agreed to the air strikes. Although the Serbs have not made a clear military response to this action, their 10 April bulletin said that they would use every means at their disposal to exercise the right of self defense. The Bosnian situation has once again entered a delicate, complicated, and intensified stage. All sides are adopt an attitude of restraint to avoid escalating the war and are seeking a political resolution. This is precisely the goal that the international community generally is looking forward to.
