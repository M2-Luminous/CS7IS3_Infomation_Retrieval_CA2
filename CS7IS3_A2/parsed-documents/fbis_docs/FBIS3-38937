What will be so decisive about it? [Mock] Each session that is now held will be significant, because we are getting close to the end of the negotiations. Thus, the session is, naturally, of particular importance. [Mayer] There are still fundamental differences on important basic positions. One issue is the single market, which the European Union requests immediately, while Austria is against it. Do you expect flexibility on this position? [Mock] Yes. In the sphere of agriculture we will have to focus on specific structural questions: For example, what about the farmers in mountain regions, the milk quota, and similar issues? One will try to advance on a pragmatic course and not discuss the basic concepts for the fifth time. [Mayer] How will that look in concrete terms? [Mock] I think that Brussels will become more flexible. Life does not work on the basis of purely theoretical teachings. [Mayer] Where will Brussels have to give in? [Mock] For me there can be no doubt that there will have to be concessions regarding the protection of the food industry and regarding the farmers. Under what title this will take place is irrelevant. It is ultimately the practitioners who will create the possibilities for membership. [Mayer] Where will Austria give in? Will you accept principles of the Union such as the reduction of border checks in the single market or the regulation that bans discrimination? [Mock] If we want to join the European Union because we expect advantages, then one has to realize that one joins a community that is guided by certain principles. We must accept the issue of abolishing national borders because it is one of the Community's essential principles. The abolition of discrimination is also an important fundamental principle. This will, of course, not remain without consequences; The validity of the eco-point system [regulating transit traffic through Austria], for example, will also apply for bilateral traffic. Nevertheless, it will not prevent interim solutions. [Mayer] Brussels can expect that we will not oppose these principles, while Austria will ask for financial compensation in return. Is this interpretation correct? [Mock] Yes, particularly in the agricultural sphere. [Mayer] Many people in Austria complain that they no longer understand the situation regarding the permanent succession of positive and negative information they get. Have the politicians not failed in this respect? [Mock] If one has to deal with these issues on a daily basis, then there is a danger that one becomes incomprehensible. That is a problem. After all, the people are doing something else than thinking about political problems all the time. However, there is always also the danger of becoming a manipulator by presenting things that are, in reality, complicated in too simple a way. It is a tightrope walk. [Mayer] How can one avoid mudslinging before the referendum? [Mock] There is a fair chance that we will not see the usual political squabbling, that people are aware that this decision is of national importance. [Mayer] Would you propose a fairness agreement before the referendum? [Mock] Well, it is a possibility. I do, however, hope that we can do without one. [Mayer] Let me ask you a personal question now: Would completed Austrian EU membership be the achievement of a personal objective for you? [Mock] It is of vital importance for me because I do not want Austria to play second fiddle, but, according to its size and history, to get a fair chance to participate in the decisionmaking process in a historic process. [Mayer] That does not quite answer my question. What does it mean for Alois Mock personally if he can put his signature to the membership treaty? [Mock] It means a great deal to me because a lot will then have been achieved for the future of the country. I do admit that this has always been a special desire of mine. [Mayer] Would you then still have different aims for your political life, for example in the EU Commission or the United Nations? [Mock] No, I am not thinking of that. Besides, one does not have to work a certain number of hours each day until the very last day of one's life. At one point, one might also take life more easily.
