Speaking to the press in Bonn on Friday [7 January], Vogel rejected a report in the HANNOVERSCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG that Ruehe is opposed to Kohl in this matter. According to Vogel, the minister telephoned the chancellor on Friday to assure him that he agreed with him and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel that Hungary, Poland, and the Czech and Slovak Republics should be the first to be offered the U.S. Partnership for Peace proposal at the NATO summit in Brussels next Monday. The Defense Ministry said that Ruehe takes the view that the NATO expansion should be shaped "as a process which should be initiated at the NATO summit." The minister sees the Partnership for Peace initiative as an important stage in this process, but not as a substitute for the expansion of NATO. [Passage omitted]
