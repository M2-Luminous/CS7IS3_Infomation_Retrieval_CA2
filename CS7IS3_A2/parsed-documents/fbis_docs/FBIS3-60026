This was revealed in a letter to Defense Secretary Renato De Villa by General Lisandro Abadia, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines [AFP]. According to Abadia, some officials and personnel of Narcom are able to sell illegal drugs that have been confiscated. Narcom operatives are allegedly giving protection to drug pushers in exchange for big pay-offs or bribes. In light of this, Abadia has proposed a system to safeguard confiscated drugs and to reveal law enforcers involved in drug pushing. Meanwhile, Abadia's accusations were immediately denied by Narcom Chief Ramsey Ocampo. Ocampo admitted that some Narcom personnel may be involved in drug pushing, but, it does not mean that the whole command is involved in drug trafficking. [Begin Ocampo recording in progress] ...unscrupulous activities of some of our personnel. The complexities mentioned by Gen. Abadia are based on previous perceptions. [sentence as heard] As a matter of fact, their claims of service from the admissions of small-time drug pushers that were arrested before, well, it is normal that the arrested drug pushers will accuse Narcom operatives of involvement in irregularities. So far, we have not handled a case where there has been no counter-charge against us.
