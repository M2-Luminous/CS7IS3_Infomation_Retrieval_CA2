A war is going on in the center of Europe, in the former Yugoslavia. On Monday [21 February] the NATO ultimatum is going to expire. Would you also be in favor of air strikes if the Serbs were to fail to completely withdraw their heavy weapons by then? [Kohl] Yes, I have said right from the beginning that I think that the decision that NATO made, also with our support, is right. Still, I think that in the hours until Monday every chance should be used to bring some reason to the situation, even in the very last minute. [Bresser] The situation is deteriorating. You have just talked to President Clinton on the telephone, and yesterday to President Yeltsin, and you are planning to talk to him on the phone again tomorrow morning. If air strikes are actually carried out on Bosnian territory will the Russians permit the situation to escalate to a conflict? [Kohl] Nobody can say that exactly. Together with others, I am trying to convince the Russian leadership, above all Boris Yeltsin himself, that the present state of affairs is intolerable. [Bresser] He is not convinced yet? [Kohl] I cannot quite say that for sure, at the moment, but there is tremendous domestic pressure. After all, Russia is the old protective power for the Serbs. There is great pressure in Moscow, in parliament, and elsewhere. Still, I think it is important that we now take advantage of the excellent contacts that have developed, not least between the U.S. and the Russian presidents, and also with us. One of the problems that I see is the psychological situation, something that is difficult to pin down. Russia is not part of NATO, Russia is no longer the Soviet Union. The time when NATO and the Warsaw Pact were standing face to face is over. Now there are major psychological problems, and Russia is wondering whether the West will act unilaterally. This has a lot to do with Russia's prestige and pride. And I think that talks in this connection are still necessary. [Siegloch] Still, many people here are asking themselves: What will Germany's role be? Can we really keep out of it if things continue to deteriorate. Considering the dying in Bosnia, do we not, at least, have to provide medical units? [Kohl] Well, first of all, the constitutional situation remains the way it is, at least in principle. I regret that, and if I had had my way we would have changed the constitution a long time ago. I regard the current situation as absolutely impossible and unbearable. We are all, not least the foreign minister and I, constantly finding ourselves in most awkward situations. We give advice and questions then remain in the air. So far we have encountered a lot of understanding for our situation. However, it will not stay like that. We will have a decision from Karlsruhe in the foreseeable future, and I hope it is a decision that will finally restore our ability to act. That is one thing. The other is that, even if our constitution had been changed or interpreted as I would like, the question remains whether, after the historic events between 1941 and 1945, the Germans would now be the proper partners. [Siegloch] Not even by providing medical units? [Kohl] I will come back to this issue. I am now speaking generally regarding combat forces which I am not in favor of it. I have always said that, and I think history is still very much alive in this connection. It is a completely different matter where decisions have to be made about what we can do to help, for example as far as logistical support is concerned, which might, of course, include medical support. In that case, I would be in favor of going to the very limit of what is possible. [Bresser] Does that also mean the Bosnian border, or are you thinking of logistical support within Bosnia? [Kohl] This would then have to be considered very carefully. Still, I want the world to realize that the Germans also want to help if they get involved, particularly in the sphere of humanitarian help that benefits people. [Bresser] Mr. Chancellor, foreign policy could become an issue in the election campaign, particularly if extremist forces were to seize power in Russia. With a view to the ultimatum, Zhirinovskiy has once more threatened World War III. Do people here need to be scared again? [Kohl] I think that one thing has become clear -- it has been clear all the time but has become more obvious again now -- namely that we did not enter a peaceful world overnight, but that the evil spirits that have dominated this century are not dead, and they do not only reside in the Balkans but can emigrate from there at any time. Specifically, for me this means that, despite all problems in terms of domestic policy, what Bismarck said remains true --that a country's peace and freedom, and, we would add today, its prosperity -- depend on foreign and security policy. We can do what we like in domestic policy, but as long as peace and freedom are not protected it will all have been in vain. There are now six years to go to the end of the century, a century that has witnessed enough misery, suffering, and death, and we must now do everything to take what precautions we can. That is why I am such a passionate advocate of European unification. Not first and foremost because of the most important economic advantages we can derive from Europe, but because only a really unified Europe that is able to act jointly in foreign, security, and military policy -- along with the Americans in NATO, for example -- only such a Europe can prevent war in our region. This is the most important argument for European unification. [Siegloch] Chancellor, this is an election year. Whether foreign policy will play a central role, remains to be seen. In any case, unemployment will play a central role. For the first time, there are more than 4 million unemployed, and many more people fear that they might lose their jobs. When will it get better, when will the number of unemployed go down again? [Kohl] The problem we are now facing is that failures are becoming apparent that have built up over many years, failures by almost all groups. It has not been a normal recession as we usually have it every eight, nine, or 10 years. If that were the case we would get out of it fairly quickly. What we are experiencing now are structural weaknesses becoming apparent. And we can only stop and cut unemployment if we start making decisions now, in spite of it being an election year, that will improve our situation and start thinking anew. Anybody who talks about maintaining the status quo will lose the future. There are many examples of this. Just think of the many issues that have not been dealt with over the years, like privatization of the post office and railroad. That means modernization, new jobs -- tens of thousands in the post office -- telecommunications technology. This means something quite specific. The legal framework has been created. And now we will have to work on it. Take the Dutch, whose situation is similar to ours which allows comparisons. Some 34-35 percent of Dutch jobs are part-time. In Germany it is just under 15 percent. We have 2.5 million people in Germany who work full time but would like to work part time. We could introduce these jobs tomorrow. All the conditions are there, if the companies, employers, employees, and the state as well -- we have made our mistakes as well, we have not done enough, I have now given the whole thing a push -- if we did a bit more about it. Let me just say something about part-time work, because this is often misunderstood: There could be other solutions, it need not be either in the morning or afternoon. It could be various days, a week in a row. There are plenty of ideas. [Siegloch] But this will only solve part of the basic problem. Even if the economy picks up, unemployment will stay. Production is increased, with the number of jobs declining. Companies might also move to the cheaper countries. [Kohl] We can, of course, do something about that. [Siegloch] What is the government doing about whole sectors of the population being paralyzed, so to speak, because they are out of work on a permanent basis? [Kohl] First of all, we have to clarify something. Creating jobs is not primarily something the government has to do, but it is something that concerns everybody. It is above all an issue industry has to deal with. The government has to create framework conditions. [Bresser] Economic policy is made by the economy. Do you share this view? [Kohl] Economic policy is made by the economy to a very great extent, with the economy also meaning the partners in pay negotiations. We are one of the two important exporting countries in the world, the second after Japan. Up to now we have always regarded Asia as competition: Taiwan, the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong. Now we have competition on our doorstep; and we want to have it there. We want the Russians to come to terms with the market economy and democracy, just like the Poles, the Hungarians, the Czechs, the Slovaks. One does not have to go to Taiwan to compare wages. I have just looked at a big company working in both countries. A metalworker in Mannheim earns 46 German marks [DM] an hour, his counterpart in Brno [Czech Republic] gets DM3. [Bresser] Does this mean you are in favor of cutting wages? [Kohl] No, this would not get us any further. Wages in the Czech Republic will go up as well. No, we must do a number of things in saving wages and ancillary wage costs. We must have new ideas. It is quite absurd that until recently we have had the shortest machine operating hours -- this is now beginning to change. This is a homemade German problem. Among the 12 EU countries, we are in 11th with the most expensive machinery and particularly short operating hours. All of a sudden, there are examples: the big car manufacturer in Kaiserslautern, where completely new shift systems are being introduced, and where greater continuity in production is being achieved. All of us -- and I say this without blaming anybody -- will have to ask ourselves whether during the past 20 years we did not think too little about the future. And this is the only way to cut unemployment, or to get it to a more acceptable level. We will not be able to do away with it altogether in the foreseeable future. [Siegloch] Mr. Chancellor, you have called for longer machine-running times -- O.K. But you have also said that we should all work longer hours. On the other hand, people at Volkswagen have said that the reduced amount of work has to be distributed more evenly. So who is right? [Kohl] I do not see a contradiction here. Volkswagen has not offered a permanent solution -- after all, we are talking of unemployment over an extended period of time -- but a temporary solution. The other question can easily be answered when one looks at demographic figures. For almost 30 years we have been the country with the lowest birthrate in the world. We can be proud of positive developments as far as health care is concerned. In the year 2000 we will have more than 3 million citizens above the age of 80. Look at these developments: a reduction -- a major reduction -- in the number of children that are born. We no longer have a population pyramid, and there are many more elderly people. When I also look at the fact that last year -- 1993 --the average retirement age of men was 59; when I see that university graduates in the natural sciences are 30 years old when they enter professional life; that means 30 years of training, 30 years of professional life, and 20 years of average life expectancy in retirement; this makes 50 against 30 years, and that cannot work out. [Siegloch] As far as pensions are concerned you are certainly right. Yet if we all were to work harder and longer hours, could we then not make do with even a smaller work force? [Kohl] We need a larger work force. There are many areas where we do not yet have sufficient labor. We are engaged in an -- excuse my language -- idiotic controversy over the nursing-care insurance. [Bresser] We will come back to that. [Kohl] Let us discuss the nursing-care insurance now. People are getting older, the number of single people has dramatically increased: in many big German cities more than 50 percent of all households. It means that the generation that is now becoming older will also require nursing-care, because the traditional family structures no longer exist. At the moment we have 30 days of annual leave, and 12-14 holidays. This makes eight weeks of vacation --one of the longest periods of vacation in the world. And now we are arguing about two holidays; we should not abolish them but just not pay wages for them, or those who so choose could give up two days of annual leave. [Bresser] Mr. Chancellor, this is a good example of what people mean when they say today that nothing is going on in Bonn any more, no problems are being tackled. The question is why have you haven't long since reached agreement with the Social Democratic Party [SPD] on the issue of the nursing-care insurance, because what the SPD is meanwhile requesting is exactly what your Minister Bluem originally proposed? [Kohl] Excuse me, we have failed to reach agreement with the SPD on two issues, because the SPD has made it a dogma that wage payments cannot be suspended for two holidays. This is a position that I absolutely cannot understand. I am in favor of protecting the system of autonomous wage negotiations. Still, this system would not collapse if we said that we need the wages of two holidays for nursing-care insurance. And here comes the SPD's second objection, something that Bluem made clear in his earlier calculations: One unpaid holiday might just be enough for the time being -- for the time being. Yet, what about the future? I am strictly against putting any new additional burden on the economy, particularly on medium-sized businesses. We will soon see that calculations that have been made so far were much too tight -- this is always the case in the sphere of social policy -- and that we will need more. [Siegloch] But, Mr. Chancellor, why do you not simply make a start. The first step could be to finance nursing-care in people's homes through one day of unpaid leave. And then you could say that in two or three years one could look how it is working and maybe revise the calculations? [Kohl] Well, in two or three years this would, of course, not work. The communities need clear decisions. For me personally as federal chancellor, this is not the most pressing question. Yet the institutions, the insurers, and local communities need clear regulations. I am ready for a compromise in which we say: let us now vote on the two days and add a [word indistinct] clause, which would clarify things in two or three years -- this clause would never be used; and everybody in the SPD knows that also; after all, everybody in the SPD knows that it would not work in any other way. What is at stake now is the election, not nursing-care insurance. If it were nursing-care insurance, and we were to have a free vote, there can be no doubt that there would be a huge majority for this model in the Bundestag. It is impossible to tell anyone that a country where everybody has eight weeks of leave a year -- including public holidays -- is not able not to pay wages for two days of holiday -- because the two holidays would remain -- or that people should not be able to give up two days of vacation. [Bresser] Let us talk about social policies. An increasing number of people are no longer covered by unemployment insurance but have to resort to social welfare. It is the poorest of the poor that the austerity measures of your government mainly affect. Is one of the reasons you are pursuing those the fact that you sometimes think that these people will not vote for you anyway? [Kohl] No, not at all. You are not talking about reality. Your statement that we are reducing expenditure for the poorest of the poor is simply propaganda. We are saving in all areas. We just talked about security. We will have to save over DM1 billion with the Bundeswehr, which is particularly hard for me. This really affects the basic issues of security and freedom in our country. [Bresser] But unemployment benefits are being reduced. [Kohl] I will talk about this in a minute. Let me first give you another example. Another measure that was extremely difficult for me was the reduction in funding for transportation for this year. Thus, if you think logically, investments are the most important thing. We just mentioned jobs. The more investments the state carries out, and the less we concentrate on consumption, the better our position is in the fight against unemployment. We must indeed save in all other areas as well. This also applies to unemployment benefits. One cannot deny that it must be ensured that the relationship between social benefits and low incomes is sensible. A public debate is going on in this respect. [Siegloch] Let us turn to another topic. People are complaining about rising rents, rising prices, tax increases, and rising social contributions. Exactly at this point, you are calling for a pay freeze in the public sector. [Kohl] Well, this is a sweeping statement that is not true. I would like to stress that. You should not forget that you are talking with the chancellor. If local fees are increased, one must check carefully. [Siegloch] I did not blame you for that. [Kohl] Let me just point this out once more. Whether local fees should be increased to such an extent and whether it is wise to include other things. [Siegloch] But the citizens can only spend their money once. [Kohl] Let us discuss the public sector. [Siegloch] Let me ask you the following question in this respect: If an ordinary clerk with two children who has a net salary of DM2,800.... [Kohl] You do not know what you are talking about. You are taking something for granted that has not yet been decided. First of all, let me comment on the wage negotiations. Concerning the public sector -- that is the government, which covers slightly less than one third, the laender, and the communes -- thus, I am also an employer and the right person to talk to -- one must take into consideration the overall economic situation. One must be aware that the situation in the metal-working industry is extremely difficult. One must also see what has largely been neglected in the past -- that a job in the public sector is secure. We just discussed unemployment. This means specifically that good and secure jobs in this area must be valued highly. Moreover, everybody is familiar with the budget situation. For me this means that ideas about wage increases that were expressed years ago -- we did not consider the extent of increases right at the time -- cannot be repeated. Thus, we are proposing a pay freeze. But whether we talk about a pay freeze or about whatever results will be achieved -- I do not want to comment on the extent of pay rises because I do not want to interfere in the negotiations -- one thing is clear: One cannot treat all incomes in the same way. That means that for the low incomes settlements must be found that are different from those for higher incomes. [Bresser] Are you suggesting some kind of minimum wage? [Kohl] We will have to investigate that. It is a technical question. Yet I do not advocate equal pay raises for all. Let me mention the popular example of the postman. The same applies to the professional soldier, the fire fighter, and others. I believe that one must differentiate here. [Bresser] All sectors of the population are affected by the cutbacks in an election year. There are still seven or eight months to go until the Bundestag election. [Kohl] I would appreciate the same approach among other groups. The government has just proposed a pay freeze. I would like to mention this, too, because the media usually ignore that. [Bresser] The voter, Chancellor, gets the impression that this government is no longer up to it. Even on economic issues the opposition is meanwhile thought to be more competent. Is this not an alarm signal for you? [Kohl] Of course it is an alarm signal. But you are talking about election results that are not yet taking place. For me it is absolutely clear that this coalition will win the Bundestag elections in October. I do not have the least doubt about that. You know, these premature burials, I have been living with them for two decades. As party chairman I have been buried all the time, and I am still here -- quite lively, too. As candidate in elections -- in 1976 they hardly gave me a chance at all. As a candidate from Mainz, they said he comes from the country. Well, then I was on the verge of winning an absolute majority, which people might or might not remember. In 1982-83 I initiated early Bundestag elections. Everybody, well not everybody but most people, said I was crazy. [Bresser] This is the past. Let us talk about the future. [Kohl] No, no, we want to talk about past predictions. We should talk about them. People said, he cannot win with the stationing Pershings, the medium-range missiles. We won the elections. In 1987 -- just look at the opinion polls before the 1987 Bundestag elections. Back then, I was just one of the candidates. And in 1990, four years ago -- I can still see you on television back then -- four years ago we had the first free elections in the People's Chamber. In February they said, well this Christian Democratic Union [CDU],... this is traditional Social Democratic Party [SPD] country: Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, etc. The CDU does not stand a chance. And we won the elections. Why should I discuss election results with you now? I am convinced that we will win the elections. [Siegloch] You quoted a whole number of figures and old predictions. One of them was made eight months before the last Bundestag elections, when 59 percent said they believed that the coalition would win. Now it is 17 percent, and 48 percent say Rudolf Scharping will win the elections. Does this not bother you a bit? [Kohl] Of course, but I am not troubled, I want to fight, I am determined. Of course, I know that the situation today is far more difficult than in 1990. There is much more turmoil all over Europe. We are facing problems like unemployment, there are people's fears, there is the situation in the new laender. Taking all this into account, things are difficult. But I can point out that we have achieved something. [Bresser] That is right, we do not doubt your achievements over the past years. We know that you have been chancellor for quite some time now. But a desire for change can be felt in this society. [Kohl] How do you know? [Bresser] People also got tired of Adenauer and Schmidt. Do you not think there will be a time when people want to see new faces? [Kohl] You are certainly right in that. But the question is when this will be. [Bresser] When do you think it will be? [Kohl] You may hope that it will be in October. I am certain it is not going to be in October. You know, these are questions I will not answer now. For me there have, of course, been certain considerations after 10 years in office. And these have not been ordinary times. The question was whether I run again or not. And I did not decide to run again for reasons of prestige. I made that decision because I am convinced that I stand a better chance than others -- if I make use of it -- of taking political unification in Europe and unification in Germany a big step forward. Adenauer said: German unity, European unity, two sides of the same coin. And because I am deeply convinced that if we only concentrate on German issues and isolate ourselves within Europe, evil spirits will turn up in some form. And at the beginning of this 21st century -- not that I want to stay until the 21st century -- during these years, where important breakthroughs have to be made in Europe, I want to take part and want to help. And I can help. I can say that more than anybody else, because there was no chancellor before me that had equally friendly, close relations with Washington, Moscow, London, and Paris. And I want to contribute this. [Siegloch] And you have never, not even once, regretted this decision? [Kohl] No. You know, this is a question I ask myself -- if I should have become federal chancellor at all. When I was in Mainz there was general mourning when I departed. I left Mainz and people were sorry that I left. This is a moment you have to wait for, when people are sorry that you leave, and not when people overwhelm you with praise insinuating that you should go. You have to sense that yourself. At that time, people would ask me: Are you mad? Giving up that relatively easy job in Mainz to become leader of the opposition in Bonn. Nobody had ever done that before. Let us see how others will do. Then I have not only experienced good years here but also bitter ones. [Bresser] I think we should now be talking of the future, and here the issue is the landtag election in Lower Saxony, the European election, the election in Saxony Anhalt. [Kohl] Nineteen elections altogether. [Bresser] It is quite safe to say that the CDU does not stand much of a chance in any of the three elections. When must the trend, which is running against you, reverse so that you stand a chance in the Bundestag election? [Kohl] Excuse me, but how do you know that the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] does not have good chances in the European election? You are simply claiming that. But you did the same in the last European election four years ago, or five years ago. [Bresser] When you finished ahead of the SPD by only a very narrow margin. [Siegloch] And lost 8 percent. [Kohl] Excuse me, but in the last European election many people here said that if the CDU/CSU did badly, the party leadership would come together and the Kohl era would be over. After the election, I asked the CDU leadership: Would anybody like to say something? And I looked around and waited. Nobody wanted to say anything. [Bresser] Your optimism is... [Kohl] This has nothing to do with optimism. You cannot be German chancellor for almost 12 years and chairman of the CDU for 21 years on the basis of cheap optimism. I am a realist, and I know what the situation is like, and I can assess situations. [Bresser] So I ask you, as a realist, by when will the mood have to change, to reverse, so that you can come first in the Bundestag election? [Kohl] Let me tell you something: I want to win the election. I am not talking of moods, and on what day a certain mood will change, because it is hard to measure this mood. I am certainly not impressed by the polls. The differences in the results from the various institutes have meanwhile become so bizarre that I do not want to comment any further on it. [Siegloch] Let us now turn to the European election, for which you are quite optimistic. Does that mean that Mr. Kohl, the European, will go into this election campaign as the head of the CDU. Will you campaign in the election ex officio, so to speak? [Kohl] Not at the head, because that would mean that I am running in the election, and I am not running in the election to the European Parliament. No, I have never thought much of running in an election when everybody knows that it is only pro forma. I will fight in the European election -- just as in all other elections, be it the Bundestag or a Landtag election -- for every single vote. At the moment we are still discussing the details of our election campaign. Still, everybody knows who is the chairman of the CDU, and everybody knows who is federal chancellor. The CDU and CSU are classic European parties, which is why I do not have to demonstrate that I am also in favor of Europe. This is something that absolutely everybody knows. Even people asked in surveys will never challenge my European credentials. [Bresser] So we will see who will appear on the election posters for the European election. The first poster was put up today. Its slogan is: Politics without a beard. [Kohl] But that is not an election poster. [Siegloch] So what is it? [Kohl] It is an ordinary poster and not an election campaign poster. [Bresser] But it was put up today. [Siegloch] And it was put up in front of the Adenauer House. [Kohl] [passage indistinct] and it is a nice picture. [Bresser] So this is the way you are trying to fight against Rudolf Scharping. [Kohl] In what way? [Bresser] After all, it is an allusion to Rudolf Scharping. [Kohl] Come on, what counts is the head and not the beard. [Bresser] Rudolf Scharping has often been compared with the early Helmut Kohl. Where is the difference between you and Rudolf Scharping, apart from the beard? [Kohl] I have to tell you that I have absolutely no intention of responding to journalistic games that treat politics as entertainment. Rudolf Scharping is the chairman of the SPD. [Bresser] True. [Kohl] He is the leading candidate of the SPD -- also true, even though he has not been formally nominated. The SPD is a major party with a great tradition, and it is the SPD's business to determine its candidate and chairman. Why should I comment on it? It has nothing to do with me. He is the candidate and that is a fact. I did not comment before on whether I preferred this person or that one. That is a bit like the weather. The SPD chooses its candidate, and we choose ours. [Siegloch] All right, Mr. Chancellor, you do not want to comment on the person, but maybe on the issues. One strategy is interesting, namely that the SPD has taken up CDU policies on many issues -- the asylum issue, internal security, many issues. Is not dangerous for you when the differences between the two parties are narrowing? [Kohl] No, not at all. The election campaign offers many opportunities for the SPD to make it clear what they stand for. So far, the Social Democrats have not said anything yet in connection with their position in foreign and security policy. At the end of his era, Willy Brandt once said ironically: The SPD against the rest of the world. The SPD is leading this country into total international isolation. Not a single reputable member of the Socialist International in Germany understands the SPD's foreign policy. Besides, most SPD experts in foreign policy also fail to understand their party in this connection. The chairman of the SPD Bundestag group, Mr. Klose, is much closer to my position on some issues -- for example constitutional amendments -- than to that of his own party. The problem is that the party congress adopted the wrong policies, and now they are stuck with them. Let us now talk of domestic policy issues, economic issues. The SPD must explain to the German voters, such as the miners in the Ruhr area or the Saarland, how German coal can have a future without an energy mix. An energy mix means: coal, gas, alternative energy, and nuclear power. The civilian use of nuclear energy is, of course, inevitable. Yet, they refuse to understand that. How do they intend to build a modern industrial society without inexpensive energy? Even within the SPD it is agreed that we need that. Even a man like Mr. Schroeder, who certainly does not lean toward the right of his party, set out to promote an energy concept but gave up on the way. [Siegloch] There is a list of other things, too, including the great bugging campaign. The SPD now supports wiretapping, but your coalition partner [the Free Democratic Party] is against it. [Kohl] Well, if we are talking about legal policies, I would like to stress the following. I would have adopted the asylum law two years ago. It took the SPD two years to agree to a sensible solution under pressure from localities and the local SPD chairmen, Landtag members, and mayors. You mention wiretapping. One has to examine the proposal very carefully with a view to the Basic Law. The proposal is not designed to permit the wiretapping of private residences. First, it is aimed at causing quarrels with the coalition. This is quite legitimate, and I have nothing against this strategy. [sentence as heard] Second, other issues have to be settled, too, in connection with the wiretapping bill and the whole package, including access to accounts to prevent money laundering, which we are not ready to allow. I do not share these ideas about property. [Bresser] What effect do you expect from your strategy to blame the SPD in 1994, at the beginning of the election campaign, for its policy vis-a-vis the German Democratic Republic [GDR] pursued in the 1980s? The voters are concerned about Germany's future. Yet you are focusing on the past. Or do you believe that you can win votes in east Germany with this strategy? [Kohl] I do not understand your question. I do not blame the SPD for things that happened in the past and which are no longer topical. What is happening? The Social Democrats have opened this debate. When the first candidate for the office of the federal president was presented, the SPD denounced an honest man in an incredible manner. Just remember the statements by SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping at the party congress. [Bresser] There was also criticism from your own party. [Kohl] That is a completely different matter. Every candidate faces criticism. Let us analyze the situation. The SPD also presented a candidate for the president's office. This candidate claims that he wants to be the president of all Germans. Thus, he must be ready to face questions from the CDU and me and every citizen in this country as to where he was when the interests of people in Germany were at stake. I do not need to investigate the Stasi files in this respect. That is nonsense. I am not talking about Stasi files. I would like to point out the following: In view of the Wall, all the laender, including those governed by Social Democrats, agreed to set up the office in Salzgitter for the documentation of crimes against humanity against German citizens in the former GDR. In 1984, the SPD Bundestag group decided to abolish this documentation center at Mr. Honecker's request. Thus, I claim that the SPD candidate for the president's office cannot speak for all Germans if he unnecessarily withdrew support for this documentation center against crime in 1987. He did not want to spend any money on this office at a time when he knew -- as I did -- that there were still 2,000 political prisoners in the GDR, and that Honecker wanted at all costs to remove this documentation center. The candidate must be able to give an answer. This is not a question that merely affects the past. The man is now running for office. If I think of the questions that our candidate was asked, the minister president of North Rhine-Westphalia must at least answer this question. [Bresser] Mr. Kohl, let me ask you a short question. The longer the division [of Germany] lasted, the more your party and your government tried to develop better ties and humanitarian relief. [Kohl] That is a completely different issue. [Bresser] In this connection, quite a few things were questioned that were considered significant earlier, including citizenship and Salzgitter. [Kohl] Let me make the following clear: What I just stated has nothing to do with state security. Let me repeat that. The SPD candidate abandoned -- one can also say betrayed -- an important principle of human coexistence at a certain point with the support of his party. We have protested against inhumanity in South Africa, in Chile, and other parts of the world. There were over 2,000 political prisoners in the GDR, and the SPD wanted to do Honecker this favor. Others prevented the abolition of the office in Salzgitter. What else was discussed is another thing. I did not initiate this discussion. You mentioned the topic. I never abandoned single German citizenship. During my era, there was never the slightest chance for the government to do so. Honecker was quite aware of that. But the Social Democrats -- leading Social Democrats -- assured Honecker in 1987 and before and after that date that they would abandon single German citizenship if they should come to power, and that the 17 million should receive dual German citizenship and would thus be citizens of a different country. What would this have meant in the summer of 1989 when the Hungarian government did not comply with Honecker's wishes and opened the borders with Austria, citing one single German citizenship? [Bresser] My original question on that issue was whether an election campaign involving national unreliability, as presidential candidate Hamm-Bruecher called it, is something that might convince voters? [Kohl] Excuse me, it is not a matter of convincing voters, it is a matter of the SPD nominating a presidential candidate who claims to be a suitable presidential candidate for all of Germany, and who must now accept that, in an important decision over the past 10 years, he did not decide in favor of his fellow countrymen but in accordance with Mr. Honecker's wishes. I have to take blame from morning till night. And this is part of my job. [Bresser] Honecker had a number of wishes. Among other things he wanted billions of marks in loans, which he got from you. [Kohl] That is something completely different. The loan did get us where we wanted to go. This was the result of an astute policy. With the major loan we did not give anything up for Honecker, but we bought something. We gave Mr. Honecker a loan -- which did not cost the government anything by the way -- and then we made him let people leave the country, the former GDR, in increasing numbers. And anybody who knows about the real psychological change in the GDR will know that the moment when millions of our fellow- citizens were here in the West, the propaganda machinery of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] collapsed. [Siegloch] But let us now take a look into the future after talking about the past for so long. There are three days to go before the CDU party conference, and your party does not seem very united. [Kohl] How do you know? [Siegloch] Well, let us think of some controversial comments: Biedenkopf says pensions are not safeguarded, other party members say we will have to pay for our own glasses in the future, for dentures. Others are trying to persecute smokers. [Kohl] Let me tell you something.... [Siegloch] Should the party chairman not put an end to this? [Kohl] I do not have any doubts that an end will be put to all this after the party conference. You know just as well as I do -- you can see this from the time when the SPD was in government, if you are talking about health care reform -- that a party that is in government, that has to make proposals, interpret proposals, is a choir with many voices; that there are people in our party -- I do not want to mention names here, there is a whole number, and this is part of a democratic party, an open party -- who consider it a matter of their prestige to turn to the public. And it is a fact -- you are more familiar with the media than I am, I think, because it is your job -- that you will only appear on the ZDF [German TV Two] news if you say something against the party line. Saying the government is doing a good job will not get you into the news. So, there are a certain number.... This happens in every party, it is not an issue for the CDU alone. Just read documents of the time of the SPD government, and you will see the number of disputes. I am not pleased about this, and I am not defending it. I find it absolutely unacceptable in some cases. I will express this very clearly on Monday. You can follow that and you can broadcast it. This is one thing, but the other thing is that this party, the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] will go into the election campaign as a single body. [Bresser] Do you not sometimes get the impression that the CDU/CSU is somewhat lacking in enthusiasm at the moment, not motivated enough for such a difficult election? [Kohl] Why are you talking about the CDU? Is there anybody that is not unenthusiastic? I talk from morning to night. [sentence as heard] [Bresser] You probably exclude yourself. [Kohl] Yes of course. And I know many others. No, this is part of the so-called image, something that is fashionable. I keep hearing people talk about weariness, disenchantment with political parties. It is a general weariness. There are people leaving political parties. Trade unions are losing many more members than for instance the CDU. Employers keep quiet and do not talk about the wave of people leaving. There is talk about the churches, the figures have been published. Take sports. Do you know of any field where we do not breed weariness. And I do not have to tell you -- just watch television in the evening, on all channels, and you will go to bed weary. There are hardly any programs that make you go to bed in a cheerful mood. [Siegloch] But you are confident. You have been party chairman for 20 years, and chancellor for 12 years. Would you say that the 16 October election is the most difficult one of your life? [Kohl] No, I would not say that at all. You know, these are just common sayings. On the one hand they say -- and this is a phrase coined by Adenauer --election campaigns are fountains of youth. These are just words. What are the facts? Well, I sit in my office, attend election events. I go there, usually quite fed up. I could imagine something more pleasant than talking for five hours between lunchtime and evening. And all the hassle.... But when I stand in front of the audience, when I enter the assembly halls, when I talk to the people, when I see them in front of me -- let me put it somewhat infomally -- then you feel like an old army horse: You hear marching music, you raise your head and you march. There is duty, and then there is inclination. You know, I am not somebody who got into politics via the backdoor. I have always been politically active. I organized my first campaign rally in 1949, at age 19. And this party is not just any organization for me, it is part of my home. There are personal, human relationships, both in the ups and downs. This is how a proper party works. This is the same in every party, not just in ours. And one has a moral obligation toward one's political friends. I am standing on their shoulders. I could not survive in this office if I did not have the confidence of the great majority, and confidence is a matter of giving as well. [Bresser] You also need another shoulder. You want to continue the coalition with the FDP. The question is, whether they want it as well. By when do you expect a clear statement by the FDP? [Kohl] They will do it in time. I know that journalists have to conduct such discussions because they have to write something. But you know very well that the FDP will not do it now. I can understand that. The FDP will do it during its party conference. [Bresser] As early as in June? [Kohl] The FDP will have a party conference and every FDP member will be asked when a statement will be issued. Well, then they'll go into the summer recess. And if they do not issue the statement before the summer recess, they will be faced with the question all summer. So, the FDP will be sensible enough -- it is not up to me to give advice to the FDP -- to make its decision at an appropriate time. And it will take a decision that is logical. The FDP cannot go into the election campaign saying: We have done an excellent job for four years, but now we will leave. Neither can The FDP say we will not commit ourselves at all. Then the SPD might want to form a coalition with the CDU, and the CDU could work with the SPD. I am not at all afraid. They will also be in parliament. This is another death knell that is being rung all the time: will they get in, will they get beyond the 5 percent? Franz Josef Strauss always used to talk about this. I used to say: `Stop it. Every time you say the FDP is in a bad position, they will not get into parliament, people will say in the end -- but we want the FDP in.' This was an old trick that Hans- Dietrich Genscher was perfect at. He always put on a worried face; the others said the FDP would not get in, and then he achieved good results. [Siegloch] Chancellor, we journalists love speculating. It could be that the FDP will not be enough. This means that a grand coalition could become necessary. Helmut Kohl, chancellor of a grand coalition -- would you say that is out of the question for you? [Kohl] I do not want to say anything about this. I do not want a grand coalition. Not because I am against grand coalitions in general. Let me say again, a grand coalition can be unavoidable in certain situations. In Baden-Wuerttemberg my friends have formed a grand coalition, and I supported them. But I do not think that a grand coalition would solve the problems any better. What must be done now -- investment in the future, a real change in the country -- cannot be achieved in a grand coalition. [Siegloch] Mr. Kohl, the question was whether you would be chancellor of such a grand coalition? [Kohl] I do not know. Why should I say no definitely? I have a certain responsibility for my own party. [Siegloch] Does this mean, if there is no other way? [Kohl] No, this is something you are inserting into the debate. This is not my opinion. I will decide, it is my choice. I am a free citizen in a free country. Nobody forced me to become chancellor, and nobody will be able to force me to make a decision [contrary to what] I think right at the time. But I am now taking with you. I am not expecting it will come to that. [Bresser] What will happen if the CDU/CSU does not become the strongest party in the 16 October Bundestag election? In this election year you will be 64. Have you, the chancellor of unity, ever thought that you might have missed the right moment to resign? [Kohl] No, I have never thought that I might have missed the right moment. I would have chosen the right moment. Had I not been convinced that what I have done is right, I would not have done it. After all, nobody forced me to do anything. I could have easily have said at one point: Well, I am now on a pedestal and expect everybody to worship me. In Germany those who resigned have always been the greatest. If the Lord were to give me that, I would have great expectations. [Sentence as heard] But this has never been my intention. My intention is -- for the reasons that I have mentioned -- to bring things a bit further ahead in a critical situation of the world, in which things are changing rapidly, and to make my contribution as a German, who, together with our people has been able to enjoy the support for unification by others. [Bresser] If the voters want that contribution.. [Kohl] Yes, if the voters want it. This is why I am fighting for each individual vote. When you broadcast the result of surveys and predict on television that my end is near, I look at you with amusement and say: Let us wait until election night. [Siegloch] And then we will know more. [Bresser] What if the voters do not want it? Then you would no longer be chancellor. [Kohl] The voter is the supreme sovereign of the country. This is the difference from you television people, for example. You do not have a supreme sovereign. I have to pay my fees whether I agree with you or not. You can vote me out, but I cannot vote you out. That is a big difference. [Bresser, Siegloch] Thank you very much, chancellor.
