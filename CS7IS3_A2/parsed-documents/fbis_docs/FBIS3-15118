Two radio stations were considering taking legal action against the head of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia after he failed to pay for more than four hours of radio time, priced 21,000 dollars, the reports in SEVODNYA and MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS newspapers said. During the campaign, the state picked up the tab for three hours of radio time and two hours of television time for each party. Additional time was meant to be paid for by the candidates themselves. The newspapers published copies of payment orders signed by the Zhirinovskiy party for two banks. However the papers quoted the head of one of the banks as saying the documents did not belong to his bank. A spokesman for the Liberal-Democratic party told AFP it was "up to the banks to pay the bills they were told to and that it couldn't possibly be a question of financial fiddling by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy." Various reports have estimated the cost of radio and TV time used by the ultra-nationalist leader, who won 23 percent of the vote, at between 70,000 and 650,000 dollars. Russia media charge up to one million rubles (6,500 dollars) for a minute of time. Last month a rival candidate in Zhirinovskiy's suburban Moscow constituency of Shelokovo lodged a formal complaint of violations of the electoral law during the December 12 vote which the ultra-nationalist leader won. Zhirinovskiy's election could be invalidated by a court if the charges are substantiated.
