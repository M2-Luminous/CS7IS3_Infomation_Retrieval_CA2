FR940317-0-00065 FR940317-0-00022 One of the rules proposed simultaneously with the issuance of this release would require a broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer to review current information provided by the issuer prior to recommending a transaction in a municipal security. In the absence of such current information, the dealer could not recommend a transaction in the issuer's securities. That rule, which would be applicable to municipal securities issued subsequent to the effective date of the proposed rule, would reinforce the obligations of dealers under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws to have a reasonable basis for recommendations of outstanding municipal securities. The Joint Statement also called for a strengthening of the suitability rules to require disclosure of ratings and whether the issuer has committed to provide annual financial reports. Today, the Commission is proposing amendments to its confirmation rules to require disclosure of the absence of a rating in confirmations. The MSRB has indicated it has under consideration a plan requiring municipal securities dealers to disclose to their customers the importance of secondary market information and whether the issuer has agreed to voluntarily provide such disclosures. 107 The Commission will defer to the MSRB's reexamination of its suitability rules in implementing those aspects of the Joint Statement. 107 See supra n. 62. VI. Request for Comments The Commission intends to continue to monitor developments in municipal securities disclosure practices. Comment is requested regarding the disclosure items discussed in this release, and in particular, items warranting event disclosure. Comment also is requested regarding additional action that should be taken with respect to disclosure in the municipal securities market by the Commission, the MSRB, or Congress.
