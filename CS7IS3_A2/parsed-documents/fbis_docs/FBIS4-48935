Spokesman Zhao Hua said trading was brisk during the 15-day event. "Daily trade volume topped $800 million during the peak days," he said. Hong Kong and Macao remained the fair's top partners, signing one-third of the contracts. The European Union, the United States and Southeast Asia followed with 16.8, 9.9 and 7.9 percent of the respective trade share. Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, in his fair tour on Friday, urged trade companies to invigorate China's drive for exports, according to a Xinhua report. He was accompanied by Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi and Zhu Senlin, governor of Guangdong Province. In his speech to provincial trade officials, Li said competition is a main reason for the fair's record transactions. He affirmed competitive bidding for export quotas is an effective solution to vicious and unfair competition between Chinese export companies. He said such a practice should be applied to more than the present 13 commodities. Li fully agrees with the plan to display similar commodities at one place. At the fair, contracted exports to the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Latin America all increased, Zhao said. Seventeen Chinese trade delegations each signed contracts valued at more than $200 million. "The increase in trade deals at the fair is attributable to the recovering world economy and China's new financial and foreign trade reforms implemented this year," Zhao said. Meanwhile, he stressed that bogus goods were not tolerated at the fair, as 20 companies were punished for using fake trade marks on their products. Organizers publicized those companies' names, confiscated their fake trade marks and drove some of them out of the fair. "Further investigation and punishment is pending and organizers are discussing whether or not to allow them to attend the coming fair," said Zhao. The infringed trade marks were found in 20 firms, including Shenzhen Kaichen, Guangxi Machinery Import and Export, Xingjiang Zhongxin, Shenzhen Foreign Trade Group and Changfa Company, China Aerospace Technological Import and Export Fujian Branch, Anhui Chemical Products Import and Export, Shantou International Trading Overseas and trade companies from Shanxi, Hubei and Hunan provinces. Vice-Premier Li urged local trade officials to take advantage of new trade policies, like the single exchange rate, to boost their exports. Li admitted the policies need improvement but urged trade authorities to take any necessary steps to prevent future problems from arising. Li said foreign importers may unreasonably depress the prices of Chinese products, while Chinese exporters may also unreasonably raise their prices, resulting in soaring prices for foreign currencies. Establishing a modern enterprise system and multinational operations should be the direction for remolding foreign trade enterprises, he added. The semi-annual, trade event was expected to help fulfill this year's planned export target of $100 billion. Zhao said new mechanical and electrical products were in high demand. More than 60 per cent of the goods displayed by the Guangzhou trade delegation were new. The quota bidding system for 13 domestic products has helped stabilize or raise export prices, he explained. The price of garlic rose 20 per cent from last year. More than 50,000 foreign businessmen visited the fair, 4,000 more than last fall. The number of Southeast Asian guests increased. And the more than 4,000 American visitors matched the Taiwanese total. Japan's sluggish economy lead to fewer Japanese visitors fair organizers said.
