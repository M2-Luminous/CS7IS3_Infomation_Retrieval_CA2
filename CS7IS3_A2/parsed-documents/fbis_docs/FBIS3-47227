I want to assure you that although we continue to be very positive on the results of the Seattle meeting and the future of APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation], we certainly do not want it to be a way of discouraging others, particularly European Union from coming here seeking mutual gains from both sides, quote unquote, Romulo told reporters. He said that during his meeting with Clarke, he was told that many Europeans perceived the Philippines as, quote unquote, too oriented towards the United States and Japan. Romulo noted that since the November Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' summit in Seattle, Clarke's visit to the Philippines is the first manifestation of interest in Asia by several officials from the European Union. During the APEC summit, the European Union, formerly known as the European Community, had expressed alarm that it is still isolated from the Asia Pacific conference. Clarke told Romulo that as a result of the APEC meeting, it was assumed that the European Union believed that this might be misunderstood as though they were just giving up this part of the globe, quote unquote. But contrary to the common perception, European nations are interested to expand economic relations with Asia, Clarke said. Europe needs to do a lot of work to tackle the business. Clarke was particularly positive in his desire to focus on the Philippines and also the Asian region because clearly his presence here for some five days together with some prominent businessmen is a good sign.
