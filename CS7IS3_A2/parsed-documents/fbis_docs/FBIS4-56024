This was emphasized in all campaign meetings, interviews, and television interviews. Do you think that your election campaign was flawed? [Boross] I do not believe that our campaign was basically mistaken. In my view, the electors did not vote mainly on the basis of the parties' campaigns. This is proved by the fact that in certain areas the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] candidates did not even conduct a campaign -- as we learned from their reports. Nevertheless, they automatically received the votes. It is a fact that, tactically, the MDF could have conducted a better campaign, I have no doubts about this. However, I do not think that this is a decisive factor. We had a stable government for four years, however, in the meantime, the opposition had time and opportunity to "consume" the MDF through its continuous attacks. Had there been four or five changes of government before, the MDF would not have been a constant target. [Oszy-Toth] How did the Socialists manage to get 32 percent if they had not even conducted a campaign in many places? [Boross] The masses were swept toward those who were most antagonistic to the government, with the clear hope that prices would decrease, pensions would increase, and it would be easier to make ends meet. The MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] both played up to this. It is a different matter that they are now slowly starting to reveal that not everything will be the way people believe. The next government is facing a difficult task because it has to live up to the wishes of the masses that they created and I do not think that they will be able to satisfy these wishes. [passage omitted] [Oszy-Toth] Are you preparing for the second round, and do you trust that the proportions can significantly change? [Boross] I am always hopeful, and not without a basis because public opinion on political parties is extremely changeable. For example, one week before the elections, public opinion researchers predicted 38 percent for the MSZP and much less for the SZDSZ. For some reason, a certain percentage of the votes went from the MSZP to the SZDSZ. [Oszy-Toth] This is a possible conclusion. [Boross] Indeed, this is only a play with logic, rather than an analysis. However, all along we had to fight with the disadvantage that Hungary is dominated by a media that does not appreciate our value system. [passage omitted] [Oszy-Toth] In what kind of economic condition will you hand over the country? According to the MSZP, the country is in a much worse situation than it was in 1990 when they had handed over power. However, you claim that the country is in a better situation now. [Boross] If an MSZP-SZDSZ coalition is made, then they will be saying jointly that the country is in a worse situation than it was in 1990, and this is the reason they are forced to take exigency measures that might not be to the liking of the population. However, for all unbiased observers, it is clear and evident that the country cannot be in such a bad situation because we completed some 60 to 70 percent of the inevitable changes. Four years ago, we received a country with a distorted ownership system, empty treasury, immeasurable tensions, and hidden unemployment. Those who now describe the country's situation as worse are actually seeking explanations for the measures to be brought that will be contrary to the promises made during the elections. [passage omitted] [Oszy-Toth] MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn said many times that they are not sure about the country's situation and the parties that will form the government will possibly have some surprises. [Boross] What was true in 1990 is not true now, nevertheless, I can hear the same statements. Let us remember that, in 1989, the Socialist government wanted to deny a $1.5 billion debt, but then it admitted it. I am thinking of [former Prime Minister] Miklos Nemeth's memorable announcement. The MSZP is aware of everything, we do not have secrets, we cannot even have any for certain reasons of personnel. This lack of trust is part of the category of political games because, when the opposition enters government, it will excuse itself by saying that it had taken over the country in an even worse than expected situation and that is why it cannot keep its promises. I am convinced that the past four years will not be a reason and an excuse the same way as the heritage of the previous 40 years was not accepted as an explanation from us. People who are voting in the hope of better living standards will sooner or later say that this is not what was promised. [passage omitted] [Oszy-Toth] Can the MDF crumble or split? In the coming four years, it will have much fewer deputies in parliament. [Boross] The MDF's membership acknowledged its defeat in a disciplined way. I hope that we will not have a split, although certain initiatives to upset our unity may be possible. The cost of this was shown by the fate of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party and Istvan Csurka. All in all, the MDF will have to renew itself, will have to assess the personnel and organizational issues, and it will have to become more modern and practical in the political struggle. In addition to this, the conclusion has to be drawn that the vast majority of the country's population was born after 1945 and became adults sometime after the mid-1960's. This public has a different attitude and does not appreciate the wounds of their forefathers. In spite of this, I am very happy that we fulfilled our moral obligation and implemented the compensation, even if the people who received compensation did not vote for us. [passage omitted]
