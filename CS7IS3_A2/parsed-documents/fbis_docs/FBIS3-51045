Bolanos Suarez: "The Truth About Cuba"] [Text] Some days ago, the CIA once again released apocalyptic reports about my country. It is not the first time the CIA has done such a thing. In 1961, one such report served to obtain President Kennedy's support for the Bay of Pigs invasion. Among other things, the report said that 80 percent of the population would rise against the government within 72 hours after the invasion. The deadline was confirmed, but the reaction was the opposite. As is known, this was precisely the time the Cuban people needed to defeat the invasion. Another example: In December 1990, one year after the destruction of the Berlin Wall, 422 frustrated foreign journalists returned to their countries after a visit that had been arranged for witnessing the collapse of the revolution. At least this is what other CIA reports had announced in November 1990. The Cuban Government does not deny its great economic difficulties. However, it tries to handle figures and data more impartially than does the CIA. The year of 1993 will be recalled as the most terrible year for the revolution. The damage caused by the rage of the empire [U.S. Government] was increased by the climatic calamities that hit the country, causing the loss of valuable lives and material damage estimated at $1 billion. Despite such adverse circumstances Cubans have maintained their organized society with solidarity, showing -- according to ECLA [Economic Commission for Latin America] -- the world's best income distribution. Without beggars or homeless people, with schools and hospitals for everyone. The motivation for the CIA is today the same as in the past: to destroy the revolution. To attain this goal they resort to all means to block Cuban efforts to survive and rejoin the world's economic system. Such attitudes, says London's FINANCIAL TIMES, "are applauded if they are adopted by Communist countries like China or Vietnam, but are determinedly and unscrupulously sabotaged if they are adopted by the small Caribbean island..." After the disappearance of the USSR and the end of the cold war, the United States has concentrated on one single country: Cuba. The entire formidable destabilization potential which operated previously on the countries of the so-called socialist world are now concentrated on Cuba. According to U.S. press sources, the cost of anti-Cuban operations runs at $700 million annually. Operations include fanciful and absurd projects like transmissions from a television station on U.S. territory which are not seen in Cuba. Despite being condemned for the second consecutive year by the United Nations General Assembly, the blockade remains the centerpiece of an abominable policy that is more than 30 years old. It has banned all trade with Cuba, and it has compelled other countries' companies with U.S. technology or capital to do the same, flagrantly violating international law. Still unsatisfied, the United States has shamelessly pressured and threatened entrepreneurs, whatever their nationality, to prevent them from selling oil or food to Cuba. Such a blockade has caused not only inhuman losses to the Cuban population, but has also hit U.S. entrepreneurs themselves, banning access to a market of more than $2 billion annually. It is deplorable that the mass media have totally or partially ignored this situation. It is even sadder to see the silence maintained about the lonely and manly fight that Cubans are waging to resist with dignity, decency, and hope the impact of such criminal harassment. In the end, I think that whatever the differences or disagreements about my country there are, to write now the entire truth about Cuba is equivalent to preserving Latin America's independence and sovereignty. Whoever disregards this today will certainly pay for it tomorrow.
