In his statement, circulated on Monday, Chornovil expressed hope that Leonid Kravchuk would use his presidential right to abort any steps of the new pro-Russian Crimean president if they contradict the Ukrainian Constitution. The leader of the "Rukh" blamed the leadership of the parliament for the outcome of the elections which he called "a recurrent loss of the Ukrainian authorities". Chornovil accused the Parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch personally of "stubbornly refusing to put onto the parliament's agenda the question of bringing the Crimean laws into line with those of Ukraine".
