The department added that slightly over 32 million new pesos of the money was "in cash," and that the National Banking Commission has been asked to impound various accounts discovered in the names of presumed drug dealers. The latter include front men and accomplices of the brothers Ramon and Benjamin Arellano Felix. The source stressed that, owing to the aforementioned program, the results of which were submitted to the Finance Secretariat and the Secretariat of the Comptroller General of the Federation, it was possible to acquire an updated record of the assets confiscated. The department noted that, last year, 22 public auctions were held to sell the public poisoners' properties and assets, and that over 9 million new pesos were obtained from these auctions. Some of the money was used to give incentives and awards to PGR workers who have distinguished themselves in the performance of their duties. On the same occasion, the department emphasized that each of the auctions was held through public bidding, and that the groundwork has been established for the computerized system to support a constant check of the material resources confiscated from organized crime.
