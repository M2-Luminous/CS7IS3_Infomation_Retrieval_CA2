FBIS4-30601 "dreas124_a_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-124 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Political Situation Report From Tokyo Continues Political Situation Report From Tokyo Continues Hata `Likely To Meet Murayama OW2806000494 Tokyo KYODO in English 2356 GMT 27 Jun 94 OW2806000494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- The ruling coalition is likely to accept an overture from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] and stage a meeting between Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to discuss forming a new government, political sources said Tuesday. Murayama and Masayoshi Takemura, New Party Sakigake head and a former chief cabinet secretary, agreed Monday that the next government should be a "dove," or soft-line government, based on an agreed policy outline. Takemura, who is critical of what he views as high-handed leadership by Shinseito and Komeito within the coalition, made it clear that his party has no plans to reconcile with the group and urged Murayama to head the new government. In a separate meeting, Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), proposed a trilateral meeting with Murayama and Takemura for a breakthrough pact. Takemura said Sakigake wants to serve as bridge between the LDP and the SDP in forming an alliance between the one-time archrivals. Murayama and Kono agreed on the need to elect a new premier Tuesday. The current regular Diet session expires Wednesday. Murayama and Kono also concurred in jointly taking "heavy responsibility" for breaking the current political standoff following the resignation of Hata and his cabinet on Saturday prior to an impending no-confidence vote against his minority cabinet tabled by the LDP in the House of Representatives. Hata is the sixth prime minister in Japan in five years. None of the parties has a majority in the lower house. The ruling coalition had earlier said it will wait for the SDP's initiative for fresh talks on a policy agreement before any high- stakes meeting between the party heads. The SDP's policy-making board, on the other hand, endorsed the joint policy platform with Sakigake and called on the coalition to make a formal response to its proposal for the Murayama-Hata talks by 11 AM [0200 GMT] Tuesday. Within the LDP, a growing number of party members are tilting toward a partnership with the SDP, party sources said. The LDP had been in power since 1955 until last August when the then coalition of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, which included the SDP and Sakigake, took power. But former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, an LDP faction leader, is opposed to an alliance with the SDP and called for a team up with Hata's Shinseito and Komeito, the key parties in the coalition. Within the SDP, a left-wing group led by Murayama is said to be in favor of a tie-up with the LDP. However, a right-wing group, including Secretary General Wataru Kubo, the No. 2 leader in the party, is seeking the return of the SDP to the coalition, party sources said. The SDP earlier made a decision at a meeting of its decision- making central committee in May that it will not form a coalition with the LDP. The SDP walked out from the coalition in April in protest against the formation of a parliamentary group by other coalition partners, excluding the SDP, shortly after the election of Hata as prime minister in the Diet. The SDP's departure forced Hata to launch the first minority government in 39 years.
