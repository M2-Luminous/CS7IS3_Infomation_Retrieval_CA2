Korea"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- Kim Chong-pil, "chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP]" of South Korea, told a press conference on February 1 that the deployment of U.S. Patriot missiles in South Korea will actually offer "no problem" in view of "defence." Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says his remarks are intolerable treacherous sophism unacceptable to anyone. The traitor Kim Chong-pil's sophism fully revealed the bellicose and treacherous nature of the "civilian" regime and the "DLP" of South Korea, the analyst notes, and stresses: Kim Chong-pil, a special-class flunkeyist traitor and warmaniac, is the first target of reforms in South Korea. His utterances proved again that the Kim Yong-sam regime seeking dependence on outside forces, division and war, not national independence, peace and reunification, must be overthrown. We have warned more than once that if the Kim Yong-sam group dare to seek the provocation of a war, the "civilian" following the aggressive war moves of outside forces, the civilian" regime would meet its miserable doom. The South Korean "civilian" warmaniacs must look squarely at the situation and act with discretion.
