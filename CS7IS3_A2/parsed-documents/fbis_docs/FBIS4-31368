According to a public statement, Simovic said that the political and security situation in the province is better this year because more ethnic Albanian citizens have been meeting their obligations toward the state. This was clearly influenced by official statements by a number of diplomats and representatives of the European states who, while visiting Kosovo and Metohija, presented their governments' clear stand regarding the inviolability of the borders of the Republic of Serbia and Yugoslavia. According to the statement, Jonathan Moore stated that his country is abiding by the stance which rules out the possibility of secession by any one part of the Republic of Serbia and Yugoslavia. Milos Simovic stated that even though it has not been officially registered as a party with the relevant republican ministry, the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo has not experienced any obstacles nor pressures in freely performing its activities, despite the fact that it has been at the forefront of the anti-Serbian campaign. The talks were also attended by Matthew Palmer, a representative of the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade.
