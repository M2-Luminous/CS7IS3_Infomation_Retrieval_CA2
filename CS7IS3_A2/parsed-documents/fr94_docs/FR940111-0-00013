ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of two interim final rules that authorized expenditures and established assessment rates under Marketing Orders 966 and 984 for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period. Authorization of these budgets enables the Florida Tomato Committee and the Walnut Marketing Board (Committee and Board) to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the programs. Funds to administer these programs are derived from assessments on handlers. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 1, 1993, through July 31, 1994.

Van Diest (M.O. 984), California Marketing Field Office, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, Suite 102B, 2202 Monterey Street, Fresno, California 93721, telephone 209&hyph;487&hyph;5901. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule is effective under Marketing Agreement No. 125 and Order No. 966, both as amended (7 CFR part 966), regulating the handling of tomatoes grown in Florida; and Marketing Agreement and Order No. 984, both as amended (7 CFR part 984), regulating the handling of walnuts grown in California. The marketing agreements and orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions now in effect, Florida tomatoes and California walnuts are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rates as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable tomatoes and walnuts handled during the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period, which began August 1, 1993, and ends July 31, 1994. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
