Scientists around the world are in their final dash to replace the present TV sets in your home with magic boxes, called high-definition television (HDTV). China, with most of its 800 million TV viewers still watching black-and-white, also has mapped out an ambitious plan, vowing to open its first experimental HDTV station by the turn of the century. If what scientists predict comes true, this new generation of television will eliminate most of the shortcomings of the old set, including some things you may not have noticed. As signals processed, transmitted and received are all digital, the loss of fidelity can be reduced to nothing theoretically or, at least, to an acceptable level, said Ma Changhua, technical adviser of the Ministry of Broadcasting, Film and Television. The picture tube of HDTV will scan twice the number of lines current television can provide, so its fidelity can be as high as 35-millimetre film, said Ma, who is also in charge of the HDTV research project. That means, when you stand at a distance of three times the screen height from the television, the picture is exactly the same as you can see at the real site, Ma added. Therefore, the screen can be much larger than current ones. A common HDTV screen will be 32-or-36-inches. It also changes the aspect ratio of the TV screen from the current 4:3 to 16:9, because a wide screen is much more comfortable on one's eyes. As for your ears, the scientists have designed a so-called ``5.1-channel sound system'' to both comfort and shock viewers. There are six different multi-directional sound channels. Using digital technology, the new TV will be able to avoid most interference in the current television from both inside--signals in the same and adjacent channels--and outside--buildings, cars or vacuums. Furthermore, with some technologies, one's home computer can also be linked to an HDTV monitor, greatly expanding the functions of the computer. As TIME magazine reported, it can become an ``interactive home information appliance'' linked by fibre optics, made easy to use by software and driven by powerful computer chips. The future of the multimedia industry, though not guaranteed, means the HDTV system may bring virtual reality into one's living room. China China's science circles are going all out to keep pace with the developed world on HDTV, which is advancing at a very rapid rate. Japan is broadcasting an 8-hour HDTV programme each day through satellite. The U.S. is expected to open its first experimental HDTV station in 1996. It is a must for China to develop HDTV technologies, said He Zuoxiu, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ``The so-called HDTV issue is not only a matter of television, but also related to a wide range of other social questions,'' He said. The technologies of digital processing, transmission, storage and display can be widely used in publications, medicine, the military, research, education, visual communication as well as other cultural and entertainment sectors, said the senior scientist. With the great improvement in TV resolution, the movie industry in the future may not necessarily shoot a ``film'' with film, but tape, so that the cost can be greatly reduced, He said. ``China must master these technologies if it does not want to always follow others in the high-tech field,'' he said. He also believes that the huge future HDTV market, both domestic and international, promises large profits. An HDTV Strategy Research Group was organized in last April with authoritative scientists and officials from the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC), the Chinese Academy of Sciences and China's top authorities in radio, film and television, the electronics industry, and post and telecommunications and the space industry. According to the group's plan, now waiting for central government approval, China will post its HDTV system standards in 1997. China so far has only a few computer-simulated HDTV systems in Ma Changhua's laboratory. These can display strikingly clear pictures. China plans to establish a model HDTV system within two years. Scientists will actively prepare from now on the opening of the country's first experimental HDTV station around 2000, while developing its own HDTV industry. The main task for China's HDTV development includes developing some key technologies and an industry to produce HDTV receivers, said Feng Jichun, an official with the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC). ``This is the highest priority,'' he stressed. China expects to start commercial production of HDTV receivers by the turn of the century, he said. The United States plans to stop broadcasting its current common television in 15 years. The process of replacing the current television system with a high definition one will be 5 to 10 years longer in China than in the U.S., according to the ``most optimistic prediction'' by Feng Jichun. This is such a sophisticated project that it needs the close co-operation of all concerned government departments, industrial circles and research institutes, Feng said. Technology China is not capable of independently developing all the technologies related to HDTV, for which Japan, the European Community and the US have, or plan to, pour billions of dollars, Feng said. The key HDTV technologies roughly can be classified as: - Professional equipment, including cameras and recording and broadcasting equipment; - 16:9 wide-screen monitors and receivers, especially picture tubes and the chips inside; - Source encoding, compression and decoding; - Transmission systems; - Others. Some technologies are still in the early research stage by scientists around the world. And none has so far been mastered by China. ``We will be seeking broad international co-operation,'' said the official. The technology for the signal encoding, compression and decoding is one of the key fields the Chinese scientists are studying, he added. China has focused sharply on the production of home-use HDTV receivers for they are comparatively easy to make as well as highly profitable. Research on HDTV picture tubes has started in some electronics companies through co-operation with foreign firms. Some scientists also have paid great attention to the design and manufacture of the special chips -- the brain of digital HDTV.
