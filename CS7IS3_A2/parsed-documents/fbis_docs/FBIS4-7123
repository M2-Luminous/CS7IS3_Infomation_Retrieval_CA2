He said: We will soon begin the replacement of the fuel rod according to the operation plan of the 5 megawatt experimental nuclear power station for the present as part of the undertakings for the normalization of our peaceful nuclear activities. As we pointed out already on April 4, we are not in a position to freeze the operation of our graphite moderated reactor system for an indefinite period since the implementation of the DPRK-USA agreement on the conversion of our graphite moderated nuclear reactor system into a light water system has become uncertain as a result of the abortion of the third round of DPRK-USA talks and, moreover, the prospect of the resumption of the DPRK-USA talks is dim at present. In view of technical requirements, too, we can no longer delay the replacement of fuel rod of the 5 megawatt experimental nuclear power station. Consistent is our stand to show the honesty of our nuclear activities, although the replacement of the fuel rod is being made while we are still in a unique status following the temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Hence, we decided to voluntarily notify the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] of our plan for the replacement of fuel rod and, especially, to allow inspectors of the IAEA to observe the process of replacement of the fuel rod so that they may verify that nuclear materials are not diverted to non-peaceful purposes, and promptly issued entry visas to the inspectors as requested by the agency. Observation activities of the agency may involve adequate contents of inspection for the continuity of safeguards, including observation of the activities for the replacement of fuel rod, measurement of all the fuel by the spent fuel rod counter, containment and surveillance of all the replaced fuel by the agency, activities related to the agency's seal and monitoring apparatuses and examination of documents of operating and accounting records. This shows that we are actively guaranteeing inspection activities of the agency with the utmost leniency and good will despite our unique status. If inspection activities falling within the scope of routine and ad hoc inspections are raised in the course of the replacement of the fuel rod, they may be allowed after the nuclear issue is settled in a package deal at future DPRK-U.S. talks. Truth to tell, we intended to discuss first the resumption of routine and ad hoc inspections within the framework of a package solution to the nuclear issue at the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. But we remain in a unique status with the abortion of the third round of talks. At this transitional stage observation of the replacement of the fuel rod cannot but be the inspection for the continuity of safeguards to verify non- diversion of nuclear materials. We will leave the fuel rod to be replaced this time strictly under the containment and surveillance of the IAEA and fully provide the continuity of safeguards data. We are studying the problem of "additional inspection" of the radiochemical laboratory raised during the March inspection activities of the IAEA in close relations with the attitude of the United States and the IAEA Secretariat. Hence, we have already notified them that we are willing to allow an "additional inspection" as an exception after examining their future behavior in keeping with the change of the current situation surrounding the exchange of special envoys between the North and South. If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat, ignoring our good will, rudely demand sampling and other inspection activities in disregard of our unique status at the time of the replacement of the fuel rod, we will have to regard it as a sinister political intention to continue more openly the campaign for stifling the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear activities. When an irrevocable complex situation is created by that, we cannot hold ourselves responsible for it at all. If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat respect our unique status and take a fair attitude and position, looking straight at the current situation, another opportunity of finding a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue will be created.
