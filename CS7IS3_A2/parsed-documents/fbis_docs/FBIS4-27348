FBIS4-27348 "dreas105__a94029" FBIS-EAS-94-105-A Daily Report 20 May 1994 ANNEX Japan MITI Revises Energy Consumption Target MITI Revises Energy Consumption Target 942A0253A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 20 May 94 p 5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0253A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] The Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], has decided on a policy of holding down the policy goal increase rate for the amount of energy consumed by 2010 to an annual average of 0.9 percent. The amount of energy consumed has continued to increase at an annual rate of about 3 percent for the past 10 years, but they are dealing with an agreement by the various advanced nations to hold down the supply of fossil fuels centering on petroleum to prevent global warming. MITI is promoting energy-saving measures such as popularization of new energies and introduction of summer time [daylight savings time]. The final domestic energy consumption amount recorded in 1992 was 360 million kiloliters. They are promoting work on a review of the "Outlook for Long-Term Energy Supply and Demand" in the Supply and Demand Subcommittee of the General Energy Research Committee (MITI consulting organ), and will incorporate this policy in the report compiled at the end of June. MITI is forecasting the amount of consumption divided into the case where existing policy is continued and the case where new energy-saving policy is implemented. Consumption in 2010 will be 425 million kiloliters to 446 million kiloliters converted to crude oil. The rate of increase under the existing policy is an annual average of 1.2 percent. It is expected to be 0.9 percent when energy-saving policies are added. Since an increase in supply of fossil fuels such as petroleum or coal is difficult from the viewpoint of preventing global warming, it was decided to make the target increase rate for consumption an annual rate of 0.9 percent. In order to promote energy-saving measures, MITI has a policy of promoting electric cars and development subsidies for high-efficiency boilers.
