And We?"] [Text] As distinct from many other of the present "members of the opposition," A. Lukyanov has been at the helm of state. And this being so, he has to bear the responsibility, if only moral, for the humiliating position in which our people have found themselves. But do you hear in his words even a hint of an apology or remorse? You do not. We have before us a most experienced, resourceful politician, armed, what is more, with the skills of legal and verbal tightrope-walking. But this is required in order to have been able to come up with the lawyer's opus: Lenin is in practice buried inasmuch as his body is below ground level. In this case I will prove as surely as two and two make four that Lenin's body lies above the level of any Moscow cemetery and, consequently, cannot be considered buried.... And each homeless person whose corpse lies in a basement may also be deemed to have been committed to the earth? Other arguments of the ex-chairman of the Supreme Soviet are constructed on the same "logic" also. Who now declares out loud that he is against reforms? Only a political suicide, perhaps! Anatoliy Ivanovich has survived Brezhnevism, Gorbachevism, and, judging by his ability to say something or other or to remain silent, will survive Yeltsinism also. You bet: He is, after all, for reforms! For good reforms. Which the people need, which are to their benefit, not which render them destitute. The poor people--to what have they been reduced by the shock therapy!... And as though there was no corrosion of the Soviet petrodollars, unchecked growth of the military-industrial monster, degradation of the socialist countryside, the extinction of an entire region--the center of Russia--the squandering of national resources for the support of doomed totalitarian regimes.... He is, apparently, for reforms, but pro-communist reforms. And this, which is clear even to V. Anpilov, has nothing in common with the actual changes that the people are awaiting. And somewhere over there, on the periphery, a civil war is under way, yet he, the ideologist of communism, here, in the center, has no opinion on this. And some people there will not understand the president's vain attempts to establish civil accord.... Anatoliy Ivanovich is, it would seem, prepared even.... All "new Russians," apparently, emphatically all, are coalescing with mafia circles and, of course, serving Western capital.... Yet I have still not forgotten the clamorous criminal trials of the 1980's, when the closest connection between mafia-socialist trade and our Communist Party was ascertained. And how could a member of the CPSU Central Committee Politburo completely forget that there are among the "new Russians" many of those that leaped across into entrepreneurs' chairs from the Central Committee and the state structures and that are, perhaps, turning over "party money"? It is not nice to smear one's class brothers. Our compatriots, apparently, are characterized by spirituality and... collectivism, not Western capitalism, which, as the CPSU-Communist Party of the Russian Federation has revealed to us, is absolutely aspiritual, and we are not to be suborned by their jeans (A.I. did not say, it is true, what is to be done with the Western K. Marx or what the Bolsheviks did with our native, celebrated cloth and other pants). Lenin, apparently, made the peasantry and the workers happy. Which ones? Those from whom he took away after the victory of Soviet power the land and the factories? Those whom he executed and starved to death?... Of all that the former all-Union speaker had to say, I understood one thing: B. Yeltsin will not achieve peace and accord inasmuch as socialism and communism will live.... Whether we all will survive here does not concern true communists and loyal Leninists. As in all the preceding years of their control of a country of slaves.
