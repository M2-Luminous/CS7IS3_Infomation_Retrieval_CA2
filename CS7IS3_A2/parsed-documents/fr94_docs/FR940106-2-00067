FR940106-2-00067 FR940106-2-00035 Example _Calculation of Adjusted Limit Effective October 1, 1993, for a Hospital-Based SNF Located in Scranton, Pennsylvania: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ 1␣ Labor-Related Component Limit $112.22 (Table I). Wage Index ×0.8952 (Table II). n,s,n Adjusted Labor Component $100.46 ␣ Nonlabor-Related Component: Limit 23.79 (Table I). Nursing Home Reform and OSHA Per Diem Add-on +1.98 ␣ n,s,n Adjusted Limit $126.23 ␣ F. Adjustments to the Routine Limits Section 1888(c) of the Act provides for appropriate adjustments to the SNF routine cost limits. These adjustments are set forth at §413.30 and include: exemptions from the cost limits for new providers; exceptions to the limits for atypical services and extraordinary circumstances; and other provisions. Section 13503(a)(1) of OBRA '93 mandates that the effect of allowing no changes in the SNF routine cost limits for cost reporting periods beginning during FYs 1994 and 1995 not be considered in making adjustments to the routine cost limits under the exceptions process. Therefore, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993, and before October 1, 1995, a provider may request an exception only for costs incurred above the amount that the limit would have been had the provisions set forth in this notice regarding no changes in the cost limits not been enacted. Accordingly, for the purpose of determining the amount of an exception to the SNF routine cost limits under the regulations at §413.30(f), the difference between the amount of a provider's cost limit as determined by the provisions set forth in this notice, and the amount that a provider's cost limit would have been under the October 7, 1992 notice had the provisions described herein not been enacted, is not subject to an exception to the routine cost limits. We note that this provision does not apply to the A&G add-on for hospital-based SNFs. That is, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993, the A&G add-on for hospital-based SNFs will not be used in computing the amount that the hospital-based cost limit would have been had the provisions requiring no changes in the limits not been enacted. In addition, we note that this provision has no effect on new provider exemptions to the SNF cost limits, as set forth under §413.30(e)(2), since this exemption removes the limitation on a SNF's routine costs. The example below demonstrates the computation to determine the amount not subject to an exception under the provisions set forth in this notice. The provider's cost limit is computed for the cost reporting period beginning January 1, 1993, in accordance with the provisions set forth in this notice, and this limit remains in effect until the cost reporting period beginning January 1, 1995. The provider has requested an exception to its limit for the period beginning January 1, 1994. Again, we use the information from the October 7, 1992 notice to calculate what the limit would have been had the OBRA '93 provisions requiring no changes in the limits not been enacted. The difference of $5.04 between the actual limit and the amount the limit would have been is the amount not subject to an exception.
