Addressing a group of 150 people attending a seminar sponsored by the NATO Defense College in Rome, the pope pointed out, "Someone, some time, made some decisions which brought terrible consequences of death, offense, destruction and mourning." Speaking in English, the pontiff affirmed that the "shocking and bloody conflict which is shaking Europe" is making the continent less certain of itself and warned that "Europe must remember that its destiny cannot depend only on strategic or economic interests. It must regain its spirit for the renewal of its civil, moral and spiritual life," he added. The ongoing appeals launched by the Holy See and other religious leaders and "men of good will," he continued, "are directed to the conscience of those who can do something to change the course of things. To the present, hope has not been compensated," he said before turning to prayer for "you and all those who are in the service of the cause of peace." Concluding his remarks, John Paul said, "Peace is a word and a desire closed in the hearts of everyone, an essential asset on which depends the well-being of the individual and the progress of society and civilization."
