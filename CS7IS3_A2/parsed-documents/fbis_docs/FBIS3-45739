He also said that to save time, it is hoped that the Legislative Yuan will agree to adopt a package of laws when enacting laws. He stated that our side has already studied the issue of holding negotiations with Communist China over investment and direct cross- strait shipping and air ties under GATT. He added, however, that there is no need at present to show our cards. Hsiao Wan-chang said that administrative departments will first have to coordinate with and seek the legislative departments' approval to negotiate. However, because the time for joining GATT is rather pressing, we cannot expect to maintain the pace needed to join GATT if we do not adopt a package deal in enacting laws. Administrative departments will also strive to win approval from the legislative departments. Hsiao Wan-chang said that because the government has already studied ways to deal with the issue of holding negotiations on investment and direct cross-strait shipping and air ties with Communist China after joining GATT, there is no need to wrestle with these problems at this point because they will be dealt with after we join GATT.
