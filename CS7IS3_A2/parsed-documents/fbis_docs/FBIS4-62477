Some 48 of them (mainly Chinese) had absolutely no reason to be in our country. Consequently, they were swiftly put on buses and sent to the Maritime Kray settlement of Pogranichnyy. From there the indisciplined foreigners were expelled by rail, in a reserved car. The Maritime Kray militia reported that the expulsion went quietly and professionally. Operation "Foreigner" will continue until 20 May. Apart from Vladivostok, the hunt for violators of passport and visa regulations will be carried out in Ussuriysk, Nakhodka, and in border settlements through which tourists, Chinese "traders" [chelnochniki], and other foreign guests enter the kray and, from there, other parts of the country. Violators of passport regulations are not always quietly expelled. In the first two days of the operation six criminal cases have been brought against foreigners. The charge for all of them is the same -- [Article] No. 196 (forgery, and the sale and use of deliberately forged documents). As a rule, the document in question will be a Soviet passport. Just how simply and openly these forgeries are carried out is shown by the case of a certain Choe Ko-un, a DPRK citizen. He traveled to Vladivostok and rented an apartment in the city center, but under the name of Andrey Vyacheslavovich Khodykin rather than Choe Ko-un. He explained at the investigation that he had acquired our hammer-and-sickle passport in Ussuriysk from some strangers, paying 200,000 rubles for it. It seems that it is not just the Russian ruble that is being devalued.... What prospect does Choe Ko-un face? If he is lucky, a year's imprisonment; if not, two years. Operation "Foreigner" is extensively under way on several fronts. Hotels, hostels, and private apartments rented by foreign guests are being raided. Conferences are being held with the leaders of local tour firms. These people often fail to monitor the tourists' return home. As a result, more than 4,000 Chinese have entered Maritime Kray as tourists since the start of the year, but only slightly over 1,000 have returned. So the figures quoted at the start of this article for the number of foreigners detained in the course of the operation are truly just a drop in the bucket. Judging by the results of a raid on a famous Chinese flea market in Vladivostok, it is time to open a permanent specialized militia detachment there. Thus, in just one raid, forces from the Special Purpose Militia Detachment and several rayon internal affairs departments arrested 80 Chinese without the necessary documents. The task of permanent militia monitoring is made easier by the conditions in the local trading system -- the flea market is surrounded by a strong barbed-wire cordon, and the territory allocated to it is minimal. Nobody today knows what the correlation between the local, Maritime Kray population and the foreigners is. No estimate at all can be made of the number of the latter, because of the lack of registration and records for people crossing the border. The range of opinions about their arrival is just as great as the difference between the actual and the officially registered "foreign presence" in Maritime Kray. All we know is that, in comparison with last year, "foreign" crime in the kray has grown threefold. There are 7,000 foreigners officially registered -- and, therefore, living legally -- in Vladivostok alone. The overwhelming majority of them are Chinese. They work at 200 enterprises in the kray center and observe the passport and visa formalities. By all accounts, they will not be affected by Operation "Foreigner."
