Reporting on the conversation held behind closed doors Valeriy Grishin, first deputy leader of the Russian Federation Government's Press Service, said that the statement by the head of the cabinet was met with understanding and support by the U.S. parliamentarians. V. Chernomyrdin also stressed that the Russian Government has not counted on foreign credits, and is not doing so. In this context he noted that the question of the allocation to Russia by the IMF of the second part of the system credits, worth $1.5 billion, "largely bears a political character." The head of the cabinet remarked that there are forces in the United States which are attempting to restrict the Russian Federation's access to, and undermine its role in, world markets. The premier said that Russia is not interested in privileges, but in equal partnership opportunities in trade. In V. Grishin's words, the U.S. congressmen expressed support for the course of reforms being carried out by V. Chernomyrdin's government. The statement by Russian Federation Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin that Russia is ready to submit its application for membership of the European Union [EU] provoked animated discussions at EU headquarters in Brussels. This statement from the Russian premier at a press conference on the results of his visit to Budapest was interpreted here as sensational. A press relations aide to European Commission Member Hans van den Broek noted in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent that right now the union has no answers to a whole range of questions linked to EU expansion. This is attested by the difficulties over the accession of Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway. He recalled that Cyprus, Turkey, and Malta have long been waiting in line for EU membership. Talks on the further expansion of the EU will hardly begin before 1996, when a conference on bringing the union's institutions into line with realities arising subsequent to the Maastricht agreements is scheduled. As for Russia, the EU representative stressed, it has completely different dimensions to any other European country. An agreement on EU cooperation with Russia should undoubtedly be concluded. But the accession to the union of such a big country with a mighty and extremely specific economy is hard to envisage even in the long term. Even if the EU does somehow manage to "swallow" Hungary and Poland, in the case of Russia the question arises: "Who is to join whom?"
