This was stated by Colonel Milan Rundic, a long-serving member of the research team at the Military-Technical Institute. He has been carefully analyzing the horrific effects of the explosion. He intends to inform the public and experts of his conclusions. "I claim that such a destructive effect could have not been caused by any bomb fired from our mortars, regardless of their caliber," he said. "According to the information to which I have had access, I think that this was an antipersonnel mine that produces a circular, splinter effect [kruzno parcadno dejstvo]. This mine was developed in our institute, but has never become part of the Yugoslav People's Army's equipment. "The final development stage of this mine, which was carried out in total secrecy, was entrusted to the Slavko Rodic military factory in Bugojno. The head of the team there was Isak Asim. Bugojno is predominantly a Muslim town, in which the accounts with the Serbs had been settled quickly, and then with the Croats. The factory has been bombed, but, judging by everything, production was quickly resumed according to the blueprints, which survived, and the highly developed technology...." The mine that Colonel Rundic claims was used in Sarajevo was certainly much more powerful than those that appeared in the naught series [nultna serija] in Bugojno, but, as he stresses, what was important in the production of this explosive device was its operating principle. Balls and Plastic Explosive He drew a picture depicting a plastic cylinder, filled with up to 5,000 small metal balls 4-5 mm in diameter. The explosion is initiated from inside in such a way that it simultaneously triggers plastic explosive at the top and the bottom of the cylinder. The two detonation waves thus caused drive the balls with immense force toward the middle, and are then released horizontally at incredible speeds. The spread is deadly and does not scatter itself, but in fact kills anything within a 60-80 meter radius. Colonel Rundic refutes the report, that is, the hypothesis of AFP, that the mortar hit a market stall and exploded in a relatively confined area, resulting in what is claimed to be the "world record" in this kind of killing. Our interviewee rejected this. Only a mine with a circular effect, judging by the traces and other details, could have killed so many people. The mine was brought to the market by someone. Considering its small dimensions and can-like shape (like a can of beans), it was planted in a certain place in advance. The mine has a fuse that can be set to activate the mine at any time from five minutes to several days.... The list of suspects excludes the Serbs, because they are in Grbavica. In reply to the question why such a large number of people were there at that time, the colonel said that he was not an expert on that, but that one should investigate whether anyone had started distributing food at that spot unannounced at the very time when the detonator was activated. Replying to why anyone in the Muslim part of Sarajevo would want to kill people in such a cruel way, Colonel Rundic asked: "Did not something similar happen in Vaso Miskina Street [where a Serbian shell killed civilians in a bread queue]?" Why Is the Market Intact? Other experts of the Yugoslav Army also claim that it was impossible for one 120-mm mortar to kill 68 and wound nearly 200 people, as stated by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] the day before yesterday. An artillery expert in the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army told us yesterday that all analyses show that one bomb could have not caused such a large number of casualties, and that it was probably an improvised, remote-controlled, explosive device planted at the Merkale market. The anonymous colonel from the Artillery Department of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army said that the tragedy in the Sarajevo market was caused by an improvised mine, the so-called camouflet [fugasa], and that it could have not been a projectile fired from a mortar or any other artillery piece. This deadly mine can be "made" very easily: Plastic explosive of destructive power could be put into a sack of potatoes or some other market commodity, reinforced with steel pellets, placed under a market stall, and then detonated. Only such a device or something similar could have caused such a large number of tragic casualties. However, to avoid speculations and guessing, everything could be precisely established with an investigation and autopsies of the bodies of those killed, which must have contained fragments of the projectile. What artillery experts unequivocally claim is that this tragedy was not caused by a mortar. Judging by what the television pictures have shown so far (information about the tragedy is certainly selective and strictly censored), a similar effect could be caused by six to nine mortar bombs. If this were the case, the Sarajevo market would have been almost destroyed. The reports on the tragedy have so far mentioned only one bomb. The public was shown only a small crater. Our interviewee said that the effect of mortars is not so devastating if people are in a group, as was the case at the market when people were waiting for the distribution of humanitarian aid. "Every person in the group acts as a kind of shelter to another person, because shrapnel does not travel through a human body as bullets do," the colonel from the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army said. However, such a number of people could have been killed by several bombs of a higher caliber, such as 120-mm, 160-mm, and 240-mm (none of the sides in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina uses the last of these), but these bombs would have to explode simultaneously and would certainly destroy a good part of the market. The origin and type of explosive in the bomb could be established precisely, if it was fired at all, because traces of artillery fragments would remain on the concrete ground. Craters show a real "picture" for experienced artillery experts. On the basis of craters they can determine who fired a shell and from what weapon, the military expert said.
