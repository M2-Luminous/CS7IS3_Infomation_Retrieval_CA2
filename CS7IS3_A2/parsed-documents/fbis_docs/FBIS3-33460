In an interview with EL MERCURIO, Vega said he is not concerned by the recent purchase of 36 combat planes by Argentina because "they should modernize their air materiel just as I have the duty to keep the Chilean Air Force completely operational." Last week, following long negotiations, the U.S. Government authorized the sale of the A-4M Skyhawk bombers to Argentina. They will be equipped with more modern radar systems than those originally installed. Vega said: "On the orders of their respective authorities, they are replenishing their inventory." According to British sources during the Falklands war (1982), Argentina lost 103 airplanes, among them 26 Mirages, 31 Skyhawks, 23 Pucaras, and 18 helicopters. Vega said the FACh is concerned about current technological demands. It believes the expeditious replacement of the old Hawker Hunter fleet, which is still in use, is a necessity. He said: "This in no way means an arms race. It is the result of real operational need." Vega added: "Moreover, we have very good ties with air forces of other Latin American countries, as shown by the participation of Argentine, Peruvian, and Brazilian planes in the upcoming Fidae [International Aerospace Fair] 94, which is a good sign of the understanding and rapprochement, and of the projects we share, with bordering countries." Vega said vast new ties have been established, which can be expanded even further through the implementation of projects in areas of common interest. He said: "It is good for us to talk with our peers because the main challenge that faces us is the acquisition of scientific and space knowledge, which demands joint training." Asked about the choice of planes to replace the 10 Hawker Hunters which have been in operation since 1967, General Vega said there are advanced studies on a definitive model. Without disclosing any names, he said this change does not mean the FACh budget will not be met or that new expenses will be generated because previous studies took into consideration these expenses and national defense costs. Chile purchased 53 Hawker Hunter planes. Despite excellent combat performance they are not equipped to carry missiles or modern bombs. Their basic characteristics (speed, height and flight autonomy) are comparable to the A-4 which Argentina has in its inventory since 1970, but they lack the electronics and radar systems of the Argentine Skyhawks. Vega said: "The FACh cannot lose the two groups of Hawker Hunter jets that are out of service. We know that -- for reasons of the budget -- it is almost impossible to replace this number of planes, but we are negotiating to recover at least one of these squadrons." The FACh commander said there are several interesting choices on the international market and the issue has already been discussed with the defense minister "with positive results." Asked about the possibility of purchasing Russian-made planes, which are currently very cheap, Vega implied that the idea is very remote. He said such a purchase would cause a drastic technological change and, consequently, high expenses in personnel training and the purchase of new equipment. He added that the FACh has always opted for the most economic solutions for the country, prioritizing -- for example -- modernization programs over purchasing new material. Vega stated: "It is a good solution because, like computer systems, airplane systems evolve very fast but the shell does not. In this way we modernized the entire electronic equipment of the Mirage 50 and the F-5E planes, thus increasing their operational life for several years." One solution apparently being studied for the replacement of the Hawker Hunters is to buy more F-5E planes, which can be refurbished at a low cost. Regarding his trip to the United States, which is scheduled for 20 to 26 February, Gen. Vega said he will visit the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Command. He said: "We want to expand our knowledge in this field and to promote some kind of support so as to start our own programs." Vega said the future of all nations lies in space and that it is necessary to promptly undertake studies in this area. He said: "We must acquire this technology immediately because this is where the future lies." He did not deny the possibility of contacting Russian experts. Vega added: "We are not planning to train an astronaut or a cosmonaut. This would be a very big step and we must first overcome many stages. The first is to establish a training program for our people in new terminology and systems. We want an experimental program to enable us to become better acquainted with this new technology, and we want to establish a specialized FACh department." Vega said that a "political decision" is needed prior to the implementation of this long-term project. He said: "With this support, we can fulfill the dream of building an experimental satellite within 10 years."
