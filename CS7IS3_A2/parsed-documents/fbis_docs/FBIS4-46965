Deputies were elected in 24 of these districts. Sixteen districts were won by KPU [Communist Party of Ukraine] candidates, and one was won by a candidate of the Socialist Party. These deputies make up nearly 71 percent of the new delegation to the Supreme Council from Luhansk Oblast. This is probably the most decisive leftist victory in all of Ukraine. A particularly striking fact is that not a single (!) representative of the national-democratic forces opposed the Communists in Luhansk Oblast in the second round of elections. The national democrats did not place higher than fifth in any district in the first round.... What is going on in this eastern oblast of Ukraine, if in the second round of elections its residents voted only for Communists, the party of power, Russian chauvinist imperialists, and only infrequently for sharp businessmen from the Kuchma-Hrynyov bloc? First and foremost, there are subjective factors at play here. Despite the fact that 57 percent of the oblast's residents are Ukrainians, in a regional referendum nearly 91 percent voted in favor of granting the Russian language official status. If we ignore this, in the next Donbass referendum, the same percentage will vote for autonomy or secession from Ukraine. This author had the opportunity to take part in the election campaign in the oblast's Ukrainian-speaking Lutuhyne Rayon. Even there, the absolute majority of the population has a negative attitude to Rukh (which personifies the national-democratic bloc here). Under the circumstances, what can one expect in the several rayons of Luhansk Oblast that are populated by indigenous Don Cossacks? Of course, Luhansk Oblast is the Donbass--the "all-Union smithy" and the "dormitory of Soviet peoples." But there are several such dormitories in Russia. What about the Tyumen region, yet we see no evidence of anti-Russian sentiments there. As it turns out, the main reason for the pro-Russian sentiments in Luhansk Oblast lies in the influence of the local mass media, which are promoting anti-Ukrainian attitudes with no opposition from official Kiev to speak of. There are currently six newspapers in Luhansk that can be regarded as more or less influential on the oblast level. Three of them--LUGANSKAYA PRAVDA, GOLOS DONBASSA, and SUBBOTNIY KALEYDOSKOP (all published in Russian)--are vying with one another to prove which is most leftist and which loves the lost empire of the USSR most. Every issue of each of these newspapers carries letters from workers, who blame the Ukrainian nationalists in power for all our troubles. The organ of the oblast state administration, NASHA HAZETA (the only bilingual newspaper among all of the oblast's periodicals), and of the local council, ZHIZN LUGANSKA, can be regarded as centrist, making their pages available to all public movements and parties. Recently, however, because of the economic crisis, they have been showing a distinct preference for advocates of the imperial idea, camouflaged either under a restored Union or a union of Slavic states. Another newspaper, the organ of the Liberal Party of Ukraine, VZGLYAD, deliberately avoids political issues, concentrating exclusively on purely economic and business matters, and on advertising. Interestingly, during the last election campaign, all these newspapers gave their main support to the representatives of the party of power, with businessmen, chauvinists, and Communists taking second place. As far as the rayon newspapers of Luhansk Oblast are concerned, Lutuhyne's TRUDOVAYA SLAVA attests that the winds of change have not yet reached all the editorial boards. The only difference is that now, instead of being dependent on the Communist leadership, they are wholly dependent on the party of power. Consequently, it is impossible to speak of candidates having had equal access to the press in the election campaign. Thus, in contrast to the programs of other candidates, the programs of all three democratically oriented candidates were all published in the same issue. If one were to compare the space reserved for their materials in TRUDOVAYA SLAVA with the space allotted to the candidates from the party of power, one would find the ratio was 1:5. As before, Luhansk Oblast radio sings the praises of the working people (mostly the leadership), and therefore, obviously, the nomenklatura was much more widely represented on the air during the election campaign than provided for by the election law. Oblast television is especially apolitical. When it granted additional time to the voters [as published], it was for large sums of money. Yet the election campaign of the agro-industrial nomenklatura was presented against the background of preparations for spring field work (in all likelihood with no cost to the candidates in question). On the other hand, the Efir-1 commercial television company of Luhansk maintains a pro-empire and antistate political position, taking full advantage of the silence on this issue on the part of both the Luhansk and Kiev authorities. If this is democracy, than it is of a unique Ukrainian variety, because it is impossible to imagine an antistate channel in England, the United States, Germany, France, and so on. In summarizing what has been said above, it is not difficult to see that the Luhansk press is generally leftist and pro-empire in its orientation and engages in the ideological indoctrination of the population in the interests of the regional headquarters of the party of power and its chauvinistically oriented puppets. The consequences of this state of affairs speak for themselves. The overwhelming majority of Luhansk residents regards the national-democratic forces as fascists, because the local media do not "bother" to explain the difference between Nazism and patriotism and are waging a battle against the latter as if it were Nazism. It is difficult to overestimate the success of imperialistic propaganda. In one of the electoral districts of Luhansk, a candidate advanced to the second round of voting who claims that the Ukrainian government is made up of Rukh-Banderites and states insolently in his autobiography that in addition to Russian, he is fluent in English, Polish, and Italian with the help of a dictionary.... The question arises: What should we do? Anything but what the leaders of national-democratic forces do when they occasionally pay courtesy visits to the Donbass. Evidence of this "productive" activity is seen in the fact that the overwhelming majority of the population of Luhansk Oblast honestly believes to this day that V. Chornovil and L. Lukyanenko are criminal offenders, despite the tolerant conduct of these politicians during their visits. In my opinion, if the Donbass is to remain Ukrainian, there is an immediate need to establish a network of Ukrainian mass media in the region, whose goal would be to combat the anti-Ukrainian propaganda of the local media and to foster a civic consciousness among the residents of this coal mining region to replace the "Soviet-Communist" [sovkova] mentality that reigns here now. It is especially important to create the necessary conditions in Luhansk Oblast for the publication of a bilingual weekly with a circulation of no less than 50,000. This matter should be decided in Kiev, and not in Luhansk, where the necessary funds are not available. It does not really matter who in Kiev assumes the responsibility of financing such a newspaper. But if the government refuses to do so, this will serve as perfect proof of its concern for the territorial integrity of Ukraine in real terms. If the national-democratic forces refuse, this will be proof of their conscious capitulation to communist-chauvinism in the Donbass. Bilingualism in the Donbass is a necessity today, because for the past three decades, Ukrainian schools in the region have constituted a tiny percentage as against Russian-language institutions. This is one aspect. Another is that I can confirm as an author that my Ukrainian-language articles on patriotic themes elicit no response from my political opponents, in contrast to my articles in Russian. Another reason why such a newspaper is needed in Luhansk is that the city has a creative potential to make this a leading publication in the oblast. If the newspaper becomes a reality, knowing the creative potential of Luhansk's independent and democratically oriented journalists, I can almost guarantee this. First of all, we will draw the population's attention with a series of materials exposing instances of "grabitization" in the oblast. This is something that is not reported by any medium of mass information in Luhansk Oblast. Secondly, we will become the most popular newspaper because we will publish analytical articles on political, economic, artistic, and sports subjects. The weekly will need several months to accomplish this. By thus winning the respect of our readers, we will be able to deal a serious blow to communist-chauvinistic propaganda in Luhansk and throughout the entire oblast. Such a publication, though expensive, is the cheapest means by which to prevent the Donbass from following the example of Crimea, which is already costing Ukraine much more than it would have cost to create a full-fledged alternative network of mass media on the peninsula (when this was still possible). Thus, the preservation of the territorial integrity of the country is unquestionably a national matter. It is time to move from words to deeds. That is, of course, if our statesmen are not merely playing at statehood and using this as camouflage for something quite different.
