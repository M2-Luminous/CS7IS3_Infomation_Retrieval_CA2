His initiative was received with protests on behalf of the members of the Chamber of Deputies and thus the chairman of the session, Mr. Radu Berceanu, requested that in the Romanian parliament Mr. Borbely should use the language of the state of which he is a citizen. Despite this the UDMR deputy, according to his own statement, still addressed the chamber with a few words of greeting in Hungarian. In their replies, independent Deputy Petre Turlea and Constantin Ciurtin, a PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party] deputy, protested the idea of celebrating the Hungarians' national day on Romania's soil, considering especially the fact that the UDMR leaders uphold the autonomy of the regions with a majority ethnic Hungarian population, a fact that violates Romania's Constitution. The information bulletin published by the UDMR press bureau, which we received last night via fax, terms the occurrence in the Chamber of Deputies as a regrettable incident, as the UDMR deputy was prevented from uttering a few words in the Hungarian language.
