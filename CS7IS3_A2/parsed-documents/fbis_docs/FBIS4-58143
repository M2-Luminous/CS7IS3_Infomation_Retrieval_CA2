This was said by David Elhayani, head of the Jordan Valley settlements committee, to our correspondent Gil Litman. He said the settlers are extremely concerned about what is expected to take place after the establishment of autonomy in Jericho. He added that the settlers will launch protest actions against the establishment of the Jericho autonomous enclave.
