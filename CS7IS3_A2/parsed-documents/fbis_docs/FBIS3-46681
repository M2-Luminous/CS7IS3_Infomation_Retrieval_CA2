They said independence day ceremonies being held in Yangon [Rangon] by the military junta are an empty display. The rally against the junta, called the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), was organized by the International Network for Burma Relief, the Burma Youth Volunteer Association (BYVA) and the Burmese Relief Center-Japan, organizers said. Not being allowed to pass directly in front of the Myanmar Embassy, human rights activists from various countries and Myanmar dissidents wound their way slowly through nearby streets. They marched in silence to symbolize Myanmar's lack of freedom of speech, said BYVA Chairman Khin Maung Zaw. In a letter to Myanmar dissidents worldwide, Sein Win, prime minister of the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma (NCGUB), said "on a sad note, I see Burma today not as an independent nation, but as a nation enslaved by the military." The NCGUB is made up of lawmakers elected in the 1990 elections who were forced to flee military persecution to the Thai border. In a joint press release, the three groups requested that the United Nations and the international community, including the Japanese Government, use their influence to ask SLORC to transfer power to the democratically elected government. They also asked for the release of Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners immediately and unconditionally.
