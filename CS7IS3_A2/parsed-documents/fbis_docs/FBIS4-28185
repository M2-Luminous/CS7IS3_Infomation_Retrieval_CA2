A MINJU CHOSON analyst today brands this as part of their deliberate moves to push the situation of the Korean peninsula to a more grave phase. The news analyst says: The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets said the "Ulchi Focus Lens" exercise is intended to fill up the "blank" up to the "Team Spirit" joint military exercise which was put off till November. But it is a baloney meant to justify their military actions. The last few months alone witnessed "Hwarang" war exercise in which some 1.3 million troops were mobilized, a "joint tactical training for the first half of this year" involving the puppet ground, naval and air forces, and a "large-scale combined landing exercise". Now, "Rimpac" war exercises are being staged in the Pacific by the United States, Japan, South Korean puppets and others. These facts show that the decision to stage the "Ulchi Focus Lens" joint military exercise is based on a war strategy designed to drive the situation on the Korean peninsula to a phase of war, not a "countermeasure". If the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets defiantly ignite a war on the Korean peninsula, they will have to pay dearly for it.
