The Pakistani Government arrested eight persons in this case. The group members were interrogated and the leaders were sentenced to be executed. However, this sentence was never carried out due to the pressure of certain influential groups. A few days ago, Pakistani publications carried a brief report on the escape of Rashid Sabra, one of the members of the group, while he was being escorted to the special tribunal, in what seemed to be a clearly manipulated scenario. Sabra's escape may be viewed by the local Pakistani officials, including the provincial Punjab government, as a normal incident but in the Iranian public's opinion, this shows a lack of decisiveness in a bilateral issue. The provincial government affiliated with the Muslim League, which claims to be more Islamist than the ruling Pakistan People's Party, can only mar the friendly relations between the two Muslim countries of the region with such an attitude. This also raises the question in the minds of the Shiites about what country is giving orders to the Muslim League leadership. The protection of the lives of citizens and diplomats resident in every country is the responsibility of the central government, on the basis of international protocols. When Ganji was martyred, the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran displayed immense restraint and poise and merely requested that the culprits be punished. However, it did not receive any firm or categorical response. Riaz Sabra is a Pakistani citizen who acted on instructions from some subservient group and martyred one of the cultural officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran and who has become linked to the tarnishing of bilateral relations. Therefore, if the Pakistani Government does not agree with the rumors currently circulating about the nature and the modus operandi of the Sepah-e Sahaba group, it should immediately issue orders for Sabra's arrest and should execute the sentence against all the accused persons of the group. Otherwise, the protests by public opinion will only wound the religious susceptibilities of the Iranian people and will certainly motivate the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to display an official reaction.
