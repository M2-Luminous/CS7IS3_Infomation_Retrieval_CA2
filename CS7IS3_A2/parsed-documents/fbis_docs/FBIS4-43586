Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, the former chairman of the MTK [Central Union of Agricultural Producers] also leaned toward EU membership in his speech. [passage omitted] Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto and Prime Minister Esko Aho have dispelled the Center Party members' concern about security policy. According to Haavisto, Finland must be able to be there and influence the intergovernmental congress of the EU in 1996. According to Prime Minister Aho, there is justification for a national referendum if there are any considerable foreign and security policy changes concerning Finland. [Begin Aho recording] NATO membership is not in any way directly connected to Finland's membership in the EU. My starting point is that if the EU makes decisions that fundamentally change the bases according to which accession is now taking place, then of course, just like in other countries, that must be separately ratified nationally. Surely, if fundamental changes are made to the bases of our security policy, then we will come to a situation where the use of a national referendum is justified. [end recording]
