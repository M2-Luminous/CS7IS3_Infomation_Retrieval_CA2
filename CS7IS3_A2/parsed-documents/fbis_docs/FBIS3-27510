Asked whether the Hong Kong governor's trip to Australia was intended to play the "international card," Zhang Junsheng, who was attending a Spring Festival party hosted by the General Chinese Chamber of Commerce yesterday, said: It is not just now that the Hong Kong governor is beginning to do this. He did it as early as 1992. But it is of no use to play the international card. As for the fact that some officials of other countries chime in and agree with the governor's words, Zhang Junsheng stressed: They do not have much of an understanding of Hong Kong's affairs. Moreover, Hong Kong's affairs should only be studied and discussed between the Chinese and British Governments. A third country has no right whatsoever to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs nor any right to say this or that about the Hong Kong issue. Regarding the Hong Kong governor's affirmation that his "political reform proposal" does not violate the "three principles," Zhang Junsheng said: If the Hong Kong governor were honest, he should have a very good understanding whether or not his so-called political reform proposal violates the Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and the understandings and agreements reached between China and Britain because it has been more than one and a half years now since October 1992. Moreover, with so many views expressed by all sectors of Hong Kong and the many views advanced by the Chinese side which have been published in many newspapers and which have even been compiled into booklets, how then can he take them as if he did not see them. He added: Even now, he still insists that his proposal does not violate the Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, and the understandings and agreements reached between China and Britain. In fact, it is very difficult to understand why, as a governor of Hong Kong, he can say this irrespective of any facts. Regarding the second reading of the first portion of the political reform proposal in the Legislative Council [Legco] next Wednesday, Zhang Junsheng reiterated: The Chinese side had favored that China and Britain could make good arrangements for some affairs during the transition period with good cooperation, particularly some questions including the electoral system. But the fact that the British side does not cooperate has led to the breakdown of the Sino-British talks over the arrangements for the 1994-1995 elections. Therefore, given no cooperation and no agreement between China and Britain, it is very clear that the three-tier councils will all cease to be and will be reorganized on 30 June 1997. He pointed out: Under these circumstances, whatever things or bills the Legco may pass and whatever a Legco is to be established, which will only last for 20 months, are the own affairs of the British Hong Kong Government, while the Chinese side will attend to things properly, together with Hong Kong residents, for Hong Kong's transition in keeping with the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration and will set up a government and a legislature for the special administrative region. As for the fact that the British side stated the need to publicize the contents of the talks, Zhang Junsheng said: The Chinese side will not be opposed to this at all as long as the British side does this through the diplomatic channel. However, I hope the British side should not "curtail the context" as it did when it publicized the seven letters exchanged between the Chinese and British foreign ministers.
