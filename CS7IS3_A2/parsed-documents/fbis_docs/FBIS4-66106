For several weeks the authorities in southwest Germany obviously did not have any idea how dangerous this find was. Only on Thursday [27 May] did investigations by the Land Office for Environmental Protection in Karlsruhe show that the material, which is in a small cylindrical container, is probably this kind of plutonium, the Environment Ministry in Stuttgart announced. According to the Ministry, the amount seized is "highly dangerous" and is so far the largest amount found in Baden-Wuerttemberg. However, the amount is not sufficient to produce a nuclear bomb. The material probably comes from an East European country. The Stuttgart Land Office of Criminal Investigations has taken over investigations. Information about the occasion, the place, and the exact date of the search was not given for "tactical reasons." In addition, the Ministry announced that "following initial suspicion, the local fire brigade did not register any radioactive radiation outside the container."
