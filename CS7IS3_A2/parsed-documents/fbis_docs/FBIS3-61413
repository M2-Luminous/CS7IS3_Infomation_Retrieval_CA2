An amorphous strip of Fe[.sub]80[/]B[.sub]10[/]Si[.sub]10[/] measuring 20 �m in thickness and 10 mm in width was used for the studies. The alloy was obtained by enriching iron with 2 atomic percent of the stable isotope [.sup]57[/]Fe to make it possible to obtain quality Mossbauer conversion electron spectra in a relatively short amount of time. The alloy strip was studied in its initial state and after cycles of isochronous annealing in a vacuum of about 10[.sup]-3[/] Pa for 1 hour at temperatures of 50 to 800�C. The specimens were also studied by x-ray diffraction, Mossbauer absorption spectroscopy, and sliding-beam x-ray diffraction. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the Fe[.sub]80[/]B[.sub]10[/]Si[.sub]10[/] demonstrated that in its starting state, it is amorphous. The first signs of its crystallization, manifested in terms of the appearance of a weak intensity against the background of the ``halo'' that is characteristic of amorphous materials, were observed after annealing at temperatures of 295-315�C. As the annealing temperature was increased, the percentage of crystalline phase increased. The study Fe[.sub]80[/]B[.sub]10[/]Si[.sub]10[/] was found to undergo four stages of structural development: No structural changes were evident at 0-300�C. At 300-400�C, a body-centered crystal lattice with the characteristic close atomic order similar to that in the amorphous matrix developed; this process was accompanied by an explicit change in orientation of magnetic moments. At temperatures of 400-500�C, the percentage of body-centered crystal lattice increased until the amorphous matrix completely disappeared (after the specimen had been held for 1 hour at 455�C), and processes of close demixing began. At 500-800�C, a transition to an equilibrium phase diagram occurred. In its equilibrium state, the specimen consisted of two phases: a body-centered crystal lattice and Fe[.sub]2[/]B. The Mossbauer spectroscopy studies pinpointed the temperature of onset of crystallization at around 250�C and indicated that the crystal regions lie at a depth of about 15 nm. The first of the above stages (i.e., 0 to 300�C) included three stages of structural relaxation. They were identified by changes in the specimen's magnetic characteristics at 75, 175, and 255�C. No structural changes were evident in the first two stages. In third stage, which is the most favorable from the standpoint of optimizing the magnetic properties of amorphous strips and increasing the stability of its properties over time, was accompanied by the appearance of nanocrystal regions in the near-surface layer of the amorphous strip's contact side.
