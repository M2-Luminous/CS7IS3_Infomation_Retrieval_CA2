The Council's Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko announced in the parliament's upper house on Tuesday that Yeltsin will submit the document as part of his legislative initiative. Shumeyko explained that Yeltsin is offering lawmakers the opportunity to first discuss the role of the Prosecutor General's Office and only "then choose a person to run it." So far Aleksey Ilyushenko has been acting as Prosecutor General, despite the fact that he has proved unpopular in the Federation Council. After Shumeyko's statement, the issue of making the proposal on a Prosecutor General part of the session's agenda was put to a vote at several legislators insistence. However, it was not included in the agenda because the motion did not collect the necessary number of votes.
