Vladimir Yakovlev also intends to attract investors from the business community to restoration of 180,000 square meters of city-owned condemned residential space on the terms of giving them 20 percent of the restored residential space. The mayoralty currently is preparing a directive on investor support for the reconstruction of 51 houses. The mayoralty also had plans to direct 56 billion rubles into reconstruction of 46 more buildings. No money has yet been appropriated from the budget, however. The next urgent topic that has brought about a lively discussion among heads of administrations was the problem of property registration in the residential sphere. (According to information received from competent sources, 13 murders have been recorded in Petersburg stemming from disputes that have emerged during registration.) On 1 March a directive was issued liquidating design and inventory bureaus (DIB), which until then had been in charge of these matters. Anatoliy Sobchak did not like the fact that DIB's were commercial organizations, joint-stock companies, and state enterprises all at the same time. The mayor intends to transfer the registration function to the mayoralty's residential housing committee. Another subject discussed at the conference in Smolnyy was the crime situation. A decision was made to resurrect people's patrols. There are currently 397 people's patrol detachments [PND] in the city. The mayoralty's administrative organs department will conduct the people's patrols training through its rayon branches. Meanwhile, the Smolnyy is drafting the procedures for remuneration of PND members. Representatives of the Petersburg City Administration of Internal Affairs presented at the conference a report on combating illegal production of alcoholic beverages; they reported that on 27 February they uncovered at the medical preparations plant a "factory" that replaced the labels on Iskra glass cleaner with those of the Zvezda Rossii vodka trademark.
