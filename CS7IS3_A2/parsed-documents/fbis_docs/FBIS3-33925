The sources were reacting to comments by Muhammad Jihad, a central committee member of PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat's maintsream Fatah faction, that the organisation had overcome the crisis after receiving 29 million dollars in fresh aid from Arab and other countries. "What Muhammad Jihad said is untrue," said an Abu Dhabi-based PLO official, who requested anonymity. "The crisis is continuing. We have not received our salaries for more than eight months." Several employees at the PLO missions in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and other oil-rich Gulf states, contacted by AFP, confirmed they had not received their salaries since mid-1993. They said a circular sent by the PLO's foreign minister, Faruq Qaddumi, four months ago asking them to resign if they want was still in force. The PLO has been facing increasing financial problems since the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states halted aid to protest its sympathy with Iraq during its seven-month occupation of Kuwait nearly three years ago. GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and the UAE -- were the main bankrollers of the PLO before the Iraqi invasion, providing it with more than two billion dollars in official aid. Billions of dollars have also been extended through private donations from Gulf shaykhs and businessmen and a five-percent tax on Palestinians living in the region. Repeated attempts by the PLO to mend fences with the GCC were crowned with a reconciliation meeting between 'Arafat and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh last week. Kuwait, however, has said it will not deal with 'Arafat again. The PLO's financial woes coincided with its peace accord with Israel, which could also be a boon in financial terms. The September 13 deal has already won he PLO pledges for two billion dollars in aid in the autonomous areas. In an interview with Wednesday's UAE daily AL-KHALIJ, Jihad had said the PLO had received 15 million dollars from Greece, five million from Malaysia, three million from Indonesia, two million from Turkey, two million from Algeria and around two million from Saudi Arabia. "The PLO has overcome its financial crisis," he said. "We have disbursed two-month salaries for all PLO staff."
