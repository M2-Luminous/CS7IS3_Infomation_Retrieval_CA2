DSP Chairman Takashi Yonezawa told a news conference that an uncompromising stance by the coalition would lead to the collapse of talks with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] and Sakigake for their return to the ruling camp. "If we build up high hurdles at the outset, the talks would lead only to breaking off," he said. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's minority coalition will open talks with the second largest opposition SDP next week to lure it back to the coalition and restore a stable government amid threats of a no- confidence motion by the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The SDP in April walked out of the broad coalition that supported the administration of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa over a move by some coalition partners to create a new Diet bloc without the socialists. Yonezawa said the ruling coalition might make some concessions on the thorny issue of a consumption tax hike. "We have left the issue undecided for meeting halfway with the SDP in the planned talks," he said. The Hata administration wants to raise the consumption tax from the current 3 percent to secure fiscal revenues to finance continued tax cuts and also to reform the taxation structure in the face of a rapidly aging society. But the SDP, which opposed the introduction of the value-added tax, is still dead set against any steep raise. On the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program, Yonezawa said the easing of tension following former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's visit to Pyongyang may be of great help. "The fact that (the atmosphere) is becoming considerably softer due to former President Carter's visit is a favorable factor," he said. The SDP, which has a long tradition of friendly ties with Pyongyang, is averse to Japan taking a hard line against North Korea over the issue. Yonezawa also said the Hata cabinet should resign rather than dissolve the House of Representatives if a no-confidence vote against him passes the diet. "We would like to avoid elections under the current multiseat constituency system. We should seek a way toward a stable government through the cabinet's resignation en masse," he said. The current election system is to be replaced with a new system of combined single-seat and proportional representation after a government committee finishes redrawing an electoral map in line with the political reform bills that passed the Diet in January. The LDP has vowed to submit a motion of no confidence once the budget bills pass the diet, probably next week. If the SDP supports the move, the no-confidence motion will be certain to clear the lower house, leaving Hata with a stark choice of either dissolving the lower house to call snap polls or stepping down with his ministers. Yonezawa said if the policy-making boards of the LDP and SDP decide to proceed with a no-confidence vote, it will create a great "reaction" within the two parties, referring to possible defection moves.
