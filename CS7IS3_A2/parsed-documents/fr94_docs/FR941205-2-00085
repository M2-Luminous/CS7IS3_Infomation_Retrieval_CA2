On July 26, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change 1 pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 2 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. 3 The rule change amends the examination specifications and study outline for the Series 39 examination. 1 The NASD filed five amendments, four of which were filed subsequent to the notice being published in the Federal Register . In the first amendment, filed on August 1, 1994, the NASD provided the amended examination specifications for the Series 39 exam. The examination specifications were filed pursuant to a request by the NASD for confidential treatment. In the second amendment, filed on August 31, 1994, the NASD provided the question bank for the Series 39 exam. The question bank was filed pursuant to a request by the NASD for confidential treatment. In the third amendment, filed via facsimile on September 7, 1994, the NASD provided a one page summary of the changes to the Series 39 specifications and study outline. In the fourth amendment, filed on October 13, 1994, the NASD provided more questions to be added to the question bank for the Series 39 exam. The test selection specifications were also amended.

The NASD has revised materials pertaining to new products, and has included new material pertaining to recently effective regulations affecting direct participation programs. The number of questions per examination and the examination time are unaffected by the amendments. Notice of the proposed rule change, as amended, together with its terms of substance was provided by issuance of a Commission release 4 and by publication in the Federal Register . 5 No comments were received in response to the Notice. This order approves the proposed rule change, which will be effective 60 days from the date of this order. 4 Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 34495 (August 5, 1994). 5 59 FR 42625 (August 18, 1994). As the NASD indicated in its rule filing, the amendments to the Series 39 examination are designed to reflect recent changes in the products offered in the industry and to reflect changes in the rules and regulations affecting direct participation programs. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD, including the requirements of Section 15A(g)(3) of the Act. 6 Section 15A(g)(3) provides, among other things, that a registered securities association may require that members and their associated persons meet certain training, experience and competence standards. The proposed changes to the examination will help ensure that persons seeking registration in the securities industry have attained the requisite levels of knowledge and competence. 6 15 U.S.C. ยง78 o &hyph;3(g)(3). It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;43 be, and hereby is, approved, effective on January 30, 1995. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 7 7 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
