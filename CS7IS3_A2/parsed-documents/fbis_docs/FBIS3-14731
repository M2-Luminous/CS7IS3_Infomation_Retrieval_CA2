She said, firstly, it was Azerbaijan that together with the former Soviet 4th Army carried out the forcible deportation of thousands of Karabakh Armenians in the spring and summer of 1991. Secondly, as she went on, it was Azerbaijan which imposed fierce economic blockades on Armenia and Karabakh that are gross violations of human rights. Thirdly, it was Azerbaijan which first used weapons of indiscriminate destruction against Karabakh civilian people, including Grad multiple-missile rocket launchers, that Baroness Cox witnessed herself while visiting Stepanakert. Fourthly, only Azerbaijan has used aerial bombardment of Karabakh populated areas. And, fifthly, only Azerbaijan has used ground-to-air missiles against civilians. As Baroness Cox affirmed, all these ways were used by Azerbaijan to drive out completely Armenians from Karabakh. She reminded of former Azerbaijan President Elchibey's words: "If there is a single Armenian living in Nagorno-Karabakh in October, the people of Azerbaijan can take me and hang me in the central square of Baku". It is hard to find more convincing proofs of Azerbaijan leadership's real intentions, she concluded.
