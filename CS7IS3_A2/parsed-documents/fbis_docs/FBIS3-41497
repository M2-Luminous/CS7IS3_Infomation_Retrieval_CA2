This independent institution will promote the application of wind energy and provide scientific information. A location for the bureau has not yet been decided. The initiative comes from the Organization for Lasting Energy [ODE], the Netherlands Association for Wind Energy [Newin], and the Netherlands Energy and the Environment Company [Novem]. ``The Bureau should partly assume the work which was formerly done by Newin and ODE separately,'' says Mirjam Tielen, staff member from ODE. Novem, together with industry, supplies the funding of the bureau.
