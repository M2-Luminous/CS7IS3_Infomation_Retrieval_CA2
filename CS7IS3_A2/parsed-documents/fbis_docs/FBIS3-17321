Shortage of money for the development of special technologies, construction of various installations and other jobs, envisaged by the complex programme, retards the implementation of the already adopted decisions. General Tarasevich believes that this year will be decisive for preparations to begin the planned destruction of chemical weapons. He denied rumours and publications on the alleged "incineration of chemical shells". "All the ammunition is being reliably guarded and poses no threat to the environment," Tarasevich said. He believes they could remain stored for several more years. "It would be wrong to shift the difficult job of destroying them to the next generation. There is every opportunity to do it now, relying on international agreements," Tarasevich noted.
