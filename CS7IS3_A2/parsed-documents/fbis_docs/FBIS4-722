The first contingent comprising military observers has been operating in Rwanda since December 1993. The second detachment meant for the UN civil police has been on mission in Rwanda since January. The Togolese Armed Forces High Command is in permanent contact with UN and UNAMIR officials. Following the recent painful events in Rwanda following the assassination of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents, the United Nations has taken measures to ensure the security of all UNAMIR contingents. At the moment, we can assert that the situation of our detachments in Rwanda does not give cause for concern.
