Prem Suwal, secretary of the Nepal Worker-Peasant Party, said in his report at the meeting that the two parties have since the publication of the joint statement intensified their joint struggle against imperialism and revisionism, firmly maintaining the socialist line in keeping with the common idea and principle and tightened the bonds of comradely and militant unity and cooperation in this struggle. He went on: "The Nepal Worker-Peasant Party and the Workers' Party of Korea agreed on the joint statement in order that they keep to the socialist line under the banner of independence against imperialism. "Now the imperialist reactionaries are resorting to heavier pressure and threat, getting noisier in their anti-socialist and anti-DPRK campaign. But the Korean people firmly armed with the chuche idea are tightly adhering to the socialist line, not wavering in face of all moves of the enemies, with the leader, the party and the masses closely united in one mind. This is entirely just. "The great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year address indicated the fundamental principles and ways of the solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula. He warned that pressure and threat would not lead to a solution of the problem but bring a catastrophe, and called for defending the sovereignty of the country more firmly and meeting all the challenges of the enemies resolutely. "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is unswervingiy advancing under the banner of socialism, defying ever more undisguised moves of the imperialist forces to isolate and stifle it. The secret to its might lies in its firm adherence to independence."
