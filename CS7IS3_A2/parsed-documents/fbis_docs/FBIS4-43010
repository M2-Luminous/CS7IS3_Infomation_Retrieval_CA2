"An extraordinarily useful meeting," commented Martino who was at his debut with the sixteen NATO nations and added that the final shape of the agreement, which could be signed before the Group of Seven summit in Naples, provides a "happy wedding" between the two requirements. According to Martino, Russia had to be accorded great-power status, even after the Soviet Union's disintegration, for domestic and international reasons. At the same time, the East and Central European countries had to be reassured that they would be left in "subordination to a hegemony." Since the debate on Russian relations with NATO began as the Cold War faded into the past, the need to accord Russia great-power status has been a constant in Italian foreign policy, not only because it is a nuclear power, but because of the contribution it can make in terms of political stability. The Partnership for Peace has already been signed by another 20 East European and ex-Soviet states. To reassure them, the NATO foreign ministers said the pact would enter specific accords with Moscow only as regards issues not covered by the partnership. These include nuclear non-proliferation and cooperation against terrorism. Martino, who confirmed the continuity of the Italian commitment to NATO, said that another problem would be to watch out for Russian attempts to water down the alliance's "identity" to the benefit of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, with the idea of "somehow legitimising the latter's right to interfere in NATO's decisions." Martino also urged the European nations to make a greater contribution to NATO and to take on greater responsibilities within it. He also told reporters that the situation in Rwanda was "extremely complex." He added that something had to be done to halt the tragedy, also voicing hope in the success of UN attempts to send in a contingent of 5,500 men from African countries under a decision taken last night. As far as Italy is concerned, he said, there would be no "hasty decisions not linked to the UN or the countries involved." He added that the Italian government will decide next Tuesday [14 June] on whom it intends to support as the successor to Jacques Delors as European Commission president. According to Martino, the government will also be deciding on the candidates Italy will be proposing for the other major international organisations, from the European Union to NATO, the Western European Union, and the OECD. To date, the only official Italian candidate is ex-Foreign Trade Minister Renato Ruggiero to head the World Trade Organisation, which will replace GATT. Martino said Italy plans to propose a packet of names, deciding in which cases to advance Italian candidatures and when the candidates of other countries will be backed. [passage omitted] According to NATO's deputy secretary-general, Sergio Balanzino, however, today's agreement confirms that NATO and Russia have now truly begun on the task of building a new security system in Europe. At today's talks, the NATO diplomatic chiefs also agreed to keep a closer watch on growing instability in the Mediterranean region, studying eventual moves that may prove necessary. (Interviewed on a Fininvest news and chat show in Rome, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi noted that a constant in Italian policy had been to insist on Russia's presence at the Naples summit and in the Partnership for Peace.) (He also said the Italian position had been to insist on a more important role for Russia in the partnership than the four Central and East European countries that have already joined and are seeking EU membership.) ("We'll receive greater consideration internationally, if we resolve our problems of public finance, criminality and corruption," he added.) In a bilateral meeting, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe' told Martino that the section of the Naples summit involving Russian President Boris Yeltsin would be an appropriate framework for seeking new impetus for a solution of the Bosnian crisis at the highest level. Official sources said that Martino and Juppe' agreed on the need for a more effective negotiating mechanism if a political solution was to be found. [passage omitted]
