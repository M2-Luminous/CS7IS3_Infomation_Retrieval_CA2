We cannot continue on this level of uncertainty and confusion. Deeply concerned by the current situation, which endangers the legitimate hopes of the Guatemalan people, hopes that will be dashed by a situation imposed by groups opposed to a political solution and just and democratic peace, and in light of the government's delay in directing and defining its policies, the URNG General Command states to the people of Guatemala and the international community: Today marks the third week since the solemn signing of the Global Agreement on Human Rights, a historic document intended to have an immediate impact on the country's social and political life if it is seriously implemented. It is disquieting that, to date, there has been no specific proof of the government's political willingness to implement the agreement. Twenty-one days have passed and the government has not complied with the simplest point in the agreement; that is, to advise the people, through massive multilingual campaigns and the media, of the contents of such an important document. Quite the contrary has occurred. Instead of carrying out this indispensable, instructional task, the government has undertaken a strong campaign to confuse and misinform the people of the contents of the agreements. The government is spreading misleading facts to try to promote the image that the URNG is disintegrating as a fighting force, something that we have described on several occasions as a dirty trick by the Armed Forces. Most serious of all is the fact that since the signing of the Global Agreement on Human Rights, there has been a wave of attacks on prominent people that is being condemned by everyone. In addition, intimidation based on threats and charges against people and religious organizations called to play an important role of the Civilian Society Assembly [Asamblea de la Sociedad Civil] in the negotiation process has continued. All this represents not only a violation of human rights but also a clear disregard for the agreements and an intention to hinder their implementation. It would be very bad to keep silent and not warn of the serious implications this has for the present and future of the country. Everyone is aware of the destabilization plan to block the negotiation process. It is indispensable to point out that the government's policy to confront this situation is incoherent. The government's security forces are obligated to clarify these criminal actions. They can do it because they know the origin of the plan and how it operates. The government of the Republic must act firmly, openly, and efficiently toward that end. It is unacceptable and censurable for the answer to be a display of military force, the presence of which is directed at intimidating the people. Establishing an illegal state of siege will not solve the problems of crime or public insecurity; on the contrary, it will inhibit and hamper the people's ability to express themselves, to protest, and to denounce what is wrong. For all of the above, the URNG General Command hereby demands: That the government strictly abide by the General Agreement on Human Rights, without delay in all of its points; That there be strong action taken against the destabilizing forces to denounce and identify them and to bring them to justice; That work begin immediately to divulge the complete text of the General Agreement on Human Rights and the commitment agreement to discuss and reach a consensus on the composition, operation, and authority of the Investigation Commission to clarify all human rights violations committed during the country's armed conflict; That the deployed military forces be withdrawn; That urgent action be taken to end the intimidation and terror certain sectors of public security organizations are inflicting upon civilian organizations and their leaders, under the cover of anonymity; That Army organizations cease their campaigns of misinformation and manipulation and that other government officials who are part of the peace process be prohibited from repeating such information. The URNG calls upon all sectors of society not to be intimidated or inhibited, to speak out loudly against any form of threat or cohesion, and to strongly demand complete fulfillment of the General Agreement on Human Rights. The URNG calls on the international community to be vigilant, now more than ever, on the fulfillment of the General Agreement on Human Rights at this particularly critical and dangerous moment and to offer the Guatemalan people and their organizations its full support, as they fight their decisive battles at this time. [Signed] URNG General Command [Dated] 19 April 1994
