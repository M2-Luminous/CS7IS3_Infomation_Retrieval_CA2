The Budget will paint a grim, if realistic, picture of the financial state of the country. Sources who read a copy of Mr Liu's speech last night said the Finance Minister had predicted a slowdown in the growth of revenue and a surge of expenditure this year, leading to a gargantuan shortfall. Total expenditure in 1994 is projected at 542.9 billion yuan, up by 15 percent from last year. The central treasury is forecast to receive a total of 475.9 billion yuan of revenue this year, representing a 7.7 percent increase over the previous year. This results in a budgetary shortfall of 67 billion yuan. By contrast, the budget deficit for 1993 was 20.5 billion yuan. However, Mr Liu said the accounting system this year had been changed to bring the Budget more in line with international practice. Chinese economists said last night that the change had made it difficult to gauge the true extent of the difference between the deficits. They pointed out that if the new accounting system had been used last year, the deficit would have been much higher than 20.5 billion yuan. Mr Liu said that the increase of revenue for 1994 would be "restrained" by the fact that the "revenue base" last year was already considerable and that room for expansion was limited. Tax exemption to be given to the ailing state industrial sector would mean a cut of income of 14 billion yuan, he said. Mr Liu also said the total size of domestic and foreign debts would reach a staggering 129.2 billion yuan this year, up by 39.3 billion yuan from 1993. Allocations for agriculture would be boosted to 37.8 billion yuan, which translated into a dramatic growth of 17.4 percent over the previous year. Agrarian-related expenditure include the setting up of a risk fund, increased investments for the rural sector in general, and measures to guarantee an increase for the income of farmers of at least five percent a year. Science, technology culture, and education will get an increase of funds from 18 to 20 percent in the face of frantic lobbying from these sectors. On the expenditure plan for 1994, a staggering 187.4 billion yuan has been set aside for providing funds to regions. It is understood that these cover tax returns to regions under the new tax reform programme. Nonproduction type of infrastructure is estimated to cost the central treasury a total of 12 billion yuan. Expenditure on social development will reach 19.4 billion yuan. A total of 62.3 billion yuan will be spent under a category called "construction of the Government and regime." It is not known whether that also covers defence expenditure. The central treasury is to spend a total of 13.1 billion yuan on price subsidies. According to the Budget, the actual revenue in 1993 stood at 511.4 billion yuan, up by 23.2 percent. The actual total expenditure last year was 531.8 billion yuan, representing an increase of 21.2 percent. Total expenditure on defence in 1993 was 43.2 billion yuan, slightly higher than the estimate of 42.5 billion yuan in last year's budget. The Budget attributes the increase of expenditure to funds for money-losing enterprises, wages doubling from an estimated four billion yuan to eight billion. The Finance Minister revealed that the financial situation both at the central and region levels had been so severe that some regions had met difficulty in paying wages for workers. Describing the financial situation as "severe" and "tough," Mr Liu said the tight situation would be aggravated further by factors such as the high-level investment in fixed-assets, increased procurement prices for grain, and higher expenditure on wages for civil servants. Mr Liu has laid down the major tasks for this year as: Tightening control on expenditure, strengthening macrolevel adjustment and control, cutting expenditure by governments of all levels; increasing funding for education, agriculture and infrastructure development; and limiting the money supply. The Finance Minister also indicated that funds for national defence and the law-and-order establishment would be "assured." Analysts expect the defence budget to go up on a par with the 13 per cent increase granted to the People's Liberation Army last year. In his 25-page report, Mr Liu insisted that drastic fiscal reform in the past two months had proven "correct" with no major problems resulting. But he would call on legislators not to relax their fiscal prudence because there was always discrepancy between the targets laid down in the policy and the reality. "This is inevitable," Mr Liu said. He urged regions to coordinate their interests and keep a constant watch on the implementation of tax reform. Any problems should be nipped in the bud before they get worse, he said. Regions were warned to take the "overall national interest" above their own and not to make their own local regulations on taxes and other financial matters. Mr Liu will also urge delegates to strictly follow the Budget, adding any local level budget deficits "will not be acceptable." The battle against malpractices in taxation such as evasion and avoidance should continue unabated he said. Localities will also be asked to ensure the smooth issuing of government bonds. Under the new budget, the central government is to curb expenditure while ensuring adequate funds for essential capital projects.
