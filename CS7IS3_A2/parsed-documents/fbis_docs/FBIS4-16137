According to its founders, the new organization is a "party dedicated to working people" seeking to restore communist ideas. In the opposition's opinion, before the new party is registered, it is necessary to establish the relations of its members with the subunit of the USSR Communist Party, which functioned illegally in Lithuania. Representatives of the Lithuanian Ministry of Justice have reported that the rules for registering political organizations do not envision such a procedure. They have also said that thus far they have not received any official application from the Socialist Party requesting legalization.
