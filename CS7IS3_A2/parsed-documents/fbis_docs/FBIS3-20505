The role of political indoctrinators and political parties on campuses not only has not been eliminated or reduced as the result of "post-martial law" structural changes; instead it has acquired greater legal standing and greater support than during the martial law era. Looked at with a "post-martial law" view, the product of martial law is old goods in old garb that are more martial than martial law. How can it be regarded as other than an ancient relic? Of course, the things that hundred year old shops sell are rich in "historical value." At each election time, the KMT pulls out all stops to win over the public. It breaks its neck repaying the debts it owes; it goes all out to resolve grievances; and it writes all the checks that it has to write. From the chairman of the party to the candidates for office, everyone says nice things and thinks of all possible ways to coax and humbug the electorate into going to polling places to vote. But once the voting is over, the KMT reverts to its old ways. It will not budge on areas it must guard, and it will not relent on time it wants to control. Old debts are repaid only to incur new ones, and old grievances are resolved only to be replaced by new ones. The wider gap today between the KMT and the intellectuals on amendment of the university law is a classic example. The fact is that for several years prior to amendment of the university law, the percentage of "non-KMT" or "anti-KMT" people on college campuses, from professors to students, has gradually increased. In recent years, in particular, in the aftermath of several large and small student demonstrations, the political position of many college students has tilted more and more toward the opposition party. Following graduation, college students who played the role of student movement leaders, either go into jobs helping opposition party candidates run for election, or become assistants to opposition party legislators. An even larger number rush off to opposition party candidate headquarters to volunteer whenever an election occurs. In addition, each time those in charge of student groups have been re-elected in recent years, most have been elected from among opposition party students. This also makes clear the political atmosphere on college campuses today. Of course, college campuses still have very many professors and students who are strongly loyal to the KMT, but with each student campaign, the number who are strongly loyal to the KMT declines somewhat. This is a plain fact. During the past several years, the KMT has "fostered" and "created" quite a few opposition party elite in colleges. The "March Student Campaign" of more than three years ago was such a case; the "100 Actions League" of two years ago was such a case; and the present campaign to "rescue the university law" is naturally no exception. During the martial law period, whether political indoctrinators and political parties should leave college campuses may have been a substantive issue, but today the issue of whether political indoctrinators and political parties should leave simply cannot generate any real effect on college students whose independence is increasing daily. No matter how ferocious political indoctrinators may be, the students can simply ignore them; and no matter how pervasive political parties, the students can make their own choice. Nevertheless, today the matter of political indoctrinators and political parties leaving or not leaving has become a symbolic issue. Leaving denotes an open frame of mind; not leaving denotes a conservative frame of mind. This is the main reason for the linking of hands by students and professors in opposition to amendment of the university law. Superficially, the KMT has won in the university law amendment process, but ill will between the intellectuals and the KMT has deepened. This is the grievous price that the KMT must pay. The percentage of this generation of college students to go over to the opposition party camp will consequently increase. This is the second price the KMT must pay. The university law amendment process also makes the public realize once again the true face of the hundred year old KMT shop. It attests once again that the KMT speaks nothing but pretty lies, that it is an old political party with a thoroughly conservative frame of mind, and that Li Teng-hui's "changing into new garb," and "selling new goods" is nothing more than a deceptive slogan. This is an even greater price that the KMT must pay. The KMT obtained a university law, but it lost confidence and an image. Whether the KMT has gained or lost is clear.
