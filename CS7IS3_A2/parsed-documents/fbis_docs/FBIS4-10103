During the past few years the judicial branch's percentage of the country's budget has varied a lot. From 1965 to 1969, the average was 0.52 percent. It was 0.59 percent from 1970 to 1974. Matters did not change during the 1980's (it must be recalled that the 1979 Constitution established that 2 percent of the budget was to be set aside for the judicial branch). From 1980 to 1984, the judicial branch's average share of the budget was 0.42 percent. From 1985 to 1990, the average was 0.55 percent. Now, it is worthwhile to comment that in 1964 salaries accounted for 86.7 percent of the judicial branch's budget, while in 1990 it was only 20.9 percent and a mere 14 percent in 1994. In other words, judges' salaries became a mere ancillary element when the budget was being drafted. The Current Situation In 1994, the judicial branch submitted a budget for 440 million soles. The Treasury allocated barely 116 million soles, 0.70 percent of the national budget. Of the 95 million soles asked for in the remunerations category, only 16.8 million soles were given. In other words, less than 20 percent of what was asked for. And what is even worse, in this item there has been a 2 million-sol reduction compared with last year's budget because the judicial branch received 18.5 million soles in 1993. As mentioned in a previous report, a Supreme Court justice gets a salary of 3,800 soles. The judicial branch's governing law establishes that a superior justice must get 90 percent of a Supreme Court justice's salary, in other words 3,400 soles. But matters are very different: He gets only 1,600 soles. In the case of penal, civil, and assorted judges, the law indicates that they must get 80 percent of a Supreme Court justice's salary, 3,000 soles in other words. Reality is dramatic: They only earn 1,100 soles. Justices of the peace they should earn 2,600 soles, but they only get 700. A judicial branch official said: "In submitting this plan, our objective was to pay the salaries in accordance with the law." But this will not be possible now. Regarding the works category, the judicial branch requested 15 million soles and was given 7.439 million. The sum that had been requested was to have been used to equip the new courts that will operate in the former seats of the Economy and Education Ministries and for other minor works. A sum of 28 million soles was asked for assets, but the Treasury only released 10.2 million. Some Improvements But not everything is bad. Important improvements have been made this year. For example: There is a rule that allows the judicial branch Executive Council to administer its own resources within determined parameters: It can use 30 percent of its budget to improve salaries. This rule in itself is revolutionary because there have been occasions when the judicial branch has not been able to dispose of its own resources, and, therefore, could not resolve problems within its scope. For example: In 1993 it was hoped the category for its own resources would be 10 million soles, but 13.2 million soles were accrued, over 3 million soles more than estimated. Since the budget was controlled by the Economy Ministry's Public Credit Directorate and the programming is rigid, a budget increase request had to be submitted to Congress. This was not obtained due to the complicated and bureaucratic rules. A high-ranking judicial branch official has said: "Had a larger budget been obtained, it would have been possible to establish the first court of appeals in buildings that used to seat the Economy and Education Ministries. Progress could also have been made in eradicating corruption from the courts." This new situation allows officials of the Executive Council of the judicial branch to increase its resources. The 1994 budget has 14 million soles but based on several measures there are plans to collect 24 million soles. How is it possible to reach this goal? For example, a decision was made to end the forging the paid certificates of the Record of Sentences. Things would go better if a law -- which is being prepared -- is approved returning to the judicial branch its right to legalize accounting books. In this way it can collect another 10.2 million soles. Something similar will occur with the official application forms that must be purchased. There will be no longer any forging because high security paper will be used. This represents greater security. This measure is expected to yield another 30 million soles. Despite the law of own resources and the ambitious projects of the judicial branch, some Economy Ministry officials want to deny this right to the judicial branch. To do that, they talk about the differences between the concept of "own revenues" used in the law favoring the judicial branch and the "other concepts of the Treasury" established in the Budget Law. A harsh campaign must be carried out on behalf of the judicial branch. Another important improvement is the Basic Spending Concentration Program included in the 1994 National Budget. This program will be used in judicial matters, health, and education. It will serve to make disbursements from the Treasury without the ridigity of the budget regulations. The idea is to increase the number of justices of the peace with law degrees and to train those who do not have any degree. It is estimated that $10 million will be invested in this project. A Basic Objective The possibility of managing its own resources will make the judicial branch eligible for credit from national and international organizations. Sources close to the Executive Council of the judicial branch have said that one way to finally resolve the problem of the low salary of judges would be to request a loan from the World Bank or the Inter-American Development Agency. A high- ranking official said: "A request of $20 to $30 million payable over two to three years could be made." Conclusions An evaluation of the figures and percentages allocated to the judicial branch this year indicates that apparently no important changes would be made. There is a growing trend for even less money being allocated for salaries. The law allowing the judicial branch to manage its own resources opens the possibility of producing its own income and being eligible for international credit. The reaction of some Economy Ministry officials who want to deny this right to the judicial branch cannot be understood. The Basic Spending Concentration Program represents an important progress because it establishes priorities by the government. But a budget to solve all the needs of justice is still far away.
