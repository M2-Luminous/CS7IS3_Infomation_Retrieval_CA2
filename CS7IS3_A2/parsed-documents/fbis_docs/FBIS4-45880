The carcass of an elephant was found in south Raidak on Friday. Wildlife officials suspect it to be the fifth victim of the disease. The differences surfaced with the district veterinary doctors maintaining that no "Bacillus anthraxcis" could be traced in the blood of the last three victims. The wildlife officials were however, more than certain that external symptoms showed evidence of the pachyderms being affected with anthrax. Not satisfied with the findings of the district veterinary doctors, they arranged to send blood samples to Calcutta for re-examination. The veterinary doctors' attempt to rule out an anthrax attack was not without reason. With signs of the disease still spreading and taking its toll, there was an increasing possibility of the doctors being criticized for having failed to give advance warning. The wildlife officials said that had there been the slightest indication of the disease, immunization programmes could have been taken up in right earnest and the casualties could be restricted. Even last year, the Forest Department undertook immunization programmes.
