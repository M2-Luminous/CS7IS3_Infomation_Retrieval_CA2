The shipment includes 20 tonnes of baby food and two tonnes of medicaments. Head of the Russian ministry for emergency situations Valery Shuykov said the action was a manifestation of the Russian people's wish to help the Yugoslavs at their time of need. The hospitality and gratitude which we felt from the moment we stepped on the ground of your great country is indescribable, he said. This was a second humanitarian delivery which the United Nations Sanctions Committee has lately approved without delay, in only six days. The first was sent by the Greek government. The committee has so far prevented this kind of assistance and we are grateful to the Russian government and the embassy in Belgrade for investing great efforts to ensure that the humanitarian supplies reach our country, said commissioner for refugees of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia Dobrica Vulovic. Humanitarian supplies are exempted from the regime of sanctions which was imposed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in May 1992 because of its alleged involvement in the civil war in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina but humanitarian deliveries sent to Yugoslavia have nevertheless been delayed owing to petty bureaucracy practiced by the sanctions committee. As a result of the tough economic sanctions, the population of Yugoslavia and over 700,000 refugees are currently on the verge of total poverty because the country lacks the most essential products, medicaments and fuels for heating apartments, schools and refugee centres during winter months.
