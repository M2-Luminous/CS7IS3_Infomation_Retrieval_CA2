FR940921-0-00002 FR940921-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;138&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9027; AD 94&hyph;19&hyph;05] Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain British Aerospace Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes. This action requires revising the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to limit reversion of the flight controls to manual (unpowered) operation. This action also provides optional terminating action for the AFM limitation. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracking of certain brackets and levers in the primary flight control system due to residual stresses, mechanical loading, and material properties changes associated with aging. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent loss of integrity of the primary flight control system due to structural failure of the brackets or levers. DATES: Effective October 6, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of October 6, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before November 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;138&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from British Aerospace, Inc., 22070 Broderick Drive, Sterling, Virginia 20166. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain British Aerospace Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes. The CAA advises that it has received reports of cracking of certain brackets and levers in the primary flight control system. These brackets and levers were manufactured from L53 aluminum alloy casting material. Investigation has revealed that the cracking may be attributed to a combination of residual stresses, mechanical loading, and material properties changes associated with aging. Cracking of these brackets and levers could lead to structural failure of these components. This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of integrity of the primary flight control system. British Aerospace has issued Alert Service Bulletin 27&hyph;A&hyph;PM6025, Issue 1, dated March 23, 1994, which specifies a new operating restriction for reversion of the flight controls to manual (unpowered) operation. Limiting /such reversion to emergency situations only will greatly reduce the probability that flight control system brackets and levers (manufactured from L53 aluminum alloy casting material) will experience higher stresses, and thereby higher probability of structural failure associated with manual operation of the flight control systems. The alert service bulletin also describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect cracking of the rudder pedal pivot brackets, elevator pivot levers, and aileron pulley brackets (manufactured from L53 aluminum alloy casting material) in the primary flight control system, replacement of any cracked bracket or lever with a serviceable part, and application of water displacing fluid to the brackets and levers. The CAA classified this alert service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent loss of the integrity of the primary flight control system. This AD requires revising the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to limit reversion of the flight controls to manual (unpowered) operation. This AD also provides for an optional terminating action for the AFM limitation, consisting of inspections, replacement (as necessary), and application of water displacing fluid, as specified in the alert service bulletin described previously.
