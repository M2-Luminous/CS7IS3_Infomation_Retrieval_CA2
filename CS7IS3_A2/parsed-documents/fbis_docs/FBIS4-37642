Tens of thousands have been killed, wounded, or displaced in Yemen, north and south. U.S. political pressure, aided and abetted by Arab regimes, is slowly but surely wrecking Yemen's national sovereignty and wrenching its land apart. Keeping particular countries weak, in disgrace, and dependent upon foreign assistance is the hallmark of the policy the United States has been vigorously pursuing in the region since the oil [Gulf] war, a policy pursued even more adamantly in the southern Gulf states. The United States recently imposed humiliating terms on the shaykhs of southern Gulf states, forcing their governments, not particularly known for a firm political will, to end the political and economic embargo of the Zionist, Jerusalem-usurping entity. Stripping Arab states in the southern Gulf region of dignity, integrity, and political will has become a trademark of U.S. policy in that area. The corrupt regimes in Riyad and Cairo support this policy, dragging along, willy nilly, Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Seen from this angle, the U.S. position on the Yemeni crisis is easily explained. The United States wants Yemen weak, poor, divided, and, in both its parts, dependent upon foreign assistance. This is the subservient state in which the United States likes to keep most of the agent governments that do its gambling in the Middle East.
