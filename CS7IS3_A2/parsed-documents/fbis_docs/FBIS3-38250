"We will never resign ourselves to the EU border being the border between Germany and Poland," Kohl said in Mainz today at a reception for 33 bishops from throughout Europe. Europe was in the process of taking up the great tradition of coexistence. Everyone should be grateful about the progress achieved. Beforehand the chancellor attended a celebration mass in Mainz Cathedral at the conclusion of the 24th General Assembly of the Council of Catholic European Bishops' Conferences. At the service, the bishops called on the warmongers in former Yugoslavia to stop their merciless actions, and said they hoped peace would be achieved. Kohl warned that no one was immune to developments such as those in former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]
