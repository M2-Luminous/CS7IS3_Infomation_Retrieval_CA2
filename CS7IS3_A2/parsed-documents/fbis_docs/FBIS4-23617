Joseph Mukendi, political adviser to the opposition leader, told AFP that Mr. Tshisekedi returned to his house yesterday at midnight. Mr. Mukendi did not comment on the incident which led to Mr. Tshisekedi's arrest or talk about the circumstances under which Tshisekedi found himself inside the military premises. "For the moment, we are happy that he has returned home," he said. Mr. Tshisekedi told reporters yesterday afternoon: "I am a victim of a conspiracy here, and I won't say anything again." According to the official version of the events as reported by Colonel Nsankete Kumimgama, commander of the Kibomango training camp of the Presidential Special Division, Mr. Tshisekedi, who was driving in a car with four people, sneaked into the military camp. Kibomango camp is near the road leading to the presidential estate at Nsele, east of Kinshasa. According to these sources, arms and ammunition including an Uzi rifle, a pistol, and two magazines were on board the vehicle. Mr. Mukendi pointed out that Mr. Tshisekedi usually "takes a walk for health reasons every Sunday" on the Nsele road. "We cannot understand that people accompanying Mr. Tshisekedi with no military training should have weapons," he said.
