The Ciskei homeland, a member of the right-wing Freedom Alliance, said earlier on Monday it would join the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) helping to chart South Africa's transition to majority rule. Brig Gqozo also announced that 250 Ciskei troops would serve alongside government soldiers and former guerrillas in a national peacekeeping force. In a statement issued in Pretoria the NP said brig gqozo's vision to avoid a cul-de-sac for his own people and his breakaway from an unhealthy partnership of groups who had very little in common was a wise move. "It is also the first visible crack in the Freedom Alliance and will set the pace for others to follow. We sincerely hope and trust that other individual groups within the alliance will also display their commitment to a democratic solution by following suit. "We also wish to accept that the more moderate leaders within the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] and the IFP (Inkatha Freedom Party) are rethinking their situation with the aim to follow the example set by the Ciskei," the statement said. Transkei military leader Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa in welcoming Ciskei's move said there was no doubt in his mind that the action by the homeland's government would imporve stability in the region. "The future of the civil servants and security forces in Ciskei would strengthen these workers to redouble their efforts in supporting the democratic changes which are taking place now and after the elections. "The move by Ciskei should also make things easy for the finalisation of the regional government and other related issues, as far as the eastern Cape -- which includes Port Elizabeth, Ciskei, Border and Transkei -- is concerned," Gen Holomisa said. He said Transkei wished that the relationship among the political organisations in the region would improve as a result of Ciskei's move. "I hope that the government employees in Bophuthatswana and kwaZulu will seriously consider pressurising their political heads that their future depends on their future paymaster, which would be a government of national unity. Therefore they must demand to be catered for in the deal." An African National Congress spokesman said any move by members of the Freedom Alliance to join the ranks of people who wanted democracy should be welcomed.
