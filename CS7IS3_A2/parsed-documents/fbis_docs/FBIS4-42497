Emphasising Britain's sense of national identity and its pride in institutions such as the Monarchy and Parliament, Mr Howard said EC leaders ignored popular feeling at their peril. He singled out M Delors who steps down as president of the Commission at the end of this year, for suggesting recently that those who opposed federalism were encouraging racism and were anti-European. "It is those who wish to impose a European superstate over the heads of the people of Europe, those who are obsessed with their federalist mission, who risk stimulating a revival of nationalist extremism," Mr Howard told a Tory campaign meeting in his constituency at Hythe, Kent. His tone was reminiscent of Mrs Thatcher's landmark speech at Bruges in 1988 when she gave a warning against the creation of a "United States of Europe." Mr Howard, a Cabinet Euro-sceptic, warmly welcomed Mr John Major's call earlier this week for a multi-speed, multi-layered Europe, in which member states could do some things in their own way and at their own speed. "What we need is a made-to-measure Europe in which the institutional arrangements comfortably fit national interests, not an off-the-peg standard-size Europe, ill-fitting and splintering at the seams," he said. There were some basic, unchanging requirements of the European Union: an acceptance of the single market in goods and services, free movement of citizens of member states to live and work throughout the Community, and the need for common institutions to make decisions and see they were enforced. "Beyond these basic principles there is no need why all states should move together or at the same speed and good reasons why they might choose not to do so," he said. Earlier this week, Lord Tebbit, the arch-Euro-sceptic, welcomed Mr Major's speech as evidence that the Government was coming round to the viewpoint of the anti-Maastricht rebels. Mr Howard's speech is a further indication that the Cabinet is adopting an increasingly sceptical approach in an attempt to persuade core Tory supporters to vote on Thursday [9 June]. Mr Howard said the real debate was not about Britain's membership, but about the future of the EC. He emphasised that he wanted to see a free-trading Europe of nation states. Labour and the Liberal Democrats, he said, wanted a "one-way ticket on the federal express to a European superstate."
