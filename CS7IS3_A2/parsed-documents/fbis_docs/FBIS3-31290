As senior political and government leaders at the head of a dictatorship, by deliberately abusing their positions the defendants granted economic privileges to themselves and their families, thus causing serious economic damage to the state and the people's interests. For these reasons, under Articles 106 and 31, Paragraphs B and D of the Penal Code, the defendants were convicted as follows: Qirjako Mihali -- eight years of imprisonment; Pali Miska -- six; Besnik Bekteshi -- five; Vangjel Cerrava -- five; Prokop Murra -- five; Llambi Gegprifti -- seven; Muho Artunda -- five; Hajredin Celiku -- five; Foto Cami -- six; Lenka Cuko -- seven.
