FBIS4-21946 "jptot015__l94111" JPRS-TOT-94-015-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 7 April 1994 WEST EUROPE GERMANY FOCUS Says Two RAF Members Escaped at Bad Kleinen FOCUS Says Two RAF Members Escaped at Bad Kleinen BKA Denies FOCUS Report AU0704112394 Hamburg DPA in German 0958 GMT 7 Apr 94 AU0704112394 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Excerpt] Wiesbaden (DPA) -- The Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA) has rejected information in the new magazine FOCUS that four members of the Red Army Faction (RAF) might have escaped during the antiterrorist action of Bad Kleinen. These assumptions are wrong and do not correspond to the facts, BKA spokesman Hans-Georg Fuchs said in Wiesbaden on Thursday. However, the BKA does not wish to initiate any legal steps against FOCUS, it was stated. It is true that on 24 June 1993, that is, three days before the action, the police filmed two persons who have so far not been identified and who were also at the expected meeting point of presumed RAF members Birgit Hogefeld and Wolfgang Grams. However, the investigators do not have any evidence that the man and the woman whom they filmed are terrorists, the BKA reported. At the same time, the BKA rejected information from FOCUS that authorities are meanwhile proceeding on the assumption that the couple filmed might have participated in the murder of Trust Agency chief Detlef Karsten Rohwedder on 1 April 1991. A relevant "internal BKA paper" to which the magazine refers in its report is not known in the BKA, it was stated. According to Fuchs, the magazine's assertion that the BKA investigators had filmed another couple who were only later recognized as presumed RAF members Daniela Klette and Ernst-Volker Staub at the Bad Kleinen station five hours before the antiterrorist action is equally wrong. The BKA does not have such a video recording, Fuchs said. [passage omitted]
