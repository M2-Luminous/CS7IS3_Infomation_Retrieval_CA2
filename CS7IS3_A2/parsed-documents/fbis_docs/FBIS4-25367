Eight DPP National Assembly members are in the group, as well as one nonpartisan member. Taiwan currently operates under a dual-parliament system. The National Assembly is in charge of revising the constitution and electing the president, and the Legislative Yuan is responsible for enacting laws and screening the national budget. The DPP has been seeking to revise the constitution to abolish the National Assembly in an effort to accomplish its goal of a single parliament. The ruling party, however, does not consider such a change a top priority in its political reform program. KMT National Assemblymen Cheng Yun-tang, one of the committee members, said the group will lobby hard to get the single parliament proposal approved by the National Assembly. The National Assembly is meeting in Yangminshan to discuss proposed amendments to the constitution. National Assembly members have already submitted five proposals pertaining to changes in Taiwan's parliamentary system. Another committee member, Chen Chen-shun, said that merging the National Assembly with the Legislative Yuan would be an easier way to achieve the goal of a single parliament.
