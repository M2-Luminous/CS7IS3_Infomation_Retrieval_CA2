This was the reason why the agenda comprised questions agreed in advance among the factions. Elections for the tellers' commission, the commission for overseeing the electronic ballot, and the provisional secretariat took place without any particular difficulties. [passage omitted] It was expected that some differences of opinion might arise during discussion of the Central Electoral Commission's report, delivered by Deputy Chairman A. Ivanchenko. Among other things, he reported that a total of 444 deputies representing 32 nationalities had been elected to the State Duma (of which 430 were present for the first session), that 95 percent of them have higher or incomplete higher education, and that one in 10 deputies is a professor, academic, and so on. However, it was not this interesting information which proved the cause of conflict but rather the Central Electoral Commission's blatant attempt in delivering the report to preclude all questions associated with the election of deputies. Even the possibility of a proposal not to set up a credentials commission in the Duma but to transfer its functions to the Central Electoral Commission has not been ruled out. However, State Duma members are determined pretty unanimously to include a discussion of the Central Electoral Commission's Report in the agenda, so a credentials commission will probably be set up anyway. Nevertheless, despite all the efforts, clashes in the opening hours of the Duma's work could not be avoided. As expected, the opening skirmishes took place in connection with the Statute on Deputies' Factions. During preliminary consultations, deputies were unable to reach accord in respect of the minimum number of deputies required in order to secure the right to set up a faction. Communist representatives suggested that the ceiling be raised to a minimum of 50. Communist Leader G. Zyuganov justified this stance by saying that a multitude of small radical factions and groups will otherwise take shape in the Duma and paralyze its work as a result. Democratic Party of Russia Leader N. Travkin spoke in support of this. Their opponents' proposal to reduce the minimum to 14 was put forward by "Russia's Choice" and supported by Shakhray's party, as well as supporters of "August" represented by I. Khakamada. As for the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], its leader, Zhirinovskiy, adopted an emphatically neutral stance, declaring that any outcome would satisfy him. There has already been occasion in the preceding edition to write about the reasons behind the tension. The matter concerns the plans of "Russia's Choice." If it is decided to form factions comprising 14 deputies, "Russia's Choice" may split into several amicable factions in order to strengthen its influence in the Duma. Among other things, a faction leader has the right of access to the microphone out of turn, plus other privileges. Of course, this situation does not benefit the Communists and the Agrarians. The situation is further complicated by shortcomings in the electronic balloting system, as well as many deputies' dissatisfaction that it was an LDPR representative who chaired the sitting. By the time the first recess began, passions were noticeably stirred. As a result, the nigh-on hour-long debate failed to culminate in accord despite the well coordinated actions of the Communists and the Agrarians in defending a quota of 50 people. The 20-man quota supported by the democratic factions also failed to attract a majority of votes.
