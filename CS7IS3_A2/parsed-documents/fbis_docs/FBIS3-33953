Our colleague reports from Kabul: [Unidentified reporter] Simultaneous with the arrival in Kabul of large groups of the neutral jihad commanders and mediators, the head of Jalalabad Jihad Council announced that a nationwide peace session will be held in this city soon. He said: In order to convene such a session, coordination has taken place among all the jihad factions and commanders and the neutral political forces, including Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami [Islamic Unity Party]. They have agreed that a prompt and nationwide measure should be undertaken to resolve the current crisis in Afghanistan. Head of another peace group, named the Reform Council [Shura-ye Eslahi], announced in Kabul that President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar have agreed with his mediation to end the current conflict. A source affiliated to Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami reiterated his party's neutral stance in the current conflict today, and stressed the need for the intensification of peace efforts to end the war. He described the current war as a conflict which will achieve nothing but the further weakening and reduced credibility of Afghanistan's revolutionary and jihad groups. These peace efforts are being undertaken at a time when the two main warring sides have reported fresh fighting in the northern region of Afghanistan. Opponents of the government say that thousands of troops loyal to the president have been surrounded in the Nahrain region, northeast of Baghlan Province. On the other hand a source close to the government has said that president's forces have achieved remarkable victory in the ongoing battles of Baghlan, Jowzjan, and Fariab Provinces. On the military status of the warring factions, an Afghan mojahedin commander said: In recent days the Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party] and General Dostam's forces have concentrated their efforts on inflicting blows on the government's vulnerable military centers in the northern region of Afghanistan.
