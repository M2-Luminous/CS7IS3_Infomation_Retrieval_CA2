Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) rating increased from 18 to about 26 per cent after the fall of his government in mid-March. The SDL, for its part, would be supported by only 10 per cent of Slovaks. "We must convince citizens that it is possible to rule without threats, scandals and creating the image of an enemy, and by means of cooperation and reasonable compromises. I am not pessimistic at all," said Weiss. Moreover, the government has prepared some pragmatic steps, including launching the second wave of coupon privatization shortly before elections, he added. The elections are slated for September 31-October 1. "Even a citizen who does not have enough money to participate in privatization, should be given a chance," stressed Weiss, specifying that the coupon method (most important privatization method in the Czech Republic), virtually abandoned in Slovakia in 1992, will be just one of several ways of privatization. "Meciar is expected to receive some 22 to 25 percent (in the elections). But it is too little to form a government and I do not know anyone willing to create a coalition with him," Milan Knazko, chairman of the governing Alliance of Slovak Democrats (AD SR), said.
