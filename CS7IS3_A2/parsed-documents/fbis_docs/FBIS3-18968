The EC enlargement negotiations with Norway are postponed until 15 March because of Spain's firm stance regarding fishing rights, as well as the issue of voting at the Council of Ministers. Vicente Albero, the Spanish minister for agriculture and fisheries, in statements to our station said that regarding the fishing issue, we can not be deemed selfish. On the contrary, we are trying to uphold important Community principles. For his part, Portuguese Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barroso has repeated his support for the Spanish stance regarding fishing in Norway, and he added that Portugal also claims its right to fish in Norwegian waters. Today, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso arrived in Madrid to close the two-day seminar held by the Spanish and Portuguese ambassadors stationed in Maghreb countries. Regarding the meeting Jose Manuel Durao Barroso is scheduled to have with his Spanish counterpart, Javier Solana, he said his country, as well as Spain, is very interested in strengthening relations with North African countries, and both countries are putting their case to the European Union [EU]. Jose Manuel Durao Barroso underlined that Spain and Portugal have similar stances regarding this issue because Europe does not only have a frontier with East and Central European countries. Europe's southern frontier with the North African countries is also very important.
