Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa said, "although it was proper for him to have withdrawn his remark, it does not release him from the need to take the responsibility as a cabinet minister." Ichikawa is regarded as the archally of the prime coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa. Nagano, the 71-year-old army general-turned politician, is from Ozawa's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. Shinseito and Komeito have closely cooperated in pushing the policies of the coalition government. Ichikawa went on to say the remark was "inappropriate as that of a cabinet minister." Ichikawa made the remarks a few hours after Nagano apologized for making the remark that the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a "fabrication."
