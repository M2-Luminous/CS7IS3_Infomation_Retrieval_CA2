Magnesia-silicate slags from the Serov ferroalloy plant were used to produce periclase- spinellid-forsterite linings for the anode furnace of the Kyshtym electrolytic plant. These linings were comparable in durability to chromite-periclase linings. Forsterite-spinel heating furnace bottoms for the Chelyabinsk forging press and forsterite-spinellid teeming vessels for the Chelyabinsk metallurgical combine were made from high-carbon ferrochromium slag at the Magnesite plant. The furnace bottoms were 2-4 times more durable than those made with conventional raw materials, and the teeming vessels were as durable as periclase-graphite vessels. Use of these slags is calculated to save 2.1 million rubles per annum in raw materials costs and 157 thousand rubles per year in savings from reduced environmental damage. Savings from transporting and storing these wastes is expected to be 96.5 thousand rubles annually. The formulas used to arrive at these figures are presented, and other examples of refractories produced using metallurgical wastes are discussed. Tables 1; references 5: Russian.
