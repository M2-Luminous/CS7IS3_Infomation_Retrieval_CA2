FR940428-0-00033 FR940428-0-00012 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 38 CFR Part 21 RIN 2900&hyph;AG54 Veterans Education; Flight Training AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: These amended regulations permit pilot flight training pursuant to 14 CFR, Part 61, conducted in flight simulators to be approved for purposes of VA (Department of Veterans Affairs) administered education benefits when such training is authorized by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration). These regulations also provide for approval of solo flight training for such education benefits purposes, as authorized by the Veterans Benefits Act of 1992. EFFECTIVE DATES: The amendments to §§21.4263(g)(1), 21.4263(g)(4), 21.4263(g)(4)(ii) and the new paragraph 21.4263(h)(1)(iii) are effective September 30, 1990. All other amendments to the regulations included here are effective October 1, 1992. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: June C. Schaeffer (225), Assistant Director for Policy and Program Administration, Education Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420, 202&hyph;233&hyph;2092. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On pages 49196 through 49199 of the Federal Register of September 22, 1993, there were published interim final regulations with a request for public comment. These regulations amended 38 CFR part 21 in order to implement provisions of the Veterans Benefits Act of 1992 which affect flight training and to provide for approval of flight training in flight simulators for VA educational benefit purposes. Interested people were given 30 days to submit comments, suggestions or objections. VA received no comments, suggestions or objections. Accordingly, these regulations are now final. To ensure that flight training would achieve the end of qualifying the individual for employment in the aviation industry, VA regulation §21.4263 has long restricted approvable training in two ways: (1) The entity providing the training must have a pilot school or provisional pilot school certificate issued by the FAA under part 141, 14 CFR (§21.4263(g)); and (2) the training being offered must meet the FAA requirements of either Part 141, in the case of pilots, or part 63, in the case of flight crew members other than pilots (§21.4263(g)(3)(ii)). Thus, the individual is assured of the quality of the training and its ability to enable him or her to meet FAA standards for an appropriate certificate or rating in areas relevant to commercial aviation. For the reasons stated in the Federal Register on September 22, 1993, these amended regulations now also permit pilot flight training pursuant to 14 CFR part 61, conducted in flight simulators to be approved for purposes of VA (Department of Veterans Affairs) administered education benefits when such training is authorized by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration).
