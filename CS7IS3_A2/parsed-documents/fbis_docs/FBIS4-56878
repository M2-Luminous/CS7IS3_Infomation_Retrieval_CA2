Opening the 11th U.S.-Mexican Bilateral Commission, the Mexican foreign secretary said that relations between the two countries are at a great moment in time, adding that he hopes the work being done by both delegations "will contribute to strengthening our ties." Speaking to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other officials from the two countries, Tello Macias explained that Mexico has launched reforms and significant changes for promoting growth, controlling inflation, fighting poverty, and opening the economy to world competition. Tello Macias emphasized that "we are the first to admit that there is still a lot to be done and we are encouraged to see that our efforts and sacrifices are producing the desired results." He said the current administration's basic goal is to place Mexico in an international position that enables it to use the opportunities presented by global reorganization, "as an active participant in the changes that occur rather than as a passive and indifferent spectator." The Mexican diplomat said that, given their proximity, asymmetric capabilities, individual historical experiences, and diverse cultures, "ties between the two countries are the most complex in the world." He said: This happens because ties among academicians, scientists, businessmen, and organizations on both sides of the border represent a universe of societal contacts that frequently surpass the interaction between the two governments. Tello Macias explained that, given this reality, it is important to cultivate bilateral relations with talent, which implies having effective institutional channels that facilitate dialogue and cooperation. The foreign minister admitted that cultural differences "and economic disparities between our countries" cannot be neglected, but that "interests based on our common presence in the same geographical zone prevail and these interests are strengthened with commercial integration." He emphasized that the meeting's agenda clearly proves the richness and complexity of relations between Mexico and the United States and the responsibility of finding reasonable formulas to resolve any problems between the two countries.
