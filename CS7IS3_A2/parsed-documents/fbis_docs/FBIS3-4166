Kim hopes to consult with Jiang and other Chinese leaders, including Prime Minister Li Peng, on the North Korean nuclear issue and ways to boost economic cooperation. Kim will reportedly request that China, North Korea's only major remaining ally, exercise its influence in persuading Pyongyang to accept International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of its nuclear facilities. Failing that, Kim will ask the Chinese leaders not to oppose any decision the United Nations Security Council makes on North Korea. Before going to Beijing on Sunday, Kim, accompanied by his wife Son Myoung-sun, will visit the site of the former government-in-exile during the Japanese colonial days. He will also tour Luxun Park in Shanghai, where Korean patriot Yun Pong-kil bombed Japanese dignitaries celebrating the birthday of their emperor, killing Gen. Yoshimori Shirakawa on April 29, 1932.
