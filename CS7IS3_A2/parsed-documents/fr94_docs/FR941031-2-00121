FR941031-2-00121 FR941031-2-00083 Federal Highway Administration Environmental Impact Statement: Ketchikan, Alaska AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Cancellation of Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. Reference: Federal Register, Volume 54, Number 90, Thursday, May 11, 1989. SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing this notice to inform the public that an environmental impact statement (EIS) will not be prepared for the proposed upgrading of the Ketchikan transportation system from Ward Cove to Deermount Street. The scope of the proposed improvements has been significantly reduced. An EIS will not be prepared because significant environment impacts should not result from this project. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Phillip Smith, Field Operations Engineer, Federal Highway Administration, P.O. Box 021648, Juneau, AK 99802&hyph;1648 or; William F. Ballard, Regional Environmental Coordinator, Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (ADOT&PF), 6860 Glacier Highway, Juneau, AK 99801&hyph;7999. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The new project scope involves improvements along Tongass Avenue between the Airport Ferry Terminal and Deermount Street, rehabilitation and reconstruction of viaduct sections along Tongass Avenue including realignment of the S-Curve, and installation of traffic signals and underground utilities. In addition to the improvements on Tongass Avenue, the project would construct a two lane road connecting the existing Third Avenue with Schoenbar Road. This will enable drivers and bicyclists to avoid a portion of Tongass Avenue, which will relieve congestion. This revised proposal is based on written comments and the results of public meetings held from May, 1989, to March 1993 regarding the proposed project. Members of the public and agency representatives discussed potential alternatives and identified relevant issues at these meetings. Input received indicates that there is not strong support at this time for additional improvements to Tongass Avenue and North Tongass Highway. The revised scope adequately meets the stated need. And Environmental Assessment/Draft Section 4(f) Evaluation will be available for review in late 1994. Issued on: October 12, 1994. Robert E. Ruby, Division Administrator, Federal Highway Administration, Juneau, Alaska. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26718 Filed 10&hyph;28&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;22&hyph;M
