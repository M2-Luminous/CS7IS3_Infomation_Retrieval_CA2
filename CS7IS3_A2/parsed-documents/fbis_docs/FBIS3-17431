'Olympic' Cut in the Armed Forces"] [Text] The defense minister is soon likely to cut the number of his deputies from seven to four. Generals Gromov and Toporov are running the risk of being the first among those to be axed. Observers think that Boris Gromov -- one of the most likely contenders for the position of minister if it becomes vacant -- is thus being "taken out of the game." Who the third one will be is yet unknown. Radical reforms in the ministry have long been expected. The deputies -- Generals Toporov and Mironov -- have long been gradually vacating the fifth floor where Pavel Grachev's office is located. As for Boris Gromov's office, it is in an altogether different building. In principle, no defense minister before Gen. Grachev had such a number of deputies.
