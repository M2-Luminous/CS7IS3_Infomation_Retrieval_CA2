"Those who pine for Cuba." On the right? "The descendants of fascism and the separatists." Mario Segni is now abandoning the pursuit of a two-party system, stating: "The only alternative to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] is the `Pact for Italy.'" With Martinazzoli, La Malfa, and Amato. "The heirs of the CAF [Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani] have sided with Bossi and Berlusconi." "On the left we have those who hark back to the days of the Berlin wall, and on the right the heirs of fascism." These are the terms in which Mario Segni expounds the paradox that he is now facing, and it is no small political paradox: He is the man who fought hardest, with the institutional referenda, for a two-party system based on alternation in Italy as well, but he now finds himself leading a third pole opposing both the right and the left. "Over the last few months," Segni explains, "We have come to realize that you cannot achieve a two-party system in a few weeks; it takes a much longer political process. But let's get things straight: What he have set up with the `Pact for Italy' is not a third pole, the geographical center, ready to line up with the right or the left at its own convenience, according to Andreotti's old theory of the two ovens." The Pact for Italy was originally formed to become the liberal-democratic, reformist pole in opposition to the left. In the midst of the current chaos, it now represents the only true national alternative with the potential to beat a left wing dominated by the PDS. [Grasso] All things considered, the prospect of a European two-party system is receding, at least for the time being.... [Segni] Yes, but the blame also lies with the Italian left, which has no Gonzales or Mitterrand, only Occhetto and D'Alema, who have no scruples about forming alliances with Bertinotti, in other words with those on the left who look not to Europe but to Cuba. [Grasso] Be that as it may, the left and the right seem to form an unholy alliance against you.... [Segni] Yes, but what I want to say is that the aroma of stale politics hangs over both Occhetto's forces and the force taking shape [if it ever does emerge fully as a force] among Berlusconi, Bossi, and Fini. They have consciously omitted a fundamental step: agreeing on a platform for a true political alliance. Forming a hotchpotch alliance just to gain a few more seats strikes me as a disgraceful lack of respect for the people who voted to turn over a new leaf in the referendum. What sense does it make, for instance, to lump together the League, which still has federalism as one of its tenets, and the MSI [Italian Social Movement], which will fight its election campaign in the south on a platform of national unity? How can these two forces form a government together? Let us not deceive ourselves.... [Grasso] Berlusconi accuses you of splitting the liberal-democratic pole, thus helping the left to win. [Segni] How can Berlusconi describe himself as a liberal democrat and yet get on with Fini? Liberal democracy is something very different from claiming to represent the continuation of the fascist tradition and outlook, albeit in an updated form. Giscard has never come to arrangements with Le Pen. [Grasso] Deputy Segni, you had managed to wrest an agreement on a platform for government from the League's lower house floor leader, Maroni. Then Bossi disowned Maroni, and Maroni said there had never been any mention of alliances with Martinazzoli and the PPI [Italian Popular Party]. What is the truth? [Segni] We have always said that our goal was to gather the best of democratic Catholicism around the Pact, along with those of a liberal-democratic and reformist persuasion, and the Popular Party has been in the Pact since the beginning. Maroni was perfectly well aware of this. What subsequently passed between Bossi and Maroni I do not know, although I do not find it difficult to imagine. The once certain thing is that the League had to disown an agreement that would have made it clear once and for all that Italian unity is inviolable. By taking this step, Bossi has once again confirmed his inconsistency on this issue, demonstrating once and for all that the League is unreliable. [Grasso] Has Bossi's "no" disappointed you? [Segni] I have no regrets. We did everything in broad daylight and with the intention of creating a joint platform, as called for by the result of the referendum. It would have been much more convenient to hold secret meetings with Bossi and Maroni, but that was a feature of the old way of politics, the way that lead to "kickback city." Anyway, we did achieve one result: The electorate in the north now knows who it is that wants modernity and progress, who wants to combat statism and inefficiency, who wants privatization, greater regional autonomy, and safeguards for the weaker members of society and for the family, without jeopardizing Italian unity and the national spirit. [Grasso] Were you not a little naive to think it would be possible to come to an agreement with Bossi? [Segni] I don't know. But it's much better to be naive and in good faith than to be forced to go back on an agreement after little more than 24 hours. [Grasso] What idea have you formed of the right-wing pole? [Segni] It isn't a pole, and it is tainted by a fascist strain. It is a true right-wing aggregate, unacceptable to a modern electorate. It is as well for all the moderates in the north who voted for the League as a protest to reflect that this is no longer the time for protest votes: The old regime has been demolished, and now it is time to build. Meanwhile, the southern electorate must realize that if it votes for the MSI it will also help the League, which is no longer concealing its separatist, selfish tendencies. [Grasso] What do you think of Amato and La Malfa joining the Pact? [Segni] I believe that it is fundamental for the Pact to take in major currents that represent the better manifestations of the nonconfessional, reformist political traditions. But I want to make it clear that the Pact will not serve as a life raft for shipwrecked exponents of the party regime. La Malfa has set an example by saying that he does not intend to stand for reelection, and I greatly appreciate this gesture. Moreover, I am quite sure that we shall stand or fall by the candidates that we put up: We shall fail the Italians' expectations unless we present a new, credible, political class. [Grasso] Does this apply to De Mita too? [Segni] Look, it is not my place to hand down summary verdicts. I have already stated publicly that, in my opinion, De Mita should keep out. However, this does not apply only to him, but to all those, without exception, who have been the protagonists of the old party regime, whether at local or at national level. [Grasso] Segni, Martinazzoli, Amato, La Malfa. Miglio accuses you of having reformed the five-party coalition.... [Segni] I would advise Miglio to look to his own house: The remnants of Craxism are siding with Berlusconi, and the CCD [Democratic Christian Center] are the direct heirs of the CAF. And both Berlusconi and the CCD have lined up with the League, not with us. [Grasso] If none of the poles gains an absolute majority in the election, what will you do? Is there not a risk of ungovernability? [Segni] If people want us to govern, they must vote for us, otherwise no one can force us into government. We can go into opposition, and if we do, we shall do so in earnest, not like the consociational opposition that we have had to date. It may well be that parliament is ungovernable after the election, but I have always maintained that the journey begun with the referendum is not over yet and that if things are to go in the right direction we need to amend the constitution to allow the direct election of the executive. [Grasso] One last question: The catholic world is experiencing some anxiety over your government platform, which is suspected of being over-reliant on free market forces.... [Segni] I should like to make one thing clear: When I talk about liberal democracy I do not mean that we want to do away with the welfare state. We want to do away with a state that promised all things to all men and, in the end, gave no one anything. The challenge today is to find out where the new poor are and to give them real protection. Then there is the family, which is one of the main features of our platform. They have all promised to safeguard the family in Italy, but no one has ever done so. Suffice it to say that the state receives three times as much for family allowances as it actually pays out.
