Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said this to reporters after the inauguration of the building housing UMNO's [United Malays National Organization] Pramu Branch in Pekan, Pahang. He said Malaysia should maintain its credibility, or else other countries will certainly wonder whether future decisions will be based on good practices or on some political stand. He added that the decision to buy the aircraft stands even though Malaysia is not pleased with Russia's position on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. This is because Malaysia needs to modernize its air force and strengthen its ability to defend the nation's airspace.
