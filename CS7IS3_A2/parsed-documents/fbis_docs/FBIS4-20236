The document basically lists the measures being adopted by Romania to achieve the political goals of the Partnership as well as the means and activities envisaged to implement the PFP program. On the occasion of the submission of the presentation document, Mr. Tinca and Mr. Balanzino had an almost 40-minute meeting devoted to relations between our country and NATO and to the prospects of bilateral cooperation, including within the framework of the positive implementation of the PFP. During the talks, the sides assessed the contents of the document, which will now be examined by the North Atlantic alliance. Negotiations will be held with the Romanian delegation in the next few weeks, after which NATO will submit its own contribution to this cooperation. A program for a bilateral partnership will be worked out between Romania and NATO. The NATO delegate secretary general praised our country's presence in the front-ranking group, since Romania was the first country to sign the Partnership document and submitted the presentation document two days after Poland. This is proof of our country's seriousness on this matter. After the document was handed over, the NATO delegate secretary general and the Romanian minister of national defense had a brief meeting with the press. On this occasion, they emphasized the significance of this political act, which reiterates Romania's active commitment to ensuring the success of the PFP program as well as our country's firm desire to deepen its integration into the political and military structures of the North Atlantic alliance. This report has been sent to us by press correspondent Andrei Barsan.
