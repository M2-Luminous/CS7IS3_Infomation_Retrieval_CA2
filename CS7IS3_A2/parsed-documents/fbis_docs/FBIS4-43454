Many things have happened in the last few weeks to make Kliridhis' position difficult, even through we are not accustomed to politicians, and especially presidents, resigning over such, an admittedly, delicate matter. Then again, his resignation threat was probably the most effective way of emphasizing his objections to the continuation of discussions on the confidence-building measures, which he considers dead and buried. Therein lies the president's miscalculation, for which he is prepared to give up his job. After the UN Secretary-General's report, which unequivocally blamed [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas for the failure to reach an agreement, Kliridhis assumed that the confidence-building measure chapter would be consigned to the dustbin of history, where so many other UN initiatives have ended up. Yet there had been warnings to the contrary. First, there was the Vienna meeting, at which U.S. and UN representatives met Denktas and a Turkish Foreign Ministry official in a last-ditch attempt to salvage the initiative. Second, in his report to the Security Council, the Secretary-General included the continuation of confidence-building measure discussions as one of five options, despite the earlier failure. It became obvious that neither the United Nations nor the United States and Britain were prepared to abandon a whole year's work on the confidence-building measures, especially as they believed the few differences that prevented progress were not insurmountable. In the circumstances, it was unrealistic to expect the UN to abandon the measures and accept that a year's work had gone to waste, irrespective of Butrus- Ghali's report. And once Denktas had supposedly agreed to the main sticking-point, access to Varosha, there was no way the UN, the U.S. and Britain would abandon the process. To add insult to injury, the European Union observer's report on Cyprus, released earlier this week, also supported the continuation of discussions. In other words, all those countries and organisations that Kliridhis was relying on to condemn Denktas intransigence are, in no uncertain terms, backing the confidence-building measure process. For an experienced politician like the president to declare the confidence-building measure talks dead, was more a case of wishful thinking then mistaken evaluation. Matters were made worse last week when the National Council unanimously agreed that the Greek Cypriot side would not agree to discuss the confidence-building measures again; and unanimous decisions are binding. Kliridhis had on the one hand committed himself to the UN on the confidence-building measures, and last week committed himself to not discussing them again. This explains his threat to resign. Admittedly, he made a serious miscalculation regarding the UN's and the United States' ability to bring Denktas round to their way of thinking. He did after all say before discussions had even begun that he did not expect the Turkish Cypriot side to accept the measures. Then again, Kliridhis has good reason to feel aggrieved at the way things have gone. Unlike Denktas, he had cooperated constructively with the UN. Yet now the UN is helping the obstructionist get off the hook. It would seem that taking a hard line and being a difficult customer pay off in the end. Even so, the UN has no real grounds to believe Denktas will keep his word and go all the way on the confidence-building measures even if it has received assurances on the Varosha issue and discussion resume. Who can guarantee Denktas won't throw a spanner in the works once again? The preparedness of the UN, the United States and Britain to credit Denktas with good intentions defies logic and experience. Kliridhis obviously feels his position has become untenable. But the UN and the countries involved cannot afford to let him carry out his threat, because that would be the end of the confidence-building measures. A new president, if things come to that pass, would not have any obligation to accept the confidence-building measures, in which case a year's efforts would go to waste. Perhaps the Secretary-General's other option of allowing a period of reflection for all concerned is in the circumstances the best suggestion for now.
