Who do you believe has taken this decision? [Salih] Those who have decided on separation are known. They are the elements of apostasy and separation in the YSP. It is they who fabricated the crisis, escalated its regrettable complications, and took numerous separatist measures, including the circumvention of the results of the 27 April 1993 elections, the mobilization of citizens in southern and eastern governorates against unity, the rebellion against constitutional legitimacy and nonrecognition of constitutional institutions, mobilization of military units and their withdrawal from the political borders of the Republic of Yemen to the former partition border areas, and the fomenting of sedition and stirring up of sectarian, territorial, and tribal tendencies with a view to fomenting a sedition in society and pushing the Yemeni people into the furnaces of infighting. [Khayrallah] Do you believe that separation is a reality? [Salih] Regrettably the forces of apostasy and separation in the YSP have through their partitionist practices imposed the reality of undeclared separation in some southern and eastern governorates. It is obviously a reality which the Yemenis will never recognize. They will resist it with all their strength to safeguard unity. The sons of our people, especially in the southern and eastern governorates, have suffered a great deal from the calamities of partition. They vigorously refuse to return the Yemeni homeland to the situation that existed before the 22 May 1990. Because they understand the meaning of the return of the totalitarian regime's domination of people's life. Unity rescued them from a horrific nightmare and is an umbrella of security for the Yemeni people. Our people will not allow anyone or any party to claim guardianship over them and their unity. The Yemeni people will defend and safeguard unity, whatever the price and the sacrifices. Separatists will gain nothing, nor will they achieve their narrow and selfish aims. The Yemeni people are now grown up. The sons of our Yemeni people in what used to be known as the south of the homeland moved out of the horrific prison and the iron fence imposed on them by the YSP over 25 years of totalitarian rule. No one in Yemen will ever accept a return to that prison at all. [Khayrallah] What is the fate of the Pledge and Accord Document? [Salih] The Pledge and Accord Document signed in Amman on 10 Ramadan [20 February] is binding on everyone, ends the crisis, and imposes implementation. The Yemeni people will not accept its circumvention by any party. The YSP leadership was supposed to return to Sanaa after the signing to merge the constitutional and executive institutions and form a coalition government headed by Haydar al-'Attas from the General People's Congress, the YSP, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping, in order to carry out its duties and put the document into practice. But regrettably, some separatist forces in the YSP are seeking to circumvent the document because it affects their narrow interests. [Khayrallah] Do you believe that some people are financing the separation? [Salih] It is difficult to answer that question, for numerous reasons. However, it can be answered by another question: Where does the YSP get all that money to spend on purchasing and stockpiling arms in the former partition areas? How does it finance the armed militias and spending on the new military formations it is setting up outside the constitutional institutions? Where do some of these separatist elements get the huge amount of cash from which they spend generously on buying people's consciences, kindling conflicts in society, and financing subversive operations in the homeland, especially in the northern governorates, to disrupt the security of the companies operating in the oilfield and kidnap foreigners to give the impression that there is no stability in northern governorates. We have sufficient evidence to prove that. Of course the YSP does not get these huge sums of money from the state treasury, so where does it get the money? Anyhow, our people know very well the sources of the YSP's finances. They are clear and exposed. [Khayrallah] In your view, what are the real causes of the crisis? [Salih] In brief: First, the crisis actually began on 12 Dhu al-Hijjah 1411 Hegira, corresponding to 24 June 1991. Second, there is the YSP leaders' nonrecognition of the results of the 27 April elections and the attempt to get around them by fabricating and escalating the crisis. THird, there is the YSP's acceptance of constitutional reforms and then rejection of them because of its secretary general's disapproval. Fourth, there is the discovery of oil in some southern and eastern governorates, which whetted some people's appetites and ambitions. Some people thought that they could sacrifice the gigantic project represented in the united state for a dwarf project represented in a petty oil state that fulfills personal and selfish wishes. This is why the crisis was fabricated without taking account of the potential harm to the interests of the homeland and the people amd the potential serious threats to the march of unity and democracy. [Khayrallah] At the beginning you maintained that there was no crisis, so what has changed to make you talk about a crisis? [Salih] Indeed at the beginning of the crisis we tried to play down and contain the effects of the crisis and see it as merely contradictions and differing views that could be resolved through dialogue and reason. At the beginning it was indeed minor and lay primarily in the brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid's seclusion after his return to Aden from a hospitalization trip abroad on 19 August 1993. We had though that through dialogue, understanding, and mediation we would be able to persuade him to return to Sanaa to carry out his duties, as happened in the past. But it seems that what happened was deeper, more serious, and had been planned for some time to produce a crisis in the manner we are experiencing now and to push the country to the situation it is now in, in addition to the threats posed to unity and democracy in our country as a result.
