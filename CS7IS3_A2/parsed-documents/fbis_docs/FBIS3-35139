Speaking at a London press conference Thursday, he said that Kuwait had "good relations" with Iran and that his government was working as much as it can as a "partner" with Tehran. The Islamic Republic was a "major power" and had an important role to play in security of the Persian Gulf, the Kuwaiti minister told foreign journalists. Iran and Kuwait were fellow victims of Iraqi aggression and the former ambassador to London and Washington said that his government had "respect" for Iran's policy of neutrality during the 1991 allied war to end Iraqi's occupation of Kuwait. Still feeling bitterness, he believed that the Persian Gulf region would not be able to enjoy security while Saddam was in power. His equal conviction was that UN sanctions against Baghdad would not be lifted, either partially or fully, until he was replaced. The minister emphasised that he had sympathy with the Iraqi people suffering the effects of more than three years of sanctions, who he said were also victims of the Iraqi regime since Saddam's 1980-88 war against Iran. With regard to the declining price of oil, he suggested that producing nations should seriously reassess the value of oil in the world and that OPEC and non-OPEC countries needed to cooperate together. Kuwait was not liberated for crude rates of 10 dlrs. [dollars] per barrel, which were "not helpful" to anyone.
