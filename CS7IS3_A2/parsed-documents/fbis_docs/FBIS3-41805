Older travellers especially are more at risk from Legionnaires' Disease and dehydration than from contracting a fatal strain of malaria abroad. Research by doctors in tropical medicine, to be published soon, will suggest there is almost no risk of malaria to ordinary tourists in much of southeast Asia, and most of the 150,000 travellers to Thailand from Britain do not need to take prophylaxis. Those most at risk are people from ethnic minority groups visiting friends and relatives and living in close contact with local people. Over the last five years the rise in the number of people returning to the UK every year with malaria has been almost parallel to the increase in the number of travellers. Each year, there are 2,000 cases of malaria in Britain, 1,200 of them the potentially fatal strain, and about 12 deaths. Dr. Ron Behrens, consultant in tropical and travel medicine at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in London, says: "Ethnic minority groups are three times more likely to contract malaria than ordinary tourists, and research has shown that only 19 percent use prophylaxis, compared with an average of 73 percent of tourists."
