However, Mr Li, who suffered a heart attack last year and has lost the bulk of his economic decision-making powers to Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, is also anxious to secure regional support to consolidate his power base. Sources in Guangdong said the premier, who flew into Guangzhou last week, had pledged his support for the radical reforms being carried out in the future-oriented province. The Chinese-run Hong Kong daily, WEN WEI PO, reported yesterday that Mr Li, who usually comes to Guangdong at least once a year, had already visited the Pearl River estuary boom towns of Zhongshan and Foshan. The paper said the premier was anxious to get a personal understanding of supplies in the market and the people's living conditions before the Lunar New Year. Sources in Guangdong said, however, that Mr Li's principal objective was to ensure the application of decisions to boost Beijing's macro-level control over the economy, which were made at a Politburo meeting last month. A large part of the recentralisation measures is aimed at reducing the authority of localities in making investments in capital construction and in fixing their own tax rates. Chinese papers yesterday quoted the Finance Minister, Liu Zhongli, as saying that local governments had no right to set their own value-added tax rates on property. It is understood that Guangdong, which has among all provinces marketed the largest number of commercial and residential buildings in Hong Kong and overseas, is anxious to grant tax remissions to favoured customers. "Li Peng has hit home the point that in spite of its ability to secure development funds from non-governmental sources, Guangdong must heed central edicts on the scale of investment so as not to exacerbate inflation," a source said. "Moreover, the premier is worried about a new spate of speculation in real estate and stocks, as well as the opening up of development zones for which investments have not been secured."
