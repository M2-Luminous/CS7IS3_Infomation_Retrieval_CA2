FBIS3-12408 "drnes040dd_94011" FBIS-NES-94-040 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Mar 1994 Palestinian Affairs Opposition Factions Pledge Vengeance for Massacre PM0103111594 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 26 Feb 94 p6 PM0103111594 London AL-HAYAH Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Palestinian Opposition Factions Pledge Vengeance"] [Excerpt] Damascus -- The 10 Palestinian factions opposed to the Oslo agreement have threatened to escalate military action and retaliate to the "al-Ibrahimi mosque crime in Hebron." They called on the PLO to "revoke the Gaza-Jericho and the Cairo document" signed with Israel and to request the dismantling of the settlements in the occupied territory. Abu-'Ali Mustafa, deputy secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] (led by George Habash), has told AL-HAYAH that "today's (yesterday's) crime was premeditated. Nobody should believe that the Israeli officials were not linked to the operation, for they want to combine the PLO leadership's political submission with military submission through massacres." He said that yesterday's PLO call yesterday for the dismantling of the settlements "came too late and its aim was to contain the people's fury." He urged the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] (led by Nayif Hawatimah) and the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) to overlook their differences. Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, Hamas representative in Damascus, dismissed the claim that the perpetrator of the massacre was mentally deranged. He emphasized that Hamas "pledges retaliation for the crime." He told AL-HAYAH that the massacre "will not affect the implmentation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement." He accused the Israeli forces of complicity. He said that the "operation was planned by the army and the settlers. No armed person can enter the mosque without coordination with the army and no single person can kill about 50 people and wound over 200." He added that "the only language those (Israelis) understand is the language of military action." Hamas' information office yesterday issued a statement calling for an urgent enlarged meeting of the Islamic movements in the Arab and Islamic states "to consider ways of reacting to the Zionist massacre and of supporting the Palestinian people." The statement added: "Let the confrontations escalate and let the land erupt in flames and earthquakes under the feet of the occupation. Let (Yitzhaq) Rabin know that our people's flesh is very bitter." Hamas later issued another statement calling on the Palestinian and Arab negotiators to withdraw from the negotiations with Israel. It added: "We call on the Tunis leadership to return to the option of resistance as the only strategic option for our people to regain their rights and avenge the blood of the martyrs." Hawatimah said that escalation of military action and the downfall of the Oslo and Cairo agreements "would open the way for a political settlement based on withdrawal, termination of [Israeli] settlement and massacres, and fulfillment of our people's right to self-determination and independence." He called for a three-day general strike in the West Bank, Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip." Palestinian Popular Struggle Front Secretary General Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid has urged the Security Council to "take the necessary measures to prevent the Zionists from committing their crimes." He called on Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat to stop the negotiations with Israel. The PFLP and the DFLP have issued a statement requesting international protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territory and promising to "avenge" the Hebron massacre and "punish the occupation forces and the settlers." The statement called on the Palestinian president to stop the negotiations with the Hebrew state. [passage omitted]
