Ltd. has developed a DC-type, 26-inch (896 x 512 pixel) color plasma display. With an improved operating life of 10,000 hours, and increased brightness of 150 cd/m[.sup]2[/], the new display meets the requirements for practical usage. The problem of short lifespan was resolved by adding a resistor to each display cell which comprises a picture element. By passing the discharge current through the resistor, the current can be limited; thereby improving the efficiency of light emission. This results in extended lifespan. Brightness was increased by extending the application of phosphor from the bottom of the cell to the sidewalls of the cell. Flat panel displays are generally used in two types of applications. The first is in office equipment such as personal computer and workstation displays, and the second is in audio/visual type uses such as in flat televisions. For the office applications, liquid crystal panels have already come into practical use. However, using liquid crystal panels for audio/visual applications has not been practical due to the panels' limited screen size. Development of 20-inch (diagonal) and larger panels has been underway. The plasma display panel (PDP) has drawn attention as a possible candidate for flat panel televisions because it can be produced in large sizes (40-inch), and because due to its wide angle of visibility, can be viewed from an angle. However, commercialization lagged behind that of the liquid crystal panel because of problems with low light emission efficiency, dark screen, and short operating life. In 1993, the color PDP finally arrived on the market. Fujitsu began selling an AC-type 21-inch color PDP having a lifespan of 10,000 hours or more, and screen brightness of 200 cd/m[.sup]2[/].[.sup]1)[/] The operating life of this product rivals that of the CRT, and brightness also approaches that of the CRT. Subsequently, Matsushita Electronic Industrial Co., together with NHK at the NHK Broadcasting Laboratory, developed a DC-type 26-inch color PDP having a brightness of 150 cd/m[.sup]2[/] and a life of 10,000 hours, with a view toward commercialization. Large panels can be easily produced since the vacuum film growth process needed for AC-type panels is not required for the DC-type panel. At present, DC-type panels are being developed by Matsushita, Oki Electric Industrial Co., and Dainippon Insatsu, with efforts focused at the NHK Broadcasting Laboratory. One objective is to achieve a practical 55-inch panel which can be used for high-definition TV broadcasting of the Winter Olympics to be held in Nagano in 1998. However, the immediate goal is to achieve by 1995 a practical 30-inch panel which can be used for EDTV II broadcasting or for the current NTSC TV broadcasting system. Resolving the problems of brightness and lifespan with the new 26-inch panel brings achieving this goal one step closer. Phosphor Emits Light Using Ultraviolet Rays In the color PDP, ultraviolet rays are generated by gas discharge, and they are injected into the phosphor to enable a color display. The panel consists of two glass plates facing each other with a gap of about 200 ï¿½m between. Gas is sealed inside this gap (see Figure 1). Electrode lines are formed in the glass plates for alignment, and a single display cell is defined by the intersection of these lines. Red, green, and blue phosphor is applied to each display cell according to the arrangement shown in Table 1. Each display cell is separated from other cells by a partition to form a very small discharge tube. The partition maintains the spacing between glass plates and also prevents color smear between display cells. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Structure of the 26-Inch Pulse Memory DC PDP. A gas which radiates ultraviolet rays is used for the color PDP. The new panel uses a mixture of helium (95%) and xenon (5%) gas. Although the discharge gas is almost colorless, xenon emits 147nm ultraviolet rays. These ultraviolet rays excite the phosphor, resulting in the generation of visible light. For the phosphor, an improved type of that used in fluorescent lamps for illumination purpose is used. With the phosphor ordinarily used in fluorescent lighting, mercury atoms emit a peak excitation in 254nm wavelength ultraviolet rays. When this is shifted toward the shorter wavelength side, it can be used for the PDP. The aspect ratio of the screen is 16:9, to match high definition broadcasting. Display size is about 670mm (26-inches diagonal), which roughly rivals a 28-inch type CRT display. The pixels (cells) are arranged in a ``quartet'' configuration, with each side of the square being 0.65mm. 512 cells are arranged vertically and 896 are aligned horizontally to make up the screen. Field is Divided into Eight Parts for Gradient Display The panel is driven by means of a pulse memory system (see Figure 2).[.sup]2)[/] While a voltage (maintenance pulse) which does not cause discharge is applied to all cells, a write pulse having the voltage needed to initiate discharge of only desired cells is input synchronously with a scanning pulse. Once initiated, discharge continues by means of the maintenance pulse voltage. To discontinue the discharge, a pulse voltage lower than the maintenance pulse is input. (This is called the cancel pulse.) If this PDP were to be driven using a simple matrix system (time division system), the maximum duty ratio (display time ratio) would be 1/512. Since the light emission period is short, sufficient brightness cannot be achieved. When the pulse memory system is used, the display discharge can be continued for a fixed time by means of the maintenance pulse, so illumination time can be extended. This is the advantage of the pulse memory system. Figure 2. Drive Waveforms in the Pulse Memory System. The scanning pulse and subsequent maintenance voltage is applied consecutively to each of the 512 cathodes. During this time, a maintenance pulse is applied constantly to the anode. The maintenance pulse and the scanning pulse are out of phase with each other, and discharge does not begin when only one or the other pulse is applied. To cause the display discharge, a write pulse which is synchronized with the scanning pulse is Figure 3. Principle of 256 Gradient Display by Subfield Division. applied to the anode. The voltage difference between electrodes which occurs due to the write pulse and the scanning pulse must be set higher than the discharge initiation voltage. When a system such as this is used to drive the panel, the display time for one field of each cell is fixed. In other words, one field can display no more than two gradients. For multiple gradient display, the field must be divided into several sub-fields, as shown in Figure 3. To achieve 256 gradient display, it is necessary to divide each field into eight subfields. The display time for each subfield is proportionate to 1, 2, ... 128. Combining these eight subfields makes it possible to achieve gradient display of 256 steps. However, in order to scan 512 cathodes for one of one subfield, the period t of the scanning pulse must be within the following: t = (1/60) x (1/512) x (1/8) = 4 x 10[.sup]-6[/] (seconds) In other words, discharge must start up within 1 microsecond. To achieve this, discharge starters located in auxiliary cells between display cells are kept constantly illuminated. With the help of the auxiliary discharge, the discharge startup time can be kept at 1 microsecond or less, enabling display of 256 gradients. Lifespan of 10,000 Hours, Brightness of 150 cd/m [.sup]2[/] Table 2 shows the performance of the new 26-inch panel relative to former panels. In former panels, the largest problems were lifespan and efficiency of light emission. Lifespan is defined here as the point where a drop is reached of 50% or more in brightness (relative to initial brightness) when the PDP is continuously and fully illuminated. During use, the phosphor and glass of the PDP becomes contaminated, resulting in a decrease in brightness. This happens because during display, ion collide in the gas enclosed at the cathode surface, and the cathode materials becomes dispersed (sputtered). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2. Performance of the 26-Inch Pulse Memory Type DC Plasma Display Pane-| |l. Although lifespan is currently 10,000 hours for the 26-inch panel, this h-| |as been extended to 30,000 hours in a long-life 8-inch panel. Life is also e-| |xpected to increase to 30,000 hours in the future for the 26-inch panel. Wit-| |h regard to power consumed in the drive circuit section, the drive circuit h-| |as not yet been made into an IC for the 26-inch panel, so no comparison can | |be made. For a prototype 40-inch panel developed at the same time, former po-| |wer consumption was 400W; this has been lowered to 100W in a 1993 version. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Former (1992 Electronics |New (1993 NHK Technology | | |Show) |Exhibition) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Brightness |100 cd/m[.sup]2[/] |150 cd/m[.sup]2[/] | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Contrast |10:1 |10:1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Life |1000 hours |10,000 hours | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Discharge Current |150 ï¿½A |60 ï¿½A | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Light Emission Efficiency|0.15 lm/W |0.40 lm/W | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Power Consumption of Pan-|140W |80W | |el (except for drive cir-| | | |cuit) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The lifespan of former color PDPs was about 1,000 hours. This has been extended to 10,000 hours or more with the new panel, equaling that of the CRT. Efficiency of light emission, at 0.40 lm/W, is almost triple the former value of 0.151 lm/W. Factors contributing to the improved lifespan and light emission efficiency include: (1) the discharge current for each pulse has been lowered by adding a current limiting resistor to each cell, (2) the pressure of enclosed gas has been raised, and (3) the phosphor, which was formerly applied only to the bottom of the cell, is applied to the sidewalls of the cell to increase the utility of ultraviolet rays. By improving the light emission efficiency, brightness has been increased and power consumption has been lowered. Brightness has been improved from the former 100 cd/m[.sup]2[/], which is generally regarded to be at the practical level. While the former-type panels consume about 140W (with the exception of the circuit driver area), the new 26-inch panel consumes 80W. As a result, the temperature rise which occurs during use has also been limited. When using the panel at room temperature, former panels would heat up to about 90ï¿½C; this has been reduced to about 50ï¿½C in the new panels. Resistors Added to Each Cell The biggest reason why the new panel has an extended lifespan of 10,000 hours is because a current limiting resistor has been added to each display cell. Former-type plasma display panels which do not have this resistor use anomalous glow discharge for display discharge. With this method, an increase in the discharge current is accompanied by a slight increase in the discharge voltage, as shown in Figure 4 (a) and (b). In other words, the discharge current can be controlled by adjusting the applied voltage. However, when anomalous glow discharge is used, the electrode is easily damaged by sputtering, resulting in a shortened lifespan. Sputtering can be reduced by increasing the pressure of gas within the cell. Increasing this gas pressure also raises the efficiency of light emission. However, once the gas pressure is increased, discharge changes from anomalous glow discharge to normal glow discharge. During normal glow discharge, the discharge voltage remains fixed or even decreases when the discharge current is increased, as shown in Figure 4 (c). In cases where the voltage drops in conjunction with an increase in current, uncontrolled discharge occurs if the current is not limited; and the cell is destroyed. To utilize normal glow discharge, some means of limiting the discharge current must be devised. Using a peripheral circuit to limit the discharge current has also been considered, but this is not regarded to be practical. The number of display cells in each electrode line which will illuminate changes, depending on the image to be reproduced. Controlling the current according to the image would require an extremely complex control circuit. Another way of doing this is to add an independent resistor to each display cell. By so doing, the discharge current can be limited without requiring a peripheral circuit (see Figure 4 (d)). It was known in the past that adding a resistor to each display cell would achieve a practical lifespan for the panel.[.sup]3)4)[/] However, since there were still numerous other problems, and there was no suitable resistor material, a large-size panel could not be constructed practically due to the Figure 4. Normal and anomalous Glow Discharge. increased number of processes involved. Recent advancements have been made in the production technology for display panels, and peripheral techniques for resistor formation have been established. These can now be adopted for 26-inch type panels. Comparing the lifespan of the new panels against former panels which did not use resistors, the usable life in former models could not be improved by raising the gas pressure (see Figure 5). This is because the discharge current would increase in conjunction with an increase of the gas pressure. In addition, gas pressure could not be increased above a certain value due to the possibility of arc discharge. Since the new panels have resistors to control the discharge current, the discharge current can be managed without high pressure gas, resulting in longer life. In an experimental panel, HeZe gas mixture was enclosed at a pressure of 40 kPa, and discharge current was kept at about 60 ï¿½A. The brightness half-life was extended to 10,000 hours or more. There have also been some other fundamental experiments underway in an effort to lengthen the usable lifespan of the panel. The lifespan of an 8-inch panel, displayed by NHK at the 1993 Technology Exhibition, is estimated to be 30,000 hours or more. Gas pressure has been increased to 47 kPa in this panel. Also, the proportion of Xe gas, which controls sputtering, is 10%. Figure 5. Lifetime of Panels with Resistors Added. Accuracy of Resistance Value Assured by Etching The key points in adding resistors involved determining what kind of design should be used to incorporate the resistor, and how to produce panels having complex designs. The resistor was formed on the glass plate on the anode side (rear side), as shown in Figure 6. The bus line from the anode passes through the resistor and connects to the anode in the center of the cell. An insulating layer is used to protect the anode from resistance. Only the center part of the anode is exposed to the discharge space because of a thru-hole situated in the insulating layer. Figure 6. Internal Cell Structure of Resistor-Added Panels. The new resistor-added panel can be produced by simply adding a resistor printing process, as shown in Figure 7. However, since the resistors are built into display cells which are about 0.5mm square, a higher level of precision is required of the printing process. When producing 26-inch panels, it is necessary to achieve uniform formation of 450,000 resistors. To achieve this degree of uniformity, (1) the shape of the electrode which connects resistor to resistor must be precise, and (2) the resistor material must be compatible with the electrode and insulating film materials. In particular, conventional screen printing does not produce sufficient precision when forming the electrode -- therefore, a photoetch process was adopted. For the prototype panel, a goal of plus or minus 10% was set for uniformity of resistance values. Although the actual prototype contained some resistors which exceeded this standard, this did not significantly affect the display. Efforts are currently underway to discover the causes of the variance in resistor values.[.sup]5)[/] RuO[.sup]2[/] paste having a sinter temperature of about 600ï¿½C was used as the resistor material. The resistive paste which is ordinarily used for hybrid ICs was not used because it has a higher sinter temperature of about 850ï¿½C, which cannot be used with glass plates. Each resistor has a value of about 1 M ohms. As a result, discharge current could be greatly reduced from the former value of 150 ï¿½A to 60 ï¿½A. Since photo-etching was used to produce the resistor-added panel, processing required a slightly more complex procedure. Also, since the resistor sinter temperature of 600ï¿½C is higher than that used in other processes (where temperatures up to 580ï¿½C are used), there is a higher occurrence of stress in the glass. Further study is needed to resolve these problems. Phosphor Also Applied to Sidewalls of Cells The life of the display could be extended by adding resistors to the cells. The remaining problem involving the brightness was resolved by applying phosphor to the sidewalls of the display cells, to increase the utilization of ultraviolet rays which are generated during discharge (see Figure 8). Figure 7. Production Processes for Resistor-Added Panels. Figure 8. Transparent Type PDP Panel and Reflective Type PDP Panel. Color plasma discharge displays initially consisted of a design where the phosphor was applied on the front side glass, so that the emitted light could be seen through the phosphor. The drawback in this design was that emitted light was absorbed into the phosphor layer, resulting in reduced brightness. To resolve this problem, a reflective-type panel was developed. It consisted of applying phosphorous material on the rear glass, and emitted light was viewed through the front glass. Since there was no light absorbed by the phosphor, brightness was improved by 1.5 times. However, since the phosphor was at the bottom of the cell, the viewing angle was narrow. In the new panel, phosphor has been applied to the sidewall in addition to the bottom of the cell. By doing so, the utilization of ultraviolet rays increases, and brightness also more than doubles. At the same time, the viewing angle remains the same as that of permeation-type displays. Ultraviolet rays which struck the sidewalls were formerly not utilized. When combining this with the drop in discharge current brought about by adding resistors, light emission efficiency has been improved almost three-fold, reaching 0.4 lm/W. As a result, a brightness of 150 cd/m[.sup]2[/] can be obtained, and the average power consumption can be reduced from the former 140 W to 80 W, with the exception of power consumed in the circuit drive sections. There are two problems in forming phosphor material on the sidewalls. The first is that the panel becomes whitish because the color of the phosphor material is white. This can be resolved by placing red, green, and blue color filters on each pixel, as shown in Figure 9. By adding a filter which allows only the color of light emitted by each cell to penetrate, reflected light can ideally be reduced to 1/3 without any drop in brightness of the display light. Figure 9. Reflection of External Light Is Prevented by Color Filters The second problem is the degree of complexity involved in processing. To form phosphor on the sidewalls, the display cell must first be covered with phosphor material, and then the phosphor must be removed except for the sidewall areas. To selectively remove the phosphor material, a sandblasting or photoetching process is required. Mass Production Technique to Be Established The objectives of improving longevity, brightness, and efficiency were basically achieved about one year ago.[.sup]6)[/] Remaining technical problems include converting the circuit drive into an IC. Once this is achieved, the system can be made more compact, and power consumption can also be decreased. In DC-type PDPs which have a pulse memory system, the discharge voltage is 250 V or higher. This has made it difficult to develop a monolithic IC. Recently, new drive systems which can be used with drive IC withstand voltage of 200 V or more have been proposed.[.sup]7)-9)[/] A bias voltage is applied to the entire drive circuit in order to reduce the voltage to the drive IC. At the 1993 NHK Technology Exhibition, a 40-inch panel using the new drive system was displayed, with picture quality that equaled the former type systems. In the new drive system, the amplitude of the drive pulse and the duration of application are reduced. Therefore, the power loss which occurs in the drive circuit section can be reduced. In the 40-inch panel, power consumption in the drive section is 400 W when the former drive system is used. With the new drive system, this has dropped to 100 W. When this is applied to a 26-inch panel, the average power consumption of the entire panel can be reduced to 150 W or lower. One more problem is the establishment of mass production processes for large panels. Thick film technology could be developed to achieve this. When producing large size panels, it is beneficial to use thick film rather than thin film methods in view of the cost of production equipment, and throughput. There could also be areas where thin film formation techniques can be utilized. Mass production processes will eventually be determined by balancing yield and cost, while comparing low cost thick-film processes to higher cost, but more precise thin-film processes.

DC Method Better for Larger Plasma Display Panels; AC Method Better for High Precision There are two methods used in plasma displays -- the DC method and the AC method. 21-inch AC-type color panels are already being mass produced, and a practical level of light emission and usable life have been achieved. There are slight differences in structure between the DC and AC systems (see Figure A). In the DC system, the opposing electrodes are exposed to the discharge space. When voltage is applied between the electrodes, electrons jump from the cathode and reach the anode while gas is being ionized. Discharge is maintained by a DC discharge current. In the AC method, the electrodes are covered with a dielectric layer. The process is the same as the DC method in as much as electrons pass from the minus electrode side when voltage is applied, and gas becomes ionized. However, since the electrodes are covered with dielectric material and a capacitor is formed, the current stops completely when a fixed charge moves. As implied by the name, in the AC method, discharge is maintained by applying an AC current. In the AC system, the charge stored in the capacitor helps to initiate the discharge. Therefore, a supplemental discharge cell is not required to serve as the discharge starter. This makes it possible to achieve a smaller cell size. However, the disadvantage is that there is a large amount of reactive current because AC drives a large capacity panel. The conventional AC system has been regarded to have a better lifespan. In the AC system, a MgO film that resists sputtering is formed on the dielectric layer which covers the electrodes. However, in the DC system, since the electrodes are directly exposed to the discharge, it is necessary to use an electrode material which is resistant to sputtering, such as aluminum. The AC method also has the advantage that current is automatically limited by the capacitance of the display cell. By keeping the discharge current below a certain value, the sputtering can be reduced. In the case of the DC method, current must be limited by using a resistor or constant-current circuit. For larger size panels which adopt the AC system, a vacuum deposition process is required to form the MgO film, thus equipment investment and yield are not favorable. In the DC method, thick film printing can be used to create the film, so it is more suitable for larger screen sizes. On the other hand, the construction of the display cell is simple in the AC method, so precision can be more easily achieved than in the DC method.
