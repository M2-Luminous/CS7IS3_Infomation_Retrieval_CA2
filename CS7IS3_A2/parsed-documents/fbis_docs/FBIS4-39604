U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Thomas Pickering thanked the Russian side for "the tact and understanding" shown during the plane incident. Some time ago an Israeli private plane was forced to land under similar circumstances. Some experts doubt that such frequent incidents in the same area are accidental. Rather this is a deliberate violation of the established procedures for activating the air defense system in this region. Following the disintegration of the Union system, Russia had to create new border lines, in particular in the Caucasus, which have become a subject of study by U.S. and NATO electronic surveillance centers in Turkey. The presence of reconnaissance equipment aboard the C-130 is not ruled out. According to flight documents, there was a diplomatic cargo aboard the plane, and so its inspection was unlikely.
