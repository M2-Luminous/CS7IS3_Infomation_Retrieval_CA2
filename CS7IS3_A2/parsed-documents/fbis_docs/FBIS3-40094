Yet, while market activities can forcefully propel enterprises to improve their operation and management and raise their product quality and economic efficiency, they are quite unchecked. So, to bring the driving force of markets into full play, while ensuring the steady, rapid, and sound growth of our national economy, tighter macroeconomic regulation and control brook no delay. China's macroeconomic regulation and control is exercised by the State Council through sectors such as planning, finance, and banking. The central bank is the department that enforces monetary policy under State Council leadership by regulating the money supply. The "CPC Central Committee Resolution on Certain Issues Involved in Establishing a Socialist Market Economy" (abbreviated hereafter as the "Resolution") points out that the Central Government must "use monetary and fiscal policy for regulation to achieve a basic overall balance between supply and demand, as well as coordinating them with industrial policy to promote the balanced development of our national economy and society." Monetary Policy Is Most Crucial Means of Exercising Macroeconomic Regulation and Control While planning, fiscal policy, and monetary policy all are China's means of macroeconomic regulation and control, monetary policy stands in a particularly crucial position. This is because the most essential substance of macroeconomic regulation and control is the maintenance of basic overall economic balance, or the preservation of a basic overall balance between supply and demand. Overall supply is all of the commodities capable of being provided to markets, while overall demand means effective demand, or purchasing power expressed in the money supply and its turnover frequency. The key function of macroeconomic regulation and control, in addition to actively supporting the development of industrial and agricultural production and tertiary industries, by doing all possible to increase commodity supplies, is to regulate the whole society's money supply (as the currency turnover rate does not vary much under normal conditions, it can be regarded as a constant), so that it reflects the scale on which overall demand is suited to overall supply. The so-called money supply is the cash and account-transfer currency in the market. It is formed by banks through fund applications. As about 95 percent of bank fund applications are loans, it can be said that the money supply is formed through bank lending. Enterprises generally borrow from banks to pay for stock purchases, and the loans granted by banks for enterprise stock purchases very quickly turn into sales units' product-sale funds. The product-sale funds acquired by sales units are then used to pay employee wages, all sorts of expenses, profits and taxes to state revenue, and for stock purchases with, except for some that form potential currency, the rest being converted through transactions into cash and account transfer currency. So as long as the state emphasizes the key link of banks, controlling overall lending and the money supply, it can achieve its macroeconomic regulation and control ends. The fund activities of other sectors of the national economy can affect only the distribution and turnover rate of social currency, by either shifting it from one sector to another or accelerating or slowing the currency turnover rate, but cannot directly increase or reduce the money supply. This is also the case with fiscal revenue and expenditure. When revenue and expenditure is balanced (including balance achieved through the sale of bonds), fiscal revenue and expenditure comes from and is used for the society, affecting only the social currency turnover frequency, as well as redistributing the social money supply. However, when fiscal revenue and expenditure produces surpluses or deficits that increase or decrease the social money supply, that is achieved either through increasing or decreasing fiscal deposits in banks or through borrowing and overdrawing from banks. In the final analysis, the impact of fiscal revenue and expenditure on the money supply is still realized through bank credit fund variation. Of course, this refers only to the overall source of the social money supply, certainly not to say that the impact of the economic activities of the non-banking sector (mostly the fiscal sector) on the money supply, and thus on overall social demand, is insignificant. On the contrary, sectors, such as state revenue, in addition to being able to affect the currency turnover rate, can also use methods, such as spending beyond income, creating deficits, and arranging more basic construction projects, to force banks to make additional loans, increasing the money supply and expanding overall social demand. So the impact on overall demand of activities by sectors, such as state revenue, must absolutely not be overlooked. While emphasizing the use of monetary policy to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control, the state must also establish coordination and restraint mechanisms among planning, banking, and finance, to enhance its comprehensive coordination of economic operations. Achieving Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Through Mostly Monetary Policy Means Will Require Certain Terms To Be Met Setting up a macroeconomic regulation and control system in which planning, finance, and banking are coordinated and monetary policy by banks is the major means, or shifting regulation and control from mostly administrative to mostly economic means, will require that the following terms be met: 1. We need to set up a modern enterprise system, to enable state enterprises to become corporate entities that have operating autonomy, are responsible for their own profits and losses, and organize their production or operation according to market needs. This will allow both enterprise leaders and employees to pay particular attention to their operating results so that they can respond sensitively to economic macroeconomic regulation and control measures by conscientiously organizing and adjusting their production and operation according to state macroeconomic policy. 2. We need to pave the way for the central bank to exercise an independent monetary policy. China's money market is a centralized one, in which the yuan can circulate freely and without obstacle throughout the country, and in which a larger monetary investment by any region can affect the national money-flow status quo. Thus, to prevent unchecked starting of projects by localities, which would force the central bank to provide more money, sharpening inflation, our macroeconomic regulation and control authority, including monetary policy control authority, must be concentrated in the center. Some hold that we ought to devolve some macroeconomic regulation and control authority to local governments, setting a clear division of labor between the center and localities, and practicing two-level macroeconomic regulation and control. This merits discussion. Those who hold this view probably understand macroeconomic regulation and control as controlling the major matter of economic construction, believing that it should be not overcentralized, but rather appropriately decentralized to stimulate the initiative of all areas. In fact, macroeconomic regulation and control is an economic concept with a specific meaning, being an overall regulation and control. Its regulation and control target is overall social supply and demand, with its regulation and control aim being an attempt to achieve an overall balance of demand with supply. So macroeconomic regulation and control policies and measures can only be formulated, organized, and enforced directly by the central government. If we allowed all places and sectors to become their own units for exercising regulation and control, making their own money supply decisions, it would be impossible to balance our whole society's overall supply and demand, and difficult to prevent inflation. Might the uniform exercise of macroeconomic regulation and control concentrated in the center affect local economic development? This would be absolutely impossible, and we must not confuse macroeconomic regulation and control with the former planned management. We must not worry that the mere mention of tighter macroeconomic regulation and control concentrated in the center might mean restricted microeconomic activity. In fact, macroeconomic regulation and control differs sharply from the past planned management, which directly restrained microeconomic activity, with the more planning, the more restraint on and the harder to stimulate the economy. On the other hand, macroeconomic regulation and control mainly regulates and controls overall social supply and demand, completely deregulating the economic activities of individual enterprises to market regulation. Tighter macroeconomic regulation and control ensures currency stability to give enterprises full play to grow faster, by clearing the way and setting the stage. One of the reasons that the "Resolution" provides for macroeconomic regulation and control authority to be concentrated in the center is to promote microeconomic activity. If we allowed all regions and sectors to share in macroeconomic regulation and control authority, to practice two- or multi-level regulation and control that would micromanage macroeconomic regulation and control, certain defects of our past planned management might reappear in such micromanaged macroeconomic regulation and control. 3. We need to establish an appropriate banking system. While banks shoulder the key macroeconomic regulation and control responsibility, our banking system still contains certain problems that keep it from adapting to needs. 1. Our central bank is liable for too many specific matters, making it hard for it to focus more efforts on controlling monetary policy. 2. All specialized banks handle both ordinary banking business and policy-related matters, making it impossible for them to be genuine enterprises. This keeps the banking industry from further invigoration, while making it impossible for the central bank to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control through economic means. Economic means of regulation and control is using a method that can influence the economic interests of all financial institutions and enterprises, to guide financial institutions and thus enterprises to operate their business activities according to state macroeconomic policy demands. As all large banks have not yet become genuine enterprises, not emphasizing evaluation of profits, it would be bound to be impossible for the central bank to achieve the desired results from exercising macroeconomic regulation and control through economic means. 3. As economic leverage, such as interest and exchange rates, is still not invigorated, bringing the impact of monetary policy into full play to tighten macroeconomic regulation and control will necessitate intensified reform of our banking system: --We need to set up a policy bank as quickly as possible to specially handle the ordinary banking business handled by the central bank and the policy-related matters handled by specialized banks that require direct government regulation and control. Once specialized banks separate out policy-related matters; they will gradually convert to commercial banks. In addition, we could also reestablish in an organized way a few national or regional commercial banks, including shareholding-system banks. But all commercial banks must practice assets, liability, and ratio management and risk control. --We need to better develop our money markets. We need not only to increase our securities trade turnover, but also to commercialize the credit funds of commercial banks and other financial institutions. All monetary funds, except for policy bank loans, must be turned into commodities to operate according to the fund for commodity exchange principle. --We need to deregulate banking interest rates in a controlled way. Based on the spirit of the decision by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the central bank in the future will set only benchmark interest rates based on fund supply and demand, while commercial bank interest rates can float freely within a range around the benchmark rates. Within these limits, commercial banks and other financial institutions will have the authority to freely decide their own deposit and loan interest rates. We also need to reform our foreign exchange control system by establishing a market-based and controlled floating exchange rate system and a foreign exchange market with uniform standards, in order to gradually turn the yuan into a convertible currency. Once these terms are met, the central bank will be able to basically use economic means to effect monetary policy, the state will be able to establish macroeconomic regulation and control forces that control effectively while contributing to microeconomic invigoration, and our socialist market economy will be able to grow steadily, quickly, and soundly.
