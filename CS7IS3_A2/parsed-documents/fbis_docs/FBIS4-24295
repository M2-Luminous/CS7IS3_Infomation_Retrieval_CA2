The party top brass, led by the second vice chairman Professor Rashid Mzee, said they were not satisfied with the explanation given by police about the accident. "We therefore call for an independent judicial inquiry to be constituted urgently," they said at a hastily called press conference at parliament buildings last night. They said they were dissatisfied with the police explanation because of the urgency with which the scene of the accident was cleaned up. They claimed blood stains were washed away from the scene 15 minutes after the accident occurred. Professor Mzee, who read the statement on behalf of his colleagues, said Dr. Masinde died at 2:30 PM at Nairobi Hospital.

Several senior police officers were seen visiting the hospital at 5 PM. Officials at the Nairobi Hospital were not available to comment and were said to be holding a board meeting. [passage omitted]
