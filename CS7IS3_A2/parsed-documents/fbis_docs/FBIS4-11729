The participants in the Cairo session are discussing the cancellation of the indirect economic embargo against the Zionist regime. The embargo includes that group of companies and institutions which have economic and commercial deals with the Israeli regime. The Arab states imposed the economic sanctions since the early 1950's in the wake of recurrence of the first war between Arabs and the Israelis. Based on the Zionist regime officials, within this period of time Israel has sustained over $50 billion in loss. With the start of the Arab-Israeli peace process and the Arab-Zionist mutual talks paving of grounds for lifting of economic sanctions against that regime by the United States have been further revealed. This took a more serious form with the conclusion of the Gaza-Jericho agreement by the Zionist regime and the PLO. Since last September -- that is, the time when the agreement was signed -- the U.S. pressures on Arabs for easing the economic sanctions against Israel have been stepped up. These pressures as well as spread of reports on some agreements reached between some Arab states and the Zionist regime over economic plans caused the Arab League general secretary, 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, to declare late last year that the Arab League will hold a session in March to discuss the lifting of the indirect economic embargo against Israel. In the past six months reports regarding the possibility of cancellation of economic embargo of Israel by Arabs have entailed various reactions among the Arab countries. Despite the silence maintained by Arab countries, Syria, Sudan, and Libya have shown protesting reactions towards such a possibility. The Syrian Prime Minister Faruq al-Shar' upon arrival in Cairo on Friday said the issue of lifting of the Israeli sanctions by the Arabs will not be dealt with as long as the Israeli forces have not evacuated the occupied lands and a Palestinian country is not established. Political observers assess these comments which in fact indicate serious posturing toward the Arab League session in Cairo today as a kind of taking of position by that group of Arab states which are not satisfied with the Arab-Israeli peace process. However, in line of their current regional situation it is not easy to predict whether this might leave an impact on decision-making of the Cairo session or not.
