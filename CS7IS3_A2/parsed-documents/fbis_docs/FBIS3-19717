Don't you therefore have some sympathy for the British view on the voting system? [Petersen] Well, I have a lot of sympathy for the United Kingdom, for Great Britain; we have in many issues been in agreement, but on this issue I think there are very solid reasons why the predominant view inside the European Union -- that is the view of 10 out of 12 countries -- is the correct one and I would mention at least three major reasons why it is so. First of all, it is the historical precedent when Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Ireland joined, we readjusted the level for qualified majority. Accordingly it was done at the time of our entry, it was done again with the entry of Greece, with the entry of Spain and Portugal. All the time, it has been the Community rule around 70 percent of the vote constituted a qualified majority, that is, 30 percent would be a block... [Humphries, interrupting] And the other two reasons? [Petersen] That is the overriding interest of my country, and I think indeed also of the United Kingdom -- that is, that the Nordic countries and Austria now could become members. We should not delay that, and it will be delayed if we do not agree on another figure than 23. And thirdly, what is really at stake here also for the United Kingdom, for Denmark, for others, is that the government conference in 1996, which is going to set the rules for the community of the future, that that is an enlarged Community taking these decisions, including the Scandinavian countries and Austria. I think that is deeply also in the interests of England. [Humphries] Isn't the reality though, that when you sit at that table in Brussels on Tuesday [22 March] with Douglas Hurd and all the rest of you, you're going to have a lot of talk and a lot of negotiating, and you're going to emerge perhaps a bit bleary-eyed on Wednesday morning, the early hours of Wednesday morning with a compromise, with a fudge, isn't that the reality? [Petersen] Well I hope so, I certainly hope so. I think all parties to the debate now have made their points, I've certainly made mine, others have done so as well, and now is the time to find solutions, and we should do that on Tuesday. [Humphries] You say find solutions, do you mean by that find a compromise? Are you in the first place prepared to shift on the matter of 23 and 27? [Petersen] I think the only realistic view is to say -- 23 that can never become an agreed position in the council... [Humphries, interrupting] Never under any circumstances? [Peterson] Oh no, I don't think so. That will never be a position that could create a common position. Therefore we will have to be looking for something else. I think Britain should be very clear on this. There will never be an agreement on 23, we will have to look for something else. I think there's a lot of good sense in the proposition that has been put forward saying it's 27, yes, but if the majority of 23 or more are opposed it would take a period of rethinking in good faith trying then to establish a formula that could be a consensus of [words indistinct]. [Humphries] So what are you saying here, I'm not quite sure about what you are saying, whether you're saying we can put off the decision, the entire decision, or whether.... [Petersen, interrupting] No, I was talking about a compromise, saying well it's 27, that's a blocking in minority, but if there is any voting in council, 23 or more but not 27, that would create a special situation up to the moment when we have the government conference in 1996. [Humphries] Right, so you're talking about some sort of cooling-off period. [Petersen] Yes. [Humphries] For how long? [Petersen] Of rethinking? [Humphries] Yes. [Petersen] One month, it could be twice one month, that's not so important, one could look for solutions along these lines. I think that should be acceptable to everyone, and such a cooling-off period -- or think-again period I would prefer to call it -- is absolutely very valuable. It is true that it gives a chance for national parliaments and national public opinion to make itself felt in the debate. [Humphries] There is no way, is there, in which you can separate, decouple these two issues, that's to say the acceptance of the four new members and the question of qualified majority voting. So you say OK, we'll have the four in and then we'll decide, we'll sort it out afterward? [Petersen] No, that's not possible, for very good legal reasons, after all, what we have to sign with the four applicant countries is a new treaty and the treaty or adoption of the treaty, so there will have to be texts in the agreement also covering this problem. [Humphries] Let me remind you of what you did, I think, say earlier this week, the British position, I quote, is absolutely untenable, this cannot be solved by another meeting, the Brits should call us when they have reconsidered. Is that still your position? [Petersen] It is my position, as I said just a moment ago, everybody including myself have made our positions clear, we shall now seek solutions, do it on Tuesday and come up with the result. [Humphries] Right, and so if Mr. Hurd is not prepared to accept the compromise that you seem now to be suggesting, no deal? [Petersen] Well in that case, there's no enlargement and that is, I think, deeply regrettable. It is not possible to have 23 and enlargement, that is very clear now. [Humphries] Mr. Helveg Peterson, thank you very much.
