Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen made an unusual statement to the effect that excessive fluctuation is to be avoided, indicating a firm position to guard against the depreciation of the dollar. The market has now awakened from its illusion that the U.S. authorities favor a policy of "inducing yen appreciation." It is now time to listen to the U.S. message that it does not want rapid appreciation of the yen. The Federal Bank of New York started buying dollars to intervene in the market because the dollar was depreciating not only against the yen, but also against the German mark and other European currencies. If nothing were done about the situation, the dollar might depreciate rapidly. This would then stimulate the market's apprehensions about inflation, leading in turn to a triple drop in the value of the dollar, government bonds, and stock prices. This might then dampen the ongoing economic recovery in the United States. Before going into dollar-buying and yen-selling, the Federal Bank of New York had already engaged in dollar-buying and mark-selling. Dollar-buying was undertaken not because the Japanese Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan requested such intervention, but rather because of domestic circumstances in the United States. Actually, this was a dollar stabilization policy aimed at avoiding any confusion in the U.S. market and securing the U.S. economy on the track of recovery. At the Tokyo foreign exchange market and other foreign exchange markets all over the world, there had been persistent speculations that the Clinton administration is bent on inducing yen appreciation to correct the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States. However, in a floating rate system, without monetary policy coordination and powerful concerted intervention, verbal intervention can only influence the market temporarily. If, as the market speculated, the U.S. monetary authorities' strategy were to induce dollar depreciation and yen appreciation, it would have to lower interest rates and engage in dollar-selling. However, what the U.S. authorities did was the exact opposite. Short-term interest rates were raised thrice, and the monetary authorities also moved to buy dollars. It is said that U.S. monetary officials are strongly critical of economist Fred Bergsten's statement on inducing yen appreciation. The market is still expecting the yen to appreciate in the future. The prevailing view is that Japan's huge current accounts surplus will serve as pressure on the yen to increase its value. However, there is a great gap between the economic conditions in the United States and those in Japan and Germany. As the United States implements a tight monetary policy, Germany continues to adopt an easy monetary policy, and Japan also maintains a basically easy monetary policy. There is also an interest rate gap. From the economic fundamentals, there should not be any substantial pressure for the yen to appreciate. Furthermore, there are quite a number of political factors that should encourage the selling of yen, such as the unstable Japanese political situation, and the explosive situation on the Korean peninsula. There is speculation in the market that the political instability will make Japan unable to bring about a breakthrough in its frictions with the United States. However, the U.S. Government has decided to postpone sanctions against Japan in such areas as government procurement in consideration of the Japanese political situation. It is even more unlikely that the United States will choose to apply pressure to appreciate the yen in order to place the Hata administration in an extremely difficult position. The exchange rate is decided by the market. In that sense, the market should reflect accurate information. This time, the market will probably get the message of the U.S. monetary authorities. Needless to say, regardless of whether the Hata administration will be a stable government or not, timely measures should be taken to expand domestic demand and relax government regulations in order to reduce the current accounts surplus, which is a root cause of the volatility of the foreign exchange market.
