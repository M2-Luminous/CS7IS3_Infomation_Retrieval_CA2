During a 12-hour session, former Chamber of Deputies President Pinheiro was stripped of his congressional mandate by a vote of 296 to 139; 24 lawmakers abstained. The Federal Supreme Court [STF] turned down a request for a court injunction filed by Pinheiro, who wanted to suspend his trial at the Chamber of Deputies. Justice Carlos Mario Veloso reported at his office that the investigations requested by Pinheiro could be conducted only during the trial. Ibsen Pinheiro also wanted the STF to annul a decision by the Constitution and Justice Commission, which recommended his dismissal.
