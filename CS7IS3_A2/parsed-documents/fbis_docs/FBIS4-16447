He said that a dangerous policy--characterized by a trend toward replacing the state media with commercial structures interested in having their programs broadcast to central Russia only--could be discerned in the country. The possibility that the Ostankino company might cut its output from 19 to five and a half hours in every 24 hours gave rise to particular anxiety in this context, Poltoranin noted. He emphasized that the activities of foreign news agencies in Russia also did tremendous damage to the country's sovereignty in the area of information. He said that having received the right to gather information, these agencies immediately disseminated it in the form they found convenient. This trend also posed dangers to the Russian information area, said the chairman of the information policy committee.
