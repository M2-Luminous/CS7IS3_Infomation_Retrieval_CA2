Freeman, U.S. assistant secretary of defense for issues of international security told Estonian leaders yesterday. Washington will allocate up to 10 million dollars as support for the formation of the battalion, Estonian Defense Minister Indrek Kannik quoted Freeman as saying. Freeman and Kannik also discussed the opportunities for military cooperation between Estonia and the United States, as well as their working closely under NATO's Partnership for Peace program. The high Pentagon official had meetings today with President Lennart Meri, Foreign Minister Juri Luik, Defense Minister Indrek Kannik, the country's commander in chief, Aleksander Einseln, and members of the parliament's defense and foreign affairs commissions. Freeman at a press conference later in the day said the United States has no plans to set up its military bases in the Baltics. He said such a prospect was rather unlikely at a time when America is cutting down the number of its bases abroad. This is not a political decision, but a purely realistic approach, he said. While commenting on the Estonian-Russian relations, he said the Estonian Government is having at its disposal the possibilities to resolve the existing problems. Freeman said the U.S. Administration supports Estonia's position at the talks with Russia. Russia ought to understand that Estonia stays in the center of attention of the U.S. President and the government, he said.
