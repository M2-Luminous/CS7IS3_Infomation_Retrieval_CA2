FR940816-1-00032 FR940816-1-00007 Similarly, the Act requires the application of control measures that are ``reasonable'' in moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas (RACM) and control measures that are ``best'' (BACM) whenever a moderate area cannot ``practicably'' attain or fails to attain the NAAQS and is therefore reclassified as serious. Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, EPA believes it is reasonable to conclude that Congress intended a greater level of stringency to apply in areas that are required to implement ``best available'' controls than in those required only to implement controls that are ``reasonably available.'' As noted earlier, an array of different control measures is applicable under various title I NAAQS-related programs. A key factor, among others, in determining the level of control appropriate for a given area from among the different emission control measures and technologies referred to throughout title I is the severity of the air pollution problem in that area. In addition to the general categorization of areas as ``attainment,'' ``nonattainment,'' and ``unclassifiable,'' the Act characterizes the severity of an area's air pollution problem by classifying the area, for example, as ``marginal,'' ``moderate,'' ``serious,'' and so on. As discussed above, the different control measures are required to be implemented as follows: For new (or modified) sources, BACT applies in PM&hyph;10 unclassifiable and attainment areas under the PSD program, while LAER applies in moderate and serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas under the nonattainment NSR program; for existing sources, RACM (including RACT) applies in moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas, while BACM (including BACT) applies in serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. In each case, the more serious the pollution problem, the more stringent the control standard required. It is apparent that in requiring the application of BACM to existing sources in serious PM&hyph;10 areas, Congress implied that these sources should be subject to a more stringent level of control than the application of RACM required for existing sources in moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas, but not as stringent as the application of LAER required for new or modified sources in moderate and serious nonattainment areas (or the degree of control required to secure an extension under section 188(e)). 1. Definition In view of the preceding discussion, EPA believes that, as a starting point in interpreting BACM for PM&hyph;10 nonattainment purposes, it is reasonable to consider the term BACT as applied in the PSD program under section 169(3) as an analogue. Because PSD BACT and PM&hyph;10 BACM (which includes BACT) are similar terms, EPA believes it is reasonable to accord some interpretive weight to this use of similar language. 32 32 Under accepted principles of statutory interpretation, similar terms in a statute generally suggest a similar meaning, and an agency is permitted, but not required, to give a similar meaning to similar terms which appear in different parts of a statute. Therefore, EPA's interpretation of BACM for serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas will generally be similar to the definition of BACT for the PSD program. The BACM is the maximum degree of emissions reduction of PM&hyph;10 and PM&hyph;10 precursors from a source (except as provided in subsection C. 3) which is determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, to be achievable for such source through application of production processes and available methods, systems, and techniques for control of each such pollutant. For PM&hyph;10, BACM must be applied to existing source categories in nonattainment areas that cannot practicably attain (or fail to attain) within the moderate area timeframe and are reclassified as serious. 33 33 The term ``source categories'' for which BACM will be required, refers to categories of area-wide sources or large individual stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 or PM&hyph;10 precursor emissions that may be regulated under a specific rule, generic emission limit, or standard of performance, or a specific control program in a SIP. For example, the SIP may regulate emissions from unpaved roads, construction activities, residential wood combustion, asphalt concrete batch plants, etc., as source categories. Note that, in some instances, an entire source category may consist of one large individual stationary source that is regulated separately under the SIP such as a single iron and steel manufacturing facility and the various processes therein.
