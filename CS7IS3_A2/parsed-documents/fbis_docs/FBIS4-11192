FBIS4-11192 "drlat079_f_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-079 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AMERICA El Salvador Fraud Reported in La Union Fraud Reported in La Union PA2404225594 San Salvador Radio Cadena YSKL in Spanish 2143 GMT 24 Apr 94 PA2404225594 San Salvador Radio Cadena YSKL Spanish BFN [Report by Fausto Guzman] [Text] We are now in Pasaquina, La Union Department, where disturbances have been reported. At 1245 a ballot box was invalidated. We now have a statement by alternate deputy for the department of [three-second break in reception] for Radio Cadena YSKL. [Begin unidentified alternate deputy recording] Thank you. First I would like to thank YSKL for the opportunity to address the Salvadoran people to state my [four-second break in reception] of the city of Pasaquina at 1245 today. The members of the Democratic Convergence-Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [CD-FMLN] coalition withdrew from all 23 polling stations without any explanation. Their only pretext was that they had discovered that a man -- who they claim was Honduran -- had already voted and was carrying an electoral card. They said they were going to withdraw from all the polling stations for that reason. The president of the Municipal Electoral Board, who is also the coalition's representative, also withdrew. However, because of pressure from the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, from Onusal [UN Observer Mission for El Salvador], and from the secretary of the Municipal Electoral Board, a dialogue was held two hours after these gentlemen withdrew. The gentlemen from the Municipal Electoral Board were unable to reach an agreement because they claim that there had been fraud. They have criticized the installation of the orientation center of the Nationalist Republic Alliance, ARENA, in front of the central park in this city. They claim that votes were being bought and sold at this orientation center and that fraud was being committed, which is not true. When we saw that they were trying to accuse our party, ARENA, we invited Onusal and other observers from the United States and other countries to see for themselves that the orientation center was being used to help illiterate people vote. We all know that the percentage of illiterate people in our country is high. All we were doing at the orientation center was asking people for their identification cards, looking for their names on the electoral lists, and then telling them where they were supposed to vote and where their voting table was. The people of Pasaquina came out to vote. They showed that they wanted to participate. Only they know which candidate they are electing for the presidency and the vice presidency. [end recording]
