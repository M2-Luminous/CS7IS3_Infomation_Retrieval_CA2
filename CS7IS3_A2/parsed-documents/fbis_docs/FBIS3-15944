The law deals with materials both located in Estonia or removed from here, which contain information about the local population's activities and repressions, as well as materials dealing directly with foreign countries' intelligence activities. According to the law, these materials are the property of the State of Estonia. The collecting, registering, maintaining, and using of intelligence materials are the tasks of the state secretary and the archives department's director general. Everyone has the right to familiarize themselves with the materials kept about them at the archives. Everyone who has materials about foreign countries' intelligence services in their possession must inform the archives department within three months from the inception date on the law on intelligence materials and hand them over by the date set by the department. Enn Tarto, who presented the law and who is chairman of the temporary commission investigating the activities of foreign countries' intelligence and security services, told ETA that the law regulates first and foremost the use of materials of the former USSR State Security Committee and its subsiduaries, as well as those of other countries' intelligence. According to Tarto, the law will also protect people from incorrect quoting and extracting material out of context. Tarto acknowledges that even though Estonia made repeated applications for the return of all intelligence materials removed from Estonia to Russia, the return of such materials is possible on the strength of the basic agreement on a mutual exchange of culturally valuable articles concluded in 1993.
