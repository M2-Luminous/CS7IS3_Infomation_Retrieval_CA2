FR940302-0-00009 FR940302-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 15 CFR Part 946 [Docket No. 931221&hyph;3321] RIN 0648&hyph;AF72 Weather Service Modernization Criteria agency: National Weather Service (NWS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. action: Final rule. summary: This final rule establishes NWS criteria for taking certain modernization actions such as commissioning new weather observation systems, decommissioning outdated NWS radars and evaluating staffing needs for field offices in an affected area; and its criteria for certifying that closing, consolidating, automating, or relocating a field office will not degrade service to the affected area. A notice of proposed rulemaking (published December 6, 1993, 58 FR 64202) set forth the proposed criteria for those actions except for automating and closing field offices. The criteria for those two actions require further development and, after notice, public comments, and consultation with the Committee and NRC will be published in final form before either of these actions take place. All final criteria will be set forth as Appendix A to the basic modernization regulations at 15 CFR part 946 promulgated at 58 FR 64088. effective date: March 2, 1994. addresses: Requests for copies of documents should be sent to Julie Scanlon, NOAA/GCW, 1325 East-West Highway, # 18111, Silver Spring, MD 20910, 301&hyph;713&hyph;0053. for further information contact: Julie Scanlon, 301&hyph;713&hyph;0053. supplementary information: Section 704 of the NOAA Authorization Act of 1992 (Act) requires the NWS to contract with the National Research Council (NRC) for a review of the scientific and technical modernization criteria by which the NWS proposes to certify, under section 706 of the Act, actions to close, consolidate, automate, or relocate a field office and the preparation and submission of a report assessing these criteria. The NRC prepared this report and submitted it to the Secretary of Commerce on July 28, 1993. The NRC endorsed the criteria proposed, with certain reservations about some of the criteria that relate to the commissioning of Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) and automation certification. Section 704(b) of the Act requires the NWS to publish the final criteria in the Federal Register , based on the NRC report, after providing an opportunity for public comment, and after consulting with the NRC and the Modernization Transition Committee (the Committee). The public comment period closed January 5, 1994. There was one comment received. This was submitted by the National Weather Service Employees Organization (NWSEO). Consultation with the Committee was completed on January 13, 1994. The Committee reviewed the public comment and offered one recommendation to be added to the criteria. Consultation with the NRC was completed on February 23, 1994. The major comments were as follows: Comment 1_ NWSEO stated that the criteria do not contain ``statistical and analytical measures'' for determining that there will be no degradation of service but rather are merely ``process criteria.'' Response_ The commentor is incorrect in stating that the criteria are merely process criteria. The criteria for each action contain the necessary analytical and performance measures. The criteria for consolidation contain measures for evaluating each of its component and subcomponent elements, often in exhaustive detail. These include measures to ensure that the new radar is commissionable, e.g., adequate operations and maintenance personnel, adequate backup capability, system availability of at least 96 percent; and that the old radar can be decommissioned. The criteria for relocation include a checklist to ensure that each element of the move will be considered in advance and can be completed without degrading services. The NRC found these criteria to be adequate to determine that no degradation would result from these actions.
