Commenting on the refusal by the U.S. Department of Transport at a news conference on 17 March, Michihiko Matsuo, administrative vice minister of the Transport Ministry, criticized the U.S. Department of Transportation, saying, "Japan has the right to ask the United States to allow the inauguration of such a new regular flight for the Japanese airline in accordance with the Japan-U.S. Aviation Agreement." As for Japan's countermeasures, including restrictions on flights by American airlines to Japan, he said, "What we have to do first is to continue to ask the United States to go along with our request for opening the regular flight." In this way, he made clear that Japan will not think of taking any countermeasures against the United States for the time being. The Japan Air Lines planned to inaugurate its first Sendai-Honolulu regular flight on 17 March, but it hurriedly shifted to a charter flight. The chartered airliner with 275 passengers aboard left Sendai for Honolulu on the evening of 17 March.
