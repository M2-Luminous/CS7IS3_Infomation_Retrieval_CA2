Japan's International Trade Policy Bureau [ITPB] recently extended a formal invitation to Huang Yen-chao, director general of the Board of Foreign Trade [BOFT] in which it expressed the hope of facilitating unrestricted, two-way visits and exchanges, and of establishing a pattern for dialogue. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economic Affairs [MOEA] has also completed a plan concerning the appropriate tactics aimed at coping with the possible impact on Sino-Japanese trade of the ROC's applying for GATT membership. The following is a report filed by Huang Mei-ting: [Begin Huang Mei-ting recording] The ROC and Japan have made very good progress in promoting official contacts on economic and trade issues following the ROC's vigorous efforts to rejoin the international community. The level of visiting Japanese officials increased from the former departmental-head level to the current ITPB-director level. The two countries recently saw a new breakthrough in the pattern of their exchanges. The BOFT under the MOEA said: In the past, the two sides used to hold annual economic meetings through the Association of East Asian Relations and the Chinese-Japanese Interchange Association; however, because of their semiofficial nature, the meetings were usually more important in form than in substance. Japan's ITPB recently reached a tacit mutual understanding with the MOEA's BOFT on mutual visits by ITPB and BOFT directors at irregular intervals every year for discussions on removing obstacles to Sino-Japanese trade. Japan's ITPB extended a formal invitation to BOFT Director General Huang Yen-chao to [words indistinct] visit Japan this year. This signaled a breakthrough beyond the former need of ROC officials to stress the private and informal nature of their visits to Japan. In addition to the issue of the ROC's trade deficit with Japan, the ROC's application for GATT membership will also change the form of trade between the two countries. Departmental Head Chu Wei-cheng of the BOFT said: The ROC has completed an assessment of the ranking of priority items for negotiations with Japan on trade obstacles. Before obtaining GATT membership, the ROC will still focus its negotiations with Japan on readjusting the ROC's economic and trade system; after obtaining GATT membership, we shall then request Japan to scrap its discriminative measures against us in economic relations and trade. [Chu Wei-cheng] Now we must deal with the matter by dividing it into two aspects. One aspect is our application for GATT membership. Possibly this is purely a request made of us by the other side. However, on the other hand, we hope to establish a channel for consultations to state our requirements to Japan and to negotiate with it in the future. [Huang] Departmental Head Chu Wei-cheng said: The Sino-Japanese trade deficit may very likely increase due to the cancellation of trade restrictions on the importing of cars and other goods. The BOFT believes that the fundamental solution to the problem lies in beefing up the basic materials at home [as received]. In addition, enhancing the competitiveness of ROC products in Japan's market by lifting the ban on and increasing the imports of semifinished products from the mainland and by implementing a cross-strait division-of-labor system are another way for the government to reduce its trade deficit with Japan. This is a report by Huang Mei-ting, Broadcasting Corporation of China correspondent, at the MOEA. [end recording]
