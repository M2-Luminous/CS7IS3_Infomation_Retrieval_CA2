The consultative body, chaired by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, began discussions on the fiscal 1994 budget late last year. The debate was stalled earlier this month, however, due to political turmoil after the rejection of the reform bills by the House of Councillors January 21. Friday's agreement on political reforms reached between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party, prompted the government and governing coalition to make haste in weaving together steps to rev up the flagging economy, the sources said. The consultative body, made up of cabinet ministers in charge of economic affairs and representatives of the ruling coalition parties, is determined to set the timetable for drafting the national budget on Saturday, they said. Saturday's discussion is expected to focus on when to raise the 3 percent consumption tax as a means of securing funds to implement major income and residential tax cuts, the sources said. Indications are that the government will announce the pump-priming package by the end of next week and have the Ministry of Finance adopt its budget proposal around February 10 ahead of a summit meeting between Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington February 11. The government intends to adopt its draft budget in mid-February, sources said.
