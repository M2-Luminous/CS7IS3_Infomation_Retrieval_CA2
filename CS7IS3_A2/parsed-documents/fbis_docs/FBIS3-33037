It should be recalled that U.S. Government officials have issued a report stating that during 1993 there were several cases of human rights violations in Chile. The U.S. ambassador stated that the report is positive, and the Foreign Ministry under secretary said it was better than the past one and it acknowledges the efforts made by the current government. Cantuarias rejected the report, which he said was unacceptable because it represents an intervention in a democratic country where the state of law prevails. The UDI legislator said Chilean dignity is trampled on whenever U.S. Government officials feel they have the right to intervene in domestic affairs and voice their opinion on our behavior. Cantuarias then said that the United States has many unsolved problems and its officials should be busy trying to solve them.
