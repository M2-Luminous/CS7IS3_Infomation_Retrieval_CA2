A spokesman of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office today issued a statement on this matter, saying that soon after Britain rented the "New Territories" by force with an unequal treaty, it declared that all the lands in the new territories belonged to the British Royal Family, thereby peremptorily depriving the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories of land ownership. As this was unreasonable, indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories rose up in protest. A regulation adopted later requiring the indigenous inhabitants to pay only nominal rent was the result of the struggle of indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories. Therefore, it is imperative to protect the traditional legitimate rights and interests of the New Territories inhabitants. This has been written into the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic Law and it cannot be changed. The spokesman said: Annex III of the Sino-British Joint Declaration clearly provides that rural lands leased to indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories "shall remain unchanged so long as the property is held by that person or by one of his lawful successors in the male line." The interpretation given by the British side during the Sino-British negotiations is that the only way to establish who are the descendants of the indigenous inhabitants is to trace back their ancestors through the male line. Children of a family customarily use their father's last name, and it by no means implies discrimination against women. We must, however, not confuse these traditional rights and interests of the New Territories indigenous inhabitants with discrimination against women. The spokesman emphasized: Our stand is that the concept of "indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories" that is written into the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic Law should not be scrapped, nor should the legitimate rights and interests of the aforementioned indigenous inhabitants won from Britain as a result of their struggle be abandoned or nullified. The spokesman said: It is only natural that the British Hong Kong government, which endorsed the amendments to the aforementioned bill without first consulting the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories, aroused intense discontent among the indigenous inhabitants. He emphasized that the British Hong Kong government must face up to the discontent of the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories, and appropriately handle this matter by way of full consultations with the indigenous inhabitants, and in accordance with the provisions of the Hong Kong Basic Law so as not to artificially create social upheavals and division.
