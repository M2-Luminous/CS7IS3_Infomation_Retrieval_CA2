During this period, the changes in China's rural areas have been profound and the results obtained remarkable. I think that the most important changes in rural areas have been in the following aspects: The first change is the change in the form of management and the distribution of land. The basic means of production, that is to say the production relationship, has been readjusted. In essence, the past structure of the so-called people's commune of being large in size and collective in nature, eating out of the big pot, and egalitarianism has been changed, and various forms of responsibility system linking remuneration to output with household contracts as the dominant factor have been instituted. Management rights over land, a means of production and a basic factor of production, have been given to peasants and the idea of land to the tiller has been realized. This is the greatest and most profound change in China's rural areas during the socialist construction period, and it is also the foundation of all other changes. This has enabled peasants to have the right to make decisions about land management and the right to handle most agricultural produce freely. This has given economic benefits to the peasants and has greatly aroused their enthusiasm for production. Land management rights, the right to freely handle one's own produce, and economic benefits are the essence of rural change. The second change is that we have gradually abolished the long- standing policy of a state monopoly in the purchase and marketing of agricultural produce. At present, with the exception of a few kinds of agricultural produce, such as cotton, cured tobacco, and silk cocoons, which are still under state monopoly, price restrictions on all other agricultural produce have been basically removed and prices are regulated by the market. Restrictions on the price of major agricultural produce, such as grains, edible oils, and meat have been removed across the country. The third change is that we have used the viewpoint of macro agriculture to guide agriculture. In developing planting, we have enthusiastically developed forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, and various kinds of sideline production. In the 1980's and even at the beginning of the 1990's, not just planting developed greatly: Forestry, animal husbandry, breeding, and various kinds of sideline production also developed very fast in China's rural areas. We have corrected the long-standing one-sided practice of taking grain as the key link and have used the viewpoint of macro agriculture and the viewpoint of the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries to guide agriculture. This is one of the main reasons why our rural economy has developed quite rapidly. The fourth important change is that in developing agriculture, we have energetically developed township-run industry and village-run industry and have encouraged peasants to enter the field of commodity circulation and to move toward nonagricultural production. I estimate that by the end of this year, the total income provided by township and town enterprises in China will exceed 2,500 billion yuan, and the number of peasants working in these enterprises will be about 110 million. Such a rapid development of township and town enterprises basically depends on accumulation by the collective economy and by the peasants, and the state has invested nothing in them, but has only assisted by granting some bank loans and implementing some preferential taxation policies. At present, we can say that the township and town enterprises have developed into a powerful support for the rural economy and have become an important part of the whole national economy. I think that they will soon constitute half of the entire national economy. Of China's 1.1 billion-strong population, peasants account for 800 million. What road should China take to realize modernization? The development of township and town enterprises has enabled us to view the hope of rural modernization. Since the birth of township and town enterprises, they have not enjoyed any preferential treatment from the planned economy, but have been guided by the market economy. Therefore, they have powerful vitality. The development of township and town enterprises has not only injected new vitality into the rural economy in China, but has also created rich experience for reforming state-owned enterprises. I think that if our state-owned enterprises can really master the operational mechanisms of township and town enterprises and can transplant such mechanisms for their own use, reform of our state-owned enterprises will make much greater progress and their economic results will also be greatly improved. In developing the rural economy, we have also encouraged the integration of planting and breeding with the industry of processing agricultural produce, the integration of agriculture and industry with commerce, and the integration of agriculture, science, technology, and education with the improvement of the quality of laborers. Of course, we have not yet done sufficient work in this respect, and such work should be carried out at a deeper level. However, we have made a good start. At the symposium, various specialists and scholars have put forward some issues which we should further resolve and should pay attention to in the reform and development of China's rural areas. I think they are very important and are also important issues which we should study and resolve in deepening reform in the future. For example, the issue of extending peasants' rights to use and manage land is an issue peasants are most concerned about. In the beginning, the contract period was usually limited to 15 years. Now that 15 years has passed, should we fix another time limit or should we state clearly that the land is being given to the peasants for their long-term management and use. I think this issue is worth studying. I think that if we state clearly that land is being given to the peasants for long-term management, the peasants will carry out intensive and meticulous farming and will pay even great attention to inputs to the land. This would also be an effective measure to curb the practice of some government departments of randomly occupying and misusing land. Another example is that after agricultural produce is regulated by the market, the issue of how to maintain steady growth in major agricultural produce is also very important. To resolve this issue, it may be necessary to adopt measures to protect producers and consumers in addition to providing the peasants in good time with relatively accurate information on market supply and demand. For example, after a bumper agricultural harvest, we should set a protective lower limit for prices of agricultural produce; and if output of agricultural produce decreases and market prices rise abruptly, the consumers should be given certain corresponding subsidies. I think that after practicing market regulation, it is necessary for us to study the adoption of similar measures. Another issue is the rising gap in incomes between urban and rural residents. This is also an important aspect affecting the peasants' enthusiasm for production. In the early and mid-1980's, the increase in peasants' incomes was fast, and the gap between urban and rural income was greatly reduced. However, by the end of the 1980's and the beginning of the 1990's, we can say that peasants' income was in a state of slow growth. After the gap between urban residents and rural residents had been reduced for some time, it became bigger again. If such a situation is short and temporary, we need not worry. However, if such a situation continues in this way, this would be dreadful and will become a factor of social instability. It is very important and necessary to appropriately raise agricultural produce prices, but this is not the only way. What is important is to readjust the structure of agricultural production and to optimize the product mix of agriculture. We call it the development of high-output, high-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture. The third measure is to raise labor productivity in agriculture. While energetically developing secondary and tertiary industries, we should, in localities where conditions are available, energetically promote land management on a considerably large scale, including household farms, collective farms, and state farms. Besides, I quite agree with the viewpoint put forward by various specialists. The most fundamental thing in resolving rural issues is to improve the quality of rural laborers and to raise the educational level of the peasants. I have been in charge of agriculture for a long period and have been to many localities. I have come to the conclusion that any village which is led by a person with a relatively low educational level or without much schooling is a relatively backward village, its economy develops slowly, and even the problem of food is not completely solved there; and any village which is led by an educated person, be he a person with a medium educational level, a middle school graduate, or an ex- serviceman who has been to other places and has wide experience, develops fast. This can be said to be a general law. Without energetically improving the cultural quality of the peasants, it will be very difficult to turn existing and practical science and technology into productive forces. Besides what I have mentioned, we have also put forward many other good suggestions, such as on the issue of environmental protection, the issue of population, and so on. We should seriously study all of them. I think that this international symposium is a great success and will play a positive role in promoting and deepening rural reform.
