On this occasion, we asked for an interview with him. In the beginning, we were interested in who had proposed him for this post and why he had accepted it. [Sabol] I believe that it is not important to know who proposed me for this position. They are people who considered this step thoroughly. Anyway, this is the way it was announced. My reaction is very simple. I do not want to be a member of any political party. Slovakia's interests are, and will be, the only politics I will be engaged in. [Modrocky] What has your predecessor left for you, and what are your work priorities? [Sabol] Your question is very suggestive, but my answer will be very simple. In the Army, we have to transform our individualist method of control into a systemic method of administration. Our priorities are to trust the people and to give them appropriate powers. On the other hand, we have to demand an energetic and active fulfillment of all of the tasks, including those that have been neglected in the past few months. [Modrocky] The appointment of a new manager is often linked to personnel changes. Are you going to replace some people? What qualities should your colleagues have? [Sabol] We must judge people not according to how others look at them but according to their work capabilities. I have a simple requirement. They must be active collaborators, full of initiative, who do not have to be "pushed to work" and who come up with their own ideas and proposals for solving problems that arise. If this is not the case, they have to realize that, as long as they, in their position, are unable to contribute to the solution of their tasks, they have to search for a job where they could assert themselves. [Modrocky] New Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis spoke about a certain tension between the Slovak Republic's Defense Ministry and the Slovak Republic's Army Command. It will certainly be in your interests to change this situation. [Sabol] I have to say that we, Mr. Kanis and I, are extremely interested in eliminating misunderstandings and tensions that really have existed between Bratislava and Trencin [seat of Army Command]. We want to clearly define the roles of the Slovak Defense Ministry and the Army Command. One is a political and the other a military body. We are not going to interfere in one another's jurisdiction. On the contrary, we will demand responsible and perfect fulfillment of the tasks. We will introduce systemic administration. Higher levels of administration will provide methodical help to lower levels. Moreover, lower levels of administration will be given more jurisdiction and will be raised to higher levels. [Modrocky] What should be the optimal relations between the minister, who is a politician, and the state secretary, who is a soldier? [Sabol] This problem is a very easy one. I am convinced that it is all right if the defense minister is a civilian, with clear military and political concepts. A soldier in the position of state secretary is a plus in that he is able to formulate essential principles regarding the development of the Army and its training, because he is a professional, and to help implement structural changes within the Army. I believe that, if the roles of the two men are understood in that way, their roles will become complementary, which will contribute to the solution of the problems that still have not been sorted out in the Army. [Modrocky] It is a known fact that you were involved in the arms industry. Will you continue to be active in that sphere? [Sabol] The Slovak economy certainly has to deal with problems linked to the production of arms systems and military technology. This is what Slovakia has inherited. In the world, this problem is quite clear-cut. On the other hand, it is quite clear that our arms production has to meet certain demands. It is true that the Slovak Republic Army is only a very small customer for the advanced arms industry in Slovakia. If the Army places orders for weapon systems and military technology only from time to time, we should not expect that the industry would produce them right away. This is why we have to harmonize and organize, as they do in advanced democratic countries, our exports and the innovation of technology in such a way as to allow the Army's weapons to be modernized and replaced in case of need. I also want to say that it is not possible for the Slovak arms industry to produce weapons on its previous scale. Today, we have to sort out two problems: first, the production of new systems after they are brought to a certain level of modernization, and second, the modernization of the systems that have already been manufactured in quite large amounts. They are scattered all over the world and are due to be modernized. Arms production has been stopped in Slovakia, but that has not stopped the military conflicts in the world, of course. We have discontinued production, but others have become richer as a consequence. I do not believe that Slovakia should surpass the world's framework and standards. Slovakia must have its place in the sun as regards this matter. We do not want more than we are entitled to. We want this society, Europe, and the entire world to conduct a healthy life. [Modrocky] In your view, what do the Defense Ministry and the Army Command need at present? [Sabol] The ministry has to change the style of its work. It must fulfill its legal obligations and meet the standards. The Army Command has to take over the jurisdiction of such a large body as the General Staff. I have to say that we do not have enough skilled experts. This means that we have to fulfill our tasks while simultaneously educating our people. [Modrocky] The Army lacks important laws. Do you expect that, in your position of state secretary, you will be able to repair this flaw? [Sabol] Yes. We are decided, the defense minister and I, to do our best for the laws to pass so that we might live in a law-abiding state that respects legal standards. Laws are very much needed and are important for the further development of the Army. This development will depend on the economy and foreign policy and on our image in Europe. We are prepared to do all we can to make the Army really respect all the laws that apply to it.
