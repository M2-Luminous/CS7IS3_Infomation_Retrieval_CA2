Atucha-I Nuclear Plant --Net power: 337 net megawatts. --Design: AECL (Canadian). --Located at Embalse Rio Tercero, 100 km southwest of the capital city of Cordoba. This plant's design allows the production of the cobalt-60 radioisotope as part of the process. This radioisotope is used in medicine, agriculture, industry, and the preservation of the environment. Argentina has 8 percent of the world market for this radioisotope, and since 1986 it has been exported to, among other countries, the United States, France, Belgium, Colombia, and other American countries. Atucha-II Nuclear Plant (Under Construction) --Power: 745 gross megawatts, 692 net megawatts. --Design: Siemens-KWU. --Work progress on 21 December 1993: 86.5 percent of the total work. --Personnel working in February 1994: 3,664 workers. In addition, the CNEA participates as an associate in the following enterprises: INVAP S.A. [Applied Research Institute], Nuclear Mendoza SE, ENLACE S.A., CONVAR S.A., ALTEC SE., FAE S.A., Coratec SE., and ENSI SE.
