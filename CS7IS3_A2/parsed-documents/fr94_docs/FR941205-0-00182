(1) All laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on a project insured under this part shall be paid not less than the wages prevailing in the locality in which the work was performed for the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics employed in construction of a similar character, as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 276a-276a-5), where the project meets all of the following conditions: (i) Advances for the project are insured under this part; (ii) The project involves new construction or substantial rehabilitation; and (iii) The project will contain 12 or more dwelling units. (2) Projects that do not meet these conditions are not subject to Davis-Bacon wage rates except to the extent required as a condition of other Federal assistance to the project. (b) Volunteers. The provisions of this section shall not apply to volunteers under the conditions set out in 24 CFR part 70. In applying part 70, insurance under this part shall be treated as a program for which there is a statutory exemption for volunteers. (c) Labor standards. Any contract, subcontract, or building loan agreement executed for a project subject to Davis-Bacon wage rates under paragraph (a) of this section shall comply with all labor standards and provisions of 29 CFR parts 1, 3 and 5 that would be applicable to a mortgage insurance program to which Davis-Bacon wage rates are made applicable by statute. (d) Advances. (1) No advance under a mortgage on a project subject to Davis-Bacon wage rates under paragraph (a) of this section shall be eligible for insurance under this part unless the HFA determines (in accordance with the Commissioner's administrative procedures) that the general contractor or any subcontractor or any firm, corporation, partnership or association in which the contractor or subcontractor has a substantial interest was not, on the date the contract or subcontract was executed, on the ineligible list established by the Comptroller General, pursuant 29 CFR 5.12, issued by the Secretary of Labor. (2) No advance under any mortgage on a project subject to Davis-Bacon wage rates under paragraph (a) of this section shall be insured under this part unless there is filed with the application for the advance, and no such mortgage shall be insured under this part unless there is filed with the HFA after completion of the construction or substantial rehabilitation, a certificate or certificates in the form required by the Commissioner, supported by such other information as the Commissioner may prescribe, certifying that the laborers and mechanics employed in the construction of the project involved have been paid not less than the wages determined by the Secretary of Labor to be prevailing in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. (e) Responsibility for enforcement and administration. The Commissioner retains responsibility for enforcement of labor standards under this section, but the Commissioner may delegate to the HFA information collection ( e.g., payroll review and routine interviews) and other routine administration and enforcement functions, subject to monitoring by the Commissioner. Where routine administration and enforcement functions are delegated to the HFA, the HFA shall bear financial responsibility for any deficiency in payment of prevailing wages or, where applicable under 29 CFR part 1, any increase in compensation to a contractor, that is attributable to any failure properly to carry out its delegated functions. For example, failure of an HFA to supply or ensure inclusion of the proper contract clauses or wage determination in a contract or building loan agreement may require the HFA to fund increased compensation to a contractor as the result of increased wages attributable to incorporation of the proper clauses and wage determination.
