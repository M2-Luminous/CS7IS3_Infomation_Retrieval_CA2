It will include the territories from the Murmansk region to Chukotka, Governor of the Murmansk region Yevgeniy Komarov said at a conference in Murmansk dedicated to protection of Russia's northern borders. He said that the border service in the Arctic region is being restructured, taking into account the development of large-scale ties between the Russian Federation, Norway and Finland, and the opening of the Northern sea route for passage of foreign vessels with stops in Russian ports. Besides, the need for the Northern border district is dictated by the increased interest of NATO in Russia's northern borders.
