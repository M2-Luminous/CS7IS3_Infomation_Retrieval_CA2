This came as a surprise move by [Israeli Prime Minister] Peres' deputy Yosi Beilin, intended as confirmation of Israel's condemnatory stance against the neofascist danger in Europe. The decision was made at the Israeli Foreign Ministry yesterday evening, following lengthy consultations, over a period of days with the Israeli Embassy in Rome. Another plenary meeting is planned at the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem for next week. It is being suggested that the complete freeze on relations may be lifted, and that the measure will only apply to AN [National Alliance] members. A first practical measure was already taken yesterday with the decision to cancel a cultural mission to Rome, which was scheduled for early next week. Israeli Foreign Ministry sources explained: "We did not wish our representatives to meet the new Cultural Heritage Minister Domenico Fisichella, who is a National Alliance member." The same sources added: "We had to choose between the logic of reasons of state, which leads us to greatly appreciate [Italian Foreign] Minister Martino's friendly statements concerning Israel, and our commitment to combat any kind of return to the totalitarian ideologies which developed in Europe in the first half of this century."
