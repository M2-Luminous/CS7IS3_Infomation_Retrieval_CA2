The French troops are said to have arrived at Yaounde airport base carrying light machine guns. The troops were deployed from the Central African Republic where they are stationed. Apart from this, a high-level French delegation of senior diplomats and military officials are also in Yaounde to hold discussions with Cameroon President Paul Biya and Cameroonian authorities. The delegation includes the head of African affairs in the French Foreign Ministry and President Francois Mitterand's personal military chief of staff, General Christian Quesnot. France has a defense pact with Cameroon. Foreign news correspondent Stephen Eshep was at the defense headquarters in Lagos for the reaction to the latest development. The Director of Defense Information Brigadier General Fred Chijuka said there was no cause for alarm and that the same French delegation now in Yaounde is expected in Nigeria within the week. [Begin Chijuka recording] I cannot say what is going to be the government reaction to what they are going to discuss, but I feel that everything is tending toward finding a peaceful solution to what the other side considers as our incursion into their territory whereas we are convinced that...[pauses] we are also considering it as our territory. Every day we have reports from that zone telling the defense headquarters what is happening and so on. What they have got this morning is that everywhere is calm so we will be there on the spot. And this is what they have told us. We have no reason to doubt it. So the general situation after that report is that the situation is very calm. [end recording] French officials are reported to have said that the paratroopers would not be deployed in Bakassi. But the (?interesting) aspect is that there is a French military presence in Cameroon. There are speculations that the military presence has to do with the protection of French interests and the oil-rich peninsula. Tension has been increasing in the peninsula since last December, when Cameroonian gendarmes attacked villagers in the Bakassi peninsula in an attempt to take over territory which historically belongs to Nigeria.
