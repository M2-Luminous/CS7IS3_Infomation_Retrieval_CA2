FBIS4-65578 "drweu097_o_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-097 Daily Report 18 May 1994 CYPRUS UN's Feissel, Denktas Meet 18 May UN's Feissel, Denktas Meet 18 May Denktas Comments on Progress NC1805204894 Nicosia BRTK Television Network in Turkish 1630 GMT 18 May 94 NC1805204894 Nicosia BRTK Television Network Turkish BFN [Excerpts] President Denktas received Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special representative, in connection with the talks that have been held in Vienna. [passage omitted] In a statement to journalists after the meeting, Denktas said: [Begin Denktas recording] Although Feissel attached importance to the matters we insist on, he maintained that we should agree to the map. Regarding the access road to Maras [Varosha], they agreed that we should have authority over that road. However, they took the approach that we should reach an agreement with the United Nations to enable the UN officials to control it. In that case, we would be able to stand around it, etc. Meanwhile, a partial withdrawal of troops from that area is being discussed. They have confirmed that the Nicosia International Airport [NIA] will have two gates for entry and exit. Nevertheless, we have not been furnished with a map of the airport thus far. Consequently, we have not been given enough help to be able to consider the matter as a whole. We are worried that the Greek Cypriots may seek a court decision to close down the airport because of the noise it will make. Statements have been published in the Greek Cypriot newspapers on that matter. They say that they will consult their legal advisers and note that they will be able to obstruct the operation of the airport. Regarding the use of the NIA by the Greek Cypriot airline, they have agreed that the Turkish Cypriot airline should also use that airport under equal conditions. It seems that they also agree that Turkish Cypriot passenger aircraft using that airport should be allowed carry their logo. Yes, a certain degree of progress has been made. However, the problems have not been resolved. We must have authority to resolve those problems. We shall hold talks with the Government and quickly take the matter to the Republican Assembly. They have said that we do not have much time. They may be right. We have informed them that we are prepared to convene the Council of Ministers and the Republican Assembly even during the religious holidays. [end recording] A correspondent recalled the proposal to open simultaneously Maras and the NIA. Denktas replied: [Begin Denktas recording] A certain degree of progress has been made on that matter. They have made a proposal that is close to the one we made some time ago. However, they have not agreed to our proposal as it stands. They have proposed that that the Greek Cypriots get access to the northern part of Dhimokratias Avenue after our direct flights from the NIA begin. That area will be placed under UN control, but the Greek Cypriots will have access to it when our direct flights take off from the NIA and when the routes our aircraft will fly are established. They are trying to work out the simultaneous use of Maras and the NIA. We also have to consider our passports. When we say we shall fly with our own passports, it means that we shall be issued a visa on a piece of paper. That is the system that is now applied when Turkish Cypriots wish to travel to Britain and the United States. However, we still retain our passports. Russia was the country that opposed that most. We have not been able to understand Russia's approach. That country is an important UN Security Council member. We hoped that Russia too would agree to the UN Security Council's decision, but Russia reportedly is opposed to the idea for the time being. Let us wait and see whether it will change its mind. [end recording] Another journalist asked Denktas whether or not the UN secretary general's report will be delayed or an interim report submitted. Denktas replied as follows: [Begin Denktas recoding] I do not know. However, I tried to explain to Mr. Feissel today that there were matters that should have been discussed. We have held talks on them in Vienna, which means that not everything was discussed in detail in the past. That is why we had to meet in Vienna. An effort was made to have Robert Lamb and Gustave Feissel agree on various issues. Lamb agreed on various points, but the UN officials objected to them. Talks were held in goodwill. They have put a kind of pressure on us by saying that the UN secretary general's report is ready and the UN secretary general is about to sign it. However, they have failed to clarify various issues even at the present time. They have not submitted the map of the NIA. The agreement about having two gates at the airport was clearly confirmed only today. We were informed that the map will depict the two gates. All that means that there is still work to be done. Nevertheless, they still maintain the approach that all these are details and ask us whether or not we accept the map and to place the access road to Maras under their juristiction. They caution us that the UN secretary general's report will be reflect our approach if we object. They wish to place the matter in their own preferred framework. What is important, however, is the agreement that will be reached between the two sides. [end recording]
