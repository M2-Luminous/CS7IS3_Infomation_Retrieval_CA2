He estimates that the about 30 deputies of the Bloc of the Socialist Party and Edinstvo Unity Movement represent interests of another state. Darie thinks that results of the voting have been influenced by the anticipate voting of the Transdniestrian people and by the opening of additional voting sections, against terms provided by law, in regions mostly inhabited with Gagauzians. "Now impertinence will be ruling. Serious strikes will first of all be applied to the Ministry of Education, especially concerning the teaching of history and Romanian language," said Darie.
