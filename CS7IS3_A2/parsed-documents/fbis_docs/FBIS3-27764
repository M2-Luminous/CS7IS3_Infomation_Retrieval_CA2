Han said on Sunday, however, he did not know the exact status of Kim Chong-hwi, former senior secretary for Foreign and National Security Affairs to President No Tae-u, in the United States. Kim, wanted in South Korea on suspicion of accepting bribes in connection with the Yulgok military buildup program, was reported to have applied for permanent U.S. residency. Han made the remark to reporters at Kimpo International Airport Sunday after he arrived from Washington to attend a conference of heads of diplomatic missions. With regard to the North Korean nuclear problem Han said the issue will have to be referred to the U.N. Security Council if North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) fail to reach any agreement on IAEA inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities by Feb. 21. Korean Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae, who also arrived for the conference on Sunday, said that the Seoul government has informed North Korea through China that Pyongyang has to allow IAEA inspection by Feb. 21 when the IAEA convenes a meeting of Board of Directors in Vienna. "I have been meeting responsible Chinese officials from time to time to discuss problems aimed at resolving the North Korean nuclear problem," Hwang added. On the planned visit to China by President Kim Yong-sam, Hwang said the date is tentatively set for late March and preparations for it are progressing smoothly, Hwang said. Since President Kim is going to visit China as a state guest, he will be meeting his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin and other top Chinese leaders, he said. Commenting on the establishment of air routes to China, Hwang said the two countries will first set up a regular air route between Seoul and Beijing before starting to negotiate for an air route between Seoul and Shanghai. Hwang said he hoped the air route question will be resolved by the time President Kim visits China.
