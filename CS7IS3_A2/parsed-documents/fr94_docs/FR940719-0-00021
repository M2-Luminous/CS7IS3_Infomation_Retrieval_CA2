FR940719-0-00021 FR940719-0-00006 DEA received 26 comments on the proposed rule. Of these, seven support the proposed rule as written and 19 support the proposed rule with clarification or minor change. Commentors expressed concern in the following general areas. Seven comments were concerned with the problem of allowing the facsimile prescription to be dispensed only by a ``consulting'' pharmacy as proposed in 21 CFR 1306.11(f) and suggested that other categories of pharmacies also be allowed to dispense controlled substances based upon facsimile prescriptions. Six submitted alternatives: (1) Consulting or provider pharmacy, (2) provider pharmacy, (3) dispensing or provider pharmacy, (4) pharmacy with which the facility has a contract or agreement, (5) pharmacy dispensing medications to the facility and (6) providing pharmacy. DEA has changed ``consulting'' pharmacy to ``dispensing'' pharmacy in the final rule. It was found that many facilities utilize more than one pharmacy on a regular basis. Although some state laws require that each facility must have a consultant pharmacist, the individual may not be affiliated with the pharmacy actually dispensing medications. Restricting the process to consulting pharmacies would not facilitate the process for those facilities whose dispensing pharmacy and consulting pharmacy are different. DEA received three comments on the definition of LTCF. One commentor suggested including facilities such as nursing homes or facilities, residential care facilities and mental and correctional institutions in the definition. Another commentor suggested including the term ``or hospice setting''. The third commentor suggested including skilled nursing homes, personal care homes and adult care facilities as closed system environments in the definition. DEA maintains that the existing definition of lTCF, currently found in 21 CFR 1306.02(e), adequately addresses the facilities that should be included. The definition includes a nursing home, retirement care, mental care or other facility or institution which provides extended health care to resident patients. One commentor pointed out a lack of consistency concerning the use of the terms physician, practitioner, prescriber, and prescribing practitioner throughout the proposed rule. It was further suggested that DEA standardize or clarify the term prescribing practitioner by mentioning physicians and mid-level practitioners. DEA acknowledges the inconsistency. The term practitioner will be used in the final rule. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), DEA registers practitioners which includes Mid-Level Practitioners (MLPs) if the applicant is authorized to dispense controlled substances by the state in which he/she practices. No further clarification is warranted. This term is defined in 21 U.S.C. 802(21) and 21 CFR 1304.02 (d) and is consistently used throughout the statutes and regulations of Title 21 of the Controlled Substances Act. Two commentors suggest adding information on the prescription prior to faxing such as: ``faxed to'' to void the prescription for reuse. This was considered prior to publishing the proposed rule. While DEA agrees with and encourages this practice as a deterrent to sending the same document several times, the ease of getting around the requirement does not justify its addition to the rule. If such information were required but was not transmitted in the facsimile, the dispensing pharmacist would be forced to seek the information before dispensing the controlled substance, thus adding delay to the process, which is contrary to the intent of the regulation. Four comments concern the Schedule II restriction of only allowing oral prescription under emergency situations pursuant to the conditions set forth in 21 CFR 1306.11(d). Two commentors state that no schedule II's should be faxed. Two commentors disagree with the Schedule II restriction, one of these two commentors suggests that the prescription could be delivered within 5 days after the faxed original.
