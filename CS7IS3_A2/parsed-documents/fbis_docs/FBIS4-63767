This time the attack has been made by representatives of the shipbuilding sector, to be precise the "Baltiyskiy Zavod" from St. Petersburg. The day before the plant trade union committee sent a telegram to Premier V. Chernomyrdin which said: "Your instructions to extinguish debts for work carried out on the construction of the nuclear-powered icebreaker Ural over 1993 and the first quarter of this year are being ignored by the ministries of finances and transport. The government's inaction is making it impossible to continue the building of two nuclear-powered ships -- the icebreaker Ural and the cruiser Petr Velikiy. If your promises and directives are not binding for ministers, then it is time you retired." "The situation at the plant is critical," says trade union committee chairman Vyacheslav Firyulin. "The halting of the building of these ships will not only affect our collective. The state will also incur enormous losses." Of course, the "Baltiyskiy Zavod" collective's recommendation is not compulsory for the head of government. But it is scarcely sensible to dismiss SOS signals.
