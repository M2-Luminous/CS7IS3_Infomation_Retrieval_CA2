The visit was scheduled for today to discuss the results of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Tunis and his meeting with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat last night. The visit has been postponed despite the PLO's approval for receiving Ross today in accordance with a proposal by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in his message to 'Arafat yesterday. Under the proposal, Ross was scheduled to visit Tunis and Israel today and tomorrow as part of the ongoing efforts to bring the PLO back to the peace talks. The same sources pointed out that perhaps Washington is worried about Kozyrev's visit to Tunis and his meeting with 'Arafat, which were made as part of a unilateral Russian initiative without coordination with the United States.
