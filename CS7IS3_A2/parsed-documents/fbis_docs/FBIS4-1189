Merton and N. Lewis] [Text] Johannesburg April 23 SAPA -- A stand-off between African National Congress supporters holed up in the Ulundi police station, KwaZulu, and Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] members gathered outside the premises seemed to have ended on Saturday [23 April] evening following the intervention of IFP leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The ANC supporters and Independent Electoral Commission monitors sought sanctuary at the police station earlier on Saturday after two people were killed and two vehicles torched in clashes between the ANC members and IFP supporters in downtown Ulundi. At least five other members of the ANC contingent, canvassing political support in the northern Natal town -- where the IFP has its headquarters -- are still missing. ANC lawyer John Wills told SAPA that six ANC members and four IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] monitors were in the police cells "in protective custody", awaiting the arrival of armoured-plated vehicles to transport them out of the area. He said at least 200 IFP supporters were gathered outside the police station. "The ANC and IEC members have been holed up in the station for the past four or five hours. The situation is really tense, but the crowd outside is dispersing now," he said from the Ulundi police station at about 7.10PM on Saturday. Chief Buthelezi cut short an [Orange] Free State election roadshow on Saturday and rushed back to Ulundi on hearing of the news of the fighting in Ulundi. He arrived at the police station shortly before 7PM to resolve the stand-off. Clashes erupted in the KwaZulu capital on Saturday afternoon after an ANC convoy entered the town to distribute election literature and canvass political support. The IFP claimed the ANC members attacked its supporters after they refused to accept ANC pamphlets, but this was strongly denied by the ANC in Johannesburg.
