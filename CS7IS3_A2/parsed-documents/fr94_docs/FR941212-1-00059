FR941212-1-00059 FR941212-1-00016 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AC85 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Rule to List the Cactus Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl as Endangered With Critical Habitat in Arizona and Threatened in Texas AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 12-month finding on a petition to list the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl ( Glaucidium brasilianum cactorum ) as endangered under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The Service finds that the petitioned action is warranted and proposes to list the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl as endangered in Arizona, and as threatened in Texas. Listing is not warranted at this time in its range in Mexico. The former breeding range of this bird extended from south-central Arizona south through western Mexico, and from southern Texas south through northeastern Mexico. Within these regions, the species occurs in riverbottom woodlands, coastal plain oak associations, thornscrub, and desertscrub associations.The cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl is threatened to varying degrees across its range by loss and modification of habitat, lack of adequate protective regulations, and other factors. This proposal, if made final, would implement Federal protection provided by the Act for the cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl in the United States. Critical habitat is being proposed in Arizona. DATES: Comments from all interested parties must be received by April 11, 1995: Public hearing requests must be received by February 27, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments and materials concerning this proposal should be sent to the State Supervisor, Arizona Ecological Services State Office, Fish and Wildlife Service, 3616 West Thomas Road, Suite 6, Phoenix, Arizona 85019. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert M. Marshall, at the above address (Telephone 602/379&hyph;4720). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl is a small bird, approximately 17 centimeters (63/4 inches) long. Males average 62 grams (g) [2.2 ounces (oz)], females average 75 g (2.6 oz). It is reddish-brown overall, with a cream-colored belly streaked with reddish-brown. Some individuals are grayish, rather than reddish-brown. The eyes are yellow, the crown is lightly streaked, and there are no ear tufts. Paired black-and-white spots on the nape suggests eyes. The tail is relatively long for an owl, colored rufous with dark bars. The call of the diurnal owl, heard chiefly near dawn and dusk, is a monotonous series of short notes.
