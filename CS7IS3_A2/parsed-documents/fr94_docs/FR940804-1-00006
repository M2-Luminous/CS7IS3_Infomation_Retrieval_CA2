FR940804-1-00006 FR940804-1-00002 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 12 CFR Part 225 [Regulation Y; Docket No. R&hyph;0843] Revisions Regarding Tying Restrictions AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Board is seeking public comment on a proposed amendment to the anti-tying provisions of Regulation Y. The proposed amendment would permit a bank holding company or its nonbank subsidiary to discount any of its products or services on condition that a customer obtain another product or service from that company or subsidiary or from any of its nonbank affiliates, provided that all products offered in the package arrangement are separately available for purchase. This exception would not apply when any product in the arrangement is offered by a bank. The board believes that this will increase the efficiency with which banking organizations can deliver banking services. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before September 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0843, and may be mailed to William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20551.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1972) generally prohibits a bank from tying a product or service to another product or service offered by the bank or by any of its affiliates. 1 In 1971, the Board applied these tying restrictions to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries as if they were banks. 12 CFR 225.4(d)(1); 36 FR 10777, 10778 (1971). 1 A prohibited tie-in occurs if a bank: (1) varies the consideration for a product or service (the ``tying product'') on the condition that the customer obtain some additional product or service (the ``tied product'') from the bank or from any of its affiliates; or (2) as a condition for providing a customer a product or service, requires the customer to purchase another product or service from the bank or from any of its affiliates. On March 11, 1994, the Board requested public comment on proposed amendments to Regulation Y, including an extension of the so-called traditional bank product exception of section 106 to package arrangements with affiliates. 59 FR 12202 (March 16, 1994). In addition to comments on the proposed rule, which is being made final in a separate document published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register , the Board received various requests for interpretation or extension of regulatory exceptions to the tying restrictions imposed by section 106 and Regulation Y. In particular, commenters urged the Board to reconsider its extension of the tying restrictions of section 106 to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. Proposed Amendments After considering those requests, the Board has decided to propose an amendment to its anti-tying regulation to conform it more closely to section 106 and its focus on tying by banks. Under the proposed rule, bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries would be permitted to offer discounts on packaged products when: (1) Both the tying and tied products 2 are offered by bank holding companies or their nonbanking subsidiaries_in other words, where no affiliated bank is involved in the arrangement; and (2) both the tying and tied products are separately available. 3 In cases that do not qualify for this (or some other) exception, the general restrictions of section 106 and Regulation Y would continue to apply; for example, if the package arrangement involved a product offered by an affiliated bank, the exception would not apply and the nonbanking subsidiary could only offer discount package arrangements involving exclusively traditional bank products or securities brokerage services, under exceptions recently adopted by the Board and to take effect in thirty days. The antitrust laws also would continue to apply in all cases. 2 The ``tying'' product is the product whose consideration is being varied or whose availability is being conditioned. The ``tied'' product is the product that must be purchased in order to receive a discount on the tying product or become eligible to purchase the tying product. 3 The Board recognizes that requiring the products to be separately available effectively requires that the exception be limited to discounting, and vice versa, but is proposing both conditions in order to avoid any ambiguity.
