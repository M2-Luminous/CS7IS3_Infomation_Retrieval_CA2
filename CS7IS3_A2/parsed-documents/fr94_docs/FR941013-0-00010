Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent damage to the aircraft resulting from engine debris following a low pressure turbine (LPT) blade or shaft failure, accomplish the following: (a) For engines that do not contain fan exhaust inner front duct segment assemblies that are installed in accordance with PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 6039, Revision 3, dated October 15, 1993, or earlier revisions of PW ASB No. 6039, and either PW honeycomb third stage outer airseal Part Number (P/N) 801931, 802097, 797594, or 798279; or Pyromet Industries, Inc., honeycomb third stage outer airseal P/N PI9336; or McClain International, Inc., honeycomb third stage outer airseal P/N M2433; or a turbine case shield assembly installed in accordance with PW ASB No. 6039, Revision 3, dated October 15, 1993, or earlier revisions of PW ASB No. 6039; or a third stage blade set that has third stage turbine blades that were installed in accordance with PW SB No. 5331, dated October 27, 1982, accomplish the following: (1) Conduct initial and repetitive inspections on installed third and fourth stage LPT blade sets, and remove and replace with serviceable blade sets, as necessary, in accordance with Part 1 of the Accomplishment Instructions of PW ASB No. A5913, Revision 6, dated October 15, 1993; or PW ASB No. 5913, Revision 5, dated August 10, 1992; or PW ASB No. 5913, Revision 4, dated February 20, 1992, as follows: (i) Initially inspect the blade shroud crossnotches of the third stage LPT blade set when specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) or (a)(1)(i)(B) of this AD, whichever occurs later. Engines that contain a third stage blade set that have third stage turbine blades that were installed per the requirements specified in PW Service Bulletin No. 5331, dated October 27, 1982, do not require the third stage blade set inspection. (A) Inspect within 6,000 cycles or 6,000 hours time in service, whichever occurs first, since new, since the last blade shroud crossnotch inspection specified in Section 72&hyph;53&hyph;12 of PW JT8D Engine Manual P/N 481672, or since last blade shroud crossnotch repair that was accomplished per the requirements specified in Section 72&hyph;53&hyph;12 of PW JT8D Engine Manual P/N 481672; or (B) Inspect within 1,000 cycles or 1,000 hours time in service, whichever occurs first, after the effective date of this AD. (ii) Initially inspect the blade shroud crossnotches of the fourth stage LPT blade set when specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) or (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this AD, whichever occurs later. Engines that contain fan exhaust inner front duct segment assemblies that were installed per the requirements of PW ASB No. 6039, Revision 3, dated October 15, 1993, or earlier revisions of PW ASB No. 6039, do not require the fourth stage blade set inspection. (A) Inspect within 6,000 cycles or 6,000 hours time in service, whichever occurs first, since new, since the last blade shroud crossnotch inspection specified in Section 72&hyph;53&hyph;13 of PW JT8D Engine Manual P/N 481672, or since last blade shroud crossnotch repair that was accomplished per the requirements specified in Section 72&hyph;53&hyph;13 of PW JT8D Engine Manual P/N 481672; or (B) Inspect within 1,000 cycles or 1,000 hours time in service, whichever occurs first, after the effective date of this AD. (iii) Thereafter, inspect the third and fourth stage LPT blade sets in accordance with the procedures and intervals specified in PW ASB No. A5913, Revision 6, dated October 15, 1993; (2) At the next shop visit after the effective date of this AD; but not later than December 31, 1999, 8,000 hours time in service after the effective date of this AD, or 7,000 cycles after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs latest, install the improved inner front fan exhaust duct and associated hardware in accordance with Part A of the Accomplishment Instructions of PW ASB No. A6110, Revision 1, dated October 15, 1993. (3) At the next access to the third stage turbine air sealing ring after the effective date of this AD, but not later than December 31, 1999, 8,000 hours time in service after the effective date of this AD, or 7,000 cycles after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs latest, install the improved third stage turbine air sealing ring and associated hardware in accordance with Part B of the Accomplishment Instructions of PW ASB No. A6110, Revision 1, dated October 15, 1993.
