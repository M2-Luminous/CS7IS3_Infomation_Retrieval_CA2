In an exclusive interview with the MENA correspondent in Ankara dealing with his visit to Egypt, which will begin tomorrow, Saturday [7 May], the Turkish president said that the resources of Egypt and Turkey could together contribute to establishing peace and stability in the Middle East. Demirel added that he agreed with President Mubarak to eliminate all barriers and protocols and to meet at any time. They also agreed to stay in continuous contact to negotiate various bilateral and international issues of mutual interest. President Demirel said that both he and President Mubarak realize their important responsibilities since Egypt and Turkey have so much influence on the course of events in the Middle East and can preserve security and stability in the region. He added that if Egypt is considered a gateway to Africa, Turkey is considered a gateway to the Islamic republics in Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Europe. In his speech, Demirel praised President Husni Mubarak's wisdom in overcoming the problem that emerged during the ceremony held in Cairo on Wednesday to sign the Israeli-PLO Agreement. He clarified that he telephoned President Mubarak to congratulate him on his wisdom, which saved the agreement from collapse before it even started. President Demirel said that we consider the agreement signed by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo an important step in establishing peace. We believe it will pave the way for and open the door to the aspired for peace. The Turkish president said in his interview with the MENA correspondent in Ankara that when peace is established in the Middle East we can then benefit from the large potential in the region. Demirel added that after the former Soviet Union collapsed, the independent Islamic republics emerged, which Egypt and Turkey are cooperating with in various social, cultural, and economic fields to serve them. Answering a question on the Egyptian-Turkish-Saudi economic cooperation, Demirel said that the Israeli-PLO agreement, which was signed on Wednesday in Cairo, will make it easy to realize this cooperation. In this regard, he affirmed that Egypt and Turkey have very good relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. On the Turkish role in the Middle East peace process, President Demirel said that Turkey has very good relations with Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel. He added that relations with Israel were limited until Egypt and Israel signed the peace treaty that opened the door to Turkey to develop relations with Israel. The Turkish president said that contacts between his country and Israel continue. He pointed out that it is possible during the coming stage to establish peace agreements between Israel and Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. On the Turkish stance regarding the idea of a Middle East common market, President Demirel said that he believes such a market can be established in time. However, he noted that a common market requires certain developments in the region, such as the return of Iraq to the international community. He said that Iraq's return to the international community is not Turkey's idea alone, but that some leaders of Islamic countries share it. Demirel affirmed that Iraq's return to the international community as soon as possible could open the opportunity of launching the concept of the Middle Eastern market. However, he said that he does not know how Iraq's return should be handled. On the international sanctions imposed on Iraq, the Turkish president said these sanctions have not affected the Iraqi Government or Iraqi President Saddam Husayn but the Iraqi people, who are suffering from the shortage of their basic needs of medicine and food. He added that Turkey has also suffered as a result of these sanctions, noting that its losses since the outbreak of the Gulf War have reached approximately $20 billion. Asked about the differences between Ankara and Washington over the repair of the Iraqi oil pipeline passing through Turkey, President Demirel said his country is losing approximately $4 billion annually as a result of the closure of this pipeline. For this reason Turkey calls for the economic blockade of Iraq to be lifted as a way of overcoming Turkey's economic problems. He explained that the nonuse of the Iraqi pipeline for an extended amount of time will damage it. He said he is confident that in the next few days officials in Washington will realize the need for carrying out maintenance work on this pipeline. Regarding the water problem, President Demirel explained that the Euphrates River also passes through Syria and Iraq. He said Turkey is building 12 dams on the river to regulate its water flow. He said his country has not yet begun the full exploitation of these waters for generating electricity or for agriculture. He said he hopes that Turkey will begin exploiting these waters for generating electricity after these dams are completed. He stressed that Turkey has no intention of depriving neighboring countries of water. Regarding the differences between Turkey and Greece, Demirel accused Greece of providing shelter for the supporters of the banned Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK]. He said Turkey does not object to a solution of the Cyprus problem provided it is not an imposed solution. This is because there are at least 150,000 Muslim citizens in the Turkish sector of Cyprus while the Greek community lives in the other sector. He added that an imposed solution on either party will not be permanent and comprehensive. Therefore, there is a need for dialogue. Regarding the political solution proposed by some European countries for the problem in southeast Turkey, President Demirel condemned all acts of terrorism, describing them as a human crime abhorred by religion and society. He said Turkey cannot hold a dialogue with a terrorist band or organization that kills innocent civilians. He added that no political solution can be reached with a terrorist organization under any pressure because the PKK uses terrorism. He said we will not negotiate with terrorists and will not compromise on Turkey's territorial unity. On Turkey's role in solving the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem, Demirel said Turkey has offered all it can in terms of aid and contacts with Bosnian officials to reach a solution to this crisis. On the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Demirel said Armenia continually commits aggression on Azerbaijani territory. He called for a halt to these aggressive acts. He added that Turkey gives every kind of aid to Azerbaijan to repulse these attacks.
