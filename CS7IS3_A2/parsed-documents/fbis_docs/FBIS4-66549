Not only because Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav will go through a real test of fire, but also because of the rumors floating around that the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] will run film star and BJP member Shatrughna Sinha for the position of chief minister. If true, the next election definitely will be very interesting. The central BJP leadership has belatedly learned the fact that the popularity of a Bihari Babu can be cashed in on only in Bihar. He was embarrassed when he ran against Rajesh Khanna for the New Delhi Lok Sabha seat. Despite numerous efforts by Tarakant Jha and the present state party president, Kailashpati Misra, the BJP could not achieve the position in that state that it should have. Yes, the BJP is in good position in the southern part of the state because of businessmen and industrialists there. However, because of the activities of some extremists and the Naxalites, the political atmosphere here is not as favorable to the BJP as it was in the past. Lalu Prasad organized an tribal conference in Patna recently to take the initiative in attracting their vote bank. According to some sources, Lalu had promised the tribals all kind of support from the Janata Dal. It means that the Janata Dal can also win a good number of seats in southern Bihar this time. Thus, southern Bihar will not be easy to win for the BJP. Political observers believe that Lalu is also expected to benefit from the breach in the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha [JMM]. Most of the BJP members elected to the vidhan sabha are from southern Bihar. Meanwhile, the BJP got a major jolt when Inder Singh Namdhari, who was considered one of its strong pillars, left the party and formed a new party of his own. Later, Namdhari joined the Janata Dal. The Janata Dal made a crack in a BJP known for its unity. However, one of its candidates did win the election for a Rajya Sabha seat. This is a good omen, but cannot be called a solid base. Major efforts were made to strengthen the BJP in this state last year. The right atmosphere was created by the rathyatra [procession]. Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh, and other major leaders had attracted huge crowds and made speeches to get support for the BJP. It is noteworthy that huge crowds had attended these meetings. It seemed at that time that the BJP would succeed in forming the government in Bihar. However, Bihar, notorious for caste-related politics, has taken the wind out of the BJP sail here. Although Tarakant Jha was replaced with Kailashpati Misra as president of the state BJP, the BJP still could not get additional support in Bihar. Now that the politics here are being made more caste-based by calling for rallies of various caste groups, what will the BJP do? Is it finding itself helpless or is it planning a new strategy? While reviewing answers to such questions, it was learned that movie star Shatrughna Sinha would be especially useful in Bihar. That is why when the question of appointing a new member to the BJP working committee came up, Lal Krishna Advani's favorite man Yashwant Sinha, who had deserted the Samajwadi Janata Party and joined the BJP, was considered to be the front runner. However, Murli Manohar Joshi insisted on appointing Sinha to this position. Sinha thus was given an honorable position in the party by making him a member of the working committee. It can be easily assumed that he will be asked to play a major role in Bihar's politics. The BJP knows that if there is anyone who can make the party strong in this state then it is Shatrughna Sinha. There are solid reasons behind this line of thought. The first reason is that only Sinha can counter the popularity that Lalu Prasad has gained in this state. He is popular in the whole state. That fact that his popularity is mostly because of the his movie star glamour rather than of his political involvement is a separate issue. The truth is that Shatrughna Sinha is a heavy weight compared to Lalu Prasad when it comes to attracting crowds. Second, the caste issue is so prevalent in the state that the next government should be that of the Janata Dal. Lalu's image is mostly that of a Dalit leader. Sinha has established himself among all the caste and religious groups as a movie star. If the BJP announced that Shatrughna Sinha will be the chief minister in a BJP government, the BJP would definitely win the next election. If the BJP gives more publicity to Kailashpati Misra or Tarakant Jha, it will suffer on two fronts. First, both are Brahmans and it will not take much time to establish a negative environment for them in this caste-oriented state. Second, neither of these leaders have access to the rural population of the state. Well-educated persons also do not know them very well. The same is not true of Sinha. Although the Biharis' craze for him is related to movies, the people are aware of his political savvy from some of his public meetings. Anyhow, Shatrughna Sinha is seeing a green flag from the BJP high command and has decided to join Bihari politics. In a recent public meeting in Buxar, he had said that the caste-related mentality in Bihar is a way of life there, but the people have also learned that the reason for their backwardness is the caste system. At the same time, Sinha encouraged regional politics by asking the people to say "we are Biharis" in the same tune as they say "we are Indians." This makes it possible that the people will be attracted to him.
