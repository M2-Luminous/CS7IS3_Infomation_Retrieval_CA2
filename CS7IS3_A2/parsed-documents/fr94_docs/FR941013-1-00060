FR941013-1-00060 FR941013-1-00010 Each closed-vent system would be required to operate with no detectable emissions (as determined by procedures specified under the rule). For the proposed rule, any control device could be used that reduces the mass content of either total organic compounds (less methane and ethane) or total HAP in the gases vented to the device by 95 percent by weight or greater. An owner or operator would be allowed to comply with alternative performance requirements for enclosed combustion devices (e.g., thermal vapor incinerators, catalytic vapor incinerators, boilers, and process heaters) and for flares. 10. Test Methods and Compliance Procedures For affected units using air emission controls in accordance with the rule requirements, no regulated material determination would be required under the proposed rule. An owner or operator would be required to determine the VOHAP concentration or organic HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material being managed in the unit not using air emission controls in accordance with the requirements of the standards. Either analysis of regulated material samples using procedures specified in the rule or the owner's or operator's knowledge of the regulated material could be used could be used for a regulated material determination. The owner or operator would determine that covers and closed-vent system operates with no detectable emissions by visual inspection and testing the equipment in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 under 40 CFR 60 appendix A. Test procedures for control devices would be consistent with procedures specified in existing NESHAP. 11. Monitoring and Inspection Requirements To ensure that the air emission control equipment is properly operated and maintained, the proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would require that the owner or operator periodically inspect and monitor this equipment. Visual inspections and leak detection monitoring using Method 21 would be required for certain types of covers to ensure gaskets and seals are in good condition, and for closed-vent systems to ensure all fittings remain leak-tight. In general, semi-annual inspection and leak detection monitoring of covers is proposed. Annual inspection and leak detection monitoring would be required for closed-vent systems. Continuous monitoring of control device operation would be required under the proposed rule. This would involve the use of automated instrumentation to measure and record appropriate control device operating parameters that indicate whether the control device is in compliance with the applicable performance requirements of the rule. A more detailed explanation of these proposed monitoring requirements for control devices is presented in section V.E.1 of this notice. In cases when an owner or operator complies with the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP by treating a regulated material to remove or destroy HAP before placing the regulated material in a unit, the EPA is proposing that the owner or operator monitor appropriate operating parameters for the treatment process as described in section V.E.2 of this notice. 12. Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements The proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would require that the owner or operator to maintain certain records and submit to the EPA certain reports consistent with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for all NESHAP as specified in the Part 63 general provisions (40 CFR 63 subpart A). B. Summary of Rule Impacts Implementation of the proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would result in substantial reductions in organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere from off-site waste and recovery operations located in the United States. Furthermore, many of the organic HAP emitted from the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are also volatile organic compounds (VOC). These VOC react photochemically with other chemical compounds in the atmosphere to form ozone. Although the NESHAP proposed today would not specifically require control of VOC emissions from off-site waste and recovery operations, the organic emission control technologies upon which today's rulemaking is based would also significantly reduce VOC emissions from the source category. The EPA estimates that implementation of the proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would reduce nationwide organic HAP emissions by approximately 43,000 Mg/yr and reduce nationwide VOC emissions by approximately 52,000 Mg/yr.
