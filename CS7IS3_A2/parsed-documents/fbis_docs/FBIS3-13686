Ayatollah Khomeyni was the first to oppose this day being marked by the Zoroastrian sect, on the grounds that it is part of idolatrous rituals that conflict with Islam. Although the regime failed to prevent all citizens from marking the occasion by igniting fires in public places and the yards of houses, it maintained the ban without displaying great enthusiasm for its implementation. But this year Ayatollah Khamene'i, spiritual guide of the Islamic Republic, issued orders to put security forces on alert and deploy them in all major cities, especially Tehran, "to eliminate from the streets any signs of the atheists' celebrations." According to the report, the clashes between security forces and demonstrators, the majority of whom were young men, began after midday the day before yesterday and continued until late at night. Eleven people, among them one policeman, were killed and 530 wounded, among them 180 security men. And 2,598 were arrested, many of whom were released after interrogation. Religious authorities imposed a media blackout on the clashes, but sources close to security forces and the Information Ministry described the clashes as "unprecedented and organized." Opposition sources in Iran have confirmed the occurrence of the clashes. A report released by the Iranian National Party, one of the oldest secular political organizations in the country, said that "street battles broke out between citizens and security forces in Tehran and the neighborhoods of Akbatan, Ghisha, Aryashahr, and Shahrak Gharb..., and security forces opened fire and used tear gas."
