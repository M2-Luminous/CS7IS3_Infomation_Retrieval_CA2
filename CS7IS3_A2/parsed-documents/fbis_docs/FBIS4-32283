Finance Minister Florin Georgescu in agreement with Dan Martian, the leader of the ruling Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] parliamentary group, objected to the stipulation by law of the percentage allotted to education and sustained instead the amendment proposed by Dan Martian, which only spells that the real growth of the GDP ratio apportioned to education is compulsory, without specifying it. The 1994 state budget law earmarked 2.7 percent of the GDP to education.
