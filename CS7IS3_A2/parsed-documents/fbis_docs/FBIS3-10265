Escorted by the International Red Cross and nongovernmental organizations, the delegates left the San Cristobal de las Casas Cathedral, 1,200 km southeast of Mexico City, for their hometowns. These delegates will inform their communities about the results of their dialogue with Camacho Solis in which they received promises to meet their economic, political, and social demands for upgrading the living standard of the Indians. The results of nine days of talks at the cathedral require the approval of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and local Indian communities before they can be transformed into a peace agreement. As he saw off eight of the 19 delegates in San Miguel Ocosingo, Camacho Solis insisted on implementing initial agreements on meeting the needs of the Indians to avoid loosing the hope and trust achieved during the dialogue. "At this time no one can fail to honor his word because that would actually be tantamount to failing Mexico," the commissioner said as he saw off the delegates headed by "Subcommander Marcos," military chief of the armed group. The dialogue began on 21 February to find a political solution to the conflict the group initiated on the first day of this year to present Indian demands by occupying towns and attacking the military. This forced the Mexican Army to intervene. In Las Margaritas delegate "Juan" also urged those involved to comply with the agreements to avoid putting "distance between the two parties."
