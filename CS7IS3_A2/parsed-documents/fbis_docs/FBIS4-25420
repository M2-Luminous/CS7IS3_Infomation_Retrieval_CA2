This reporter interviewed Comrade Xie Fei over the telephone on Guangdong-German economic cooperation prospects. After winding up a fruitful visit to Germany and Denmark, the Guangdong Provincial Economic Investigation Delegation headed by Xie Fei, arrived back in Guangzhou last week. In Germany, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who had invited Comrade Xie Fei to visit Germany, held a banquet in honor of Comrade Xie Fei and his entourage in Bonn. The two sides held cordial talks on expanding friendly relations of cooperation between China and Germany, especially between Guangdong and Germany. In Germany, Comrade Xie Fei and his entourage had extensive contacts with personages from Germany's industrial, commercial, and banking circles, and held talks with entrepreneurs and financiers from the German Industrial and Economic Federation, Berlin Industrial and Commercial Federation, and Bremen Industrial and Commercial Federation and with chief executives of Germany's (BAOMA) Joint-Stock Company, Siemens Company, and (JINMAKE) Company. Comrade Xie Fei briefed German friends on Guangdong's economic development, investment environment, and projects awaiting foreign investment. Comrade Xie Fei also held conscientious trade talks with the German friends. People of all walks of life in Germany expressed profound appreciation of as well as interest in the excellent economic cooperation opportunities offered by Guangdong. After the Guangdong delegation returned to Guangzhou from Germany, this reporter interviewed Comrade Xie Fei on what Guangdong should do to expand economic cooperation with Germany. During the interview, Comrade Xie Fei told this reporter: Germany's advanced science, technology, managerial expertise, as well as high economic efficiency are useful to Guangdong's modernization drive. Guangdong should, in the years ahead, strive to expand economic cooperation with Germany in four main areas. [Begin Xie Fei recording] We should expand economic cooperation with Germany in light of Guangdong's actual conditions. To this end, first and foremost, we should expand Guangdong-German economic cooperation in a number of selected areas, such as enterprise management, communications, telecommunication, environmental protection, and so on, in which Germany has excelled. We should also set up more joint venture enterprises with Germany and invite more capital from Germany. Second, we should study and draw on Germany's advanced capital construction experiences with an eye to upgrading Guangdong's capital construction and large-scale modern production. To this end, we should send more personnel to Germany to learn relevant expertise. I believe that we will be able to learn a great deal from Germany in many areas. Third, we should forge closer bilateral trade ties with Germany on the basis of enhanced mutual understanding, hold more trade promotion fairs, and carry out more similar activities in Germany to make it more convenient for the German businesspeople and entrepreneurs to come to and invest in Guangdong. Germany has a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises engaging in modern production. These German enterprises have expressed profound interest in investing in Guangdong. We should try to provide German entrepreneurs with more and better services and sufficient information in this regard, and invite them to come to have a look at Guangdong's investment environment with their own eyes. Fourth, we should provide more cooperation projects for and hold more trade talks with the German business community and expand cooperation with German financial and banking circles. Germany has agreed to provide more loans on preferential terms to help Guangdong build environmental protection projects. I can foresee great potential in this area of bilateral cooperation. We should strive to improve work in this connection. In a nutshell, in my view, it is all the more necessary for Guangdong to expand cooperation with and learn more from Germany, as well as other advanced countries in the world. We should strive to expand pluralistic opening up to the outside world and make redoubled efforts to step up economic cooperation in depth and breadth with all advanced countries in the world. Only by so doing will we finally optimize Guangdong's industrial structure. I'm full of confidence about the Guangdong-Germany economic cooperation. Last year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited Guangdong, at which time we discussed a host of trade and cooperation issues. I believe that we should take last year's visit to Guangdong as a point of departure and strive to make every possible endeavor to push forward bilateral trade and cooperation. Since last year, Guangdong has sent many a delegation to Germany and forged extensive ties with the German business community. The recent visit to Germany has undoubtedly enhanced our confidence in the Guangdong-Germany cooperation in the years ahead. [end recording]
