But Dick Evans, BAe chief executive, gave a cool response to the idea and said there were no plans for re-opening negotiations on any merger talks. Lord Weinstock, GEC managing director, indicated, during an interview with the BBC Money Programme, he was still holding the merger door open and suggested the consolidation of existing technical and joint venture links would produce a "national champion" in the defence market. He said: "I think if the national champion or the national defence company were more efficient you would automatically get more protection. "We would have more protection at home against imports and better prospects of making export sales. So I do not think there is any question that we could make the industry stronger by an amalgamation which created a single prime contractor." Lord Weinstock said he would like the talks with BAe to resume "under certain conditions" but made it clear they could not proceed unless BAe was "wholeheartedly in favour" of them. On the same programme Mr Evans said he was "very keen" for the existing relationship between the two companies to continue, but added: "It does not have to go to a vertically integrated merger." Mr Evans was criticised earlier this year for going out on a limb in backing a GEC and BAe merger but now feels that the aerospace group is in a stronger position to maintain its defence role through joint ventures rather than a complete merger. Robert Bauman, new chairman, is also said to be supporting the joint venture rather than merger route. The feeling in the BAe camp is that Lord Weinstock missed his chance of picking up the group cheaply when the share price collapsed. One source said: "He was worried about black holes in the balance sheet but action is now being taken to fill them."
