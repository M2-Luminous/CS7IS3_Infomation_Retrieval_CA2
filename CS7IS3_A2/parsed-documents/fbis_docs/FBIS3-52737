King Husayn had earlier stressed that these talks will be the last opportunity to rectify the situation following the PLO's continuous procrastination. Observers believe that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's decision to send Faruq Qaddumi to Amman, taking into consideration that the latter is not informed of the coordination file, unlike Mahmud 'Abbas, Abu-Mazin, reflects 'Arafat's desire to procrastinate and gain time, especially since the Palestinian delegation is expected to ask for time to hold consultations with the leadership in Tunis, something which will lead to revolving in the same vicious circle. An authorized Jordanian source has stressed that Jordan has the feeling that 'Arafat gives priority to coordination with Israel at the expense of coordination with Jordan. The source noted that Amman does not want to get involved in the whirlpool of turning the conflict from a Palestinian-Israeli conflict into a Palestinian-Jordanian conflict. However, the source added, Amman holds the PLO responsible for the repercussions of the failure of the dialogue in Amman, and the additional suffering this would cause to the Palestinian people inside the occupied territories.
