The Colombian Petroleum Enterprise (Ecopetrol) has found a way to profit from the situation by exploring deals that go beyond merely selling crude oil abroad. Last Monday, the Office of the Vice President for Sales of the oil company managed to close a deal in Trinidad-Tobago that yielded a profit of $1 million: In exchange for 500,000 barrels of oil, it will receive 200,000 barrels of processed products (gasoline, kerosene, and others). In this way, the oil company is marketing finished products rather than crude oil, following a very obvious economic strategy: As long as crude prices are on the decline, gasolines and other derivatives can fetch better and better prices. The current winter season in the United States and Europe has contributed to the increase in demand for fuels, and therefore prices are very attractive for producers. And there are better prospects ahead. In countries with seasons, the so-called "driving season" is approaching. This is a time when Americans travel on the highways, and fuel consumption increases notably. As a result, Ecopetrol has decided to look for mechanisms that will enable it to take advantage of what the fuels market offers. After the Trinidad-Tobago transaction, the oil company expects to negotiate similar deals in the gulf of the United States (the country's west coast), where the principal refineries in the world are located. They have a refining capacity of 15 million barrels per day. Change in Strategy How will the deal work? The oil company contracts with a foreign refinery to process crude, and in exchange, it receives a given quantity of products such as gasolines for cars, airplanes, and boats. In this way, the company gets a profit margin it would not get if it sold the oil directly on the major commodities markets of the world. Why? While a barrel of high-quality oil currently sells for less than $14, gasoline can sell for $18 or $19. The conclusion for Ecopetrol is simple: Whatever it pays to have the fuel refined can be recouped, and ultimately it is better off selling the fuel in processed form. Of course, 100 barrels of petroleum does not yield 100 barrels of gasoline. Everything depends on the refineries' conversion capacity. The best plants can achieve an 85-percent conversion, that is, 85 barrels of gasoline for every 100 barrels of crude. According to Ecopetrol officials consulted by EL TIEMPO, however, this type of transaction can be profitable for the company and can boost revenues at a time when the crude market is depressed, but looks like it will improve in the next few months. The next step is the futures market. Very soon, all oil transactions will be protected against any sharp change in prices. Thus, crude will be sold for delivery in two to six months at a predetermined price. If the price falls, the company is compensated by the financial institution that insured the sale. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |International Prices, U.S.$ per Barrel | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Date |Gasoline Price (1) |Petroleum Price | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Feb 93 |20.5 |20.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Mar 93 |21.0 |21.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Apr 93 |24.5 |20.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |May 93 |25.0 |20.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jun 93 |23.0 |19.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jul 93 |21.0 |19.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Aug 93 |21.0 |17.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sep 93 |20.0 |18.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Oct 93 |19.0 |17.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nov 93 |17.0 |17.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Dec 93 |15.0 |15.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jan 94 |17.0 |14.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Feb 94 |18.4 |13.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(1) Price indicator in Gulf of U.S. | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
