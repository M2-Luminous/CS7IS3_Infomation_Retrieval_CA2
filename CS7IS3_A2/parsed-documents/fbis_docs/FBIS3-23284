We were ostracized when Rabbi Kahana was banned from being a Knesset member and when our list was prohibited from running in the Knesset elections. We are under serious pressure. I have the feeling that Dr. Barukh Goldstein's deed could happen again." These remarks were made yesterday by a member of the Kahana Hay movement. "I would not be surprised," the man said, "if such an action were to take place within the walls of the Knesset, whose members blackball and persecute us. Look what one Jew did, and how effective it is." At around 2100 last night, an anonymous caller phoned MA'ARIV and said that "500 Arabs would be slaughtered if Binyamin Kahana was not released from his prison cell in Hadera by midnight." A check by MA'ARIV revealed that a similar anonymous phone call was received by the duty officer at the Hadera police station. The Hadera police have launched an investigation.
