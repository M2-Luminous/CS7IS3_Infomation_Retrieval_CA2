Liu Jiyuan, president of the China Aerospace Industry Corporation [CAIC] and honorary chairman of the board of directors of the China Aerospace International Holdings Limited [CAIH] flew in from Beijing specifically to host the party. He said: As the parent company of CAIH, CAIC will pay great attention to its development because it is an important window through which the will proceed to the world. We will surely make a success of it. In addition to financially supporting CAIH's business, we will also support its development with high-tech products and high-tech personnel resources. In particular, we will have to choose some high-quality and high-efficiency high-tech projects and inject them into CAIH, the example being the just announced Guizhou-Jiangnan auto project, so that CAIH's product mix can be readjusted in a comparatively short time, changing the outlook of its operation and management, and so that it will produce comparatively ideal economic returns after one to three years. He said: CAIC is a technology-led company which integrates technology, industry, and trade, and which is directly under the PRC State Council. It was reorganized and set up in June 1993 against the background of reform and opening up and on the basis of the former Fifth Research Institute of the National Defense Ministry set up in October 1956, which eventually evolved into the Seventh Ministry of Machine Building, to the Astronautics Industry Ministry, and to the Ministry of Aeronautics and Astronautics Industry. CAIC has accumulated scientific and technological achievements and management experience over the past 40 years or more in the astronautics industry, and possesses powerful scientific and technological strength and rich management experience, forming a complete air-ground integrated system that researches, designs, experiments with, and produces carrier rockets, satellites, and other applied ground-based systems. CAIC has large comprehensive research academies including the China Carrier Rocket Research Academy and the China Space Technology Academy and over 300 research institutes, three colleges of higher learning, and six large and medium-sized enterprise groups. Under CAIC are research and educational institutes and various types of enterprises in 24 provinces and municipalities across the country. It has 270,000 employees of whom 100,000 are professional technical personnel and 40,000 are senior professional technical personnel. CAIC currently has assets totaling 30 billion yuan and annual sales of 8 billion yuan and earns a post-tax net profit of approximately one billion yuan. CAIC mainly develops, produces, and deals in all types of aerospace products and launches all types of series carrier rockets and various types of applied satellites and scientific experimental satellites including telecommunications and broadcasting, meteorological, and earth resources survey satellites, and various types of earth receivers and applied systems. CAIC is utilizing the high-tech advantages it possesses to develop a variety of fair-sized and marketable civilian products covering electronics, telecommunications, computers, industrial automation control, petrochemistry, medical equipment, autos, and all kinds of home electrical appliances. It has obtained comparatively good economic returns by developing and dealing in these civilian products. In the past two decades, eight models of the Long March series carrier rockets have been developed and manufactured by China. As of the end of 1993, China had succeeded in launching 36 satellites, five of which were successfully launched into preset orbits for overseas customers. At present, China possesses world advanced technology in retrieving satellites, launching several satellites with one rocket, and launching stationary satellites. It also has fixed-point, satellite survey and control, and rocket high-energy and low-temperature technology. Each year, CAIC is awarded by various ministries for over 500 scientific and technological achievements and by the state for a dozen or more achievements. Since reform and opening up, CAIC has established good cooperative ties with foreign businesses and has set up 21 solely funded enterprises and joint ventures in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Russia. Moreover, it has set up 55 joint-ventures and cooperative enterprises with other countries in China. CAIC and its affiliated companies have always maintained a good cooperative relationship with Hong Kong. CAIC launched the satellite Asiat-1 for the Asia Satellite Company Limited, whose headquarters are in Hong Kong, with the carrier rocket Long March Three and succeeded in completing the Buddha Tian Tan project on Lantau Island, Hong Kong. Furthermore, CAIC carries out technological cooperation and has business ties with many countries, consortia, and corporations around the world. Recently, it signed an agreement with the U.S. Motorola Corporation by which the corporation will for the first time invest $40 million to jointly develop an iridium satellite system. It has also signed an agreement with the corporation to launch satellites and build three mobile telecommunications ground stations for it. The company has signed an agreement with Brazil to develop and launch resource survey satellites and with Germany's MBB corporation to jointly develop satellites. It has also set up a joint venture, the Huadi Computer Company, with Digital, a U.S. corporation. CAIC has already received service orders for 60 satellites up to the year 2000, totalling some $1 billion.
