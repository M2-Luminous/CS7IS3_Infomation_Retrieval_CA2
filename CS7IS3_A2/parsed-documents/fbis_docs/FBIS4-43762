We believe that it has no historical or ideological basis within Turkish culture. No other state is so afraid of its own people. It exerted special efforts to implant the notion of discrimination between Islam and canonical law in the minds of the people. The Ataturk revolution was against Islam. That is why we question it." The United States: "The United States is afraid of radical Muslims and is searching for moderate Muslims to act as its agents. This is its concession to the Muslims." Fethullah Gulen: "He is a volunteer agent of the secular front." Great Unity Party [GUP]: "The fact that its grass roots are Muslim obliges the GUP to adopt an anti-Kemalist stand or at least show that it is not Kemalist. All it has done so far is to pursue a contrived policy that wavers between Kemalism and so called anti-Kemalism." Turkish-Islamic synthesis: "Our ideological relations with the Intellectuals Hearth are not good at all. We are against such things as the Idealist movement and Turkish-Islamic synthesis. One cannot combine Turkish nationalism and Islam. Islam comes first." The Kurdish issue: "Islam does not interfere in the customs and traditions of any race, religion, or language. It gives them freedom. The Kurdish problem is a regional issue."
