Were they a surprise to you? [Paznyak] The results of the elections are natural for an empire that is experiencing a deep socioeconomic crisis. Such situations bring people to power who address the lower instincts of the lumpen-proletariat and promise too much. This is a well-known path by which some European countries have gone and by which Russia is now going. The results of the elections were not startling for the Belarusian Popular Front [BPF]. Moreover, we did not expect that the elections could improve the political situation in Russia, because the political platforms of Russian political parties were nourished by imperial trends. All of them, in greater or lesser degree, backed a general Russian imperial mood because -- and I would like to repeat this again -- an empire cannot be democratic. That is an axiom. It is evident that Russia is developing in an antidemocratic way -- this is natural for Russia, though it is at the same time a tragic way for events to develop. All the power will be polarized (not only the State Duma!), with the mutual opposition of the president and legislature. All this can lead to civil war, even to global war. Speaking about the results of elections in Russia, we can state the complete failure of Western policy toward Russia. The West has once again demonstrated its complete misunderstanding of the events in the former states of the USSR. In general, I assess the Western policy as being Philistine. A similar policy had caused the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentropp Treaty in the 1930's.... The policy directed at the creation of a democratic Russia is illusory as long as Russia remains an empire. However, it can exist only as an empire.... [Tsyhankow] That is to say, you think that Russia can exist only as an empire or it better cease to exist at all? [Paznyak] Yes, this is the case. [Tsyhankow] Does this fit the interests of the world community? [Paznyak] Yes, it will be better when an empire ceases to exist. Having reached the peak of its economic potential in the 19th-20th centuries, Russia became a source of military danger. An empire is always extending its borders, it is ready to swallow the entire world, foreign cultures and economies and later deem them Russian. The Romans thought this way, so what happened later? The Roman Empire collapsed, the Roman nation and language disappeared. The Russian nation should specify its nationality. It is always the national culture that is aspiring to develop and defend its creative potential. Currently, the Russians have an imperial consciousness and think along imperial lines. [Tsyhankow] How can Russians understand that they need to split the Russian Federation? [Paznyak] It is impossible to realize. This topic demands a lot of time and we are limited to a newspaper interview. However, you should realize: Russia is an empire whose population thinks along imperial lines. [Tsyhankow] It is a vicious circle. Is there a way out? [Paznyak] In the opinion of BPF, the way out lies in the creation of a counterbalance in East Europe. The Baltic-Black Sea Association will stabilize the situation in this part of Europe. This idea was born in Belarus in 1916. The empire can start falling and this dangerous and lengthy process should be kept under control. [Tsyhankow] How do the results of the Russian elections effect the pro-communist Supreme Soviet majority who advocate a close union with Russia? [Paznyak] Communism and fascism have the same roots, they have similar ideas and symbols. On a certain level of development, they can change color and even unite with someone else. However, history demonstrates that communists will never share power with other political forces. By the way, Russian history is a vivid example of this: Communists required only a single night to murder the members of several political parties! Communists are ready to unite with anyone, however, they will betray and do away with their allies as soon as they secure unlimited power. When the position of communists in the State Duma is strengthened, their Belarusian colleagues will resume their activities. Currently, Belarusian communists are at a crossroads -- they do not know what to do. Please, pay attention to this: More than two weeks have passed since the Russian elections were held, and our Supreme Soviet is still silent on the issue; as if Russia has ceased to exist. [Text] [Tsyhankow] What conclusions has the BPF made? [Paznyak] We propose nothing extraordinary. There are legal norms according to which the international community should operate. These legal norms were violated for decades and only now are they being revived. Belarus should introduce its own national currency and carry out an independent national policy or, in other words, Belarus should force the world to recognize it so it can reap the fruits of its labor. The second and more significant conclusion concerns nuclear weapons. When adventurers seize power in a nuclear state and plan to wage aggressive wars and change borders, they should not get access to the nuclear button. This is clear to everybody. Therefore, Ukraine and Belarus should both give back their nuclear missiles to Russia. Belarus does not require nuclear weapons and I want to remind you that the BPF was the first to propose that a nonnuclear and neutral status of a Belarusian state become a constitutional requirement. We do not need nuclear weapons but we cannot give back the nuclear warheads to politicians who can start a world war. [Tsyhankow] In your opinion, can the acting Belarusian Government arrive at the same conclusion? [Paznyak] It is not difficult to draw this conclusion, however, our cabinet members are busy discussing an issue of corruption in high places and are anxious over how to stay in power. The problem is that we cannot destroy our weapons without our Western partners -- it is an expensive affair. Even today Belarus is dismantling its tanks and missiles, however, no other state in the world is doing the same. All this is done at the expense of Belarusian taxpayers and without any Western aid. What is it? If the West is not going to aid us in the future, we should find another way out of this predicament. [Tsyhankow] Can we expect that the policy of the West toward Russia will change? It will be more embarrassing to change their policy after the presidential elections are held in Russia. [Paznyak] All the political, moral, and financial support of the West is going to Russia, while Belarus and Ukraine are completely ignored. The West authorized Russia (with its huge oil and gas potential) to subordinate Belarus and Ukraine. The West did it consciously, pretending that it was pursuing a wise policy of creating a "democratic Russia." However, if the West is concerned with the spreading of European civilization, it should have started with the strengthening of Baltic, Belarusian, and Ukrainian statehood. The West should not have earmarked credits to this procommunist regime but should have rendered moral and political support to democratic forces. We do not even require their money -- we have both labor and intellect. We require consultative visits by foreign experts. We do not get this -- all the aid is directed to Russian, where people fight and kill each other. Will the West change its position on the issue? Of course, they will introduce some changes. However, as far as my personal opinion is concerned, the Western mind is very inert and slow, and cannot be radically changed in a short period of time. The West thinks that Russia and its neighbors are far away, however, they are very close to its door.... I am scared that the West will unwillingly -- as was done with Hitler -- help Russian fascists come to power.
