These, in particular, are plants "Radykal" [Radical], "Khimvolokno" [Chemical Fiber], TE-6, as well as automobile transport and the radioactive contamination of the capital as a result of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station. The news conference was attended by Green Party Chairman Vitaliy Kononov, Yuriy Samoylenko, first deputy chairman of the Ukrainian ecological association "Green World", Serhiy Konyukhov, the chairman of the Ecological Commission of the Ukrainian Republican Party, Mykhaylo Mykhalko, the chairman of the "Save Holosiyevo" Union [woodland on outskirts of Kiev], and others. Anatoliy Panov, the executive director of the newspaper ZELENYY SVIT [GREEN WORLD], expressed his conviction that the "hushing up of the fact that Kiev did suffer as a result of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station is not just a detrimental, but a criminal phenomenon. If our state has no money to provide medical treatment to Kievites and improve their health, this money could be provided by the world public." At the news conference, Greenpeace-Ukraine made public its press release disclosing a secret decree No. 64/94 by Ukraine's president of 23 February 1994 "On urgent measures to develop nuclear power engineering and create a nuclear-fuel cycle in Ukraine." The decree, in particular, envisages the commissioning of four new reactors at the Zaporozhye, Khmelnitskiy, and Rovno nuclear power stations and also the repair and putting into operation of the second power unit at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, which was ruined by fire in October 1991.
