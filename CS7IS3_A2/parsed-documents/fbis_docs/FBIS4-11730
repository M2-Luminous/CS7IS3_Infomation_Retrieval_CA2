Prior to the meeting, some OPEC nations including Iran and Kuwait had indicated their willingness to cut production to boost prices. Several non-OPEC producers excluding Britain, Norway, and Mexico also favored lower crude export levels which would bring higher prices and prolong the life of underground crude reserves. Britain and Norway claim that keeping the current level and even increasing it has been planned a long time ago based on "long-term investment programs." Self interest is obviously the main consideration for agreeing to any changes in production volume by the individual members of OPEC. However, it does not necessarily follow that a formula cannot be found that will benefit all members as well as the non-OPEC crude exporters. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of petroleum, saying it needs to keep its production at the current level to pay for its foreign debts, disrupted any semblance of consensus by disagreeing to any production cuts. On the surface the Saudi stance seems reasonable. But this is the same country that a few weeks ago bought $6 billion worth of U.S.-made planes from manufacturers who were on the verge of bankruptcy. it is hard to understand the Kingdom's policy which costs its nation huge sums in order to save American businesses but at the same time endangers and actually damages the economies of its own neighbors by reducing their oil revenues. Iran's Oil Minister, Gholamreza Aqazadeh, proposed a 1.4 million barrels a day collective reduction in OPEC's crude output amounting to an overall 6 percent drop in production volume. At the same time Oman, representing 8 non-OPEC producers, offered to cut non-OPEC production by 250,000 barrels a day. Aqazadeh quoted the OPEC Secretariat as saying that the above proposed cuts would have resulted in a $4 a barrel increase in crude prices. This will more than offset Saudi Arabia's lower oil revenues if production ceilings are dropped. Considering the fact that all OPEC nations, particularly Saudi Arabia which has the largest production volume, will economically benefit from higher prices the Kingdom's opposition to lowering production volumes seems contrary to its own interests. By keeping crude prices low the Saudi rulers are in effect giving higher priority to the interests of the United States, which wants cheap crude, than to their own economic well being and political independence, and in the process they are creating financial inconveniences for their neighbors.
