According to the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, these words of Ardzinba "testify not only to his skepticism but also to his intention to poison the atmosphere around the forthcoming talks and even to disrupt them as far as possible". This assumption is borne out by Ardzinba's reiterated statement that "Abkhazia is no longer part of Georgia" and that "the question now is about signing an agreement between Abkhazia and Georgia as two equal parties". A second round of consultations between Georgia and Abkhazia is scheduled to begin in Geneva on January 11. "The delegation from Georgia has been instructed to draw up, jointly with the Abkhaz delegation, a framework for the full-scale settlement in Abkhazia, which can be used as the basis of a resolution to be adopted by the United Nations Security Council," the Georgian statement said. "Only a document recognised and guaranteed by the international community can ensure the restoration of peace in Abkhazia," the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
