On 28 January, they attacked a convoy from Dirkou, which was under military escort, killing two people, wounding another, and making away with a quantity of items. Here is Mounkali Agadem with a report. [Begin recording] As has been the practice for some time now, the 28 January convoy was escorted by soldiers. Everything was proceeding smoothly until the convoy reached some 30 km from Agadez, where the attack took place. The assailants attacked right in the middle of the convoy, while the military vehicle at the rear had stopped a few kilometers away to guard a vehicle that had broken down. The rebels therefore had more than enough time to commit their act. After unsuccessfully ordering a truck to stop, they shot the driver, killing him instantly. A woman, who was on the same truck, was burned to death. The third occupant had his ear shot off. As if that were not enough, the assailants set fire to the vehicle, causing extensive damage to the goods, which were estimated at more than 2 million CFA francs by the driver's mate, who had his ear shot off. The assailants then proceeded to attack the other vehicles, from which they took television sets, food items, tape recorders, and other goods. They loaded the goods onto their three vehicles before bolting away. The soldiers, after they were alerted, pursued the assailants, but they have not found them. According to their commanding officer, the search is continuing. It should be noted that this is the third rebel attack in less than a month in Agadez Department, where a lot is expected from the outcome of the next meeting between the government and the rebels. We were not able to go and see for ourselves the extent of the damage on the spot, where apparently the vehicles were still burning even until yesterday. We were, of course, unable to go because we did not have any military escort because all trips in that region can only be done under escort. [end recording]
