The request was raised during Keating's talks with his Laotian counterpart Khamtai Siphandon. Laos' response, however, was cautious. Somsavat said despite the government's policy fostering world peace and stability, Vientiane respected countries' individual rights to find solutions to their own problems. "We (Laos and North Korea) in fact have good relations. Our two countries were the victims of aggression in the past," said Somsavat. [passage omitted]
