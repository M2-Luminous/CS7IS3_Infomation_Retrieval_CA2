The vice ministerial talks will focus on coordinating the views of the two countries on tax cuts, the implementation of a new macroeconomic policy, and the establishment of objective criteria to measure the openness of the Japanese market, which the United States has set as preconditions for resuming the stalled framework talks. The vice ministerial talks are likely to broadly examine Japan's compromise proposal that objective criteria apply only to the government procurement sector. Meanwhile, working-level talks also are expected to coordinate views of the two countries in an effort to have the stalled framework talks resumed prior to another round of Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for July. The government has sent Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Suzaburo Okamatsu, deputy minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], to Washington to attend the vice ministerial talks. They will hold talks with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Barshevsky to discuss ways to resume the stalled framework talks. The Japanese officials intend to make specific requests of their U.S. counterparts concerning three preconditions the United States has set for resuming the stalled framework talks, and then present them with Japan's response. They also intend to present a flexible macroeconomic policy to their U.S. counterparts and then feel out their response. Their focus is to seek out a compromise on the establishment of objective criteria. President Clinton has definitely said, "the United States will not seek any numerical targets." Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Kakizawa has stated, "it is necessary to set some quantitative criteria that do not actually result in establishing objective criteria." The Japanese and U.S. negotiators will discuss the possibility of establishing such quantitative criteria to expand the access of foreign manufactured goods and services to the Japanese market. Of three sectors at issue -- government procurement, automobiles and auto parts, and insurance -- the Japanese negotiators are likely to present U.S. negotiators with a proposal for applying quantitative criteria toward the government procurement sector. Regulations on foreign access to the government procurement sector have been largely relaxed, and it is highly possible that both Japan and the United States can reach an agreement on this sector. The Japanese negotiators intend to urge their U.S. counterparts to make concessions by proposing a "phased formula" under which the criteria will be gradually applied to the insurance sector and the automobile and auto parts sectors. Regarding macroeconomic policy, the Japanese officials will explain to their U.S. counterparts that Japan will continue cutting income taxes after 1995 and then seek their understanding of Japan's plan. The U.S. Government fears that a delay in breaking the deadlock between Japan and the United States could trigger a fall in the international value of the dollar and a rise in long-term interest rates. For that reason, the United States is softening its tough trade stance toward Japan. Japan intends to listen to "real" U.S. trade demands from U.S. officials and exchange information with the United States to examine whether those trade demands are acceptable.
