Background It is the policy of the BIA to emphasize and facilitate the comprehensive design, development and implementation of Indian child and family service programs in coordination with other Federal, state, and local programs which strengthen and preserve Indian families and Indian tribes.

These programs are intended to promote the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C. 1902; 25 U.S.C. 1932). This notice provides information on the FY 1994 ICWA grant application process for eligible off-reservation Indian organizations to compete for FY 1994 ICWA grant funds. B. Eligible Applicants
