For example, whereas, earlier, any defense-industry plant in Ukraine manufactured 70 or 80 percent of military products, it presently only manufactures about 10 percent of them, without producing any civilian products instead. Is it now possible to say that conversion is in progress in Ukraine? Experts believe that one can now talk of a different thing -- the decline and collapse of the previously mighty and science-intensive branch of machine building and the military-industrial complex. It does not take a prophet to point out once again that the problem of conversion in Ukraine is extremely important. Ukraine is the second most powerful representative of the former Union's military-industrial complex after Russia. There are, in Ukraine, 800 ship-, tank-, and aircraft-building plants that used to be constituent parts of the might of the former USSR. Ukraine tried to convert the military-industrial complex and machine building. Why tried? Because the state program is based upon a program-oriented principle and was elaborated for 400 enterprises. Precisely this program envisaged the transition of their work to satisfy civilian needs and a decrease in military production. Regarding the former, that is to say, the cessation of the manufacture of military products, it has, indeed, taken place. However, not in accordance with a systematic program, but as a result of a spontaneous reduction in the production of military technology and weapons. Production has been reduced severalfold. The reason for this is, primarily, the fact that the Russians used to be customers of Ukrainian plants, but, presently, they are creating their own industries. The second reason is the extremely low wages of workers in the machine building and military-industrial complexes, averaging between 600,000 and 800,000 karbovantsi [K] a month. What actually took place there was not conversion, since, as a result, we have empty production shops, workers who have not been retrained, the unprocessed technological specifications, and the loss of production potential. The state program was developed in 1991-92. If one can put it this way, it took place in a different state. At that time, Ukraine's financial situation was different, there were different reserves and resources, and the rate of inflation was not so unrestrained. If you remember, the collapse occurred at the beginning of 1994, and all calculations of the state program were eaten up by inflation. Nor are Western investors in any hurry to come to Ukraine. Despite the fact that both Germany and the United States showed an interest in investing in Ukrainian conversion. Nothing went beyond talk and intentions, even though the Ukrainian Government did try to attract Western capital by its conversion projects. The reason is simple and banal: Money may only be given for private industries, whereas the entire defense industry is state-controlled. There is still no money and nor is there the sum of $40 million that was recently promised by Americans. If this money is granted to Ukraine in the near future, almost half of it will go for remunerating the labor of U.S. specialists and experts. By way of comparison, I will quote the following figure: Experts have estimated that at least tens of billions of U.S. dollars may be needed for the renovation and conversion of Ukrainian defense capacities. Having appraised the situation, Western investors were, frankly speaking, pleased with such a state of affairs. First and foremost, they got rid of a powerful competitor in weapons production on the world market, and that is why the firms of the United States, France, Germany, and Sweden presently reign there. The West no longer fears the capacity of Ukraine's defense plants, which live from hand to mouth. Finally, Ukraine, having reduced, by tens of times, its manufacture of weapons and military products, has not proceeded to manufacturing competitive civilian products. This means that, in the next few years, we will not, so to speak, present any hazard on the world market of modern civilian products. There also arises the following question: If the state is so poor, why doesn't the government make use of private capital for implementing conversion. This capital in Ukraine is not very mighty, but it does exist. I mean the capital of between $5 billion and $7 billion that has been taken abroad since the establishment of independence and that works for the Western economy. The reason is that, however painful it may be to admit, Ukraine and its state apparatus still remain successors to the Ukrainian SSR. Everything proceeds by the inertia of the former Council of Ministers, as the people there have remained the same with the same mentality. Even though not a single statesman will specify the country's losses due to the collapse of the military-production potential, in accordance with rough estimates by experts, Ukraine has already lost several billion U.S. dollars in pure income, not to mention the fact that, with a true conversion, we would have preserved the scientific and production base and potential worth tens of billions of U.S. dollars. The aircraft- and tank-building industries have been particularly affected, as well as plants and enterprises manufacturing radio equipment. It goes without saying that all of this is not only due to foot dragging or poor economic management, but this does not make things easier.
