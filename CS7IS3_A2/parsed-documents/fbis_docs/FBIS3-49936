"It is tragic that at a time when the unity and sovereignty of the Slovak Republic is threatened, Cernak is secretly negotiating with Bugar and Arpad Duka-Zolyomi from Egyutteles," says a statement by leaders of SNS West Slovak regional branches published in the left-leaning PRAVDA today. PRAVDA writes that Cernak has called the statement "an utterly shameless and immoral lie." Bugar called the report "a dirty political move" with an apparent effort to eliminate Cernak. He stressed that the latest talks between the MKDH and the SNS had been conducted when the SNS had been in opposition. Bugar chronologically listed all the initiatives connected with the Komarno call, published on December 6, 1993. He said the reaction by Slovak top officials, warning against "destruction of Slovakia's integrity," was "out of proportion," while their approach to solving the ethnic problems had not been positive and contradicted the previous promises. He accused the Democratic Left Party (SDL) representatives of insincerity as they had received "a year and a month ago" the draft minority bill, compiled by Hungarian parties, but they had not commented on its wording yet. In connection with dissatisfaction of the Hungarian minority with the government proposal of the new administrative-territorial set-up of Slovakia, Bugar noted that deputies to local bodies in purely Slovak districts were also dissatisfied and it is them (local governments) who should have the largest powers with respect to the drafting of the law. He stressed that the MKDH stuck to the principle taking "also" the ethnic aspect into account, but not "only" the ethnic aspect.
