After that, it will do nothing." Strangely, this rumor -- or jest -- is convincing. Of course, "after a resolution is adopted," the United Nations and its member nations will begin their struggles toward recruiting personnel to participate in peacekeeping activities, abiding by restrictions imposed by the resolution, and financial juggling to deal with steadily increasing expenses. However, as far as the issue of the DPRK's suspected nuclear program is concerned, it is before the resolution is adopted that diplomacy and politics can have their say. In early June, a diplomatic source in New York said: "No nation wants to vote for a resolution to impose sanctions against North Korea. Everyone hopes to avoid it somehow. To tell you the truth, they are looking for ways to postpone adopting the resolution." Truly, it remained unclear whether or not the UNSC would be able to adopt a resolution even when the United States proposed its draft sanctions resolution to UNSC member nations on 15 June. China and Russia opposed the U.S.-proposed resolution, claiming they were not consulted about a ban on arms exports included in the resolution. Even if China abstains from voting and as a result, the resolution is adopted, the severe sanctions measure of halting remittances to the DPRK and the oil embargo, which is even more severe, would be thwarted. This is no surprise if remittances through a third country and the long PRC-DPRK border are taken into consideration. In short, it is possible that after adopting a resolution, the UNSC will realize that it has exhausted every means possible to resolve the nuclear issue, and that its chance to settle the issue occurred before adopting a resolution. An official at the UN Administration Office said: "The UNSC is a place to discuss political matters, not an organization to carry out policies. Washington knows that sanctions against Iraq after the end of the Gulf war have not been carried out satisfactorily. The United States has proposed a 30-day grace period in its draft resolution. Also, unofficial negotiations before the adoption of a resolution will take up two or three weeks. These facts indicate that the United States is fully aware that political performance before the adoption of a resolution holds the key to resolving the nuclear issue." There is another issue of concern. An opinion shared among Western nations' ambassadors to the United Nations is that Chinese and North Korean ambassadors to the United Nations "seem to have no right to decide, because they only repeat the same thing no matter how long we talk with them and no matter what we propose." Instead, they inform their home countries of the detailed moves of the United Nations. In such a situation, the United States announced its draft resolution. Although for diplomatic reasons, Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, did not touch on the details of the resolution at a news conference in the United Nations, the full text of the resolution was disclosed by a British source a few hours later. It was just a couple of hours before former U.S. President Jimmy Carter began his first round of talks with North Korean President Kim Il-song. Just a week before that event, Hisashi Owada, Japanese ambassador to the United Nations, said: "It is almost common knowledge in Japan that the sun is better than the north wind, as a tale from "Aesop's Fables" tells us. But in the international arena, the north wind is sometimes better than the sun." The United Nations will have to continue using a "carrot policy" and a "stick policy" by turns to resolve the nuclear issue.
