As he said, the reports arriving from South Africa "make it possible to hope that the elections to be concluded on Thursday will be a success." However the forces, which tried in vain to derail the negotiating process, are still resorting to sabotage," Karasin said. The recent terrorist act -- bomb explosion in Johannesburg's airport -- injured 16 people, including two Russian diplomats. "We believe that such actions will not break the will of the majority of South Africans, who voted for a democratic future and for a prosperous South Africa," the spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry concluded.
