Therefore, Mikhail Uladzimiravich, the public should learn about the results of your work, to prevent various speculations. [Hardyka] As everybody knows, in June 1991, the Supreme Soviet of the then Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic [BSSR] requested the office of attorney general to conduct a legal assessment of activities of certain Belarusian officials and other people responsible for resolving issues connected with the catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Moreover, the request was formulated by certain deputies in the following way: It is necessary to immediately find the officials who are guilty and put them behind bars. In a law-governed state this is unacceptable however. It is necessary to determine the concrete fault of every single man, as well as to point out which article of which law has been violated. A special investigating team was therefore set up, and I was requested to head it. For more than three years, we have been studying the legislative basis existing at that time concerning radiation safety, and we have collected several thousand witnesses' testimonies and experts' reports. The materials have been gathered in almost 150 bulky volumes. All this had to be interpreted and systemized, and we have had to provide a legal assessment of activities of every official responsible for making specific decisions. Without exaggeration, I can say that it has been a monumental task. [Herasyuk] The work has currently entered its final stage. You have resolved to close the criminal case.... [Hardyka] This has been inevitable, particularly, after the collapse of the USSR. Since many people became citizens of other countries, it has been very difficult to continue the investigation. Additionally, official documents of ministries which were located in Moscow at that time could not be regarded as a legal basis of the new independent Republic of Belarus. Of course, our conclusions may disappoint many people, since nobody, except for well-known employees of the plant, has been imprisoned. Nevertheless, our work has not been worthless. We know precisely today what laws we should have, so people who break the law do not remain unpunished. [Herasyuk] What has been disclosed by the investigation? [Hardyka] First of all, I would like to point out that we did not begin in an empty space. The Office of the USSR Attorney General had opened a criminal case prior to ours. Director Brukhanov, chief engineer Famin, his deputy Dyatlov, shift supervisor Rogozhyn, and Laushkin, chief of the Nuclear Power Industry Inspectorate, had already been brought to account. The criminal investigation against the people responsible for errors in the reactor's design and workers of the Ukrainian Civil Defense, who failed to report the accident in time, had been suspended by the Ukrainian Office of Attorney General. On 4 May 1986, the Communist Party of Belarus [KPB] Central Committee Bureau and the BSSR Cabinet of Ministers established the Committee for Liquidating the Aftermath of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Catastrophe. The committee included Dzemyantsey, Khusaynaw, [Belarusian Prime Minister] Kebich, and other officials. Practical recommendations were examined by a scientific-technical council comprised of such well-known scientists as Nikitchanka, Pyatrayew, and [former Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman] Shushkevich. Operational headquarters were opened in Homel and Mahilyow Oblasts. Yet, everything was coordinated by an operational group of the CPSU Central Committee Political Bureau. M. Ryzhkov, former chairman of the USSR Cabinet of Ministers, while being interrogated as a witness, said that "taking into account the knowledge existing at that time, the optimal way of liquidating the aftermath of the catastrophe was chosen. The operational group examined issues and adopted appropriate decisions. The adopted decisions were correct." M. Kavalyow, former commander of the Civil Defense and chairman of the BSSR Cabinet of Ministers, said the following: "I learned about the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant from Hryshahin, chief of the BSSR Civil Defense General Headquarters. He did not receive any reports from Moscow or Kiev. At the beginning, we did not have complete data about the radiation level, nor did we know all the details of the catastrophe. Our equipment was able to detect only high levels of radiation. There were no accurate dosimeters in Belarus at that time. Only after the accident, Moscow allocated money to purchase such equipment abroad." First Rank Captain D. Zhukowski, former chief of the Homel Oblast Civil Defense Headquarters, emphasized that "he was unable to learn about complete forecasts for radioactive pollution in Homel Oblast from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant civil defense or the Kiev Oblast Administration." This was confirmed by the testimony of A. Kamay, former secretary of the KPB Homel Oblast Committee: "The Kiev Oblast Civil Defense failed to provide appropriate information.... I have received fragmentary information about the accident from the local leadership on 27 April 1986." USSR Deputy Health Minister noted that "the government should have informed the people about radioactive contamination in the entire country and in separate regions. This was a political step.... Local authorities were unable to provide information about the accident and its aftermath. At the beginning, all reports on the accident were considered secret...." [Herasyuk] In my opinion, Gorbachev should have been the first one to be brought to account. He found the courage to mention something about the accident only two weeks after it happened. Since the boss kept silent, his subordinates did not rush to inform the people. Neither Gorbachev nor Ryzhkov, however, were punished.... [Hardyka] As the investigation has revealed, they, as well as the leadership of our country, did not violate any laws. We can only speak about moral accountability here, but this is a personal matter. The Office of Attorney General must operate strictly within judicial categories. Thus, the case has been dismissed, because of the lack of elements of crime in activities of the people who were responsible for making important decisions during the days following the Chernobyl accident.
