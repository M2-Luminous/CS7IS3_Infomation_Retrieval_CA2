This proposal was submitted via U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The sources told our correspondent Yo'av Aviv that according to the proposal, Israel is willing to withdraw its forces and end its presence in the Jazzin enclave. SLA [South Lebanese Army] forces in this region will be disarmed and replaced by Lebanese Army units. Security operations in the area will be coordinated by a joint IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and Lebanese Army committee. Over the next five years Israel will gradually withdraw from the security zone and transfer authority to the Lebanese Army, while the SLA will be incorporated as a separate unit within the Lebanese Army. According to the sources, the Lebanese Government rejected this proposal, claiming it does not involve a full withdrawal, and that there is no room for a separate peace between Israel and Lebanon.
