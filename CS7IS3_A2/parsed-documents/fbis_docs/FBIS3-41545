Located near Nanchang, capital of eastern China's Jiangxi Province, the station has virtually stopped the invasion of the surrounding desert and restored the local ecological environment in the area after six years of work. Wind and sand in the area threatened local residents' limited living space. Statistics show that in Jiangxi, sandy land covers 32,000 hectares, and that sand is swallowing farmland at a speed of four meters a year. Experts warned that the desert was approaching the city of Nanchang and there was no time to waste. In Houtian town, near Nanchang, people suffered greatly from sand disasters. Farmland and rivers were inundated, and the town was forced to move again and again. In 1985, the town's per capita income was only 170 yuan (29 U.S. dollars). More than 80 percent of all peasant households lived below the poverty line. The town owed 1.6 million yuan (275.9 U.S. dollars) in debts. To help the backward areas out of poverty, the municipal science and technology committee initiated a plan of ``helping the poor by applying scientific and technological advances.'' Cooperating with the Lanzhou Institute of Deserts in northwestern China's Gansu Province, the committee established in January of 1988 China's first experimental station on comprehensive exploration of subtropical sandy land. The station covers an area of 35.1 hectares in Houtian's most seriously sand-ridden area. Comprehensive exploration of sandy land is a difficult technological project. Although research on deserts and sandy land started long ago in northern China, this was the first time to tackle sandy land in subtropical areas. The station adopted a method that combined modern technology with traditional experience. While making efforts to improve the environment, researchers also paid attention to economic results. They introduced many special varieties of animals and plants beneficial to the environment. This low-input, high-output planting mode has proved to be successful. About 91.3 percent of fruit trees and more than 95 percent shelter forests have survived in the experimental area. Some 93 million fruit trees of 55 varieties are growing there. This year, the station harvested more than 15 tons of fruit and earned 190 million yuan (32.76 million dollars) from planting. Inspired by the experiment results, peasants living around the station planted some 200 hectares of fruit trees. Income per household has reached 8,000 yuan (1,380 dollars). This miracle has also astonished foreign experts. At the third world conference on desert control, representatives from the Nanchang experimental station issued their research results and won wide recognition and appreciation from international sand-control experts. After inspecting the station, the European Community decided to provide aid of 5.2 million U.S. dollars. EC experts have started cooperating with Chinese experts in building model orchards and a personnel training base. The research results will be spread around the country. Experts believe that by the end of this century, the deserts in southern and eastern China will become oases.
