Members of the SZDSZ delegation, headed by the party's parliamentary faction head and prime minister candidate Gabor Kuncze, told MTI they had raised to Hrebenciuc the problem of releasing Transylvanian Hungarian convicts imprisoned in connection with the 1989 December revolution in Romania. Hrebenciuc said a positive decision is expected in the matter soon. SZDSZ delegates stressed that the affair of Romania's ethnic Hungarian community and the Hungarian-Romanian basic treaty were inseparable from each other. As for the delay in opening new border posts, Hrebenciuc said construction will begin between Battonya and Turnu, and between Mehkerek and Salonta, with further crossings in the offing. Coposu said his party sticks to the principles laid down in the 1918 Alba Iulia declaration stating that Romanian Hungarians are entitled to the same rights as the Romanians, with special regard to education, including the opportunity of pursuing higher studies in the native language.
