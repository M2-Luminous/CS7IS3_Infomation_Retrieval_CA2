Ernesto Samper, former economic development minister under President Cesar Gaviria, and favored to win his party's nomination for the presidential candidacy, said a fast one was pulled on the president and he asked himself if the one who did it was the U.S. Government or the Defense Ministry. He added that "fast one pulled on the president was unfortunately pulled on all Colombians, who feel we have been harmed by this undue interference by the United States." As for the reiterated official explanation that the largest contingent of troops, made up of 156 men stationed in Juan Chaco on the Pacific coast, came to build a school and a health center, he said it is "simply outrageous and no Colombian is willing to believe that story." Another Liberal Party presidential hopeful, Humberto de la Calle, much closer to Gaviria, said that "since before the Juan Chaco situation emerged, I asked for the suspension of the operation because just as I feared, it created an atmosphere of inadvisable suspense and suspicion." He pointed out that work on social projects can perfectly well be in the hands of the Colombian Army and he added that Gaviria's explanations for the case have created an atmosphere of confusion. "What I believe should be condemned are the half truths, the quasi clandestine way of handling it, and the absence of clear information for Colombians," he added.
