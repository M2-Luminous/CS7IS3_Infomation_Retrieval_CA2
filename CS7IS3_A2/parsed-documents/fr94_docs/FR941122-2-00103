FR941122-2-00103 FR941122-2-00078 11. Applicants seek an order to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on redemptions of Class A shares sold pursuant to a complete front-end sales load waiver applicable to large purchases in addition to a CDSC on certain redemptions of Class B and Class C shares and to waive such a CDSC in certain circumstances. The CDSC will not be imposed on redemptions of shares that were purchased more than a specified period (the ``CDSC Period'') prior to their redemption or that were derived from the reinvestment of distributions; or on an amount which represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for shares purchased during the period. Any CDSC will be imposed only on the lesser of the value of the shares redeemed (exclusive of reinvested distributions) or the total cost of such shares. In determining whether a CDSC is applicable, it is assumed, unless the shareholder otherwise specifically directs, that a redemption is made first of any shares in the shareholder's Fund account that are not subject to a CDSC, second of shares derived from reinvestment of dividends, third of shares held for a period longer than the CDSC Period, and fourth of shares held for a period no longer than the CDSC Period. In determining the rate of any applicable CDSC, it is assumed that shares held by the investor for the longest period of time within the CDSC Period are redeemed. No CDSC will be imposed on any shares issued by the Funds prior to the date of the order requested by this application except as allowed by the Prior Orders. 12. If a Fund waives or reduces the CDSC, such waiver or reduction will be uniformly applied to all offerees in the class specified. In waiving or reducing a CDSC, the Funds will comply with the requirements of rule 22d&hyph;1 under the Act as if such CDSC were a sales load. If the Directors/Trustees of a Fund determine to discontinue a waiver of a CDSC, the disclosure in the Fund's prospectus will be appropriately revised. Any Class A, Class B or Class C shares purchased prior to the termination of such waiver would be able to have the CDSC waived as provided in the Fund's prospectus as in effect at the time of the purchase of such shares. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request an exemptive order to the extent the proposed issuance and sale of any of the classes of shares might be deemed to result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) of the Act and to be prohibited by section 18(f)(1) of the Act and to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act. In addition, applicants request an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c) and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to implement the proposed CDSC arrangement. 2. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. The proposed arrangement will not involve borrowing and will not affect the Funds' assets or reserves; it also will not increase the speculative character of the shares in a Fund, since all the shares will participate in all of the Fund's income and all of the Fund's expenses (with the exception of the differing rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, transfer agency costs and Class Expenses, if any) on the basis of the relative net assets of the classes. 3. Under the Multiple Distribution System, mutuality of risk will be preserved with respect to all classes of shares in a Fund. Further, since all classes of shares will be redeemable at all times, no class of shares will have any preference or priority over any other class in a Fund in the usual sense (that is, no class will have distribution or liquidation preferences with respect to particular assets, no class will have any right to require that lapsed dividends be paid before dividends are declared on the class and no class will be protected by any reserve or other account). Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree that any order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 1. The Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund, and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares of a Fund will relate solely to: (a) the impact of the disproportionate rule 12b&hyph;1 fees allocated to each of the Class A, Class B and Class C shares of the Fund and the fact that the Class Y shares will not bear any rule 12b&hyph;1 fees; (b) the impact of the disproportionate transfer agency costs attributable to each of the Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares; (c) the different Class Expenses, if any, which shall be limited to the following expenses determined by the Directors/Trustees to be attributable to a specific class of shares: (i) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class, (ii) Commission registration fees incurred with respect to a specific class of shares, (iii) blue sky registration fees incurred with respect to a specific class of shares, (iv) the expenses of administrative personnel and services required to support the shareholders of a specific class, (v) litigation or other legal expenses relating to a specific class of shares, (vi) Directors/Trustees fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to a specific class of shares, (vii) accounting expenses relating to a specific class of shares; (viii) any fees imposed pursuant to a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan; and (ix) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that lawfully may be allocated to one class which shall be approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order; (d) the fact that the Class A, Class B and Class C shares will each vote separately as a class with respect to the Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plan and that the Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares will each vote separately as a class with respect to other matters for which separate class voting is appropriate under applicable law, provided that, if the Fund submits to a vote of both the Class A shareholders and Class B shareholders an amendment to the Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plan that would materially increase the amount to be paid thereunder with respect to the Class A shares, the Class A shareholders and the Class B shareholders will vote separately by class as provided in condition 2 below; (e) the different exchange privileges of the Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares; (f) the fact that only Class B shares will have a conversion feature; and (g) the designation of each class of shares of the Fund.
