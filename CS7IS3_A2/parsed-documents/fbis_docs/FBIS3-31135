The Slovak Republic signed today, as the seventh state of the postcommunist countries of Central and East Europe, the Partnership for Peace [PFP] program at NATO headquarters in Brussels. It was signed by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. Agata Stanekova asked Meciar what the significance of this document was: [Begin recording] [Stanekova] Prime minister, the Slovak Republic officially confirmed by its signature today its joining the Partnership for Peace program. What does the partnership offer to Slovakia and vice versa? [Meciar] The PFP offers certain guarantees. Above all, it is the condition of this partnership to accept human and citizens' rights, and, to prevent arguments about interpretation, when meeting Mr. Clinton, it was guaranteed that we understand them as individual rights. Another condition of the partnership is recognition of the current frontiers. This does not create any problems for us; on the contrary, we welcome it. The PFP provides the opportunity for political consultations. The PFP provides the opportunity, in case of a feeling of threat, to carry out consultations with the other countries of NATO, although it does not bind NATO countries to military support or joint action. The PFP offers the chance to build the Army so that its organizational structure corresponds to the structure of the NATO Armed Forces. It provides the opportunity to participate in military planning, but also finance, and it provides the opportunity to set up joint units and joint training. The Slovak side has expanded its offer of our arms industry because, sooner or later, the armies of NATO countries will unite their equipment, and we would like to take part in this process and to provide our production capacities. We have likewise offered to establish centers for the training of officers of the units, which will be common within NATO, in the Slovak Republic. Similarly, it will be possible to use training areas in our country. So, it is a process that has opened and has been prepared. We have stated our approach to the offer that we received, and, further, there will be talks at home about the treaty, which we should conclude and which will give rise to clear bilateral rules between Slovakia and NATO. [Stanekova] The signing of this document was the first step. If this treaty was signed, what should be the basis for specifying further steps? [Meciar] This was, in fact, an invitation to cooperation, which we accepted and signed. [passage omitted] For us it is important that a delegation of NATO high commissioners should come to our country soon. It has been promised by both Mr. Shalikashvili and U.S. representatives, and by the NATO secretary general. This delegation should have talks about the conditions of the treaty. After its conclusion, a bilateral treaty relationship will come into being. [passage omitted] The duration of this treaty will determine whether the country will be accepted as a member of NATO. The first step is behind us, and we have just started the second one. [Stanekova] Despite all of this, some senior politicians, when speaking about new countries joining NATO, usually mention only Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic, leaving out Slovakia. [Meciar] This has happened to some politicians. However, yesterday, for instance, I met German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, who had also done this. We have clarified everything, and his immediate reaction was to invite the defense minister of the Slovak Republic to visit him, and he himself visited the Slovak Republic. Sometimes we have blown out of proportion something that has not always been done on purpose, taking it as a political precedent or a political intention--though this has never, in fact, been the case. I can say with pleasure that everything was clarified and that Slovakia is being fully accepted and fully relied upon. Our geopolitical position clearly earns us such a position that we cannot be left out. Interest in the Slovak Republic is going to grow gradually. However, we have to take into account that the Federal Republic of Germany shares its borders with Poland and the Czech Republic, and their joint military exercises may take place there. Despite this, there is no reason to believe they are not interested in Slovakia. [passage omitted] [end recording]
