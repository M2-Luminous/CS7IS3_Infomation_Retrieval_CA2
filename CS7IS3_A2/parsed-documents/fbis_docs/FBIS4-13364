The editor said these accusations are ridiculous and part of a tendentious media campaign against Iraq. Tehran radio today announced that a huge explosion of a booby- trapped car occurred in central Tehran today. Some time after this false accusation by the Iranian regime's organs, REUTER and the international news media said an Islamic group opposing the Iranian regime has claimed responsibility for the explosion, and that this group's headquarters is in Pakistan.
