Arzalluz made these statements in Barcelona at the conclusion of the meeting of the PNV and Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC) Executive Committees, at which the two Christian Democratic parties decided to demand of the government that it drop its centralist criteria in European building and allow the presence of representatives of the Catalan and Basque governments in Community institutions. Arzalluz showed himself "optimistic," albeit with reservations, when referring to the negotiation with the Socialists on the pending transfers [of areas of responsibility] to the Basque Country, and so asked Felipe Gonzalez to continue contacts in order to find a "political solution." The Basque leader said that the PNV's observance of the Constitution depends on the implementation of the autonomy statute, and so, if this process is not carried out, a "very grave" situation will be reached. Arzalluz also pointed out that the agreement on the statute had as its background observance of the constitutional system by the PNV, since the party did not approve the Constitution. In view of this he warned that "we cannot allow implementation of the statute not being completed" in the current legislative term, the government's "refusing to implement it," or, if it does so, subsequently "undermining" it through laws, decrees, or Constitutional Court rulings. The meeting between Union and the PNV -- the first of the meetings which will henceforth be held every six months -- was basically aimed at establishing a joint stance on the presence of Catalonia and the Basque Country in the European Union. In this connection the two parties believe that the Spanish state is the "most centralist" in its European role and demand that the autonomous governments' presence in Community institutions be ensured, and also that the autonomous communities be able to take part in the state's political stance on European issues, as is the case in Belgium and Germany, for instance. To achieve this, Union leader Josep Antoni Duran Lleida explained, the electoral law for the European elections must be amended, replacing the single constituency covering the whole of Spain with regional constituencies. They also demand the involvement of the Catalan and Basque governments in the allocation of Community funds, and the political normalization of the missions which both autonomous communities have abroad. Arzalluz asserted that the European integration process is being carried out with "centralist criteria" and that it is being used to enable the central government to "take back power," since "a standardization process is being attempted in Spain in the name of European unity." In addition, the two parties reiterated their intention to put forward a joint program in the European elections since their European deputies are in the same group in the European parliament. UDC and the PNV did not raise at this meeting the possibility of running together in the European elections, as the Basque party proposed in 1989 -- a request opposed by Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC). Arzalluz said that "we are already running together, albeit not on the same list," although he asserted that the Basques "are not coming to separate anything in Catalonia," while Duran asserted that Union "gives priority to the coalition with CDC" and rules out running with the PNV, even though he still believes that "we would like to run together."
