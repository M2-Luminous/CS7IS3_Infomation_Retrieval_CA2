FBIS4-6914 "dreas080__a94001" FBIS-EAS-94-080-A Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Pentagon Seeks Cooperation in Developing TMD Pentagon Seeks Cooperation in Developing TMD OW2604083394 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 9--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2604083394 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] It was revealed on 23 April that the U.S. Department of Defense [DOD] has briefed the Japanese defense industry about the development costs concerning the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) project, which will amount to $30 billion (approximately 3 trillion yen). According to a source concerned with the industry, the DOD has asked the Japanese industry "to participate in the development of the TMD, or provide advanced technology equivalent to the amount of the development costs." Under the TMD system, reconnaissance satellites and other devices confirm the launching of missiles by an enemy, then multistage pursuit missiles shoot them down. Taking into consideration that the DPRK (North Korea) has succeeded in test launching a ballistic missile the range of which can reach Japan, the United States has indicated its proposal to the Defense Agency for joint development of the TMD system between Japan and the United States. The two countries are now holding working-level discussions on the proposal. The Japanese defense industry has suffered from a decrease in business due to restraints on defense expenses. As stated by an executive of a major missile-related company, for this reason each defense-related company is considering whether it is possible to make good use of its technology, stating that "the TMD is an attractive project because it will lead to new business projects." However, it is not easy for them to provide the United States with technology equivalent to development costs totaling $30 billion. A person concerned with the industry said: "It is feared that cooperation may not be limited to technology of liquid crystals and compound materials, which the United States has originally demanded." Moreover, it is expected the United States will divert Japan's technology to other purposes, such as civilian production. According to an executive of a defense-related company, because it is reportedly "difficult for both the Japanese Government and private sector" to share a considerable amount of the development costs due to the financial conditions and management environment of private companies, Japan will likely face difficulties in dealing with the U.S. proposal.
