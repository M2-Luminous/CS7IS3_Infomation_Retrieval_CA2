FBIS4-46243 "jptot023__l94029" JPRS-TOT-94-023-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 13 June 1994 LATIN AMERICA PERU Shining Path Anniversary Strike `Total Failure' Shining Path Anniversary Strike `Total Failure' PY0206005994 PY0206005994 BFN [Editorial Report] Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish on 18 May 1994, pages 16 and 17, carries a 1700-word article dated 17 May by Eladio Arcaya who evaluates the armed strike ordered by the Shining Path, SL, to commemorate the 14th anniversary of its first "terrorist" action. For the first time in 14 years, the people of the Upper Huallaga region did not obey the armed strike ordered by the SL. They went about their business as usual in the midst of an impressive deployment of combined police and Army security forces along the Marginal highway from Tingo Maria to Aucayacu. Officials ordered a curfew in Pucayacu from 2100 to 0600 after four people were murdered on 15 May by a SL unit that looted the town, taking food and medicine. The SL unit came from Upper Pucayacu where it has a camp. A military patrol with help from the population cleaned "subversive" slogans from the walls in Madre Mia. The peasants no longer fear the armed strike and went to work the land. Others opened their businesses, took their children to school, and carried out their normal activities like any other day. Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish on 18 May 1994, page 17, carries an unattributed 800-word article on the "total failure" of the SL armed strike ordered in Lima. The people paid no attention to the call and went to work as usual. Despite some cuts in the public transportation system because bus owners wanted to protect their units early in the morning, most Lima residents managed to get to work. Police and Army units patrolled roads and highways. Some "subversives" managed only to throw a few fire crackers. Security forces captured five "subversives" and confiscated weapons and explosives. In the San Juan de Lurigancho district, the Army provided buses to take passangers to the university campus. Early on the morning of 17 May a bomb exploded at the Interbanc branch in the San Martin de Porres district. On the same day at 1400, policemen of the Pachacutec Police Post arrested three alleged "terrorists" who reportedly murdered a woman who was selling fruit in the market of San Juan de Miraflores. The police found two 9 mm Browning pistols in their posession.
