[Sha'th] I welcome you and wish you, too, many happy returns. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, the visit is perhaps a surprise short visit to the Gaza Strip? What is the purpose of this visit? [Sha'th] First of all, I have come to see my homeland. This is the first time I have entered Palestine since 1964. My last visit to Gaza was in 1964. Therefore, this is a chance for me, even for a few moments, to see this beloved homeland, Gaza, and its skies and land, and these great people in Gaza. That's why when the opportunity presented itself to see Gaza, I did not let it pass. Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] wanted to reassure himself about the situation. He gave me some money that is needed by the police force in Gaza. Let us say that it is a small present so things will begin in the proper perspective and then, God willing, all necessary funds will flow when international material assistance becomes available. We will also meet with the brothers at brother Abu-'Ammar's request to see about, at least, the preliminary and necessary needs after the first week of our forces' arrival and the establishment of our authority in preparation for the arrival of brother Abu-'Ammar and the brothers in the command. God willing, I will be with them. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, how do you assess the implementation on the ground of the agreement between the Israeli and Palestinian side? [Sha'th] With all sincerity, I see that matters are proceeding far better than in the best of expectations. Of course, I believe matters are going this well because our Palestinian people, at least here in Gaza and in Jericho, want this agreement to succed. There is complete popular cooperation with the Palestinian police. They have adopted the police force. Let me say that the people, with their generosity and sincere national sense have adopted their soldiers and their police force. They are doing all they can to enable them carry out their duties as easily as possible. I have noticed, too, that, in reality, there are no large problems concerning coordination between the Palestinian police force and the withdrawing Israeli forces. I believe the beginning of work is positive on all levels. We hope we will be able to offer the necessary support to complete the requirements for success. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, perhaps you do not know, but an incident took place at Erez junction. Two IDF soldiers were fired on and killed. The perpetrators fled into the autonomy area in Gaza. [Sha'th] No doubt, there will be incidents. However, what is important is that the will should exist to overcome them and to gradually prevent all acts of violence and move toward real peace, which our people and the Israeli people undoubtedly need. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th from Gaza, thank you very much and many happy returns, and welcome. [Sha'th] Thank you, and through you I send greetings to all the sons of our people throughout our beloved Palestine on the 'Id and to our brothers in the Galilee, the Negev, Yafo, and everywhere.
