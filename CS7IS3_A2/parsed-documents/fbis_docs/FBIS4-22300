Baruch Gur, a leader of the Jewish Agency responsible for the immigration to Israel of Jews from the USSR, declared on Sunday (26 December) that Zhirinovskiy, who is today considered a well-known anti-Semite, once took steps to emigrate to Israel. The leader of the nationalists forwarded papers confirming that his father, Volf by name, had been a Jew. "It was perfectly clear that his father was a Jew," Mr. Gur confirmed. "In 1980 V. Zhirinovskiy was an active member of the Shalom Jewish culture group and he worked actively in a group of Soviet Zionists up to 1989, that is, two years before offering himself at the Russian presidential elections in 1991." I came across this piece in the very popular newspaper LE PARISIEN in the issue for 28 December last. The piece is headed "ZHIRINOVSKIY WANTED TO EMIGRATE TO ISRAEL." On 29 December this same piece (its source is a REUTERS dispatch: "Interview With Baruch Gur in Israel") was published by LE MONDE. The LE MONDE version specifies that Zhirinovskiy "took the first steps toward emigration to the Jewish state in 1983." In the evening of 3 January, in response to the question put directly by the anchor of French Television's Channel 1: "Was your father a Jew? You wanted to leave for Israel?" Zhirinovskiy declined to answer. This news left French public opinion, the "right," thunderstruck. I confess that I myself am catching it now for it was I who had taken it upon myself to introduce Zhirinovskiy to the French right and had organized his meeting with Jean-Marie Le Pen, president of the National Front, in September 1992. Censure has been rained down on me for the fact that I introduced to their environment "a Jew posing as a Nazi." While leaving this definition to the conscience of my accusers, I am forced to agree that a Jew masquerading as a Russian nationalist is an extremely unhealthy, pathological phenomenon. How all of us (the electorate, Russia, Vladimir Volfovich himself included) will extricate ourselves from this pathological business I cannot imagine. Nonetheless, I shall cite several exculpatory facts in my defense. I was never a member of the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party]. I was a member of Vladimir Volfovich's shadow cabinet for just several months. I left Zhirinovskiy without a scandal and formed, having united with dissidents of his LDP (they include a good half of the shadow cabinet: Kurbskiy, Arkhipov, Zharikov, and even A. Mitrofanov, who is now very close to Zhirinovskiy), the National Radical Party back on 22 November 1992. Why did I leave Zhirinovskiy? The LDP is Vladimir Volfovich alone, and the party members, his mute servants. Back at the time of the joint trip to Krasnodar Kray and while observing him daily during the trip to Paris I ascertained little by little that alongside undoubted political talent there happily reside in Zhirinovskiy total unscrupulousness and political recklessness. For example, while promising loudly at a mass meeting in a Cossack village clubhouse to rid the Cossacks of the Armenian mafia, he swore the following day in my presence to a representative of the Armenian mafia to defend Armenian interests in exchange for cash transactions beneficial to the party. After hundreds of such instances, I realized that Zhirinovskiy is an adventurer. But we were all involved in the common struggle against Yeltsin, and I did not, therefore, consider myself entitled to attack an ally at that time. Simply Theater! An article by Lev Aleynik from Moscow appeared on 15 January 1993 in the newspaper RUSSKAYA MYSL, which is published in Paris. It adduced information to the effect that Zhirinovskiy had several years ago been an activist in the Jewish movement. "Stored at the Shalom Theater," Aleynik concludes his article, "where the vaad is still billeted, are the archives of the Jewish movement, which had emerged from the underground. There is among the multitude of documents the first actual list of telephone numbers of the board (of the Jewish Culture Society--E.L.), which had just been elected. There figures on this list beneath the number 12 the present 'defender of the Russians' Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy." Aleynik's article dealt the final blow to my belief that Zhirinovskiy is a politician. A man who in several years had swapped three ideologies--and mutually inimical ones at that! (following his unsuccessful career as an active Zionist, he was for some time a "democrat" also)--is undoubtedly an adventurer, I said to myself. And I wrote last February the article "Perversions of Nationalism," part two being headed "Miscarriage of Nationalism." The article was devoted entirely to Zhirinovskiy and my relations with him. Publication of the article against the "lawyer" in the complex world of patriotic and democratic newspapers was a difficult business. Many editors refused to publish it. PRAVDA held up the article all summer. Only toward the end of summer was it finally carried in NOVYY VZGLYAD No. 117. Unfortunately, NOVYY VZGLYAD is distributed mainly in Moscow, and the influence of "Perversions of Nationalism" was limited, therefore. Zhirinovskiy did not fail to respond to me, carefully skirting his Jewish activism, in NOVYY VZGLYAD also. Point Five Today, when the West has itself been preoccupied with Zhirinovskiy's nationality, no one can censure me for racism, and it is possible to reflect without encumbrance on the history of Vladimir Volfovich--shameful for Russia and Russians. Whereas the nationality of Gaydar is a matter of indifference to me and it is all the same that he is an exponent of nonnational, mondialist ideas, the nationality of Vladimir Volfovich and his papa--Volf--is important. A Jew masquerading as a Russian nationalist--THIS is a sickness, pathology, THIS IS TOO MUCH. It is the sickness simultaneously of both Vladimir Volfovich and Russian society. Each time I see him, reddish-haired and vulgarly arguing with a small-town accent about "Russians," whom he will defend and fix up, I am repelled, so unnatural is the part he is playing (I would like to know how the leaders of the extreme-right parties of Western countries, whom he has only just embraced, feel. The Germans?). But what has happened is by no means an accident but a tragi-comic normality. If the Ivanovs themselves cannot organize in a nationalist party, there will always be a adroit native of Minsk, Pinsk, or Alma-Ata [Almaty] who will conceive a desire to take advantage of their national passions. It is clear that Vladimir Volfovich is in a state of panic fear. For he knows that if the news media pick up on, if they conceive a desire to pick up on, the information unearthed in Israel and the Shalom Theater and if they assemble into a single pile the evidence of his Zionist activism comrades, Russians will understand that Vladimir Volfovich is a political operator and that he should not be on the political stage, and he will be swept away forever. In any event, the saber or the Cossack's pike is the lot of all false Dmitriys. But Vladimir Volfovich's impudence is stronger than his fear. Meanwhile we will see the struggle of Vladimir Volfovich and Boris Nikolayevich (even if they become allies). Beware, Vladimir Volfovich, Boris Nikolayevich, he has bested Mikhail Sergeyich and Aleksandr Vladimirovich (Rutskoy) and even Ruslan Imranovich, also an eastern individual, like yourself. And Boris Nikolayevich has tanks.... Fire-Breathing Dragon The backstage of politics is unknown to the voter. He is not a frequenter of it, he is not admitted there. A pity, because the future has already existed in the past and has only been hiding, undeveloped, here backstage, but it, the future, could have been seen here at the start of 1992 even. All today's contradictions have already existed. Even then the moderate-pink Zyuganov was driving out the bright-red heroic Anpilov from the meetings of the "respectable" opposition. Even then the shifty Vladimir Volfovich was receiving his first money from sympathetic businessmen--boy bankers in colored coats--and those whom the Yeltsinites had short-changed in the shareout of the plump pie--Russia. In order to understand what the future has in store for us we need first of all to have a correct view of our present. Those who are happy with the result of the elections--"Gaydar and his Yeltsin team really got a faceful!"--are rejoicing in vain. And the nationalists have to see, despite the clear weakening of the president's "boys in pink pants," the next disturbing reality: The antinational forces have increased both in importance and in power and that this dragon now has three heads. Onto the lisping and guttural Gaydar-Yavlinskiy-Yeltsin demo-head have adhered fast on heavy necks two new ones. The boffola physiognomy of the Zhirinovskiy-Kashpirovskiy self-interested persons bares its teeth in all its vulgar obscenity: "Zhirinovskiy and Russia Corporation," the head likes to gorge! The pink, replete, "weak-communist" head elongated by the tie and gray suit of the deputy and ex-apparatchik of the CPSU, peaceably dissembles, yawning, the head of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. But there flash in the yawn now and again sharp little teeth. The fact that the heads fight one another from time to time means absolutely nothing. These are the heads of a single beast. The smashing of parliament was a major defeat for the nationalists and, consequently, Russia and Russians. We should not, pouting with hysterical fervor, be trying to prove the opposite. Yes, a defeat, a rout. Parliament contained an ill-assorted crowd of fellow travelers united only by a common opposition to Yeltsin and Company. There was no chief, there were leaders (and all leaders are, for the most part, accidental). There were no weapons. There were few--yes, few--people resolved to fight and capable of fighting. And only the national radicals were both capable and resolved. The nationalist youth. The authorities ascertained unerringly who posed a physical danger to them and, immediately following the smashing of parliament, banned some of the radical parties. Another part was captiously sifted through the malicious sieve of the Central Election Commission.... The result: 13 nationalist parties and associations were not admitted to the electorate. Yet "our" Zhirinovskiy and the mild slate of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation headed by Zyuganov were admitted. For a whole year--from the fall of 1992--Vladimir Volfovich's behavior was exemplary. He took part like a well-behaved schoolboy in the work of Yeltsin's Constitutional Commission. He did not take part in the events of 21 September-4 October. True to the instinct of the self-interested person, he attempted on each occasion to sell himself to both, it is true: He grieved over "the best officers who died at the White House" and in another speech justified the actions of the president. Zhirinovskiy had by the time of the elections arrived wholly as one of them, a useful ally of Yeltsin for the adoption of the constitution, and for this reason the Central Election Commission turned a blind, benevolent eye to the lists of signatures for nomination of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. Janus Wolfovich Few people have noticed this, but Zhirinovskiy has always cultivated two images simultaneously. Because there are two Zhirinovskiys: for the rich and for the poor, if you like. The LDPR's official program (all versions, including Zhirinovskiy's draft Constitution of Russia and a concise exposition of the principles of the LDPR, are dated April 1993) is a respectable democratic program, which promises both privatization and the transfer of title to the land. The fact that "the LDPR is a party that rejects shock therapy" sways no one today because it, the shock, is rejected now by both Yavlinskiy and Chernomyrdin himself. The fact that the LDPR "is for the gradual reconstitution of the Russian state" is also a trite statement in 1994. It is, on the other hand, very interesting that clause 2 of the Constitution of Russia of the LDPR reads: "All power in Russia belongs to the people, which exercise it...." Which people, Vladimir Volfovich? There is no place in your constitution, as in Yeltsin's also, for the Russian people. But Russians constitute 85 percent of the population of Russia, it is they who created Russian civilization and the state. How can this be? This, for comparison, is how the Constitution of the French Republic begins: "The French people solemnly proclaim...." The point is that the LDPR program was written not for Untermenschen (let them sit quietly, they have, after all, been told that they will be defended by the brokers and second-hand dealers! "Russians and the small peoples on the territory of Russia and the USSR" will be defended by the "Zhirinovskiy and Russia Corporation") but was written for the boy bankers in colored coats. One such boy, in green, paid for the visit of Zhirinovskiy and his team to Paris in September 1992. On that visit, incidentally, Zhirinovskiy called me one morning and expressed a desire to meet with... Rothschild! "Which one?" I asked. "There are dozens of Rothschilds...." "The main one, the banker".... The LDPR program does not encroach on the social reality engendered by Yeltsin and his "boys." Crowds of poor people and Mercedes and dying plants, where the workers have not received their wretched wages for several months, and commercial banks, which are being built like mushrooms after a bloody rain, will in the same way coexist. Only the national president will be a former Jewish activist, not a former secretary of the Central Committee. For the Untermenschen, on the other hand, for the people, who are not in the constitution even, Zhirinovskiy employs another program--of stupefaction. Geopolitical daydreams evoked on television. Russians appear in them, but as... the soldier Vladimir Volfovich. These soldiers are washing their boots in the waters of southern seas, avenging Vladimir Volfovich, and declaring war on Germany. They are threatening Poland, China, Iran, Turkey.... They are threatening Japan with a repetition of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Vladimir Volfovich has for three years now been promising to slip the Balts radioactive waste. All these totally impracticable pieces of high-sounding nonsense (it would be difficult to cope even with Ukraine were matters really to reach the point of war) are evoking a response in Russian hearts (they did so both in June 1991 and in November-December 1993). Humiliated since 1985, the Russian electorate has with pleasure given itself over to nostalgic daydreams about lost power, about imperial might. Participating unwittingly in the performances of television nostalgia abundantly paid for by the boy bankers, the Russian electorate generously showed Zhirinovskiy and his corporation its gratitude. But all this is fraudulent, daydreams for the poor. Zhirinovskiy is no more the enemy of the West than Yeltsin. One Samuel Francis writes in THE WASHINGTON POST of 28 December 1993 in the article "We Are Turning Zhirinovskiy Into an Arch-Enemy Wholly Without Cause": "It is possible that Mr. Zhirinovskiy is an enemy, and we should then be his enemies, but, his crude mouth aside, he has up to now done nothing against the United States or, generally speaking, against anyone else either." Backing the Wrong Horse Whereas Zhirinovskiy is today a greater evil for Russia than Yeltsin, the third head of the beast is less dangerous. It is dangerous only in that it wants some power and will bite to death for it! I want to say to Zyuganov: "Gennadiy Andreyevich! Stop calling yourself a communist! Stop exploiting the communist voter! The basis of communist doctrine are two fundamental concepts: proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. You and your party of gray suits, on the other hand, have long since jettisoned in practice the dictatorship of the proletariat and proletarian revolution. Without them, though, you and your hierarchy of former and present nomenklatura types are, at best, compromisers and social democrats, at worst, impostors, not communists. And in the Duma you will logically be accomplices of either Yeltsin or Zhirinovskiy. Neither is honorable." In November, in the area of Krasnaya Presnya, I saw traced out on a fence in red letters: "Zyuganov, where is your brother Anpilov?" This says it all. The Red Brigades in Italy once went even further. They would knee-cap professionals of the "red bourgeoisie," crippling them for life. Considering them bigger enemies than the ruling Christian Democrats. Since the "red bourgeoisie" had betrayed the proletariat. The unsophisticated Russian electorate has backed the wrong horse repeatedly. After the first clash with the "democratic" Special Militia on Tverskaya on 23 February 1992, the people's masses, beaten by democratic nightsticks, poured from the demonstration and cursed among themselves, admitting that they had voted in June 1992 [dates as published] for Yeltsin. "We brought it on ourselves." It had taken the people seven months to understand their mistake. Watching the small-town bazaar, the Sholom-Aleykhem play put on in the State Duma by the "defender of the Russians," possessed with megalomania and having lost his head at his success, and his team of "ites," how much time will you need, blind ones, to recover your sight? To understand that Vladimir Volfovich wants to meet Rothschild.
