The three seriously wounded people were carried by their friends onto a train bound for Guangzhou and died during the journey. The 15 February accident was the most serious railway accident since the founding of the PRC. Shortly after the accident occurred, Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua, two vice premiers of the State Council, separately inspected the area where the accident occurred. Zou Jiahua went to the top floor of Hengyang's Jindu Hotel to look down at the railway station. After that, he told the authorities concerned to draw a serious lesson from the accident and properly arrange the spring passenger transportation every year. He also instructed Hengyang to more quickly complete the project of transforming and expanding the railway station. After the accident, the investigation group formed by the city party committee, the city government, the railway station, and the public utilities department reached announced their initial conclusions, pointing out that the railway station's backward facilities and poor management caused the tragedy. The head of the transportation department concerned was detained and may be brought to justice. The railway station's party secretary, Zhu, and director, Yin, were both dismissed from office. Two to three years ago, the Guangzhou Railway Group Corporation formulated a plan for transforming the Hengyang Railway Station. In order to protect economic returns, however, the city party committee, the city government, and the railway station kept passing the buck, and the project made very slow progress. The city party committee and the city government leaders, therefore, had to bear certain responsibility for the tragedy. The Hengyang Railway Station was built in the 1950's and 1960's, and the facilities were rather substantial when it was completed. Along with the development of the mainland's reforms and opening up and after the economic changes of the past 30 to 40 years, however, the railway station became rather outdated. Over the last few years, a large number of migrant rural laborers moved south to seek jobs, and, around the Chinese New Year, over 1 million migrant laborers returned home to hold family reunions and celebrate the festival. This added huge passenger transportation pressure to the Hengyang Railway Station. Therefore, expanding the railway station brooks no delay. During last year's Spring Festival, this reporter visited the Hengyang Railway Station and found that, in addition to the backward facilities, the railway station was also poorly managed and was in a chaotic condition. It was very difficult for passengers to buy tickets, and many passengers had to wait one or two days standing in line before they could get any. The public security officers and military troops responsible for maintaining order often took bribes and bought tickets for bribe-givers by jumping the line. Last year, this reporter witnessed a fight between two groups of security guards and policemen. Reportedly, there was also an economic factor behind the authorities' unwillingness to immediately expand the railway station -- they wanted to earn more money from the crowds of migrant laborers. Because a large number of migrant laborers were stranded in the railway station before and after the Chinese New Year, they had to get accommodation and food and might go shopping, and all such consumption would bring substantial income to the railway station. After the accident occurred, the authorities sent more people to work in the railway station, and this shortened the waiting period and improved the order, but the railway station's economic returns decreased. Some local residents told this reporter that, although the tragedy caused heavy casualties and this was unfortunate, the accident also had a positive effect, because the authorities learned a bloody lesson and decided to speed up the railway station's expansion.
