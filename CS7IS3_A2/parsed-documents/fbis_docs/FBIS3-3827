Philip Hui-Ho Cheng, 64, is expected to return to Hong Kong Friday from Changsha, where he was detained after his business partner in the mainland decided to withdraw from an investment project and wanted his money back. Cheng's passport was returned to him on Tuesday after a court in Changsha found his business partner had falsified business documents in order to convince court officials to arrest him. Cheng was arrested and during a three-day interrogation in a detention centre headed by his partner's brother-in-law was told to return the money immediately or face a jail term.
