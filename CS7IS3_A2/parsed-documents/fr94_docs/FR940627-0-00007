FR940627-0-00007 FR940627-0-00002 The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing AD 74&hyph;13&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;1870, and by adding a new airworthiness directive to read as follows: 94&hyph;13&hyph;10 Piper Aircraft Corporation: Amendment 39&hyph;8951; Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;60&hyph;AD; Supersedes AD 74&hyph;13&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;1870. Applicability: The following model and serial number airplanes, certificated in any category, that have not incorporated Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit) on all four stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings: ␣ 1Models 1Serial Nos. PA24&hyph;180, PA24&hyph;250 and PA24&hyph;260 24&hyph;1 through 24&hyph;5047. PA24&hyph;400 26&hyph;2 through 26&hyph;148. PA30 30&hyph;1 through 30&hyph;2000. PA39 39&hyph;1 through 39&hyph;155. Note 1: Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit), may have been incorporated through compliance with AD 75&hyph;27&hyph;08, Amendment 39&hyph;2624. This AD requires inspecting the rivets of the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings, and incorporating the referenced kit if any rivets are found misaligned. Airplanes incorporating this kit on all four stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings are not affected by this AD. Compliance: Required within the next 100 hour time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished, and thereafter as indicated. To prevent loss of pitch control because of looseness of the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings, which could result in loss of control of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Inspect the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings for looseness by accomplishing the following: (1) Remove the tail cone and right rear aft fuselage access door. (2) Grasp the stabilator tip and shake the tip from left to right and up and down. Note 2: Piper Service Bulletin 411A, dated April 10, 1974, specifies these same procedures for inspecting the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings. (b) If looseness is found during the inspection specified in paragraph (a) of this AD, prior to further flight, incorporate Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit) on the affected fitting, and reinstall the tail cone and right rear aft fuselage access door. (c) If looseness is not found during the inspection specified in paragraph (a) of this AD, prior to further flight, reinstall the tail cone and right rear aft fuselage access door, and reinspect the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings for looseness at intervals not to exceed 100 hours TIS until Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit) is incorporated on all four stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings. (d) Incorporating Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit) on all four stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings is considered terminating action for the inspection requirement of this AD. (e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (f) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an equivalent level of safety may be approved by the Manager, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), 1669 Phoenix Parkway, Suite 210C, Atlanta, Georgia 30349. The request shall be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Atlanta ACO. Note 3: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Atlanta ACO. (g) All persons affected by this directive may obtain copies of the document referred to herein upon request to the Piper Aircraft Corporation, 2926 Piper Drive, Vero Beach, Florida 32960; or may examine this document at the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. (h) This amendment (39&hyph;8951) supersedes AD 74&hyph;13&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;1870. (i) This amendment (39&hyph;8951) becomes effective on August 12, 1994. Issued in Kansas City, Missouri, on June 17, 1994. Barry D. Clements, Manager, Small Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
