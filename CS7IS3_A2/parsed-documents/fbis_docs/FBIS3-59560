The POLPAK network consists of 18 exchange offices located in Poland's principal cities (Warsaw, Katowice, Krakow, Lublin, Wroclaw, Poznan, Szczecin, Gdansk, Olsztyn, Bialystok, Biala Podlaska, Rzeszow, Nowy Sacz, Bielsko, Lodz, Jelenia Gora, Zielona Gora, Koszalin). The total capacity of this network is 1200 ports. Its management center is located in Warsaw. At this time the network has 4 analog direct (X.75) links to the U.S.A. France, Germany, Great Britain respectively and more than 40 tandem links to practically the whole world. Sequential connections are made in the coordinating channel. Subscribers to the POLPAK network can be connected to it directly through a permanent line or remotely through a switched telephone or telex network. In the case of synchronous direct links (X.25) the transmission speed is up to 9600 bit/s and in the case of asynchronous ones (X.28) the transmission speed is 600 bit/s, 1200 bit/s, or 2400 bit/s. Remote subscribers can in the case of synchronous transmission (X.32) count on a speed of 2400 bit/s, in the case of asynchronous transmission the speed also being 2400 bit/s. The transmission speed along international links is now 9600 bit/s, but plans for transmission at a speed of 64 kbit/s have already been purchased. The throughput capacity of the exchange offices is 1400 packets per second. Basic technical parameters of the POLPAK network: standard packet length - 128 symbols standard frequency of packet receipt confirmation - every second packet maximum number of closed groups of users a subscriber can belong to - 3 large selection of network facilities access by authorization only to subscribers with necessary identifiers. As has already been indicated, the POLPAK network covers the entire country and, through international links with packet networks in other countries, facilitates data transmission to and from practically all subscribers to these networks worldwide. Unlike other telecommunication services, moreover, the rate for switched virtual connections within the "POLPAK" network does not depend on the distance between subscribers. The bill for calls depends on the time of day: It is much smaller for calls made during night hours and non-business days. Therefore data transmission is cheaper over a packet network than over leased or telephone lines, especially when the distances are longer. The advantages of the "POLPAK" network are: - certainty of error-free data transmission - possibility of transmitting data of various lengths and at various speeds - possibility of protecting data against unauthorized access from outside - availability of network facilities such as closed groups of users - blockage of incoming and outgoing calls - possibility of reverse charging - automatic readdressation of calls - transmission of brief messages (alarms) - access to network for mobile subscribers - negotiation of transmission parameters If very high reliability is required, a subscriber can become a multiple one. Such a subscriber is connected to at least two POLPAK exchange offices. When there is trouble in one of them, the subscriber can continue making and taking calls. Using the POLPAK network, the subscriber can thus communicate with any other subscribers at any time. Outlook for Development of "POLPAK" Network Development of the POLPAK packet switching network will be oriented toward its technical characteristics and availability of services. Improvement of technical characteristics and better coverage of Poland's territory will be achieved in several steps. The first step will be installation of new exchange offices in cities such as Bydgoszcz, Radom, Kielce, and Czestochowa. In other cities requiring it (like Warsaw, Gdansk, or Katowice) growing into larger clusters, there will be installed X.25 concentrators. The second step will be raising the speed of digital interoffice or intranetwork transmission between the POLPAK's principal exchange offices to 64 kb/s. Toward the end of 1995 there will be started up a digital skeleton (tandem) network with 2 Mbit/s capability covering Poland's principal cities and operating by the Frame Relay protocol. It is to be kept in mind however that, from the user's point of view, access to the network at the 9.6 kb/s level will for X.25 subscribers still remain the principal bottle neck for a rather long time, because of the characteristics of the existing access network, even though channels with 64 kb/s capacity will be made available to users wherever a city network is in good technical condition. One way to avoid problems of the access network will be the planned hand-over by the Polish Telecommunications Ltd of their VSAT terminals. The user of such a terminal will be able not only to reach the POLPAK network, and a maximum speed of 64 kb/s to wit, but also to build private networks with the aid VSAT facilities. The only services now provided by the POLPAK network are "pure" transmission. By the end of 1993, however, Polish Telecommunications Ltd intends to introduce Electronic Mail X.400/X.500 accessible (connected) to all network subscribers. Purchase of a new user-friendly system which will facilitate cooperation with ISDN network and will include an electronic document interchange (EDI) module. Cooperation between Electronic Mail and Other Facilities Interconnections between packet switching network, telephone network, telex network, ISDN network through a E-Mail computer. Economics of Data Transmission over POLPAK Network Services obtained by use of the POLPAK network subscribers are billed on a monthly basis.
