Starting from the provincial capital of Nanchang in the south and ending at Jiujiang, a port city on the Chang Jiang in the north, the industrial corridor is expected to become the pillar of the local economy in the foreseeable future. The corridor's total industrial output value topped 26 billion yuan last year, with a growth of about 40 percent over that of 1992. The amount of foreign investment utilized, which was 135 million yuan, has also more than doubled that of the previous year. First established in 1992, the corridor has witnessed a conspicuous improvement in its investment environment since then. Nanchang-Jiujiang first-rate highway and the second phase of Jiujiang electricity factory project have been put into operation in succession. The 2,780-meter-long Nanchang Bridge over the Ganjiang has also opened to traffic, alleviating local traffic jams. Thirty-seven communication projects have been completed and the number of computer-controlled telephone sets installed have reached 143,500. The eight provincial development zones along the industrial corridor totally earmarked 200 million yuan for infrastructure constructions last year. By now, blessed with the best transportation and communication conditions and most advanced energy industry in the province, regions along the corridor have aroused interest of more and more foreign investors. In 1993, newly-approved foreign-invested projects reached 764, with a contracted investment of 610 million U.S. dollars. Among them, 145 have started business and been put into operation and 250 of them are under construction.
