[Al-Iryani] Thank you. [Al-Jundi] Concerning the conditions in Yemen and the fierce clashes between northern and southern forces, without pointing the blame at anyone, how can we contain the situation? [Al-Iryani] I assure you that the northern forces are not alone. Several southern brigades are fighting alongside the northern forces. Other southern brigades have declared their loyalty to the lawful government. The situation will be contained once everyone shows respect for the Constitution and the lawful government and once the Armed Forces obey the orders of the state and their supreme commander. [Al-Jundi] Some people say that weapons will not achieve a solution and that a political settlement must be brokered. [Al-Iryani] Of course, all wars end with a political solution, regardless of their outcome. We welcome any political solution in the context of Yemeni unity and constitutional legitimacy. The Armed Forces should follow the orders of the state, not those of a party or an insurgent wing of a party. [Al-Jundi] Concerning a political settlement, do you think that the Yemeni Presidential Council's rejection of any mediation has helped a political solution? [Al-Iryani] I think this is a distortion. The Presidential Council has not rejected mediation. What it rejected was the internationalization of the crisis, its transformation into an international issue, and the dispatch of Arab or international troops to Yemen to separate the fighters. This is what the president told the House of Representatives. Some people twisted these words to make it seem as if he was rejecting mediation. What we reject is the internationalization of the conflict and its transformation from a conflict between a legitimate government and an insurgent group into a conflict between two states. This is unacceptable for us. It would be so in any other Arab or non-Arab country. [Al-Jundi] Since we are discussing mediation, yesterday, Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah visited Egypt. And you are currently in Saudi Arabia together with 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, speaker of the House of Representatives. Are these visits linked with Egyptian and Saudi mediation? [Al-Iryani] Two Arab League envoys are about to go to Jizan and Sanaa. As long as there is Arab League mediation, I think that most Arab countries would see this effort as sufficient.
