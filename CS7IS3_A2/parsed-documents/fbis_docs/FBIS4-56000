In a statement to Radio France International (RFI), whose programme was monitored in Belgrade, Izetbegovic said that the world's insistence on such a settlement implied a continuation of the war. Foreign ministers of the United States, Russia, Great Britain and the European `troika' (Belgium, Greece and Germany) accepted in mid-May the E.U. formula envisaging this division of the Bosnian territory. The Bosnian Serbs, who owned 64 per cent of the territory before the outbreak of the war in 1992, now control 70 per cent. Izetbegovic described the forthcoming Geneva meeting of a Bosnian Moslem delegation with U.S. presidential envoy Charles Redman and the contact group for Bosnia not as negotiations, but simply as meetings in which Redman and the contact group would inform the Bosnian Moslem side about their stands. The contact group, made up of U.S., Russian, E.U. and U.N. representatives, was set up in late April with the aim of restoring the Bosnian peace process. Izetbegovic took another opportunity to disparage special U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi and said that Akashi had fallen into oblivion and that he was already regarded as history in Bosnia.
