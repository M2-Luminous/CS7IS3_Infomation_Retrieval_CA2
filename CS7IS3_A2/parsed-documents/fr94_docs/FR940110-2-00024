FR940110-2-00024 FR940110-2-00011 Comment 32: Petitioners contend that interest income claimed by TCM from long-term installment sales may have been earned on sales from TCM's unrelated dealers to end-users rather than on sales from TCM to its dealers, and as such should not be added to the price of TCM's sales. Petitioners assert that installment sales are generally sales to end-users rather than to dealers. In addition, petitioners claim that TCM did not properly justify the interest rate it used in calculating this income. TCM argues that the credit income at issue is earned by TCM itself, not by its dealers. TCM further argues that such income is a legitimate increase to U.S. price, because it is agreed to by the customer at the time of sale. Therefore, TCM claims that the Department should continue to add credit income to U.S. price for the final results. Department's Position: We disagree with petitioners. Concerning the issue of whether the installment sales in question were made by TCM to its unrelated dealers, as opposed to sales from the dealers to end-users, we have not found any evidence that these transactions did not concern sales by TCM to its dealers. We also do not have any evidence that TCM did not collect the credit income that it has reported, regardless of the interest rate that it charged. Therefore we have continued to add credit income to USP for the final results. Comment 33: Petitioners, citing Color Picture Tubes from Korea (52 FR 44186, November 18, 1987), contend that TCM's U.S. advertising expenses are direct selling expenses because the advertisements are aimed at a purchaser who buys the merchandise from the first unrelated purchaser or from a subsequent purchaser, i.e. , the customer's customer. Petitioners further contend that a TCM advertisement submitted as Exhibit 6 of petitioners' case brief is proof that these expenses are direct advertising expenses because the advertisement: (1) specifically promotes internal-combustion forklifts subject to this review; (2) identifies TCM Manufacturing, USA, Inc., TCM America, Inc., and C. Itoh Industrial Machinery, Inc., as the source of the advertisement; and (3) does not refer to or promote specific TCM dealers. Petitioners submit that TCM failed to support its claim that all of its U.S. advertisements were indirect selling expenses and state that the Department should therefore reject TCM's claim and treat all of the advertising expenses as direct expenses. Petitioners provide calculations for allocating this expense as a direct selling expense to forklifts sold through CIM and to forklifts sold through MMD. In rebuttal, TCM argues that the only advertising expenses related to subject merchandise were for general corporate advertising, rather than advertising for specific products. TCM further argues that the advertising cited by petitioner does not relate to subject merchandise, because it concerns forklift trucks manufactured in the United States. Because TCM's advertising is either intended to promote the company as a whole, or is not related to forklift trucks produced in Japan, TCM concludes that the Department should treat TCM's U.S. advertising expenses as indirect selling expenses. Department's Position: We agree with petitioners that these expenses are direct selling expenses because these advertisements, as evident from the examples submitted by TCM, are aimed at the ultimate consumer. We disagree with TCM regarding TCM's claim that the advertising in question is unrelated to subject merchandise because the trucks sold by TCM in the United States were in fact manufactured in Japan, and were, at most, customized through further processing in the United States. Therefore, we have treated these advertising expenses as a direct selling expense in the final results. Final Results of Review We determine the following percentage margins to exist for the period June 1, 1989 through May 31, 1990: ‚ê£ 1Manufacturer/exporter 1Margin percent Toyota Motor Corporation 6.87 Toyo Umpanki Co., Ltd. 4.48 The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions concerning all respondents directly to the Customs Service. Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of these final results of administrative review for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) the cash deposit rate for the reviewed companies will be the rates as listed above; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; and (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered by this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise. The cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be 39.45 percent. On May 25, 1993, the CIT in Floral Trade Council v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;79 and Federal Mogul Corporation v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company it can only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty order for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. In proceedings governed by antidumping findings, unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the Department has determined that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first final results of administrative review published by the Department (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) as the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this review will be 39.45 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the amended final notice of the LTFV investigation by the Department (53 FR 20882, June 7, 1988). These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility concerning disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely written notification of the return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation. This administrative review and this notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. Dated: December 23, 1993. Barbara R. Stafford, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;506 Filed 1&hyph;7&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
