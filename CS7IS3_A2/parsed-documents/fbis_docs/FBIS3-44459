In the first incident, a female worker at the Yongqi Company was shut in a dog kennel, and the Taiwanese manager -- who is held to be chiefly responsible -- has absconded, following in the footsteps of the aforementioned Hong Kong boss. Then, on 13 December, a fire broke out at Gaofu Textile Company, Ltd., causing the deaths of some 60 workers. True, there is an inevitable, accidental factor in any fire, but for some time past, there really has been a small number of foreign businessmen who pay no attention to Chinese laws and decrees, being bent on making profits by playing wicked tricks against their conscience: Some had no concern for the life and safety of Chinese staffers and workers, and would not provide labor conditions meeting safety and hygiene requirements. Others did not show any respect for the human dignity of Chinese staffers and workers, and would arbitrarily beat them, call them names, conduct body searches, and restrict their personal freedom. Some regarded Chinese staffers and workers merely as cheap machines that create wealth, while allowing them very low pay, and depriving them of legitimate public holidays, as well as their right to leave with pay. Still others deprived Chinese staffers and workers of their rights and interests in organizing workers' trade unions, regardless of customary international practice and the stipulations of Chinese law. In certain foreign-funded enterprises, their awful demeanor has gone beyond the tolerance of the law of any sovereign state. It must be pointed out that the lawbreaking behavior of some foreign businessmen had its cause in their ignorance of Chinese law, not in deliberate actions. However, there really are some individual foreign businessmen who definitely believe that mainland China is "a paradise for adventurists," where they run no risk, and they can keep the enterprise's running costs to a minimum impossible to achieve abroad or outside the border, and can reduce China's legal system to nothingness, as described in a poetic line: "It looks like grass from afar, but is actually nothing when one comes draws close." How is it possible that those foreign businessmen have such an understanding of mainland China? Who has led them into this "erroneous zone?" Perhaps it would be no exaggeration to say that "the cause lies in our own selves!" One wave of the "craze for importing foreign funds" has surged higher than another in various places over the past few years. The volume of foreign funds imported, and the number of foreign-funded enterprises sanctioned seemed to be the highest criterion for assessing the governing accomplishments of "local officials" at all levels. There is always a limit to foreign funds, but not in the demand for them. Thus, all places were vying to present their preferential policies. As for foreign businessmen, their tax burdens have been cut time and again, and land prices were cut increasingly deeper as local officials bowed increasingly lower before foreign businessmen. Naturally, foreign businessmen heard only a crescendo chorus of "welcome" wherever they went; how could there be any "different opinion?" Could there be places or people that would run the risk of dampening the enthusiasm of investment- bent foreign businessmen by enlightening them on the ABC's of the Chinese law? "The habitual force of people going after profits is like water in a river always running downstream." Foreign businessmen come to China to invest in running enterprises so as to make money; this is beyond reproach. To provide them with a sound investment climate and play the role of host is something that must be done. However, there is a "limit" to everything; we must remember that "excess is just as bad as deficiency," which has been a law that governing things since ancient times. Quite a few foreign businessmen have been scared away by the "wild" super-preferential policies of some localities. Regarding those places where vicious incidents frequently took place, those earnest, law-abiding foreign businessmen who make money by relying on their own abilities would ponder: Can one be at ease in a legal environment that cannot even protect the personal rights, interests, properties, and lives of its own citizens, its own brothers and sisters? Locking one's doors against the world is not socialism; neither is being afraid of foreign countries or fawning on foreign powers; nor is impoverishment or neglecting and even sacrificing the legitimate rights and interests of one's own compatriots in order to escape poverty and become well-off. In socialist China, no patriotic Chinese who has intuitive knowledge will ever tolerate a repetition of the tragic "indentured laborers"; by no means will he tolerate the evil of putting an equal sign between "Chinese and dogs" on PRC territory! To those foreign businessmen who plan to invest in China in sincere cooperation, our door is wide open and will always be, but we must tell them two things: First, we warmly welcome them and will provide them with conveniences. Second, they must observe Chinese laws, decrees and regulations, and must operate in accordance with the law. Chinese laws are suitable to all, without discrimination, regardless of surname, no matter whether capitalist or socialist, Chinese or foreign. Those who abide by the law will be protected, while lawbreakers will be penalized. Soverignty and the law brook no nonsense. The "welcoming ceremonies" are complete only when these "two things" have been made clear. Of course, we must be true to our word. The Hong Kong boss of the Zhili factory, and the Taiwan manager of the Yongqi Company have left without saying goodbye, believing that "the show is over" when they are "gone with the wind," though on this point they are wrong. In conclusion, we would like to say a few words to those brothers and sisters "working" at foreign-funded enterprises: True, we are poor today, but in seeking jobs, we should choose a sound employer, while avoiding those places where we will have to suffer and be humiliated, or even sacrifice our lives in order to earn a living. In addition, we must be always serious on one point: Should our legitimate rights and interests be violated, we should learn to "protect ourselves" with the law. Never should we forget that no matter the kind of enterprise at which we work, we are the masters on this piece of land.
