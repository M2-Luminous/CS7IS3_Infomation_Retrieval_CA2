Naturally, inhabitants of rayons in western Georgia are unable to watch television. However, the situation has become even more complex during the last four-five months. Last night, for almost six hours, Kutaisi and its environs were transformed, as they say, into a "dead" zone. Electricity was cut, all work came to a halt, and telephone communications were severed. In short, the city and its 300,000 inhabitants are experiencing the most difficult conditions. There is, in general, no natural gas; it is not possible to supply the minimum amount of electric power; water is being supplied barely once a week. [passage omitted] In spite of the situation yesterday, all municipal police employees are honorably fulfilling their duties. They are displaying particular vigilance in such extreme conditions. One can state that Kutaisi's No. 1 and No. 2 bakeries have diesel generators on permanent standby and, as a result, the city is being supplied with bread. Work has not stopped at the bread mill. In short, Kutaisi is in an extremely difficult situation. [passage omitted] Kutaisi has submitted a request to the Cabinet of Ministers that it nevertheless be supplied with electric power according to the schedule and that the city receive natural gas once a week. It is impossible for such a big city to remain paralyzed throughout the entire winter.
