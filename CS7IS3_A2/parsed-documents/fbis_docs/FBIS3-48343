Chemical weapons, which kill and injure people by using poisonous chemical materials, are branded as the most cruel massacre weapons in the world and thus their use and development have been prohibited by international commitments. Only traitor Kim Yong-sam, who hangs out the signboard of civilian politics, is openly pursuing possession of chemical weapons. This shows that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is going to openly perpetrate not only nuclear war, but also chemical war, against fellow countrymen. We cannot but regard it as very grave. As has already been known, successive ruling bunches have produced and stockpiled chemical weapons from long ago. There are more than 40 underground nuclear warehouses and underground chemical weapon warehouses in areas around Mt. Kyeryong in South Chungchong Province and in the area near Suwon, Kyonggi Province. Many ion chemical weapons, known as malicious mass lethal weapons, are stockpiled there. While talking about possession of independent chemical warfare capability, former South Korean dictators built more than 10 poisonous gas plants in South Korea and produced a great number of chemical weapons. The rascals brought from the United States on a large scale military aircraft capable of dropping chemical bombs and 155-mm [word indistinct] guns capable of firing the bombs. They also purchased gas masks on a pretext of preparing for chemical warfare. A chemical, biological, and radiological unit school has been operating in the puppet Army for a long time to train professional chemical warfare experts. By loudly raving that chemical warfare has become a worldwide trend, the former puppet warmongers exhibited various chemical equipment they produced and even propagandized its superiority. The Team Spirit joint military exercise, conducted every year in South Korea, has become an important leverage to achieve not only the nuclear war plan, but also the rascals' chemical war plan. New chemical war equipment was mobilized in the recent Team Spirit joint military exercise and units specializing in chemical war training participated in the exercise. Reporting on the true aspect of chemical war exercises conducted during the Team Spirit joint military exercise several years ago, a South Korean broadcast said that in addition to aircraft attacks on simulated areas in the North side, smoke bombs, chemical shells, bacterial shells, and even explosive shells, were dropped during the exercise. As the result, all living things can barely survive. Just as former dictators, puppet Kim Yong-sam, who claims to be a civilian politician in South Korea, is also scheming to inflict, not only nuclear disaster, but also poisonous gas calamity on fellow countrymen by clinging to the sleeves of outside forces. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, in a so-called conference of offices and agencies concerned, decided to possess chemical weapons and to submit the bill to National Assembly for ratification. This clearly shows how frantically the rascals are running amok with chemical war preparations. Going against the trend of the time toward disarmament and detente, the civilian warmongers are accelerating production of chemical weapons -- mass lethal weapons the use of which is prohibited worldwide -- and are attempting to inflict the disaster of chemical weapons on fellow countrymen. Their crime will not be pardoned forever. The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam should give up criminal chemical war preparations and should act with discretion. If the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, in spite of the warnings of our people and the people of the world, is advancing along the road of continuously committing antinational maneuvers to accelerate preparation of nuclear war and chemical war on the Korean peninsula in collusion with outside forces, the rascals cannot avoid the responsibility for all consequences arising therefrom nor can they evade the stern judgment of history.
