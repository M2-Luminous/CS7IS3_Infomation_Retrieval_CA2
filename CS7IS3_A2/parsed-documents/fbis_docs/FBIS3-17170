Under the bill, the status can be granted not only to Latvian citizens but also to permanent residents who suffered either from the Communist or Nazi regimes in Latvia. The bill, unlike the currently effective law, recognizes the two occupation regimes in Latvia, said Inese Birzniece, head of the Human Rights Committee. Presently, 28,000 people have certificates of politically repressed persons in Latvia. The committee will submit the bill for Saeima consideration March 28.
