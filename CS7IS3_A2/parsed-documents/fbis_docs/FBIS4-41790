Instead of receiving 7.5m cubic meters of gas a day, the republic will now be receiving 3.0m cubic meters. The Sakgazi Department will distribute this limited supply among vital installations in the republic, including Tbilisi power station, which will be receiving 1.0m cubic meters of gas a day, instead of the required 3.0m cubic meters. All supplies of natural gas to eastern and western Georgian regions and to the Kartli and Kvemo Kartli zones will be stopped as of today. As soon as the situation improves the Sakgazi Department will take measures to resume the normal supply of gas.
