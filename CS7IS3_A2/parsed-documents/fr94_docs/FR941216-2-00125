FR941216-2-00125 FR941216-2-00074 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,776; TA&hyph;W&hyph;29, 776A] Harbour Casuals, Inc., Plains, PA, Roxanne of Pennsylvania; Wilkes-Barre, PA; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on June 8, 1994, applicable to all workers of Harbour Casuals, Inc., in Plains, Pennsylvania. The certification notice was published in the Federal Register on June 24, 1994 (59 FR 32716). At the request of the Hazleton-Wyoming Valley District Council of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. New findings show that the production at Harbour Casuals was integrated with that of Roxanne of Pennsylvania. Harbour Casuals was the cutting firm and Roxanne of Pennsylvania is the sewing firm. Both firms were engaged in the production of ladies' sportswear and swimwear. Sales, production and employment at Roxanne of Pennsylvania decreased in 1993 compared to 1992. U.S. imports of various ladies' sportswear and swimwear increased in 1993 compared to 1992. The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports. Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to include workers at Roxanne of Pennsylvania in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,776 is hereby issued as follows: All workers of Harbour Casuals, Inc., in Plains, Pennsylvania and Roxanne of Pennsylvania in Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania engaged in employment related to the production of ladies' sportswear and swimwear who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after April 11, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 5th day of December 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
