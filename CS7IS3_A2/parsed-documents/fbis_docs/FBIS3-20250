Previously, Esko Aho had said that Finland's referendum should be held in September. Aho certainly does not want to postpone the referendum any longer than 13 November because of the upcoming parliamentary elections in Finland, scheduled for March 1995. Yesterday, Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt's office did not wish to make any comment on Esko Aho's proposal. In Norway, the parties in favor of saying no to EU membership are urging the government to take Aho's request into consideration. Hitherto Finland -- a country well disposed toward the EU -- has been seen as providing excellent stimulus in the run-up to the referenda in Sweden and Norway: The latest poll shows that 48 percent of Finns support EU membership, while 26 percent are opposed. The remaining 26 percent are "undecided."
