FBIS4-28412 "dreas112_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 North Korea Russian Paper Reports on Kim Yong-sam's Career Russian Paper Reports on Kim Yong-sam's Career SK0406105494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1030 GMT 4 Jun 94 SK0406105494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The No. 22 of June of the Russian paper PATRIOT carried an article on the career of Kim Yong- sam under the title "15 Years After" upon his Moscow trip. The paper notes that Kim Yong-sam threw off his "election commitments" in less than one year after he took office as "president" and, while visiting the United States, signed a secret agreement with his masters across the ocean on opening the South Korean market to U.S. farm products. With this, Kim Yong-sam has actually brought sufferings to the 6 million South Korean peasants, says the paper, and continues: Why? He sought to induce the United States not to agree to the package solution to the nuclear issue proposed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the talks with the DPRK and establish an "international cooperation system" against the DPRK. Recalling that Kim Yong-sam had always made "tough anti-fascist speeches" while active in an opposition party for over 30 years, the paper says: When he became the leader of the New Democratic Party in 1974, he made an oath that he would devote his whole life to the struggle for genuine freedom and the restoration of democracy. When he was ousted from the seats of opposition leader and "national assemblyman" in autumn of 1979, he cried: "Although the ruling quarters are trying to rob me of everything necessary, they cannot take away my political philosophy," the paper derides him, asking why can such a man who waxed so eloquent not be an opposition leader? The paper quotes the title of an article of the South Korean magazine KIL "40 years of Perfidy and Betrayal of Kim Yong-sam Were Decades of Mad Acts To Become President." It was not until the lapse of 15 years that the South Korean people understood whom Kim Yong-sam's political philosophy serves, it remarks.
