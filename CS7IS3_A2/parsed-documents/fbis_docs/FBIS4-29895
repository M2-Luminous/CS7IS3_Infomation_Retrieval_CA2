Korea; Chongukyonhap Calls for Peaceful Solution of Nuclear Issue" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- The South Korean National Alliance for Democracy and Reunification (Chongukyonhap) in a statement June 16 contended that the North's "nuclear issue" should be solved in a peaceful way through a package deal between the North and the United States, a Seoul-based radio report said. The statement said a package solution whereby to renounce the hostile policy toward the North and normalize relations with it is the only way of securing the nuclear transparency of the North as the United States wants to see and, at the same time, of ensuring the safety of the entire nation of the Korean peninsula and defending world peace. It urged the puppet authorities to oppose "sanctions" on the North and strive for a peaceful solution of the problem and to stop acts of creating "a situation for a new security-oriented rule" on the pretext of the North's "nuclear issue" in a bid to suppress the national democratic movement and force "an endorsement of the Uruguay Round final agreement".
