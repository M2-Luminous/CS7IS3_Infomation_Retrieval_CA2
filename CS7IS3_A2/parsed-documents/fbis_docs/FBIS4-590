Only 113,115 voters were registered during the first two weeks of a national registration campaign. ZANU (PF) Midlands Provincial Chairman Frederick Shava said the party had not yet told its members about the importance of taking part in the elections. "Registration kicked off on a very low note because people had not been mobilised fully and they were apprehensive," he said. Mr Shava said he hoped voter registration would pick up when people at cell, ward, district and provincial levels were mobilised. Mr Shava said the party was in full swing of consolidating itself and had sold 50,000 party membership cards in the Midlands region during the last three months. All Central Committee members, parliamentarians, chiefs and local party officials would be involved in the regional mobilisation drive starting on April 19, Mr Shava said. "We are satisfied that the restructuring exercise of the party is going into the correct phase and we shall have finished the exercise before the main congress begins," he said. The position of provincial women's league economic affairs secretary and legal affairs and human rights secretary still needed to be filled, he added.
