I must admit that I had to protest a little against the views regarding Europe's expansion, because I am convinced that Europe can never be expanded (or even made smaller) by anyone. Europe is Europe regardless of the kind of institutions established in it, and views about its expansion can only be contemplated in relation to individual European institutions or organizations. In a panel discussion involving the Belgian, Danish, Finnish, and Czech prime ministers, it became obvious that this difference is very important and that we are the ones who always point it out. Finnish Prime Minister Aho played into my hands by quoting the famous Finnish composer Sibelius, thus enabling me to reply that Sibelius was not only a Finnish composer, but also -- undoubtedly -- a European one, without being recognized as such by some European institutions. The topic of many discussions was the future of Europe and its position in the world. Our experience tells us that the success (or failure) of Europe -- and, in fact, of all of us -- does not so much depend on the existence, scope, and activities of multilateral European institutions, but that it depends far more on the type and structure of the political, social, and economic system that exists in European countries. We know very well that the reason for our own failure to keep pace with Western Europe and our rather unhappy life during the past four decades was not the existence of an institution like the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, but the existence of the communist regime. The symmetric opposite also applies: The success of Western Europe did not depend on European Community institutions, but on a free society, private ownership, and a free market. This was not only valid in the past, it is also valid for today and tomorrow. It is being decided right now whether Eastern Europe will uphold such a system or whether it will allow it to degenerate into a new form of collectivism endorsed under the banner of this or that old- new salvation-bringing "ism." The success of Europe depends on the extent of individual freedom; the extent of the free market and trade; the ability to get rid of unnecessary state interference in people's lives and their economic activities; curbing bureaucratic manipulation with everyone and everything; our determination and courage to limit the influence of the powerful and the social well being of lobby groups; and our ability to put in order the basic economic attributes, especially our handling of the reward we get for them. In this context and under these circumstances, it is necessary to specify carefully the conditions for the possible favorable impact of multilateral European institutions on our future. I am concerned that the careful formulation of these conditions is being forgotten due to the simplified and a priori accepted argument that, without a united Europe, we will be "small," "weak," and "unable to stand up to competition" with the world's other regions. The favorable impact of these institutions, however, depends on the following: 1. Whether these pan-European institutions are greater advocates of the free market and free trade and greater opponents of state interventionism, bureaucracy, and lobbying than individual European states; 2. Whether the institutionalized, organized integration of Europe produces "bulk savings," or whether the rewards from the size of the regions would be higher than the losses associated with the functioning of too-widespread organizations; 3. Whether the idea of a unified, institutionally united Europe is in the real interests of Europe's citizens and not just in the interests of European politicians of a particular ideological persuasion, as is the case at the moment. Patiently seeking (and empirically verifying) the answers to these questions has nothing whatsoever to do with nationalism (or internationalism), egoism (or altruism), or not seeing further than one's own nose (or adopting a broader view and perspective) as is often cast up -- in an oversimplified manner -- on certain people in our country and abroad. The Czech Republic proceeds from the hypothesis that the Czech lands were always part of Europe and, therefore, that they do not want to be deprived of all the advantages stemming from membership in European institutions. I firmly believe that we have already crossed the Rubicon dividing the two totally different social systems, that we deserve to be taken seriously, and that we are prepared for further steps toward European integration. If I say integration, it is because I do not want to say unification or association, which are altogether different processes. We want to be an "equal partner" that does not just want to get or acquire something, we are also prepared to give. We know we have to resolve our problems ourselves and, therefore, we are not asking anyone to resolve them for us. We believe that the current form of the European integration process is not the final one, and we would like to participate in the never-ending process of seeking the most ideal form for it. We realize that our communist past enables us to see some things more clearly than the countries of Western Europe, which did not have this past. This was a great blessing for them, but it is our duty to constantly point out some of the stumbling blocks. We believe that we will be listened to.
