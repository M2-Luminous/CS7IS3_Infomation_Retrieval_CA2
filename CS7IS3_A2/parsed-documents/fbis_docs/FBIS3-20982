This structure was recently presented on the occasion of the International Electron Devices meeting of experts in this field in Washington. What is involved is a self-aligned trench-circuit contact which is defined by the intersection of a deep trench-memory node and the "shallow" trench insulation. As described in the journal SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL (Vol. 16, 1993, No. 12, p 18), the trench cell, a "buried" strip, is 0.55 x 1.1 micrometers in size. It is produced with the aid of the 0.25-micrometer technique. The cell surface is claimed to be only 0.1 of a square micrometer larger than the theoretical minimal surface of such a cell and the smallest of the folded bit-circuit cells that have been proposed. It differs considerably from Mitsubishi's planar-stacked capacitor-cell design, which was also reported on at the Washington conference. The superdielectric, constant barium-strontium-titanate film was also discussed.
