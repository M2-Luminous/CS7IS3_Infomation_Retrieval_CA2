Neumann report: "Investment in the New Laender: Slowdown in Industry, Expansion in Services"] [Text] The Ifo Investors' Account for eastern Germany gives an overview of sectoral developments of investments in the new laender. For 1991, 1992, and 1993 the figures were calibrated to the (provisional figures) of the official statistics. In the total amounts the Ifo calculations for all these years are slightly above the official values. This is primarily due to a somewhat more positive assessment of trends in the important tertiary sector. For the 1994 projection, the basis of information was the investment plans of west and east German investors in the major economic sectors. These Ifo survey results were supplemented by assumptions on further trends in business startup investments and completed with the help of various information on foreign investment activity, investment in the Trust Agency realm and the vital area of green-field investments. 1993: Strong Investment Growth Persists In 1993, investments in the new laender (including eastern Berlin) grew vigorously. As the results of the Ifo Investors' Account for eastern Germany show, overall investment in plants and equipment in 1993 was more than DM140 billion and thus about one-fifth higher than in 1992. Investment activity in the new laender was therefore much more favourable than in western Germany. Compared to 1992, when investments in eastern Germany increased by one-third, the growth rate, as expected, decelerated. In the tertiary sector investments expanded at an above-average rate (by about two-fifths). This expansion was mainly attributable to the sectors "housing" and "other services." The emphasis in housing was on renovation, although new housing construction is gaining in importance. The umbrella category "other services" contains various activities such as hotels and gastronomy, liberal professions, human and veterinary medicine, leasing and investment management companies, commercial developers, consumer services (e.g., dry cleaning and laundries), and commercial services (e.g., engineering consultants, business consultants). In this diverse sector there was a strong upturn in construction activity (new hotels, establishment of industrial estates). Construction also displayed above-average investment gains. Despite complaints of sluggish approval procedures and delays in public contract awards, contractors are profiting from pent-up demand in the infrastructure realm and especially from necessary renovation of the housing stock, which is providing strong stimulus to small and medium-sized businesses. In the other sectors, investment growth has slowed down considerably. Investment in plant and equipment in manufacturing, transportation, communication and the public sector (including nonprofit organizations) exceeded last year's levels by about one-tenth. The originally much more positive investment plans in manufacturing were thus not fully achieved. The slowdown in transportation and communications was, not surprising, considering the unusually strong expansion in 1992 by the German Post Office (Telekom). Budget constraints slowed down investment growth in the public sector. In the energy sector (including mining) the long-standing conflict over east German energy-supply contracts has curbed an originally much more positive development. Ascertaining investments in commerce is particularly difficult. On the one hand, the expansion and modernization of existing locations is continuing, especially by western Germany retail chains, and logistic facilities are being expanded. However, extensive new construction volume and considerable (and controversial) expansion of commercial space is going to newly constructed, green-field industrial estates. In most cases, these major projects are not built by the trading enterprises themselves but by special project groups, real estate funds, or developers, and then leased out. With the normal determination of investments according to the ownership principle, a large portion of investments used by trading firms (especially real estate) does not appear under commerce but under the owner in the service sector. For this reason the 1993 investment figures for commerce will at best match last year's levels. Decelerated Growth in 1994 The Ifo calculations point to continued investment growth in the new laender, albeit at a slower pace than in 1993. Present plans indicate that 1994 investments will amount to over DM160 billion, nearly 15 percent more than in 1993. The service sector will continue its above-average growth, whereas investments in the producing sector (energy and water supply, mining, manufacturing, construction) will only expand by one-tenth due to the expected stagnation of capital expenditure in the manufacturing industry. In 1991 and 1992, investment in manufacturing grew rapidly, but in 1993 it was clear that west German investors especially were holding back due to the economic downturn. Some planned investments were postponed, others delayed. In 1994 for the first time, west German spending in the industry of the new laender will no longer reach the volume of the previous year. The favourable demand situation in construction, however, should lead to continuously increasing investments. The energy/mining sector should increase its capital expenditure by a relatively strong 20 percent in 1994, especially as a result of the noticeably stepped-up investment activities in electricity supply and district heating and, in the wake of initial privatization successes, also in mining. Spending in the transportation and communication sector will grow by about one-tenth to DM26 billion. Deutsche Bahn AG in particular will further intensify its investment activities in the new laender (expansion and modernization of the railway system). The investments of Bundespost will show slight growth after having reached new heights last year. Increased spending is also expected in the sector of "other transportation" (private road haulage and parcel deliveries, airports, travel agencies). Service enterprises will again strongly increase their capital expenditure (by one-quarter, on average). Whereas the banking and insurance investment boom, which began immediately following the mid-1990 Economic and Currency Union, is now over, expansion in other services continues. In the housing sector, a spending plus of nearly 30 percent is expected, with a stronger focus on new housing construction alongside modernization and renovation. A strong pace of expansion is again anticipated in the sector of "other services." True, the nearly one-third growth will not be as high as in 1993, but a later upward correction cannot be ruled out due to difficulties in assessing exactly when investments will be made in existing and new industrial estates. Per Capita Investment in Eastern Germany Surpasses the Western Level The stronger expansion of investment in the new laender has meant that in 1993 for the first time per capita investments in eastern Germany (nearly DM9,100) were higher than in western Germany (nearly DM9,000). For 1994, calculations indicate per capita spending of DM10,350 in the east compared to DM9,300 in the west. The sectoral distribution shows that the per capita western levels were visibly surpassed in 1992 in the sectors of transportation and communication, state, and producing industries. In contrast, per capita spending in housing still remains clearly below the western level. Also clearly below western levels is per capita spending in the services. Slower Pace of Western Involvement The restructuring process in the new laender is primarily being supported by the engagement of western investors, who are transferring not only capital but technical know-how and managerial experience. With the growing economic linkages between the two parts of Germany, a separate determination of west German investment in the new laender is becoming increasingly difficult. The latest calculations of the Ifo Institute indicate that west German and foreign firms (excluding housing) invested nearly DM50 billion in the new laender, nearly a 20-percent increase in 1992. West German and foreign investment is also expected to increase in 1994, albeit at a weaker pace. Present calculations forecast spending of nearly DM55 billion, about one-tenth more than in 1993. In the sectoral distribution of spending, the trend observed in 1993 holds on. Whereas spending continues to expand in the energy/mining and construction sectors, current plans indicate that west German and foreign investment in manufacturing will fall slightly below last year's levels for the first time. This slight decline conceals a relatively strong plunge in west German firms' investments, whereas the "genuine" foreign investment activity will most likely increase as a result of special developments in chemistry, iron and steel, and paper and board production. Due to a high starting level, western investments in the transportation and communication sector will only increase slightly, and commerce should record a decline. Strong expansion of western investment is again expected in the services (excluding housing). This development is solely attributable to the area of "other services" (especially industrial estates, new hotel construction, and other major projects). Although the investments of western companies will expand at a slower pace, they will continue to make a major contribution to growth in total capital expenditure in the new laender. In 1993, 57 percent of investments in the east German business sector (excluding housing) came from west German and foreign investors (1991: 44 percent, 1992: 56 percent). Of note is that investments of Deutsche Bahn AG in the new laender (Reichsbahn) have come from a special federal fund and have not been included in western business investment. If this area is included, the share of western investment in the business sector increases to more than 60 percent.
