Today, Paris has multiplied its efforts to persuade them by stressing the purely humanitarian aspect of the operation. In Brussels the Western European Union [WEU] has been considering French proposals. WEU Secretary General Willem van Eekelen explains: [Begin van Eekelen recording] Everyone agrees that the situation in Rwanda is tragic and that we must see if European countries can do something. The WEU will now consider how it could coordinate extra contributions from European countries under the aegis of the United Nations. Our planning cell has been allowed to get in touch with capitals to see which capabilities, which means, could be placed at our disposal and closely to follow developments. This is a start, and now a possible scenario must be assessed, we must then see which countries will be able to contribute. [end recording]
