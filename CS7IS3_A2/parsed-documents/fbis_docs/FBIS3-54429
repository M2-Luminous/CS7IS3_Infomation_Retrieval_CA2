The bill imposes restrictions on America's military presence on the international scene and also America's role in the UN. [passage omitted] The imposition of such restrictions takes place when America is emerging from an era of defeats in her interventionist policies. The failure of America's hypocritical interference in Bosnia and the disgraceful departure of American soldiers from Somalia and Haiti forced that country's authorities to minimize such defeats by creating a legal mechanism. Although the bill is presented to the congress by the leader of the Senate Republicans, far from being tantamount to opposition to the performance of the Democrats abroad, it is aimed at maintaining America's superiority and global domination -- a superiority and domination attained at less cost and lower casualties. For that reason the American statesmen intend to involve the Congress, in addition to the government and its representative, in decisionmaking at the United Nations on participation in overseas operations. Under the bill, the Congress should be involved and before the government votes for interventionist activities at the Security Council, it should consult members of Congress. The Congress claims that it approved the bill on America's membership at the United Nations on the condition that it be a fully fledged partner in that organization's financial and military decisionmaking. That claim reveals the fact that, to preserve her status, America has always deferred any fundamental effort to the United Nations. For that reason, after the failure in various operations and the inability to finance them, she asks the United Nations to pay all the expenses relating to the provision of military forces, equipment, and transport operations. According to the leader of the U.S. Senate Republicans, the joint U.S.-UN operations in Somalia, Bosnia, and Haiti showed that it is not in America's interests to allow the United Nations to determine the country's foreign policy. In his view, the bill will not resolve all the existing differences between America and the United Nations but, through the participation of the congress in fundamental decisions, it will result in America's interests on foreign policy being safeguarded. Here, one could say that giving credit to the United Nations would mean something only when it makes decisions in line with the policies of that country, and the decision of the Security Council to send forces would only be practical for America if the cost of the operation is incurred by that organization, with a minimum of U.S. soldiers lost.
