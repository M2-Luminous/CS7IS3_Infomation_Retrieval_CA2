President Mircea Snegur announced that he has received a mediation proposal from Boris Yeltsin and that a Moscow envoy will arrive in Chisinau after tomorrow's parliamentary elections. Insofar as relations with the CIS are concerned, Snegur expressed the hope that the future parliament will ratify Moldova's adherence to this community, but said that the problem of signing certain accords with it in the area of defense is not in question. He also added that he wants the Russian 14th Army to begin its withdrawal from the territory of the Republic of Moldova this year. The ambassador in Moscow, Anatol Taranu, told the INTERFAX agency that at the beginning of March, a working meeting will be held in Chisinau by military experts from Moldova and Russia to clarify the status of the Russian 14th Army, as well as methods and a timetable for its withdrawal from the territory of Moldova. He also mentioned that Chisinau will insist on the withdrawal of the 14th Army from Dniester by 1 July. This piece of news was also broadcast by Rossiya radio.
