The topic of the talks was the intensification of bilateral relations between Albania and Great Britain and cooperation in the economic field. They also discussed the aid that Great Britain may provide to Albania in various fields and its support and integration in the European structures. Regarding the regional question, President Berisha said that "the Albanian question is still a sharp regional problem, whose resolution is directly linked with the stability in the Balkans. This issue calls for general solutions and it should be on the agenda along other international problems." Mr. Berisha reiterated that the lifting of the embargo against Serbia must be conditioned with the resolution of the Kosova question, the establishing of Kosova under the UN forces' control and the completion of an agreement on the status of Kosova. Appreciating the so far achievements in Albania, Douglas Hogg expressed the conviction that there are possibilities for cooperation in fields of common interest such as in trade, tourism, and other fields. As regards the Kosova question, Mr. Hogg said that this issue needs an urgent solution. "We are for a policy which aims at granting autonomy to Kosova," Mr. Hogg said. In the meeting with Baroness Chalker, minister of development with overseas countries, the talk focused on the realisation of the projects which are under way and the possibilities for the expansion of these projects and commissioning of new ones in the future. After appreciating the aid of the British Government and non-government humanitarian organizations, Mr. Berisha pointed out the support that Britain may render to Albania in the reorganization of the banking system, in infrastructure, glass industry and culture. Mr. Berisha met with a group of representatives of the "Premje" Oil company, which is now having negotiations with Albpetrol. The group appreciated the cooperation and expressed their commitment to start their activity in Albania as soon as possible. In the meeting that President Berisha had with a BBC group, they discussed possibilities for cooperation in various fields of common interest. In the afternoon of March 28, President Berisha met with the British premier, John Major. Mr. Major said he will encourage British investments in Albania and expressed his readiness to support Albania's integration into European institutions, in the European Union, the Western European Union, adding that he will make his contribution to include Albania in the associate agreement. Mr. Major also offered his support for the membership of the Albanian Democratic Party in the European Democratic Union. The meeting also focused on the situation in the region. President Berisha presented the Albanian question. "This issue," he said, "in which the Kosova question is of priority, is rather delicate and complex in the Balkan peninsula. Putting it into the agenda of the international questions has become an indispensability. In this context, non-removal of the embargo against Serbia, dispatch of observers in Kosova and the efforts to guarantee Kosova an acceptable status for all parties serve the stability in the region. Albania and the Albanian political forces wherever they are," Mr. Berisha said, "will try to prevent the conflict, whose spillover will bring about a Balkan war. Reestablishing of Albanian institutions, the free movement of the Albanians, the implementation of the UN resolutions in relation with Kosova are the first steps for a dialogue. But the Albanians ask that this dialogue be conducted in the presence of a third party, because so far Belgrade has left no room to act in this direction," Albanian president said. British Premier Major said: "We are worried about the situation in the Balkans and appreciate the role of Albania as a factor for stability. We are already committed that the embargo should continue and we shall work for the dispatch of monitors in Kosova." Mr. Major agreed on the questions discussed in the meeting and accepted with pleasure the invitation extended to him to visit Albania.
