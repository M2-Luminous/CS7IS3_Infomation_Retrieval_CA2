The goal of our party is to ensure that man, his rights and freedoms, labor and welfare become the real values of the society in which we live. To this end, our Republic should become an economically strong, democratic, rule-of-law state. The SPRK [Union in Support of the Republic of Crimea] has already accomplished, in cooperation with other parties, politicians, and representatives of the business communities of Ukraine and Russia, a number of specific endeavors that will be helpful in solving the economic problems of the Crimea: -- An agreement has been signed with the "Grinev-Kuchma" bloc and the Party of Russian Unity and Accord (Stankevich-Shakhray) on establishing permanent informational contacts; cooperation between the centrist forces of Ukraine, Russia, and the Crimea has thus been actually initiated; -- The holding of a conference of the centrist forces of Ukraine, Belorusia [Belarus], and Russia (possibly Moldova) in the Crimea in April has been agreed upon with a view to pooling our efforts in the advancement of the states toward an economic and political union; -- A package of documents containing specific studies of ways to overcome an economic crisis and stabilize the economic and political situation in the Crimea has been given to the president of the Crimea. At present, the party is looking for ways to accomplish tasks that can overcome the chaos and ruin in the Crimea with the participation of economists, lawyers, and social science specialists. 1. A set of measures to carry out reform of the tax system of the Republic of Crimea is being developed. The essence of the reform is to reduce tax rates at the expense of nontax funds being taken in by the budget. This reform will ensure: --An increase in the profits and solvency of existing enterprises; --The development of new enterprises; --The creation of new jobs; --An increase in output produced and services rendered; --Greater welfare for the working people. 2. A program of measures to restore disrupted economic relations through economic cooperation with CIS countries is being developed: --The simplification of mutual settlements and customs barriers between the Crimea, Ukraine, and Russia; --The creation of local free economic zones with subsequent transition to an international free enterprise zone; --The upgrading of Crimean ports and restoration of the Crimea- Caucasus railway ferry, with subsequent construction of the "Crimea- Russia" bridge; --The creation of an international joint-stock airline (the Crimea-Ukraine-Russia) using the facilities of the Simferopol Airport and the takeoff and landing potential of the military bases in Belbek, Dzhankoy, and Bagerovo; --The creation of joint Crimean-Russian wine-making, tobacco- growing, silk-producing, seed-producing, and sheep-breeding enterprises. 3. The privatization program we propose can stop the process of hidden privatization, i.e. the secret pilfering of public property, and make this a truly people's privatization. The key stages of the program are: --Adopting the Law on Privatization, which takes into account the specifics of the region, analyzes the mistakes and crimes that have been allowed to occur, and codifies the priority status of labor collectives in both industry and agriculture; --Taking a complete inventory with the participation of the public, the deputy corps, trade unions, and independent experts in order to analyze in detail all changes in the form of ownership; --Reinforcing criminal liability for secretly changing the form of ownership. 4. Our social programs guarantee opportunities for the strong and protection for the weak: --The preservation of free education and health care, along with paid education and health care; --Material support for motherhood and childhood; --A minimum retirement benefit corresponding to the level of the subsistence minimum; --Long-term easy credit to young people for the construction and acquisition of housing, with a proportion of the loan being written off after the birth of each child; --Easy credit to young people to learn a profession or retrain. A program for supporting agriculture--the main sector in the economy of the Crimea: --The immediate payment of accumulated arrears by the state; --Easy credit to agricultural producers; --The lifting of existing restrictions on the area of land grants; --Long-term, indefinite land leases with right of inheritance for those who work the land; --Respect for all forms of ownership. In the name of human health and the conservation of unique nature in the Crimea, all construction, land, military, and economic projects should be carried out in keeping with the Law "On Environmental Protection" and should undergo ecological reviews. Stage-by-stage demilitarization of the peninsula, with the potential of the military-industrial complex being used in the interests of the Crimea. The Republic of Crimea must become a symbol of peace and welfare. All nations residing in the Republic should have equal opportunities to develop their ethnic cultures. Reorganization of law enforcement organs in conjunction with their reliable outfitting should become a guarantee of protection of the life, dignity, rights, and freedoms of citizens of the Crimea. We come out against the reforms that have robbed the people and turned a majority of them into beggars. All labor has lost prestige, whereas speculation, bribery, and plunder have become prestigious. We have created the "Union in Support of the Republic of Crimea" in order to bring this outrage to an end and prevent the worst from happening. We count on support from all those who create material and intellectual assets and who are concerned about the fate of the Crimea. Let us help the Republic together!!!
