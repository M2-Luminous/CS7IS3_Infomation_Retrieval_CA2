The Nigerian foreign minister was in Cairo yesterday. The Egyptian news agency MENA announced that a summit meeting between the Cameroon and Nigerian heads of state will be held in the Egyptian capital before the end of this month. This information provoked the amazement if not the anger of the Cameroon authorities. Listen to what the Cameroon information minister, Augustin Kontchou, said yesterday evening to Dominique de Courcelles: [Begin recording] [Kontchou] Cameroon agrees and has already agreed to meet the Nigerian president in a neutral country, a meeting that will obviously have to be planned by the two countries. Cameroon initially thought of Togo, whose president, His Excellency Eyadema, visited Cameroon and Nigeria, and whose foreign minister also visited Cameroon and Nigeria. The door was not shut. Before announcing a meeting in such-and-such country, the two heads of state should first agree. [Courcelles] Do you know if Husni Mubarak has agreed to mediate? [Kontchou] We have been approached neither by President Mubarak nor by any other Egyptian official, nor by any Nigerian official. Neither President Abacha nor any Nigerian minister approached us. We don't know the origin of this announcement of a meeting between His Excellency President Paul Biya and his excellency the Nigerian president. [end recording]
