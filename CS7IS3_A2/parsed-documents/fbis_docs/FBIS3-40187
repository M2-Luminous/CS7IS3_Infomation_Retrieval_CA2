Timber Resources Will Become Tight, Prices Will Be Stable and Expected To Rise After a comprehensive analysis of national economic developments, the state's macroeconomic regulation and control policies, and changes in the international timber market, we believe that in this year and the next year resources on the timber market will be tight, demand will pick up steadily, and prices will also change from current falling to stabilizing and rising situation. 1. Timber supply and demand contradiction becomes intense. It is predicted that the temporary relief of resource shortage will end in early 1994 and the supply and demand contradiction will gradually worsen. In the third quarter of 1993, due to the function of market mechanism, social demand declined, giving rise to a situation where resources appeared to be ample. However, this balance of supply and demand was merely a fake phenomenon during the period of shrinking purchasing power. The 1994 social timber balancing plan shows that the gap between timber resources and social demand is approximately 1.6 million cubic meters. First, judging from the domestic market, national forests in northeast China and Nei Monggol already reached the rational fixed production level of 19.17 million cubic meters in 1993. Domestic timber output is unlikely to increase substantially in 1994, but social demand will increase markedly along with the rapid growth of the national economy. Second, judging from the international timber market, the Clinton Administration has decided to ban the deforestation of 80 percent of virgin forests on 23 million acres of federal forest land in the western United States. This, plus other negative factors, such as slowing deforestation actitivies in Canada, increasing log restrictions in Asia, and declining export of timber from Africa and South America, are bound to affect the market supply of timber which has become increasingly dependent on the international market. Third, judging from experience, China's timber shortage will not be easily corrected over a relatively long period of time. The insufficient market supply of timber is the major contradition, which will also exist for a long time. 2. Timber prices will stabilize while falling. In the fourth quarter and next year, the trend will be affected by many factors, both up and down factors. Factors that will cause timber prices to go up mainly include: 1) Along with the implementation of state macroeconomic regulation and control measures and the improvement of financial order, the production fund shortage of key state construction projects and production enterprises are expected to somewhat improve, and the evolution of the supply and demand contradiction will provide a good opportunity for the increase of timber prices. 2) Beginning 1 July 1993, railroad freight charges went up from 0.385 yuan per ton kilometer to 0.535 yuan, jacking up the cost of timber purchases. 3) The timber price of the international market has gone up again. Between mid-August and mid-September, the log price on the November future market of Chicago increased about 18 percent and the price for 1,000 square foot reached $316. The price of domestic forest zones has also remained at a fairly high level. Factors causing timber prices to decline mainly include: 1) The state macroeconomic regulation and control policy has achieved temporary success, and the function and effect of such success will continue for a fairly long period of time in the sphere of the economy. 2) The price of timber substitutes--steel and nonferrous metal--has fallen to a low level. 3) The large inventory of timber management units has played a definite role in suppressing market prices. 4) The mentality of timber users who buy when prices are high, not low, has to a certain degree worsened the falling trend of timber prices. To sum up the above analysis, we believe that the basic trend of timber market price in 1993 and 1994 will rise gradually during 1994 while stabilizing. But it will not increase as it did in the first half of 1993. II. Plywood Import Will Gradually End Fluctuation In the first half of 1993, resources of plywood import were very tight, prices were sky-high, and plywood import became the hot spot of business. In the third quarter of 1993, due to the influence of falling prices of timber and other capital goods, the prices of imported plywood declined somewhat. However, compared to the beginning of 1993, demand for imported plywood remains stable and the prices fairly high. 1. Regarding the delivery and cost of imported plywood, in the first three quarters of 1993, the total amount of plywood imported by all harbors of China decreased 21.7 percent as compared to that of the corresponding period of 1992. Resources were tight. In the first three quarters of 1993, harbors in northern China witnessed marked increase in the import of plywood, but the cost of imports remained high. Calculated according to the current regulatory exchange rate (1:8.6), the cost, insurance, and freight, after deducting other charges, was 66.7 yuan per sheet (specifications: 1,220 by 2,440 by 3mm). This is basically the same as the cost after April. 2. After analyzing plywood import in the fourth quarter of 1993 and in 1994, we can come to the conclusion that it is certain that the resources of imported plywood will become tighter. Since the International Tropical Forest Organizations demanded that Malaysia reduced plywood export by 1.5 million cubic meters respectively in 1992 and 1993 and Indonesia recently put strict control over the quota of plywood export to China, our initial estimate is that our plywood import this year will be 20 percent less than that in last year. Second, domestic and international demands for South Pacific plywood has increased substantially. New house construction rate in the United States has increased 2 percent as compared to 1992; over 1.2 million houses will be built in Japan; and Korea has joined the competition for resources in the plywood market. Additionally, the peak season of remodeling and decorating in urban and rural areas of China at the end of this year and the beginning of next year is bound to fan demand for imported plywood. Because of this, we predict that the market of imported plywood will not slide substantially by yearend or at the beginning of next year. The prices of imported plywood will also rise from the current level.
