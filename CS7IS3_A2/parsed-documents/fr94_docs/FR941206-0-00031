FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William E.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of December 14, 1993 (58 FR 65452), FDA issued a final monograph for OTC pediculicide drug products (21 CFR part 358, subpart G). The final monograph becomes effective on December 14, 1994. Prior to that date, jurisdiction over pediculicide products is vested concurrently with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and with FDA. EPA and FDA labeling requirements for these products are different. After December 14, 1994, FDA will have sole jurisdiction over labeling and other requirements applicable to OTC pediculicide drug products. On February 25, 1994, the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA) submitted a citizen petition (Ref. 1) requesting certain actions because of the dual jurisdiction over OTC pediculicide drug products that exists until December 14, 1994. On April 14, 1994, a meeting was held between FDA, EPA, and NDMA (Ref. 2). On April 22, 1994, NDMA submitted a second, more detailed citizen petition (Ref. 3). NDMA requested FDA to provide industry at least 1 1/2 years from December 14, 1993 (the date of publication of the final monograph for OTC pediculicide drug products), for a smooth transition from EPA to FDA regulations for OTC pediculicide drug products. NDMA also requested FDA agreement not to bring enforcement proceedings against OTC pediculicide drug products applied to the human body and bearing EPA-mandated labeling for 1 year after December 14, 1994. The enforcement deferral would apply to products distributed with labeling printed before December 14, 1994, or where the products shipped into interstate commerce had been in stock before December 14, 1994. NDMA also submitted a citizen petition to EPA, which responded by notice dated September 6, 1994 (Ref. 4). FDA responded to NDMA (Refs. 5 and 6) stating that a 11/2 year extension to meet FDA labeling requirements would not be granted on a blanket basis for all products. The agency stated that requests for extensions would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The agency also indicated that any extension granted will be limited to the quantity of stock that a company has on hand prior to December 14, 1994. FDA also stated that, in its discretion, it agrees not to bring enforcement proceedings against OTC pediculicide drug products conforming with the final monograph and containing EPA-required labeling for a period of 1 year after the effective date of the final monograph on December 14, 1994. FDA has placed all of the correspondence on this subject in docket no. 81N&hyph;0201 for OTC pediculicide drug products, to enable interested persons to see the correspondence. The documents may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
