Energy Beams as Means of Processing Materials There are a number of materials with peculiar properties that reflect their microscopic atomic and electronic structures. By processing these materials properly, their properties can be made to play a role as functional materials. However, the adding new functions or compounding functions by means of artificial control requires the alteration of material structures with a method that far exceeds the compound energy of materials. This method of processing materials must be able to control space, time, energy volume, etc., very precisely. From this standpoint, directional energy beams such as ions, electrons, and lasers become important means of developing new functional materials by controlling material conditions artificially. For such research and development efforts, an understanding of the interaction between energy beams and target materials is significant. The basic interaction process involves the introduction of heterogeneous elements, electronic excitation, elastic collision, and nuclear reaction, and their ratios change according to the combinations of various kinds of energy beams and target materials. Ion beams, for example, play different interaction roles in different energy domains. Such a situation is surveyed in Table V-1. In general, the higher the level of energy is, the greater is the ratio of imparted energy for the electronic excitation process. The following is a discussion of the alteration of material structures, taking as a typical example organic materials, which are affected largely by electronic excitation processes, and inorganic materials, which are affected largely by the introduction of heterogeneous elements and elastic collision processes. 2. Organic Materials Organic polymers are used not only in all phases of our life, but are also very familiar as materials that constitute living organisms. Living organisms are quite well constructed, and are capable of responding properly to changes in the external environment. This is because the polymers that constitute organisms, such as membranes, have specific functions. Therefore, the artificial synthesis of such functional polymers has been studied, for instance, for such materials as selective separation membranes that allow specific materials to permeate, photochromic materials that change colors by radiation of light, and materials with high-temperature superconductivity. These materials are types of functional materials that not only implement the functions of living organisms, but also possess new functions that living organisms do not have. In synthesizing such organic functional materials, the use of energy beams, especially the use of electronic beams, has been studied. Recently, there has been considerable research on the use of ion beams and laser beams as well. (1) Use of Electronic Beams The reactions of materials that are radiated by electronic beams can be grouped into two categories: the primary process, where the energy of radiated electrons is applied to the material through collision and ionization, as well as excitation, and occurs adiabatically in a very short time; and the secondary process, which is caused by ions, radicals, and excitation molecules generated in the primary process. Electronic beams used for material synthesis normally have energy levels of from several hundred keV to several MeV, and the energy of the secondary electrons, generated in the primary process, at about 40-50 eV, also affects the secondary process. From the standpoint of molecules that collide, the effects of the secondary electrons are overwhelmingly larger than the direct effects of the radiated electrons. The secondary electrons with low energy levels generate ionization as well as excitation continuously in the neighborhood of their occurrence, and produce several ions and excitation molecules. As these ions and excitation molecules possess excessive energy, they themselves develop into other ions and radicals, and also generate various products due to addition, charge transfer, and reaction with neutral molecules. Synthesis of particles and thin films can be done by polymerization using electronic beam radiation. For instance, stable particles with a diameter of 20-30 ï¿½m were obtained by emulsion polymerization of styrene. Positive and negative resist materials also were obtained by applying 20 layers of polymer thin film on a silicon or gallium arsenide wafer, and then radiating it with electronic beams 250 nm in diameter. The graft polymerization method is often used as a polymerization method. In this method, polymer radicals generated by radiation are used as a starter for polymerization response of monomers. As graft polymerization using monomers that are different from the constituent unit of the base polymers results in chemical synthesis of polymers of different properties, the properties of the original polymers can be changed permanently. Since the yield of graft polymerization is dependent on the radiation dose, and not on dose rate, the amount of starter needed for a reaction can be obtained in a short time by irradiating it at a high dose rate using an accelerator. Practical application of graft polymerization by electronic beam radiation was examined, and a film that was permeable only to positive ions selectively was developed. This was accomplished by introducing carboxyl into the film, which was radiated with the accelerator, to produce graft polymerization of acrylic acid. In this case, it is necessary to distribute the polymerized acrylic acid in the film uniformly so it will serve as a separating membrane. This was achieved in the practical process by setting the radiation dose at 100-200 kGy, and the reaction time at two to three hours. This product has been used for separating membranes of button-type silver oxide cells. There also is the possibility of using it for separating membranes of nickel cadmium secondary cells in the future. The same method is used for graft polymerization of radiated fiber polymers, such as polypropylene, with styrene, and it is expected to be put into practical use as an absorbent deodorizer for ammonia gas, tobacco smoke, and pet odor. Furthermore, heat-resistant and chemical-resistant ion exchange films, selective permeable films for gas and liquids, metal collectors, and organism-affinity films and tube are in the stage of research and development. In this way, there are many research examples of the synthesis of organic functional materials using electronic beams, and such research and development is expected to further expand in the future. One reason is that electronic accelerators can be utilized relatively easily. At present there are about 800 accelerators in Japan, and about 20 percent of them are estimated to be for industrial use. It is also noted that the advantage of using electronic beams for synthesis methods has become obvious. Catalyzers are usually used for the synthesis of organic materials. Using electronic beams, however, has a number of advantages. For example, there is no need for high temperatures, no chance of introducing impurities such as catalyzer pieces into products, and easy control of the reaction by turning the beams on and off. (2) Use of Ion Beam Figure V-1 illustrates a typical phenomenon that occurs when ion beams are radiated on a material. The figure shows the results of radiation on a silicon wafer by changing the energy of Pd ions from several 10 eV to several MeV. At 1 keV or below, radiated ions lose energy on the material surface, and accumulate as a film after being neutralized. At 1 MeV or above, a layer is formed deep inside the material. The depth changes approximately in proportion to the injected energy of the ions. In the energy range between 1 keV and 1 MeV, the sputter phenomenon, where atoms on the surface of the material are cut out by colliding ions, is observed. The curve in the center of the figure indicates the numbers of ions sputtered by an ion. Similar trends can be observed in any combination of materials and ions, even though there are some differences in the range of energy and sputter rate. Based on such radiation effects, research on the possibility of adding functions to organic materials has been conducted (Table V-2). The most commonly reported research involves improvements in the electric conductivity of plastics, such as polyethylene. There is a report on polyacethylene, where p-n junction occurred between the layer created by ion injection and the original material. Concerning surface improvement, there are examples of improved adhesion between metal and plastic, as well as improved antithrombotic properties in silicon rubber. There have been experiments with ion beam resists in the submicron range, permeability improvement for gas, and optical reflectance and refractivity improvements. These improvements to organic materials by ion beam radiation can be accounted for as the result of the cutting of molecular chains, carbonization, and switching to the amorphous state. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table V-2.

For instance, this technique is used to control perforation by nuclear track and molecular orientation. When ions with a large atomic number and an energy level higher than several 10 MeV are radiated on an organic film, the ions, without stopping, penetrate the film if it is thin. When this film is processed with acid or alkali, the film is perforated through the sections where the ions penetrated. An organic film suitable for this purpose is a polymer named CR-39. CR-39 has been used for neutron ray detectors, and as a material for dose measurement in space. CR-39 film was radiated with gold ion beams with an energy level of 11.4 MeV per nucleon, and processed in a sodium hydrate solution at 6N at 60ï¿½C for four to five hours to obtain a perforated film. The film has about 5 x 10[.sup]5[/] holes, which are basically vertical cylinders, with a diameter of 2 ï¿½m, per 1 cm[.sup]2[/]. Only the holes of the film were then chemically modified by graft polymerization. For example, when the holes were combined with a kind of hydrogen that varies its volume by temperature by 5 percent in weight, the holes at 1.2 ï¿½m at 40ï¿½C were completely shut at 0ï¿½C (Figure V-2) as observed with an electronic microscope. Using this phenomenon, it is possible to produce a new film that controls the flow through its holes by changes of temperature. When molecules with both hydrophilic groups and hydrophobic groups in the same molecular structure are dropped on the surface of water, and repeat arranging orientation by adding pressure and catching with a glass wafer, a film consisting of layers of single-molecule films can be obtained. However, its mechanical strength is not sufficient as it is, and it is necessary to reinforce the film by combining individual molecules by such methods as polymerization. Then, after accumulating diacetylene monomers for 30 to 50 layers, it was polymerized by irradiating it with ion beams and ultraviolet rays. An examination of the structure of the layered film by X-ray diffraction spectrum showed that a film with superb orientation could be obtained with ion beam radiation compared to ultraviolet ray radiation. As illustrated in Figure V-3, when flex monomers are radiated with ion beams, the carbon-carbon linkage is shaken and polymerized after all the molecules are loosened. The oriented organic thin film obtained this way has a long conjugate system, and features nonlinear optical properties such as p electrons can move about the layers freely. For instance, when this film was injected by an optic laser with a wavelength of 1.907 ï¿½m, higher harmonics waves with a frequency three times higher were observed. When such a material with three-dimensional nonlinear optics is used, diffraction factors and absorption coefficients can be changed. Therefore, such materials are expected to be applied to elements for optical communications and optical memory in future. Recently, materials (hybrid materials) that are accumulated for materials to interact with each other on the atomic and molecular levels are being considered. When realized, such materials should have superb properties that far exceed those of the original materials. The creation of hybrid materials requires extraordinary distance between atoms and between molecules, the creation of anisotropy, and approximation between materials. For this purpose, such methods as vacuum evaporation, plasma CVD, molecular beam epitaxy, ion sputtering, and ion injection are effective. In the future, the synthesis of hybrid film materials with various combinations of materials produced by different layering methods will be explored experimentally using ion beams. As a result of such efforts, materials with new functions, such as organic superconductivity based on the tunnel effects, will be developed. (3) Use of Laser Beams The development of organic materials using lasers is in progress along with the spread of excimer laser. Excimer laser beams possess such properties as high durability, monochromatism, directionality, short pulse, etc., and are suitable for microprocessing. As an example of using a polymer material as the base, a polymer film was radiated with lasers to cause aberrations (a dispersing phenomenon of decomposed materials with impulsive sound and emission of light), and microprocessing at the level of microns on the surface of film was tried experimentally. One experiment involved inducing decomposed materials to accumulate on a wafer to produce a thin film. It is expected that such efforts will be applied to produce optoelectronic elements in the future. Furthermore, when ultraviolet-ray lasers are radiated on the surface of acrylic resin, moving the laser spot while radiating causes a hardened layer to form on the surface in the trace of the laser spot. By accumulating the layers, a more complex solid can be formed (the optical carving method). Its solution is about 0.1 ï¿½m at present, and its application to the processing of micromachines is being examined by improving its precision. In addition, it is also noted that the carbon cluster molecule C60, which has attracted attention as a future functional material, is produced by laser beam evaporation. 3. Inorganic Materials Use of ion beams, along with other energy beams, brings about radical changes in material structures. Electronic excitation and elastic diffusion processes cause crystalline materials to break their chemical linkage, and turn amorphous by atomic displacement. Such a state is one of disequilibrium, and presents solid state properties that are different from ordinary solid state properties. Table V-3 indicates typical property changes of inorganic materials turned amorphous by ion beam radiation. It shows that there are large effects, not only on optical properties, but also on electric and chemical properties. In this way, the use of energy beams facilitates basic property and space control, and its spin-off effects in materials development cannot be overestimated. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table V-3.

TIARA also has promoted research on the advanced use of radiation, such as the development of new materials. Figure V-4 illustrates a typical system for ion beam processing mainly for inorganic materials. The system is capable of ion radiation and injection with temperature as a parameter and on-site ion beam analysis, which are important in material processing. As a means of additional processing after ion injection, ultrafast thermal processing on the order of several 10 ns by YAG lasers is possible. A goniometer also is installed for low-temperature ion channeling experiments, so that such data as location change on the atomic level of the injected elements, and the elements constituting the target materials can be obtained. Cooling can be controlled continuously within a range from 15 K to 300 K, and data on the interactions between the injected elements and radiation defects are needed for analysis of the state of material disequilibrium, which is an important feature of ion beam processing. This system will be established and made available for operation by December in 1993 as part of a compound beam use experiment consisting of middle-energy heavy-ion radiation equipment, low-energy ion radiation equipment, and middle-energy light-ion radiation equipment in the facilities of TIARA. This section addresses metallic bond materials, ionic bond materials, and covalent materials as typical inorganic materials. Typical examples and the mechanism of basic functional addition are presented in terms of interactions between energy beams and materials. (1) Improvement of Critical Current by Introduction of Electronic Excitation Defect As most of the energy added in the electronic excitation process becomes heat that is transformed to the lattice system in metallic materials, this process becomes important in compounds. Although lattice defects called color center are generated easily by ionizing radiation in alkali halides, lattice defects are generated by high-density electronic excitation by high-energy heavy-ion radiation in oxides. When incident ion energy reaches a level of about GeV, linear lattice defects (ion tracks) with a diameter of about 100 A expanded beyond the atomic unit can be introduced. These lattice defects effectively serve to pin magnetic flux in oxide high-temperature superconductors, and contribute to the rise of critical current. Figure V-5 illustrates the results of changes in the critical current measured by the external magnetic field function and T after radiating Xe ions of 173 MeV at 77 K on a Y-group oxide high-temperature superconductor for 4 x 10[.sup]11[/]/cm[.sup]2[/] parallel to the C axis. As the figure indicates, when lattice defects (in the amorphous range) introduced by radiating Xe ions are parallel to the direction of the magnetic field, they increase critical current thereby serving as an effective pinning center. The strength of pinning is thought to be the largest when the size of the pinning center is about the same size as the coherent length of the material. This indicates that the high-energy heavy-ion radiation method is capable of controlling the direction, dose, and ionic species, and is an indispensable material processing method to upgrade research in critical current improvement for oxide superconductors. (2) Improved Sensitivity of Image Memory Elements Using Spew Defects/Heterogeneous Element Introduction Here, enhancement of sensitivity in the memory process of optical images by introducing ion radiation lattice defects to PLZT (lead-lanthanum-zirconate-titanate) oxide superconductors is discussed. Defects are created in PLZT mainly by the displacement of constituent atoms in the elastic scattering process. Electrons captured by lattice defects induce optical current by the radiation of light needed to memorize optical images and to reduce the applied current needed for orientation change in the dielectric domain. In this way, by controlling ionic species and ionic energy, it becomes possible to introduce radiation defects adjusted at the energy level of the captured electrons at the location corresponding to the depth to which light for memory reaches. Therefore, image memory elements sensitive to light across a broad range of frequencies can be formed. In Figure V-6, the inverse number of the light volume needed for image memory is defined as exposure sensitivity, and the results of measurements as a function of wavelength of light are illustrated. When Al and Ne are radiated at 500 keV for approximately 10[.sup]15[/]/cm[.sup]2[/], exposure sensitivity is improved by two orders of magnitude, and wavelength dependency is removed. Therefore, image memory capability is enhanced. (3) Addition of Electric Conductivity by Introduction of Heterogeneous Elements One-dimensional conductors can be created if it is possible to introduce metallic elements between subcrystal lattices consisting of metallic elements to constitute a compound. Ion injection, which is a means of processing amorphous materials, is effective in realizing this. The state of the materials thus obtained depends largely on injection temperature. For instance, when LiF crystals are injected with Na or K ions at 78 K, a broad absorption belt from visible to infrared light is formed, and this is totally different from the case of injection at 300 K. It can be concluded from this light absorption phenomenon that a metal state linking the Li of the injected ions and the mother lattice in a chain is formed parallel to the surface. This continuous metal layer changes its structure by annealing and becomes discontinuous metal particles. Figure V-7 illustrates change of conductance depending on the amount of K ion injection at 100 keV, and injection at approximately 2.9 x 10[.sup]16[/]/cm[.sup]2[/] (approx. 5%) increases it by six orders of magnitude. When the frequency dependency of alternating conductance is examined as a function of the amount of ionic injection, frequency dependency disappears at approximately 2.9 x 10[.sup]16[/]/cm[.sup]2[/]. This is considered to be a nonmetal-metal transfer caused by one-dimensional contact of Li and K. (4) Control of Chemical Response by Introduction of Heterogeneous Elements A considerable amount of research into the control of chemical response using the ion injection method has been conducted from the standpoint of catalytic materials, because ion injection causes alterations of the surface layer. Since the elements used as catalyzers are generally inactive, for instance, in the case of sapphire, it is necessary to inject ions into the sapphire and to stabilize the catalyzer element in the state of a high-speed response material into the crystal structure of sapphire in the heating process later on. The ion beam analysis method is used to analyze structural changes concentrated on the surface layer. Figure V-8 illustrates the relationship between response speed and response time when hydrogen is added to toluene using hydrogen and sapphire processed in an oxygen atmosphere in advance. In the reaction, methylcyclohexane is generated. The radical rise of response speed in the heat processing test piece in the first 20 minutes is attributed to the formation of water by the remaining oxygen atoms, which affect the hydrogen adding process, and the real process is indicated with the dotted line. On the other hand, in the case of processing in a hydrogen atmosphere, indicated with the solid line, the response speed is reduced by almost one order of magnitude. When advance processing for individual catalyzers is compared, heat processing in an oxygen atmosphere produces certain results regardless of the manner of handling. (5) Phase Separation and Crystallization Control by Introduction of Heterogeneous Elements The simultaneous introduction of heterogeneous elements and radiation defects to materials by both the ion injection method, and the consecutive phase separation process by heat processing, is an important part of crystallization control research for glass materials. Figure V-9 illustrates the distribution in depth of Li atoms obtained during heat processing after injecting Li ions at 50 keV for 1 x 10[.sup]17[/]/cm[.sup]2[/] into SiO[.sup]2[/] glass. The distribution of Li atoms is a result obtained by an energy analysis of the recoil of Li atoms from elastic collisions with heavy ions ([.sup]28[/]Si) as a probe. Although the depth distribution of Li atoms is not changed by annealing at temperatures up to 873 K, they accumulate on the surface above that temperature as indicated in the figure. Along with the redistribution of Li, H atoms in the glass disperse internally and induce crystallization in the range of the injected Li ions. Since crystallization does not occur by injecting Si or O ions that constitute the glass network, the role of Li atoms themselves in crystallization has been concluded. As the amount of Li ion injection is large in this case, phase-separated Li[.sup]2[/]O prevents restoration of the glass network by SiO[.sup]4[/] tetrahedron formation, and functions instead as the core of single crystallization. Using such a method, SiO[.sup]2[/] glass could be crystallized at a far lower temperature than the 2,073 K needed for melting by controlling the depth and area. (6) Application for Laser Radiation-Induced Phase Transfer and Data Memory Laser radiation of a semiconductor material with a small band gap generates fusion of the material by adding the excitation energy of the electronic system to the lattice system. When lasers with a pulse of several 10 ns are used, the material after fusing is cooled down at a ultrahigh speed, and it turns into an amorphous state. The amorphous state can be reversed to the original crystal state by longer laser radiation. The difference of reflectance between the crystal state and the amorphous state is expected to be large. Based on such results, detailed research on interaction between pulse lasers and materials is expected to be applied to the data memory process where repeated read and write are possible. Figure V-10 is a diagram illustrating the radiation effects of pulse lasers on Te at 750 A evaporated on a glass base, and indicates the range where radiation-induced transformation of Te can occur as a function of incident power and pulse width. The solid line indicates the minimum laser radiation condition to reach the fusing point of Te (450ï¿½C). From this research, the conditions for crystallization and the consequent transformation to the amorphous state that are important for recording of data can be discovered.
