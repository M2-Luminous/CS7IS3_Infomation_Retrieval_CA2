The talks held in the Solomon Islands and hailed as historic, were said to have ended with an agreement signed by both sides, paving the way to fresh peace negotiations. The negotiations will be aimed at ending the secessionist conflict on Papua New Guinea's copper rich island province. Some estimates have put the death toll in the area as high as 3,000, with casualties occurring either in fighting between rebels and Papua New Guinea forces, or indirectly through neglect resulting from lack of adequate food and medical care. Port Moresby was represented at the meeting in Honiara by the secretary of the prime minister's department, Brown Bai, and foreign affairs secretary Gabriel Dusava while the self-styled interim government of Bougainville was represented by Martin Miriori, Mike Forster and Moses Havini. Dusava confirmed the signing of the agreement but said details would be released officially by foreign minister Sir Julius Chan later this week. According to reports from Honiara the agreement states: "The purpose of this series of consultations is to pave way for peace and that must be the ultimate objective of the meeting." The interim government has meantime released a statement saying certain undertakings were agreed on and signed by both sides, a move which would open the way for further progressive negotiations. "I believe that there is now a real commitment to peace by both sides," spokesman Mike Forster said. "We are treading very carefully so as to keep both sides happy as we approach the pan-Bougainville conference." Forster said the meeting was only the second in what was hoped would become a long series of consultative meetings aimed at constructive measures to achieve peace. "By the end of the consultations this time, there was a sense of trust and understanding between the two negotiators which had been missing for years," Forster said. Further talks may continue in Australia, he said. Prime Minister Paias Wingti, "mindful" of two failed peace accords since the outbreak of hostilities, is said to be taking a cautious approach to the new dialogue. He has said the talks would be low-key to avoid building up false hope. The agreement commits both sides to negotiations and to implementing as soon as possible a schedule within which a mechanism can be put in place for a peaceful settlement of the crisis. This latest development follows moves by Port Moresby to seek the assistance of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and the Solomons in setting up a regional peacekeeping force to monitor the peace process. Each has agreed in principle to establishment of the force which would use soldiers provided by Fiji, the Solomons and Tonga.
