He emphasized: Our work in all fields of endeavor must subordinate to and serve the overall interests of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability, which have a bearing on the work of the whole party and the whole country. We must correctly handle the relations among reform, development, and stability; and must firmly carry out various reform programs. Meanwhile, we must pay attention to discovering problems and promptly solving them to ensure the smooth progress of reform and development. At the Hainan delegation's group discussion, Ruan Chongwu, provincial party secretary and governor; Huang Baozhang, director of the provincial planning department; Wang Faren, director of the provincial land reclamation bureau; and Du Bilan, director of the State Oceanography Bureau's Ocean Strategy Research Institute; spoke successively. In light of the deliberation of the Government Work Report, the delegates raised proposals to Premier Li Peng on strengthening Hainan's infrastructure, developing its rubber production, and exploiting its marine resources. Li Peng said: Hainan, as China's largest special economic zone, has made remarkable progress in implementing reform and opening up. The province is one of China's most promising areas. He expressed the hope that Hainan will proceed from its special feature in concentrating efforts on promoting economic construction and achieving breakthroughs in key areas to spur national development. He said: Hainan should further promote the special economic zone's development by making use of its advantages in location and resources to serve as the country's vegetable supply and rice breeding bases and quicken infrastructure development. The premier emphasized: The special economic zone is a showcase for opening up China to the outside world and for building socialist spiritual civilization. The deeper reform goes and the wider China opens itself up to the outside world, the more necessary it is to build spiritual civilization. We must ensure that the work in both areas is attended to. At the Jilin delegation's group discussion, the premier first listened to speeches by Jilin City Mayor Zhan Yuechang and Siping City Mayor Zang Shengye. It was almost noon, but deputies still waited for the premier to speak. Li Peng said smilingly: "I have stated all my views in the Government Work Report. It would be better for me to listen to your views." Then, Geng Zhaojie, Changchun No.1 Automobile Plant director, and Hunchun City Mayor Jin Minxiong spoke on ways for helping large and medium state enterprises tide over difficulties, introducing a share-holding system, and opening border areas. After listening to the deputies, Li Peng said: Jilin, an old industrial base and a major grain-producing province, has made contributions to the state over the years. Since the implementation of the reform and opening policy, especially since the publication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches made during his southern tour, the provincial economy has developed rapidly. He said: "I worked in Jilin for more than a decade. I have feelings for its people and places, and am very happy about the changes that have occurred in the province. I believe that through your continued efforts, Jilin will become more prosperous and more developed with each passing day." Li Peng said: The theme of the current NPC session is to earnestly implement the 20-character principle [seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability] and to correctly handle the relations among reform, development, and stability. In developing the economy, we should focus attention on improving efficiency. On ways for invigorating state enterprises, he pointed out: The invigoration of state enterprises is a focal point and knotty task in deepening the reform of the economic structure. The key to improving the performance of state enterprises lies in raising their efficiency. This year we must do everything possible to accomplish this task. The government should create a favorable external environment for enterprises to change their operating mechanisms. But, more importantly, enterprises should rely on themselves. They should tap their potential, establish a modern enterprise system, improve the competence of their managers, upgrade technology, strengthen management, and gear their production to market demands. It is hoped that governments at all levels and enterprise managers will seriously study and work out feasible measures to gradually build up state enterprises' ability to compete in the market. After attending the discussion with deputies from Jilin, Comrade Li Peng paid a courtesy call on the Fujian delegation. He told them: Fujian, a vanguard of reform and opening up, has made progress in recent years. The provincial economy keeps developing and the people's mental outlook has also undergone tremendous changes. We will continue to carry out more successfully the policy of opening up to the outside world. Fujian shall score greater successes in opening up to the outside world. Noting uneven economic development within Fujian, Li Peng said: The province should make efforts to narrow the gap between fast-growing Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Quanzhou and the backward northwestern and eastern parts in a bid to achieve common prosperity. After localities become prosperous, they should help others cast off poverty and become well off so as to achieve common prosperity throughout Fujian. It is hoped that Fujian will make further efforts in this regard.
