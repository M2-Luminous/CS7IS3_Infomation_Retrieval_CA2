Since the mid-June, various places along domestic railway lines within Fujian Province were hit by torrential rain, which was over 180 millimetres on average and up to some 400 millimetres in some places. Landslides because of floods occurred along the Yongan branch railway line and outbound railway lines between June 17 and 19. Roadbed was undermined, culverts blocked up and tracks buried by mud. The 92-kilometre outbound railway line between Laizhou and Gutian was badly hit since early morning on June 19 when railway service there stopped. Officials from each section of outbound railway lines went to the scene to direct the flood control and emergency repair in order to make railway service from Fuzhou to elsewhere across the country resume as soon as possible.
