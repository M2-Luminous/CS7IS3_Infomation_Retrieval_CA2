In preparation for upper house elections in summer 1995, the coalition parties believe it is necessary to open talks on interparty cooperation in election campaigns within this summer. In connection with this, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has recently requested a high-ranking official of the multiparty parliamentary group Shin-Ryokufukai to expand the group to the entire coalition as soon as possible. The merger of upper house parliamentary groups will be carried out among the Shin-Ryokuhukai, the Komeito, and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. Informal negotiations are now under way among SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo, Komeito Deputy Secretary General Naohiko Okubo, and Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] Parliamentary Group Chairman Yukihisa Yoshida. To cope with the next general election, Prime Minister Hosokawa is seeking a unified parliamentary group in the lower house. The upper house's moves toward a parliamentary group merger involving the SDPJ is likely to accelerate inter-party alliance, or even party realignment, in the lower house. In a speech given to the 10 March meeting of the "10-Men Association of the Coalition Village," a gathering of coalition leaders chaired by former SDPJ Chairman Makoto Tanabe, SDPJ Secretary General Kubo said: "The coalition must fully grapple with the 1995 upper house elections narrowing our candidates. We must unify our parliamentary groups." Attendants from other parties basically agreed with his opinion. Touching on the possible timing of the parliamentary group merger at the upper house, a senior Komeito official said "we are seeking the merger in the end of the current Diet session." The new group may be called the "Dai-Ryokufukai." At the upper house, the Shin-Ryokuhukai was formed last month as a joint parliamentary group of the Shinseito, the DSP, the Democratic Reform Party [Minshu Kaikaku Rengo], the Japan New Party [JNP], and the Sports Peace Party. In particular, the Shinseito and the JNP take positive stances toward the parliamentary group union because it may trigger similar moves at the lower house, or even a political party realignment. In mid-February, Prime Minister Hosokawa met with Shinseito Parliamentary Group Acting Chairman Ichiji Ishii at the prime minister's office and make a request to "unify (all coalition parties) as soon as possible." The Komeito has been taking positive attitudes toward its own participation in the unified parliamentary group. However, the party wants the SDPJ to join the group simultaneously, since it would be unfavorable to leave the largest ruling party in an isolated position. Therefore, the Komeito is currently "waiting for action by the SDPJ" (as a senior Komeito official said).
