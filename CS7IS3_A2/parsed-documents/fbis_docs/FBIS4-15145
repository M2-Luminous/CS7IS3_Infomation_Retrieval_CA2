Among other things, he said: [Begin Meshkov recording] We have all been notified that by decree of the president of Ukraine a presidential mission to the Crimean Republic has been set up in the Crimea. I am unable to see this step as anything other than a simple political provocation. [end recording] [Announcer] Meshkov laid all responsibility for the possible consequences of this provocation on the highest leadership of Ukraine. The Crimean president expressed the hope that new politicians would come to power in Ukraine as a result of future presidential elections with whom the Crimean leadership would be able to hold a constructive dialogue. Yuryy Meshkov added that he did not intend to enter into contact with the Ukrainian president's representative, Valeryy Gorbatov, who had arrived in Simferopol. Our correspondent, Ilya Kapelevich, managed to contact by telephone Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yevgenyy Saburov in Simferopol: [Begin recording] [Kapelevich] Please tell us what has happened and what the situation is now. [Saburov] Ukraine has broken its own law. It has broken resolutions by the Supreme Soviet of the Crimea and has introduced the institution of governor general to the Crimea. The governor general has said he is going to deal with all of Crimea's external links, that his functions are political, that he is going to be the father of the people, and that he has been called on to lead our dim-witted [malorazumnyy], colonial people to a bright, communist future under the guidance of, so to speak, the Ukrainian leadership. The reaction in the Crimea to this, how should I say, joke of a step is extremely negative. [Kapelevich] You met Leonid Kravchuk and you thought that it was quite a positive dialogue. Indeed, Leonid Kravchuk reacted positively after the personal meeting. Did he not warn you or notify you at all of his subsequent actions? [Saburov] The conversation was, of course, quite serious and profound. Some of our economic proposals were given a positive reception straightaway, some with caution. On the whole, there was a lot of fear, I could see, but the conversation was fine. And then right after this new decree appeared. [Kapelevich] What do you know about the deployment of five Ukrainian Navy warships, of an additional contingent of Ukrainian special forces? [Saburov] All sorts of rumors are going around and I do not have any reliable information regarding whether Ukrainian soldiers have landed or have not landed. I do not know what the aim was if they did. Maybe just to stretch their legs or inspect something or other? The fact that they did all this when President Meshkov was away is probably just another coincidence -- or maybe it is not. On the whole, this manner of operating on the sly is quite widespread here, and although Ukraine is supposedly closer to Europe than Russia, scratch the surface and it is more like Asia.
