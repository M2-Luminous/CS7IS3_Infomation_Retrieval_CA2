He said that, according to Mexico's legal framework, the task of observing the elections only involves Mexican citizens. In his offices at PRI National Headquarters, the recently appointed PRI leader nevertheless explained that his party has no objections if national observer groups monitor the federal electoral process, or if foreign visitors learn about the development and results of the electoral process. Pichardo Pagaza also said that, according to the Mexican legal framework, national observers are permitted. Therefore, the PRI endorses a decision adopted by the government of the Republic to invite the OAS to issue a technical opinion on the national electoral process' progress and to state its views to Mexican observers. The chairman of the PRI CEN said: "We have nothing to hide; quite the contrary, we want the national and international public to know why we will win. We have no objection if private visitors come from every part of the world to learn about the developments in this electoral process." In his statements, Pichardo Pagaza noted the way in which the PRI is taking part in the electoral race for the presidency: "We are waging a clean and honest campaign and election." Nevertheless, the national leader of the tricolor party said he rejects the proposal presented by two U.S. legislators, which would enable them to be the ones who would examine and observe the Mexican elections. "Consequently, we reject the proposal presented by the two U.S. congressmen who illegally want to issue opinions on the Mexican federal elections results and process," the PRI leader emphasized.
