The leftist political leader explained that it is necessary to undertake a profound and in-depth investigation--which must also include the Army's Military Intelligence Battalion--to dismantle totally the apparatus that granted legitimacy to the so-called death squads. Zamora believes these groups are very small and that they operate under the protection of the former intelligence services, and, therefore, they must be sought out and eliminated to end a yet unconcluded period of our history. [Begin Zamora recording] It is much more possible now to struggle against them and eliminate them from our history. I believe that, in this case, they must be sought out at the institutions in which they could exist; for instance, we know that the S-2, and the police are places in which the death squads had operated, and we know that in the National Police, for instance, they have hired personnel that were members of the Finance Police S- 2 and National Guard S-2. I would investigate there. I believe the Army's Intelligence Battalion must also be investigated in this regard, as the former Secret Police, or the Army's former secret intelligence, has practically become the Intelligence Battalion. Those are the places where I think we should, or the Armed Forces themselves should, investigate to eliminate all of the personnel who could be linked to the past, which, I think, we all want to overcome now. [end recording] In that same regard, the leftist presidential candidate said there is an apparent attempt at corrupting the National Civilian Police [PNC], which was created in accordance with the Peace Agreements. He also said it is necessary, therefore, to correct the mistakes that are being made, such as the transfer of the Commission to Investigate Criminal Actions to that institution. [Begin Zamora recording] There is an apparent attempt to bias or corrupt--as I call it--the PNC project. What worries me most is the transfer to it of complete organizations, such as the Commission to Investigate Criminal Actions. There are people involved who are involved in tortures and the practices used in the past. If you want to read about this, I recommend the last UN human rights report which, upon analyzing the case of Mr. Grimaldi [not further identified], clearly states that the United Nations already had the name of Grimaldi's assassin. They passed the name on to the Commission to Investigate Criminal Actions, and the commission refused, for one month, to put him in jail. [end recording] Zamora reiterated the complaint of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] is resorting to what he called little tricks [triquinelas] of the past to carry out a fraud in the next elections, in light of which the pertinent corrective steps are already being carried out before the UN Observers for El Salvador. [Begin Zamora recording, in progress] ...little tricks [words indistinct] by the TSE. I think that is incorrect; it must not be allowed, because this country must have absolutely open elections. At the same time, I want to say that I have spoken to the other candidates, the Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] candidate and the candidate for the Christian Democratic Party, and they have both told me they think we must allow the political parties with their representation. I do not mean to say that Dr. Fidel Chavez Mena or Dr. Armando Calderon Sol are involved in these little tricks. I want this to be clear, because I have spoken to them and they have said this to me and, to honor the truth, I have to say this. [end recording] The country's complex situation regarding the fulfillment of the agreements, the development of the electoral campaign, and the TSE's work are worrisome. There is still a will to continue, however, working for the construction of democracy and the development of an open electoral process based on the mutual confidence of the political parties cited by Dr. Ruben Zamora.
