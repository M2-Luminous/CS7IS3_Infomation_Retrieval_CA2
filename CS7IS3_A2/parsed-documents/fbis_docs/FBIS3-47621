The U.S. Government's agreement with North Korea on the nuclear inspection leaves America's Asian allies wondering whether U.S. security assurances are reliable, Seth Cropsey, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, said. The Clinton administration should make no more concessions at the negotiating table, Cropsey said. Instead, it should inform North Korea that if it does not allow full international inspections of all its nuclear sites on a regular basis by Feb. 1, the United States will ask the U.N. Security Council for economic sanctions the following day, he said. The Clinton administration has already erred by postponing a diplomatic confrontation in the U.N. Security Council, where the issue of sanctions against the Kim regime should be raised, Cropsey said. "North Korea now realizes President Bill Clinton suffers from lack of nerve, yielding to the apparent implacability of an armed tyrant demonstrates vulnerability," Cropsey said. "It can only lead to more North Korean evasion, excuses, delaying tactics and in the end aggression -- perhaps nuclear aggression." Even worse, he said, "By placing two North Korean nuclear sites beyond the reach of international inspectors, the compromise leaves the way open for Kim to continue his weapons-building program." The compromise also abandons Washington's reasonable expectations that North Korea will allow regular inspections as set forth in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, he said. Cropsey, a former high-ranking U.S. Defense Ministry official, recommended that the United States seize the initiative in Asia with a number of bold steps. They include: -- Lift the trade embargo against Vietnam to demonstrate to North Korea that Americans are magnanimous to former foes. -- Increase pressure on Japan to reduce the flow of funds -- at least 600 million U.S. dollars a year -- from Korean residents in Japan who send desperately needed hard currency to North Korea. -- Promise more favorable terms to China as a means to enlist Beijing's help in putting economic pressure on Pyongyang. -- Hold a naval military exercise in the western Pacific to remind Kim Il-song how quickly America can move military forces over a long distance.
