This is the fifth regular meeting of the present session of the National Assembly after it was formed. It is the first regular meeting being called at the request of the opposition. According to the opposition, the purpose of the session that began on 28 November was to open debate on nuclear policy, but the government did not allow any discussion during the first two days of the session. The opposition had staged a walkout in protest. It was clear even on 28 November that the government did not want to hold any debate before the internal elections in December, and it succeeded in its goal. The opposition objected to it strongly and caused a lot of commotion. It walked out of the meetings held on 28 November and 1 December. The fact is that the opposition itself did not want to hold the debate on the nuclear issue before the election, it just wanted to gain some momentum which the law minister provided very well. Interestingly, the only thing the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] government did after it took office was to let the nation know that the Taj Mahal of desires, the dream of the atomic bomb or nuclear capability, had disintegrated three years ago. There is no example of such an insult to the desires of the people as was done by our rulers by making deals with the United States over the nuclear program. The governments of the PPP and the Muslim League have taken turns in ruling the nation since 1995, and both are equally guilty of selling the nuclear program to the United States. That is why both the parties were scared that some "truths" might be spilled during the debate in the assembly, and they suffered losses. Still, the opposition or the Muslim League had to raise the nuclear issue in the National Assembly because the PPP had accused the Muslim League of the whole fiasco by saying that "Nawaz Sharif sold the atomic bomb during his government." Now the PPP also wants to get rid of the allegation that it was alone in this crime. Anyhow, only time will tell what discussions will take place and what facts will be brought to light during the debate in the National Assembly. One thing is clear, any more information than what has already been shared will not come to light. Our government has sold the atomic bomb to Senator Larry Pressler instead of selling it to Iran. There are two important aspects of this deal. First, U.S. aid was bought in exchange for the sale of the atomic bomb. Second, a second hushed agreement was to help us get rid of the Kashmir problem and to help rid our leaders of the nuclear problem. The fact is that every Pakistani government was not in a position to open up to the people over such important issues as the nuclear program. Every government and every party has made some deal with the United States over these issues, especially the nuclear issue. That is why the former and the present ruling parties, the Muslim League and the PPP, do not want to talk about it at least until the internal elections. It should also be mentioned is that it is good idea to discuss sensitive and important issues in the Parliament. We should go a bit further and discuss topics of national importance at the national level so that all opinions are shared with the people and the people can feel involved in formation of these policies. Unfortunately, however, the atmosphere in the present Parliament is disgraceful. It would be useless to expect any concrete results from this exercise since this debate is taking place in an atmosphere of doubt about our rulers. It would not be inappropriate to say that those who will be talking loudly about it do not even have the right information about this issue. Most of them did not even know what the former chief of the Navy, Aslam Baig, got in return for selling the nuclear program to the United States. No one will be able to tell us if we have to sell the "atom" why was it sold to the United States, and not to Iran. If nothing else, some dignity could have been salvaged from this insult. Anyhow, the situation has deteriorated so much and our social system has fallen so low that no one is disturbed by this issue. Whatever the United States wants is happening now, had happened, and we are afraid will happen in the future. Our rulers and leaders have dragged the people in the streets into every problem and every issue so many times that the people have no faith in them nor do they have any energy left to be insulted. Now the people of this nation will just watch this drama of insults and embarrassments from afar. The rulers sitting in the capital have begun to understand it because they have seen the actual demonstration of this attitude during the long marches. They are trying to take advantage of this attitude now. By looking at the expression on the faces of the rulers, sitting in the capital and ruling the 120 million people, and their "bosses," we can tell without any mistake that they are preparing the people for something else by telling them about the death of the nuclear program at this time. What is that? We cannot even imagine it. However, we will have an idea during the next few days. The indications do not look good.
