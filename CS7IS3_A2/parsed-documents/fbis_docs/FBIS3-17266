Herzl, who resides in Riga, also represents Israel in Latvia and Estonia. The two widely discussed newspaper articles, especially in the American press, such as "Lithuania's List" in THE WASHINGTON POST last week, accusing Lithuania of rehabilitating persons involved in genocide against Jews. Justas Paleckis, the Lithuanian president's foreign policy adviser, said Brazauskas emphasized that several hundred people were denied rehabilitation. He added that a number of Nazi war criminals were put on trial in post-war years when it was quite difficult to "slip past." The Lithuanian leader said Lithuania is prepared to help investigate genocide against Jews, Lithuanians and other nations. Herzl said she is satisfied that persons convicted in post-war years are not rehabilitated automatically. The president and the ambassador also discussed bilateral relations between their countries. Brazauskas said Tel Aviv is always at the top of the list when creation of new Lithuanian Embassies is discussed. Paleckis quoted Herzl as saying that a top-ranking Lithuanian official is expected to visit Israel this year.
