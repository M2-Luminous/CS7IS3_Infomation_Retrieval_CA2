Furthermore, due to their decreasing living standards, Hungarians would like May to be a month of change, Horn said. Referring to recent harsh attacks on Horn, a journalist asked the MSZP Chairman whether he was considering giving up his political career. Horn replied: "The support and encouragement I receive everywhere in the country lends me strength. The idea of giving up my political career because of a series of slanders has never occurred to me at all. All the more because I know that this is what they would like to achieve through these provocations. I do not cling on to any office, but over the past four years my primary goal was to bring the new, democratic, European left-wing to victory in Hungary," Horn said.
