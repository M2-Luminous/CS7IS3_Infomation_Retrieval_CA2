Presidential candidate Dr. Ruben Zamora said the Salvadoran left hopes the irregularities registered on 20 March will be overcome so as to guarantee the cleanliness of the process. The commitment made by Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) magistrates to correct the anomalies is key to democracy, and the cleanliness of the Salvadoran electoral process depends on it, Dr. Zamora remarked. Zamora concluded by saying a draft bill will be presented before the Assembly requesting a series of temporary reforms to the Electoral Code.

In a news conference, presidential candidate Zamora confirmed the TSE commitment to correct irregularities registered in the previous elections. He added: "The TSE has pledged to double the number of polling stations in the largest cities and place ballot boxes apart so as to avoid overcrowding."
