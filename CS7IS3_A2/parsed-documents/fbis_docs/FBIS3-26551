According to the Shenzhen City CPC Committee propaganda department, replacing the propaganda board with Deng Xiaoping's picture with a new one is an important official task of the city before the current spring festival. This in no way implies that Deng Xiaoping will come to south China on an inspection tour again. Some local residents were seen standing on the roadside commenting on the new picture and the new "quotation from Deng." The new picture still stands at the original place, namely, near the Grand Shenzhen Theater where Hongling Road Middle and Shennan Road meet and which one must pass when traveling from the city to Nantou and Dongguan. The board is five meters tall and 20 meters wide. As there is a very big open space around the board, one can see it very clearly from the top of a building several kilometers away. The new picture of Deng Xiaoping is mainly blue, green, and white. Deng's picture occupies a prominent position with blue sky and white clouds overhead and the Great Wall at the bottom. In the picture, Deng Xiaoping is looking at Shenzhen and Dapeng Bay. In the upper left corner is a 13-character quotation from Deng which reads: "Follow unswervingly the party's basic line for 100 years." Huang Xinhua, deputy chief of the Shenzhen City CPC Committee propaganda department, said: Putting up a new propaganda board does not imply that Deng will make another south China trip. Deng is held in high esteem by the citizens in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. He has been to Shenzhen twice, and this reveals his deep concern about Shenzhen's economic development. It is annual routine business of the city government to replace the old picture with a new one, which carries special implications. A local resident, aged over 50, who was passing the picture on a bike, said to this reporter: Deng Xiaoping's reform and open policies enjoy popular support. It would certainly be a good thing if he were to come to Shenzhen again. He, however, felt the new picture was not as nice as the old one because in the new picture Deng looks older. Another cadre who came to Shenzhen from another province on business also said that the "new quotation from Deng Xiaoping" is not as good as the old one.
