This came in a statement issued at the conclusion of the parliamentary talks that were held between a delegation from the Yemeni House of Representatives and the Iraqi National Assembly. The statement stresses the Iraqi people's denunciation of the interference of some suspect regional and foreign parties to prolong the fighting and impose the status quo of disunity in order to dismember the Republic of Yemen and jeopardize the unity of its people. The two sides condemned the continued blockade imposed on the people of Iraq. They called for an immediate end to the blockade since Iraq has implemented all its obligations toward the unfair UN Security Council resolutions issued against it. The Yemeni House of Representatives delegation visiting Iraq, led by Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kibsi, held meetings with officials and heads of unions and professional and popular organizations to explain the latest developments in the situation in Yemen and the efforts to resolve the crisis in a manner that conforms with constitutional legitimacy, which is being defended by the fraternal Yemeni people.
