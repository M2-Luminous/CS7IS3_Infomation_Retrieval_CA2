The year 1993 was one in which we implemented in an all-around way the 14th National Party Congress guidelines and triumphantly marched along the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We have made important achievements in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. A new situation has emerged in all fields of work. The national economy has maintained its momentum of rapid growth. Positive results have been made in macroeconomic regulation and control measures adopted in conjunction with efforts to solve some difficulties and contradictions in the economic development. Our agriculture has produced good a harvest, and all aspects of our economic work in the countryside have developed. The industry has grown rapidly. Enterprise efficiency has risen to some extent. The investment structure has improved. Our transportation, electric power, telecommunications, and other key construction sectors have scored remarkable results. The urban and rural markets are abundant with colorful goods, and business is brisk. The people's livelihood has continued to improve. In line with the demands of building a socialist market economic structure, we have continued to deepen reform. As a result, the relationship between economic sectors has become more rational, the pace of our opening up to the outside world has accelerated, our import and export trade has steadily increased, and foreign investment has risen by a big margin. The building of socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal system has strengthened. Science and technology have achieved major breakthroughs. Education has steadily developed. Culture, arts, press, publication, radio, television, sports, public health, and other undertakings have all expanded in the process of reform. In the turbulent, changing international environment, our great socialist motherland has seen economic growth, political stability, national unity, and social progress, and is standing towering like a giant in the East. Comrades, friends: The year 1994 will be one in which the national economy will maintain its momentum of sound development. It will also be a year crucial to our efforts to push forward reform. We must take as our guide Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, implement in an all-round way the guidelines of the 14th CPC National congress and Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, accelerate the building of a socialist market economic structure, maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economic, safeguard political stability, and promote social progress in an all-round way. We should unswervingly carry out economic construction as the central task. We should seek new ways for economic development. We should bring economic construction onto the track of relying on scientific and technological progress and the improved quality of workers. We should concentrate our efforts on structural readjustment and the improvement of efficiency. Food is the first necessity of the people. At no time must we relax our efforts in agriculture. We must develop the rural economy in an all-round manner and strive to do everything possible to reap a good agricultural harvest this year. We must ensure the steady and increased production of grain, cotton, and oil. We should try in every possible way to increase incomes for farmers so as to improve their living standards. Conscientious efforts should be made to effectively run large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and to increase their vitality. Enterprises should be market-oriented, and they should readjust their product mix and produce marketable goods. They should step up their technical transformation and strengthen their operations and management to ensure the maintenance and increase of the value of state-owned assets. We should strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, rationally control the scale of capital construction, and strive to maintain a basic balance between total demand and total supply. At the same time, we should further deepen the structural reform in education, science and technology, and culture so as to promote the development and thriving of other undertakings. The Third Plenary Session of the party's 14th Central Committee made the blueprint for establishing a socialist market economic structure, which is the program of action for us to further deepen reform. The main tasks of reform this year are: 1. To effectively organize the implementation of major measures for fiscal, taxation, financial, investment, and other reforms and establish and improve the system of macroeconomic regulation and control; 2. To continuously change the operating mechanisms of state-owned enterprises and seek effective ways for establishing a modern enterprise system meeting the requirements of the socialist market economy; and 3. To appropriately advance price reform after giving full consideration to the tolerance of the different sectors of society and develop and perfect the market system. Our reform tasks this year are arduous. But we can certainly ensure the smooth development of various reforms provided we work together with one heart, carefully organize our efforts, coordinate with one another, and promptly handle contradictions discovered on the road of advance according to the principles and arrangements set by the party Central Committee and the State Council. We should continue to open wider to the outside world, making use of more foreign capital, technology, and managerial expertise. We should further develop foreign trade and exchanges and cooperation [with other countries] in science and technology, education, culture, and other fields. Now our country has such good conditions as opportunity, a favorable geographical position, and the support of the people [tian shi di li ren he]. Our national economy is growing steadily and rapidly [chi xu kuai su zeng zhang]. It is estimated that our market has a tremendous potential. It can be expected that there will be very good prospects for our economic and technological cooperation with various countries of the world. Comrades and friends: Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability are the major principle for our country's work this year [called the 20-character principle]. All fields of work must be subordinated to and serve these interests. We should promote reform of the economic structure during the rapid growth of the national economy; at the same time, we should also maintain the steady growth of the national economy during the transformation of the economic structure. Therefore, we must conscientiously and properly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability. We should uphold the principle of grasping two links at the same time and putting stress on both links. While concentrating our efforts on economic reform and development, we should continue to do a good job in strengthening the building of the CPC, and vigorously strengthen the building of socialist spiritual civilization. We should develop socialist democracy, strengthen the legal system, deepen the anticorruption struggle, and effectively solve public-order problems in a comprehensive way to create a favorable environment for reform and development. On festive occasions, more than ever we think of our dear ones far away. As we celebrate the Spring Festival with jubilation, we think more than ever of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots and Overseas Chinese. Promoting reunification of the motherland in line with the concept of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems is the common aspiration of all Chinese people. In the past year, there was sustained development in economic cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and personnel exchanges and other kinds of exchanges increased gradually. We reached initial understanding in our talks on routine matters. We are happy about that and hope the Taiwan side will put national interest above everything else and work together with us to develope cross-strait relations and to promote peaceful reunification of the motherland. The dates are getting nearer for our country to resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao. Cooperation between China and Portugal on the Macao issue is progressing smoothly at present. We are satisfied with that. The British side is responsible for the termination of talks between the Chinese and British Governments. We hope the British Hong Kong Authority will not sink deeper and deeper into the wrong path. No matter what unexpected turn [bo zhe] things take, the Chinese Government and people have the determination and ability to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong according to schedule, and they are also fully confident of maintaining long-term stability and prosperity in Hong Kong. Comrades and friends, In the past year, the Chinese Government has unswervingly pursued an independent foreign policy of peace. We have made new achievements in foreign affairs work. Our country continued to expand friendly ties with other countries in the world, its international standing continued to rise gradually, and it played important roles in international affairs. We made friends all over the world. The Chinese Government and people, as always, will continue to join the governments and peoples of various countries in making unremitting efforts to strive for the establishment of a fair and reasonable new international political and economic order, to safeguard world peace, and to promote common development. Comrades and friends, We feel tremendously proud when we look back at the past, and we are full of confidence when we look to the future. We are faced with excellent opportunities for reform and opening up, and the prospects for socialist modernization are incomparably bright. Let us -- under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core -- unswervingly implement the party's basic line, strengthen the great unity among all nationalities in the whole country, be of one heart and one mind, wage hard struggle, and strive for new victories in socialist modernization!
