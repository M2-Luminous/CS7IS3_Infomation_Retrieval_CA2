FR940304-2-00164 FR940304-2-00086 [Release No. 34&hyph;33686; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;88&hyph;14] Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change Relating to Specialist Post Wires February 25, 1994. I. Introduction On April 25, 1988, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to permit a specialist unit, with Exchange approval, to use the telephone line at its trading post location to enter options or futures hedging orders through a member on the floor of an options or futures exchange. The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25694 (May 12, 1988), 53 FR 17812 (May 18, 1988). No comments were received on the proposal. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). II. Description of the Proposal The Exchange proposes to amend NYSE Rule 36.30 which currently permits a specialist unit, subject to Exchange approval, to maintain a telephone line at its trading post location on the Floor to enable the unit to communicate with its off-Floor office or clearing firm. In addition the Rule prohibits the use of such telephones for the purpose of transmitting to the NYSE Floor orders for the purchase or sale of securities, but permits the use of the telephones to enter options or futures hedging orders ( i.e., orders entered to offset the risk of making a market in the underlying speciality stock) through the specialist unit's off-Floor office or clearing firm. The proposed amendment will add language to the Rule to expand permitted usage of telephone lines at the specialist posts to include, with Exchange approval, the entry of a specialist unit's options or futures hedging orders ``through a member (on the floor) of an options or futures exchange.'' III. Discussion The adoption by the NYSE of subsection .30 to rule 36, along with other amendments to the rule, codified the Exchange's policy concerning members' use of telephones on the Floor that can be used to communicate with non-members located off-floor. 3 Such communication is permitted with certain specifically enumerated restrictions. 4 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25842 (June 23, 1988), 53 FR 24539 (June 29, 1988). Prior to the adoption of these amendments, rule 36 regulated the establishment of communication links only between a member or member organization's offices and the Exchange Floor. 4 These restrictions include a ban on portable phones on the Exchange floor. On August 19, 1988, a petition for review of the Commission's June 23 Order approving SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;87&hyph;18 was filed by William J. Higgens, a NYSE member, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Petitioner Higgens objected to the Second Circuit. Petitioner Higgens objected to the Commission's approval of that portion of the NYSE's proposal that prohibits members from using portable telephone son the Exchange floor. On January 20, 1989, the Court of Appeals issued a decision rejecting Higgins' objections and affirming the Commission's June 23 Order. See Higgins v. SEC, 866 F.2d 47 (2nd Cir.
