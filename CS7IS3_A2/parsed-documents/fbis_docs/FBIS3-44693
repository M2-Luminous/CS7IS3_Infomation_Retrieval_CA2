The spokesmen today issued a statement to lodge a serious protest [yan zhong kang yi 0917 6850 2123 6231] against the United States' unilateral move to cut import quota of textiles from China. The Sino-U.S. bilateral agreement on textile products expired on 31 December 1993. The two sides held three rounds of talks prior to the expiration date but could not reach an agreement. The spokesman said: When the two sides are about to hold the fourth round of talks, the U.S. side unilaterally declared sharp cuts in import quota of textiles from China. "This is a very irresponsible move. It has not only aroused strong reaction [qiang lie fan ying 1730 3525 0646 2019] in China but also generated extensive dissatisfaction [guang fan bu man 1639 3131 0008 3341] in the United States. It will seriously influence [yan zhong ying xiang 0917 6850 1758 0742] the economic and trade relations between China and the United States." He said: The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation solemnly [zheng zhong 6774 6850] declares that the Chinese side will continue the talks according to the original plan and solve the problem through negotiations. If the U.S. side clings obstinately to its course, China will be compelled [po 6612] to take appropriate retaliatory measures[bao fu cuo shi 1032 1788 2238 2457].
