FR940802-0-00021 FR940802-0-00008 Until EPA's Phase I volatility controls went into effect in 1989, gasoline volatility was essentially unregulated. EPA's volatility control program reversed the upward trend in gasoline volatility, and the resulting considerable increase in evaporative VOC emissions, by establishing limits on the volatility of summer gasoline. In promulgating the volatility control program, however, EPA granted a one pound per square inch (psi) volatility waiver for ethanol-containing blends. This waiver permitted continuation of splash blending of ethanol into gasoline without regulatory impediment, thereby avoiding what could have been a significant disruption to the existing market for fuel ethanol. For ethanol to continue to be blended in the absense of the waiver, refiners would have had to produce and market a special low volatility gasoline specifically for blending with ethanol. Since there was no assurance refiners would be willing to do so, the rule could have caused a dramatic decrease in the market share for ethanol blends that had developed under the existing Congressional and Administration programs. EPA believed it was important to avoid such a disruption to the ethanol industry, and as a result, granted a 1.0 psi volatility waiver. EPA believed that such a waiver would not significantly jeopardize the rule's air quality objectives for several reasons. First, even with the waiver the volatility of ethanol blends would be reduced considerably. In fact, the volatility of the ethanol blends would be reduced by the same amount (though not to the same level) as that of non-ethanol blends. Second, ethanol's market share was small, particularly in most ozone nonattainment areas, so the potential impact on ozone levels was thought to be small. At the then existing market share for ethanol, the waiver reduced by only about 3 percent the volatility control that otherwise would have been achieved by both phases of the volatility control program. Third, the rulemaking neither required the use of oxygenates such as ethanol in gasoline nor was it expected to increase their use. Were this not the case, the environmental impacts of the waiver could have been considerably greater. Congress later incorporated a similar volatility waiver in the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, when it established statutory limits on the volatility of conventional gasoline. As a result of the Federal and State initiatives and with the continued blending flexibility afforded by the volatility waiver, the market for ethanol grew from a fledgling industry in 1978 to a market which stabilized at approximately 0.8 billion gallons per year by 1990, an amount equivalent to slightly less than 1% of nationwide gasoline consumption. With the passage of the CAAA of 1990, the industry once again began to expand considerably. The oxygenated fuels program required by section 211(m) of the CAA requires that, during the winter months, all gasoline sold in certain cities with a history of exceedences of EPA's national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for carbon monoxide (CO) must contain oxygenates. Under this program (which began with the winter of 1992&hyph;93), ethanol has captured approximately 30% of the resulting oxygenate market. As a result, the demand for ethanol has grown by roughly 50% to an estimated 1.25 billion gallons in 1993. The oxygenate requirements of the reformulated gasoline program contained in section 211(k) of the CAA also provide the potential to expand considerably the market for ethanol and other renewable oxygenates. RFG is required in the nine cities with the nation's worst ozone pollution problem and has been adopted for many other ozone nonattainment areas as well as a key component in their efforts to improve air quality. The areas which will use RFG are estimated to represent 35% of all gasoline sold in the United States. The VOC emission performance standards for reformulated gasoline raised concerns in the ethanol industry that just as under the gasoline volatility control program, they will be unable to compete in the RFG market without a volatility waiver. However, section 211(k)(3) of the CAA establishes minimum emission performance standards that RFG must meet, with no allowance for a volatility waiver for ethanol-blended RFG. Furthermore, as discussed in the RFG final rule (59 FR 7716), providing such a waiver for ethanol-containing RFG would have jeopardized the emission benefits which Congress mandated the RFG program to achieve. For these reasons, the final regulations for reformulated gasoline do not contain such a volatility waiver for summer RFG. Thus, ethanol cannot be splash-blended into unmodifed gasoline blendstocks and still have the resulting blend comply with the RFG emission performance standards. Instead, either special reduced-volatility (``sub-RVP'') blendstocks would be necessary during the summer, or the ethanol would have to be converted into ETBE. Many in the ethanol industry have continued to express concern that refiners would not produce such blendstocks. If that were to occur, ethanol producers would lose access during the summer months to those current markets which will be covered by the RFG program. This loss of access, the ethanol industry contends, could also lead to a reduced market share in RFG areas in the winter months, even though no volatility restrictions apply during those months. EPA has received numerous letters from various members of Congress emphasizing their belief that the RFG program was intended to provide a significant new market for ethanol and other renewable oxygenates. EPA has also received numerous letters from members of Congress opposing a renewable oxygenate requirement. In general, they were not opposed to the use of renewable oxygenates, but rather to EPA requiring their use. As discussed in section III.A, there was also a considerable amount of discussion concerning this issue during the Congressional debate over the 1990 CAAA.
