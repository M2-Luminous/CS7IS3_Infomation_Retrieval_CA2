A. Aliyev told about the Confederation's activity to restore peace and accord in Russia's southern republics. Elaborating on problems of resolving the Ossetian-Ingush conflict, Aliyev stressed that to a very large extent it "has been provoked" by the Russian Federation law On Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples, which does not envision a mechanism for territorial rehabilitation, and also by the Russian Federation law On the Formation of the Ingush Republic, which does not designate its administrative boundaries.
