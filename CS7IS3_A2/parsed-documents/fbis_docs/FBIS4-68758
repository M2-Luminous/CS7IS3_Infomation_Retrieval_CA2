We wish to address one such problem and bring it to the attention of the government, ecologists, health workers and the citizenry. Almost two million Ukrainians ride the railways every day, representing some four percent of the population. The average trip is 110 km and takes about three hours. Later the passenger comes down with furunculoses, digestive disorders, headaches and even viral hepatitis, diphtheria, dysentery or some other infectious disease. Rarely are these conditions connected to the railroad trip, the most popular and easily accessible form of transportation for local and long-distance trips. The fact is, modern railroads are a serious health hazard. They are used for the transportation of vast quantities of solid and liquid substances that spill along the tracks and at railroad facilities and threaten every living thing. These substances include coal, petroleum products, acids, alkalis, poisons, mutagens and carcinogens. The most dangerous factors are infectious agents that contaminate passenger cars and are derived from human wastes that foul areas adjacent to the railroads. In addition to the colon bacillus, human fecal matter also contains hundreds of other infectious agents, among them viruses, rickettsia, streptococci, staphylococci, pneumococci, vibrios, bacilli, protozoan cysts, eggs of intestinal worms, fungi, and so on. Many of them survive outside the human body and pose a danger for days or weeks, and some even persist for months and years. In addition, unsanitary conditions in lavatories lead to the spread of other agents via expectorations and saliva responsible for tuberculosis, diphtheria, syphilis, typhus, and malaria. Soviet press informed us at the end of the 80s--in connection with the pre-perestroika and pre-glasnost amnesty of political prisoners-- that of the almost one million prisoners in jails and concentration camps 100,000 suffered from tuberculosis, half of them with open cavities. On his way home from a `re-educational' institution a single such returnee was in a position to infect three to five other passengers. In general, 25-50 passenger trains move along the major corridors in a day; on some days this figure approaches 80. The average trains consists of 15 cars with 50 passengers, or 750 passengers per train. If only one passenger uses a lavatory and flushes 100 grams of feces, then one kilometer of the track becomes covered with 5-10 kg of fecal matter every day, which is equivalent to 2- 3.5 tons a year. It would take a heroic effort to estimate the numbers of viruses, bacteria, protozoans and fungi that accumulate along the trains, are stirred up by the train movement, and then enter the compartments as aerosols via windows and doors to pollute the internal air and settle on all the surfaces. They are disseminated for distances that measure tens of meters away from the railroad tracks, contaminating plants, soil, ground and subsurface waters and infecting thousands of humans. In addition, the number of foreigners using our trains is on the increase. Many of them are from tropical countries and serve as carriers of disease agents to which we have no immunity and physicians lack experience in dealing with them. This matter is all the more serious since the general level of immunity in our population diminished two-fold during the last half century, particularly after the Chernobyl tragedy, rendering us more susceptible to communicable diseases. As a result, infections are becoming more severe than was common previously. Not only do the train passengers suffer, but so do their families and all who come in contact with their infected clothing, possessions, and food. Conductors, engineers, maintenance and service personnel are also exposed, and have a higher morbidity than the population at large. In fact, there are special tuberculosis sanatoria for railroad workers. Our bacteriologic studies at the Lviv railroad station on passenger trains and other sites were yielded devastating results and would have had a shocking effect if published in the popular press. Control of human waste is easy and inexpensive. Special removable containers can be attached to railroad lavatories and at the end of the trip emptied into methane tanks. The latter produce methane fuel as a result of fermentation, while the solid residue is transformed into high quality fertilizer. Biotechnological processing of human waste is ecologically sound, cost effective and socially beneficial as it protects public health. Finally, sanitation of the railroad cars also must be improved, including sterilization of air in lavatories with quartz lamps. Surely our lives and health are worth such efforts.
