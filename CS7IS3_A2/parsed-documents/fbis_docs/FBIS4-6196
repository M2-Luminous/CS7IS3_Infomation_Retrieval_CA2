Yi Song-ho, acting chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Red Cross Society, North Korea sent a telephone message to Kang Yong-hun, chairman of the ROK National Red Cross, on 19 April, pointing out that for the South side to reject the North side's demand to repatriate the two men, which has happened on two occasions, runs counter to the humanitarian ideology of the Red Cross. Today's message by North Korea is being interpreted as a countermeasure to the fact that the South side has started to show interest in the North Korean humanitarian issue, such as the South Korean Government's decision to allow North Korean loggers who escaped from logging camps in Russia to defect to South Korea.
