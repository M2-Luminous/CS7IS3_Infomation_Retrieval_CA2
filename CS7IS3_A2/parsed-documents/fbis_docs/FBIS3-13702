In their analyses today, AL-'IRAQ and AL-THAWRAH say that Washington is working on employing the economic embargo as a political framework to serve its imperialist goals in the region. AL-'IRAQ draws the world's attention to the dangers of the U.S. exploitation of world organizations. It says: The Security Council's failure to assert its independence and its submission to the desires of a policy that is unrelated to the international legitimacy or the UN Security Council's resolutions will turn the Council into a tool for mass murder against the Iraqi people. AL-IRAQ questions the usefulness of the Iraqi people's and leadership's continued adherence to and compliance with the resolutions of the Security Council, which does not respect its own obligations and resolutions. It urges the peace and freedom loving nations to stress the independence of their positions and adopt positive steps that would end the U.S. hegemony over the UN resolutions and the power to issue UN resolutions. AL-THAWRAH says fairness must dominate relations between Iraq and world organizations after the exacerbation of the state of injustice and unfairness that has afflicted Iraq as a result of the economic embargo imposed against it. The paper, mouthpiece of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, says: It has become clear that those who oppose the lifting of the embargo now have nothing to justify their opposition. If the logic of brute force, deception, and extortion is all they have to rely on, their position is now more exposed than ever before. The paper stresses that the U.S. Administration is losing much of its power and influence in the world by insisting on entrenching this despicable, hostile action, represented by the blockade. The paper urges the U.S. Administration to benefit from the lessons of the past three years with their major events. It stresses that these events have not been able to harm the substance of the Iraqi steadfastness despite the significant size of the scheme and despite what was offered by the agents and the regional traitors and mercenaries.
