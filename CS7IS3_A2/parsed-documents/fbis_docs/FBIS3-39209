Skaarup: "Police Intelligence Service Is `Top Secret' -- Even German Legislation Is Stamped `Confidential' at Meetings"] [Text] The Folketing and the PET [Police Intelligence Service] intend to lift a corner of the heavy veil of secrecy with plans for greater openness surrounding the intelligence service's work. When democracy has to defend itself against attack from its own citizens, it does so in a cloud of suspicion against the outside world that borders on pure hysteria. The means and methods are so secret that only a handful or so of people know them. Even the identities of the opponents, the 12,000 possible enemies of society, are confidential and only spoken of in general and opaque terms, faceless and nameless. A parliamentary committee in the Folketing recently received a pile of documents with descriptions of how politicians and public authorities in the countries that are our neighbors have tried to open up their intelligence services. The documents were collected by the PET for the use of the five members of the special control committee for the intelligence services. As an ingrained reaction, the PET stamped all the documents as confidential. The five committee members could not even reveal anything to the public of a bill that had previously been put before the German Bundestag. The German bill was generally available in its home country, but in Denmark it had to be kept secret. Cold War Rules of Play According to the most recent figures from the PET, the service employs some 350 full-time agents and office staff to keep an eye on Danish and foreign nationals. Additionally, there are approximately 50 loosely attached police personnel from each of the country's 54 policing districts and an unknown number of informers who either volunteer or are paid to supply the PET with information and observations. The bulk of the permanent staff is stationed in the headquarters at Bellahoej in Copenhagen, while smaller groups are stationed in the service's six regional offices. Their tasks are described in a booklet that was drawn up in 1953 during the Cold War's deep-freeze period by Hans Haekkerup, the then Social Democratic justice minister. The manual broadly describes whom the PET is to keep an eye on, what means may be used, and how the service is generally to conduct itself. The details of the job -- which anticonstitutional or political groups the service is to spy on -- are decided by the government and justice minister in office at any given time. The 41-year-old manual has never been given to -- let alone approved by -- the Folketing. Like the directives of the successive ministers for justice, it is strictly confidential. 200-Million-Kroner Cost If we ignore defense, then the PET is in every respect the one public institution subject to the least public control and access. The PET budget is concealed in the Folketing's general funding of the police, and nowhere can outsiders read exactly how much money are spending on the secret service. But, based on the number of employees, the size of the payroll alone can be estimated at 80-100 million kroner [DKr] annually, and with expenses for travel, equipment, offices, fees to informers, and so on, we approach a total expenditure of somewhere between DKr150 and 200 million. The only outsider who knows the correct figures is a specially appointed member of staff in the State Audit Department. Once a year, this person looks through the PET accounts and budget, then informs the chief public auditor, in a written account, that all is in order. The Folketing control committee is aware of the general budgetary position of the two intelligence services. SF [Socialist People's Party] member Jens Thoft has on a number of occasions asked to receive the actual budgets, but has never had a reply. Baroque Rituals The parliamentary control committee was established by law in 1988 on the basis of a bill presented by the SF, following the famous affair of the two Danish reserve officers who were arrested and charged with espionage while on a "tourist trip" in Poland. The government never admitted that the people in question were on a mission for the intelligence service, but the furor did result in the Folketing seeking greater control over the activities of the services -- in practice, however, only as regards the general guidelines. The committee's work is subject to a series of baroque rituals serving to deepen the cloud of mystery that always hovers over an intelligence service. All documents from the PET -- for example, answers to questions from the committee -- are sent by courier in a sealed envelope. The envelope is delivered to the committee secretary, who can only open it and check its contents in the presence of one of the committee members. All the committee papers are put in a safe purchased especially for the purpose and placed in a secure room in the Folketing. Only the secretary has the key and code to the door into the room, while only the committee members know the code to the safe. If a committee member wishes to read the papers sometime other than in a meeting, this may only be done under the supervision of the secretary. Two Folketing security guards are summoned before each of the six to seven meetings held each year. Under the supervision of the secretary and two committee members, they have to carry the safe's by now rather voluminous contents to the office of the department head in the Defense Ministry, where all the meetings take place. The dates of the meetings are secret. Shocking Information The oldest control body is the so-called Wamberg Committee, named after Chief Administrative Officer A.M. Wamberg, the first chairman of the committee, from Vejle. The committee was set up in 1964, after POLITISK REVY newspaper revealed that at that time 300,000-400,000 Danes were registered, suspected of being liable to practice subversion. It was the first time "civilians" got a glimpse of the state authorities' zealous monitoring of its subjects. "It did not surprise me so much to see who was registered, but it was shocking to see how much private information they had on people," a member from that era said. The four committee members then, as now, had to content themselves with checking that the PET registration of Danish citizens remained within the guidelines laid down by the justice minister and the government. At that time, in the early sixties, the guidelines were fairly all-embracing, and membership of the Danish Communist Party was more than enough to ensure that the PET found it worthwhile to make a registration. Only with a government circular in 1968 were the rules cut back so that registration could no longer be justified by political activities alone. The word "alone" is to be understood quite literally. If someone breaks the law for any reason -- for instance in an ordinary case of shoplifting -- that is grounds enough to also register what political party, if any, he is a member of. The number of those registered has fallen considerably since the lunacy of the 1950's, and today there are around 62,000 people listed in the PET files, including some 50,000 people in public positions who require a special security clearance. The remainder, some 12,000 Danes, are people whom the PET suspects of wanting to practice terrorism, use political violence, or spy for foreign powers. Modest Control The four members of the Wamberg Committee are chosen by the justice minister, and they represent the minister, not the general public, in relation to the PET. Each time PET wishes to register a Dane, add new information to the file of somebody already registered, or supply information to another authority, it has to seek the committee's approval. The committee meets seven or eight times a year, and on these occasions it is presented with a pile of at least 50 new and old names, sometimes even more. Occasionally the committee turns down the PET request, but this rarely happens. One committee member said of his job: "It is my view that all power corrupts. So there should be the greatest possible supervision of power. It is a good thing that a committee such as the Wamberg Committee exists, so the PET is not tempted to do anything wrong, or even unlawful." The committee also carries out random testing to check whether the PET may have slipped new information into the file without the its knowledge. At best, the four committee members get through somewhere between eight and 10 of the 12,000 cases in any one meeting. The sampling may be entirely random, but the committee is often inspired by articles from the daily press. "`What do we have on him, then?' we ask, and so the secretary fetches the case papers," Chief Administrative Officer Bodil Panild, the committee chairman from Soroe, remarked. The Wamberg Committee has no opportunity of checking the information and assessments on which the PET bases its request to make a registration. Neither does the committee have any influence on the political criteria for registration. Bodil Panild said the committee has to rely on PET's information and assessments, but that on the other hand she does not think PET would have anything to gain from misleading the committee. "I would not say that we identify ourselves with the PET. But our understanding of the reasons for registration is improving, and if you ask me whether I think an intelligence service such as the PET is necessary, my answer is a clear yes. There will always be extremists and groups that want to overthrow norms that are otherwise accepted by The Danish democracy," Bodil Panild said. The discretion with which PET works determines what slips out about the service's activities. Dull Job But several former bosses and justice ministers strongly maintain that the 300 or more staff do a good job. The PET job is to prevent and counteract attacks on state security, and the fact that the public hears nothing, and that not many PET cases come before the courts, is proof that the service is doing its job, or so the story goes. Cases brought to court could also be a sign that the job is not being done properly, and that the service is incapable of uncovering anything at all. Said with a smile and a shrug. The work of the PET has always been surrounded by great mystery and suspicion on the part of the outside world, but most of it is myth, due to too many bad spy films on TV and the service's own unwillingness to talk. Of course people are bugged, some 50 or so every day, and of course people are followed and letters opened, but by far the majority of the time is spent on dull and routine reading of open sources such as newspapers, periodicals, etc. In fact, PET work has a reputation for being so boring and lacking in challenge that the PET has difficulty in attracting good police officers. "If you cannot do anything else, then you can always be a police researcher at PET", is not an uncommon remark among the police. This article is based upon information from current and former employees of the PET, current and former members of the Wamberg Committee and the Folketing control committee.
