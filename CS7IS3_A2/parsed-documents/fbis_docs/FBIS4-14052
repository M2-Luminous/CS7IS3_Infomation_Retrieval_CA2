Only 90 of the 250 committee members attended the vote. Sources in Tzomet said that the fact that the constitution, which was supported by Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan, did not win a sweeping majority is a further indication that Eytan is losing his power in Tzomet. According to the new constitution, the chairman may appoint party functionaries, and his only obligation is to report the appointment to the party council and management. It was also decided that the chairman will be the party's candidate for prime minister and will be authorized to select and appoint candidates for the posts of minister and deputy minister, needing only to present the list to the Central Committee without asking for its authorization.
