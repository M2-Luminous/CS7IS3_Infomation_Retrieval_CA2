This was learned only today: The precise circumstances of their death are not yet known. Following on from these serious disturbances in Rwanda, and in particular in Kigali, people sometimes wonder about the role of the Belgian troops who have been there for several months as part of the UN peacekeeping forces, as soldiers of UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda]. But, like all UN troops, these Belgian soldiers have a very strict mandate from the United Nations. On television this lunchtime in the (Mise au Point), Foreign Minister Willy Claes stressed once again the extension of the mandate of the UN forces in Rwanda: [Begin Claes recording] I believe that we really were not wrong when we sent the troops. We were one of those promoting the peace process, and we have to back it up now. As far as I am concerned, I think the mandate was too restricted, and we need a thorough debate on the UN mandate, and therefore, on the implementation of this over restrictive mandate. Also, the weaponry was insufficient. [end recording]
