FR940112-1-00041 FR940112-1-00022 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Highway Administration 49 CFR Part 393 [FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;93&hyph;34] RIN 2125&hyph;AD25 Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation; Sleeper Berths on Motorcoaches AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM). SUMMARY: The FHWA requests public comment on the use and design of driver sleeper berths in the motorcoach industry. Existing sleeper berth regulations were written with commercial trucks and truck-tractors in mind. The agency seeks comments on the suitability of these regulations for motorcoaches and the possibility of amending them to account for design differences between trucks and motorcoaches. This action is being taken in response to comments received at the motorcoach industry Zero-Base Review hearing held in Miami, Florida, on January 20, 1993, and written requests from the motorcoach industry. DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: All signed, written comments should refer to the docket number that appears at the top of this document and must be submitted to HCC&hyph;10, room 4232, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington DC 20590. All comments received will be available for examination at the above address from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except legal Federal holidays. Those desiring notification of receipt of comments must include a self-addressed stamped postcard or envelope. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Bryan L. Price, Office of Motor Carrier Standards, (202) 366&hyph;5720, or Mr. Charles Medalen, Office of the Chief counsel, (202) 366&hyph;1354, Federal Highway Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except legal Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 20, 1993, the FHWA held a public hearing in Miami, FL, as part of our Zero-Base Review of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) to obtain information, views, and opinions from representatives of the motorcoach industry (see 57 FR 60784). Four out of ten industry representatives who testified at the hearing voiced concerns about the suitability of existing sleeper berth regulations for motorcoaches. A common theme among those who testified on this subject was that the current sleeper berth regulations were written specifically for trucks and truck-tractors without considering the unique design characteristics of motorcoaches. A complete transcript of this hearing is on file and available for review in the FHWA docket room under FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;92&hyph;33&hyph;182. Both the American Bus Association and the United Bus Owners of America have also indicated to the FHWA that the suitability of existing sleeper berth regulations for motorcoaches is a concern of their members. The FHWA has also received written requests from the motorcoach industry to revise the current sleeper berth regulations to account for design differences between motorcoaches and trucks. (Copies of these letters are included in FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;93&hyph;34.) In response to these concerns and as part of the FHWA's efforts to eliminate unnecessarily design-restrictive regulations, a review of the rulemaking history of the current sleeper berth requirements was completed. The review indicated that sleeper berths on motorcoaches may not have been considered when the existing sleeper berth regulations were promulgated. In a final rule published on May 15, 1952 (17 FR 4422), the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) revised most of the existing Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) and created a number of new regulations. One new regulation set forth detailed specifications for sleeper berths. The rule required that every sleeper berth installed in or on a truck or truck-tractor after December 31, 1952, be located within or immediately adjacent to the cab, or within the cargo space of a truck, and be provided with a direct and ready means of exit into the driver's compartment (17 FR 4443). These requirements are now codified at 49 CFR 393.76(b)(2) and 393.76(c)(1), respectively. In addition, the regulations also required that any sleeper berth which could not meet this standard, in essence those installed on trucks or truck-tractors before December 31, 1952, be provided with means of communication between the occupant of the berth and the driver. The berth also had to be designed, constructed, and maintained to provide the occupant, without the assistance of other persons, at least two means of ready exit from the motor vehicle. These requirements are now codified at 49 CFR 393.76(d) and 393.76(c)(2)(ii), respectively. Because motorcoach operators rarely used sleeper berths forty years ago, the ICC drafted a rule for trucks and truck-tractors. Practices in the motorcoach industry have changed, however, and some operators would like to use sleeper berths to reduce driver fatigue and to help comply with driver's hours of service regulations. The 1952 regulations did not address sleeper berths on motorcoaches, nor have any subsequent rulemakings done so. On July 3, 1970, the FHWA published a final rule relating to seat belts and restraint of sleeper berth occupants (35 FR 10859). That rule differentiated between trucks and buses with regard to seats, seat belt assemblies, and seat belt assembly anchorage requirements, but not with regard to sleeper berth restraint requirements.
