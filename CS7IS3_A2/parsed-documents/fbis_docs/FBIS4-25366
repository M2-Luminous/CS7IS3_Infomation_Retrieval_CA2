Chien left Mexico Wednesday. Chien made the remarks when answering questions by reporters at a farewell party for the Information & Cultural Affairs Director Ouyang Jui-hsiung, who will take over the post of director-general at the Coordination Council for North American Affairs (CCNAA) office in Los Angeles. The CCNAA represents the Republic of China [ROC]'s interests in the United States in the absence of formal ties between the two countries. Chien said he did not make public Lien's visit to Mexico beforehand because of an agreement between the two governments that neither side could release the news before Lien arrived in Mexico. Chien said the reason he refused to comment on the possibility of a Salinas-Lien meet before Lien departed on his May 29-June 9 Central American tour was because the meeting had never been scheduled. Lien did meet with other ranking Mexican officials and Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the ruling party's candidate in the next presidential election. Lien, currently in New York for a two-day family reunion with his two children, who study there, will return to Taipei Saturday, as scheduled, and hold a press conference, Chien said.
