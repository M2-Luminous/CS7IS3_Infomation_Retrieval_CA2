SZDSZ leader Gabor Kuncze and Istvan Szentivanyi, deputy chairman of the Foreign Relations Commission of Hungary's parliament and a member of SZDSZ, answered the questions asked by the journalists. Our correspondent Letitia Militaru inquired about the SZDSZ's chances in the 8 May elections. [Begin recording] [Militaru, in Romanian with simultaneous Hungarian translation] What are SZDSZ's chances in the 8 May elections? [Kuncze, in Hungarian with simultaneous Romanian translation] Naturally I cannot discuss this issue in an unbiased way, but I think our chances are very good. According to public opinion polls, the SZDSZ is the second-strongest party and its popularity is growing continuously. If we add up the two liberal-oriented parties in Hungary, the liberal bloc could have a great weight. [Militaru] How does your party view the Romanian-Hungarian relations? [Kuncze] In the eyes of SZDSZ, Hungarian-Romanian ties have a strategic importance. It is a strategic one owing to the fact that we are neighbors, owing to the Hungarian ethnic minority living here, and owing to our economic interests. The efficiency of Hungarian diplomacy could be measured by the way in which it will manage to achieve progress in this issue. [Militaru] What does the Hungarian ethnic minority living in Romania mean to the SZDSZ? [Kuncze] I think it is important to state that we cannot restrict our bilateral relations merely to our ties with that minority, which should be just a part of our bilateral relations. Culturally speaking, the Hungarian ethnic minority belongs to the Hungarian nation. Hungary's Constitution stipulates that every Hungarian government has to consider itself responsible for the Hungarians living outside the country's borders and to protect their interests. As far as I know, Romania's Constitution, in Paragraph 2 of its Article 7, contains similar stipulations.
