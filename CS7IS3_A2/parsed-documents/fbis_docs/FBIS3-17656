They do not go against our independence. At the same time, we have the strategic interest of being together with Russia and cooperating with it in the military sphere. This does not contradict the interests of third countries," Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov told the Military Council, speaking about the military doctrine. To quote Niyazov, Turkmenistan's military doctrine is of purely defense nature. Giving preference to legal, economic and other non-military means of settling conflicts, Turkmenia will adhere to the principle of "positive neutrality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other states." According to the doctrine, Turkmenia will not treat any state as a potential enemy. Nor will it join any military bloc, or keep foreign troops on its territory. (However, after his speech, Niyazov welcomed Russian specialists' participation in the development of the Turkmen armed forces -- INTERFAX). Turkmenistan will be a nuclear-free state and will not equip its troops with weapons of mass destruction. The main sources of danger threatening Turkmenistan are local conflicts, the threat of using weapons of mass destruction, attacks on Turkmenistan's facilities, border conflicts, military buildup in the neighboring countries' border regions and international terrorism. Priority is given to the broadening of military cooperation with the neighboring states, above all Russia. According to the doctrine, an army grouping is to be created in Turkmenistan and a mixed procedure of shaping the armed forces (contracts and drafting) is to be introduced. The Turkmen armed forces are to be reorganized by 1999. Priority importance will be attached to the air-defense units, and to "rapid forces capable of fast re-dislocation. Niyazov said that the Turkmen armed forces' strength would be within the limits of reasonable sufficiency -- 37,000 men. The current armed forces will therefore be cut down by 2000 men. The program for reorganizing the defense ministry, announced on 1 January, provides for establishing a defense and security council led by the president. The Council will also consist of Vice Premier Boris Shikhmuradov (deputy head of the Council), the heads of the local administrations, the leaders of the power ministries and the ministers of justice and foreign affairs. The Council will analyze the situation in the Republic and provide recommendations. The president also proposed setting up a general staff (375 members), a staff for the armaments and the rear (225 members, and the command of the air force, air defense and land troops. Niyazov welcomed cooperation with the Rosvooruzheniya (Russian arms industry) corporation and announced that a center for repairing helicopters and factories for the production of military clothes and footwear would be built. He said that in exchange for supplies, the Rosvooruzheniya will receive 6 Bn cubic meters of gas.
