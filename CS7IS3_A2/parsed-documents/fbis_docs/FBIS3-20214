Following his afternoon meeting with Denktas, Feissel said the situation has not changed since last week and the United Nations did not receive the answer it wanted. He added that now is the time to prepare the report to the UN secretary general, who will make his own observations. The UN secretary general's report to the Security Council on the progress of efforts to implement the confidence-building measures [CBM's] is expected to be submitted by the end of the month. Answering a question on the topic, Feissel said he had personally asked for the meeting with Denktas and that no new meeting has been set. Asked whether there is a deadlock, Feissel said never and nothing is ever final but he added that it is relatively clear that the UN goal has not been achieved now. He said that he would brief President Glavkos Kliridhis on the outcome of the meeting but first he would inform the UN secretary general about the situation and what has happened in the past few weeks.
