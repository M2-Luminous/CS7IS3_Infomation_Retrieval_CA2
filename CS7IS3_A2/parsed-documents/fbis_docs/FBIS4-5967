As for the month of December 1993, a trade surplus of RM388.6 million was recorded from deficits of RM850.2 million and RM479.6 million in October and November 1993 respectively. The December surplus was, however, 50.5 percent off the RM785.4 million surplus recorded in December 1992, the Department of Statistics said. The continued higher surplus in 1993 was attributed mainly to buoyant growth in exports which expanded 16.9 percent to RM121.2 billion compared with imports which expanded 15.8 percent to RM117.4 billion. The main export increases were manufactured goods (up 32.7 percent), machinery and transport equipment (up 29.6 percent), and miscellaneous manufactured articles (up 9.7 percent). The growth in imports was mainly contributed by machinery and transport equipment imports which expanded 18.4 percent and manufactured goods (up 10.7 percent). Machinery and transport equipment and manufactured goods accounted for 70.7 percent of total imports in 1993. The department said earnings from major primary commodities showed a mixed performance against strong growth for exports of manufactured products. Commodities which recorded higher export revenues were thermionic valves and tubes, photocells, and others which rose 30.4 percent, while crude petroleum exports dropped 12.1 percent.
