After a very turbulent morning, the chairman of the Socialist Eurodeputies called a press conference in mid-afternoon to reaffirm his position, without yielding an inch. He confirmed, first, that it was he personally who initiated the paragraph in the resolution voted on by the PSE [European Socialist Party], which so offended some people in Italy. [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you not think that the initiative constitutes interference in Italy's internal affairs? [Cot] No interference. It is a document addressed to the Community's heads of state and government. We addressed them to emphasize a problem that exists and that is not without importance. The possible future presence of Italian fascist ministers in the EC Council would be unacceptable to us. We could not engage in dialogue with fascist ministers. And if there were any fascist members of the European Commission we would deny our approval of that Commission. Let us consider another country; let us suppose an Italian-type situation were to occur in France. Well, I would be very glad if my country received from Europe a precise and strong reminder of the sacrosanct nature of the principles of antifascism. [LA REPUBBLICA] But do you not think that it could be considered antidemocratic to criticise the Italian electorate's free vote? [Cot] The Italians may vote however they want; but they cannot demand that we engage in dialogue with fascist ministers. [LA REPUBBLICA] Have we in some sense reached a new form of limited sovereignty? [Cot] No. We are freely joined by an agreement. If someone violates the fundamental principles that underlie that agreement, then the union is violated. Our Europe was born from the defeat of fascism and Nazism. If someone who identifies with fascism enters a government, we consider the original agreement to have been violated. [LA REPUBBLICA] But who are the fascists? How are we to define a fascist today? In Italy there will be ministers chosen by the leaders of the party that won a normal election. Where does fascism come into it? In what way have the democratic rules been violated? [Cot] Our issue has to do not with legality but with legitimization. Hitler too acceded to power legally and was not challenged because there were no legal bases for doing so. I thought that everyone had learned that lesson. [LA REPUBBLICA] But Mr. Cot, who is Italy's Hitler? [Cot] I am not saying that there is a Hitler, but am pointing out that in the coalition that is about to come to government in Italy, one of the allies identifies with fascist principles. Mr. Fini describes Mussolini as a great statesman, he does not disown fascism and its principles. If Fini rejects the principles of fascism, if he considers Mussolini an expression of antidemocratic principles, let him say so clearly. I will be pleased to hear it. [LA REPUBBLICA] After the intense reaction in Italy, would you submit the same motion again today? [Cot] I know that some people are surprised by the tone of that paragraph and by its content. I am surprised by their surprise. I have no problem in engaging in dialogue with conservatives. But fascists are another matter. A fascist minister or a fascist commissioner speaks on my behalf, too; he represents me too when he travels around the world, and I really cannot accept that. Here we have Le Pen, and there are Italian fascist deputies, and we tolerate them. But fascist ministers are another matter.
