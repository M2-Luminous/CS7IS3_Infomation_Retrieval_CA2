Eighteen out of 28 deputies voted for him. Rossel was dismissed from his post as governor by an edict of the Russian president in November 1993 for overstepping the limits of his powers in connection with the proclaiming of the Urals Republic. Rossel considers switching over to a regional policy in the real sense the main priority of his work as the Duma chairman. This means the oblast being able to decide independently what to do with its material and financial resources and being the owner of its natural resources.
