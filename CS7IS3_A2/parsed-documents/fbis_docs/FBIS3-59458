The situation has not been more serious since the beginning of the aggression, and it is threatening to turn into a veritable catastrophe. We need to inform the international public and all the responsible factors in the international community about the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We call for the international factors' engagement in order to at least alleviate the consequences of the policy conducted by the international community regarding the organization and delivery of humanitarian aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the 20 January meeting in Geneva, convened by the European Union, it was agreed that the international community would use force if needed to secure the delivery of humanitarian aid to all parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This conclusion was preceded by the talks that we held in Geneva on 18 November with Mrs. Ogata, and on 29 November 1993, a joint declaration regarding the free passage of humanitarian convoys was signed by military commanders. This declaration was based on an earlier agreement reached with Mrs. Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR]. Unfortunately, from that time until today, nothing has been done to implement the European Union's decision, although it had the support of all the other relevant international factors worldwide, including the United States and Russia. Unfortunately, for certain countries, this decision was just a pretext for lifting sanctions from Serbia and these countries invested all their efforts in this direction. The humanitarian situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina became steadily more difficult. Convoys with humanitarian aid are experiencing increasing difficulties in reaching certain parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This situation began as far back as mid-October, with the UN Secretary General's decision to suspend the delivery of humanitarian aid to central Bosnia for a full month. To this very day, we have not been able to recover from this break. At the same time, this foreshadowed the grave humanitarian situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The international public was [word indistinct], worried, they spoke about the imminent winter, the catastrophe, however, nothing concrete was done to prevent the present situation, which must be qualified as dramatic. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Government assesses that the reasons for such a dramatic situation primarily lie in the systematic and constant pressure applied to the sovereign, independent, and internationally recognized state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its legitimate and legitimately elected authorities. The pressure consists of making the legitimate authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina accept the aggressors' ultimatum, and legalize genocide and aggression in its own country. The international community has not consistently implemented Chapter 7 of the UN Charter on the collective use of force against an aggressor. It has not allowed the legal and legitimate authorities to arm their people for the defense against the aggression. That right, as we know, has been envisaged by UN Charter Article 51. The Security Council, let us remember, adopted over 30 resolutions on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The only resolution it has implemented so far is Resolution 713 that imposes an embargo on the import of arms on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, which only affects, as we know, Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have been pointing out for some time that the system and organization of the UNHCR in Bosnia-Herzegovina is illogical. The UNHCR does not have its headquarters in Sarajevo but in Zagreb, therefore in a country that is deeply involved in the conflict with Bosnia-Herzegovina. The organization of the logistic centers of the UNHCR does not conform with the state organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the system of information exchange between the government and the UNHCR is inadequate, so we have grave difficulties in obtaining reliable information. We are particularly concerned about the structure of the humanitarian aid delivered, which does not suit the needs of the population. Most of the humanitarian aid consists of flour. However, the population lacks a significant amount of foodstuffs that it must have after 22 months of starvation -- considerable amounts of sugar, fats, meat products, vitamins, clothes, and so on. As for the quantity of humanitarian aid -- [Refugees and Social Welfare] Minister Smajkic will later give some more detailed information on that -- I would only like to mention one fact: A person on the territory under the control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government, that is, the legal authorities of Bosnia-Herzegovina, received 2.89 kilos of food in December. I repeat, on the territory under the control of the legal authorities of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a person received 2.89, that is, under three, kilos of food in December. A person on the territory under the control of the Serb aggressor received 4.31 kilos of food, while a person on the territory controlled by the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] received 9.61 kilos of food. These are facts. Minister, you have to confirm this. What is the source of this information? [Unidentified voice: UNHCR]. So these are reports from the UNHCR. On the other hand, over the last few months -- according to the UNHCR reports -- convoys have been organized every day for parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the Serb aggression, or for western Herzegovina. The explanation for this is that these are territories where there are no military operations. So, in places where there are military operations the population is punished in two ways -- they have the military operations, and they do not get humanitarian aid. The humanitarian aid is distributed to the entire population in parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina that are occupied, regardless of whether they are refugees or not. That is the case in Bijeljina and Banja Luka, even though there has not been a single day of fighting in either of the cities, and the population can, under the circumstances, organize its own production of food. In the context of the pressure that is being exerted on the legal authorities of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the international community has recently been exerting pressure by the mere mention of withdrawing the UN forces from Bosnia-Herzegovina. Everyone here has heard of the case of Tuzla airport. Futile discussions have been held about that for months. The airport in Tuzla is not being opened because the aggressor does not give his approval. Therefore, the opening of the airport in Tuzla, the opening of the corridors for humanitarian convoys, the delivery of humanitarian aid in general, all this depends on the aggressor's good will, and that has been the case for 22 months now. That is the basic problem that we have with the international community. The international community is not prepared -- as they agreed in Geneva -- to use force against everyone who obstructs humanitarian convoys. Before ending, I would like to stress some positive things. Where mostly needed, airdrops of certain amounts of food, the necessary amounts of food, have been reaching the people of Maglaj, Tesanj, Mostar, and elsewhere. That is an operation carried out by the United States, Germany, and France. This is a commendable move, but we cannot rely on airdrops, as these are small quantities and the operations are too expensive and cannot last long. So the question arises of land convoys. If there are no land convoys, if we do not get the understanding of the neighboring countries, particularly those where there are large quantities of humanitarian aid, if these convoys do not head off for Bosnia-Herzegovina and if their passage is not secured by the UN forces, then the international community can expect a humanitarian catastrophe in Bosnia-Herzegovina very soon.
