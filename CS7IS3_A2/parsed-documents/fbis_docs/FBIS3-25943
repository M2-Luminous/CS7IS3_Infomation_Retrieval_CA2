In his speech, Cheng Weigao set forth: The current economic and political situation of Hebei Province is comparatively good. However, this does not mean that there aren't any problems or difficulties. We know that many unstable factors and prominent security problems persist regarding political and social stability. Thus, we must strengthen our sense of adversity in this state of contentment. That is, we should ensure that we keep an eye out for danger when we are content, subjugation when we have stability, and disorder when we have good order. He stressed: [Begin Cheng Weigao recording] Reform is the motivation, development is the purpose, and stability is the guarantee. Without the deepening of reform, there will be no foundation for development and stability in the situation and it will be impossible for social stability to last for very long. However, without a stable social environment, there will be no success in reform, it will be impossible to make development, and nothing will be accomplished. [end recording] Cheng Weigao urged: Party committees at various levels should go all out to grasp the work of safeguarding stability just as they do to grasp economic construction. We should strengthen the forecast before the issuance of reform measures; actively strengthen propaganda, education, and persuasion; adopt appropriate measures in a timely manner; and solve problems at their bud and at the grass roots-level in a timely manner. We should constantly grasp the initiative in safeguarding political and social stability and create a good social environment to ensure smooth progress in reform, opening up, and economic construction. Cheng Weigao pointed out that this year, we should focus the judicial, procuratorial, and court work on dissolving a lot of contradictions between the people at the very grass roots, positively and deeply wage the struggle against economic crimes with the focus on corruption and bribery, and sternly dealing blows to serious criminal offenders. He said: [Begin recording] The party committees and governments at various levels should have the certificates of responsibility, strictly implement the system of responsibility for guaranteeing the peace of the designated area, actually form a situation of making concerted efforts to comprehensively improve social order, and implement the measures for safeguarding stability among relevant departments and grass-roots units. The leaders at various levels should pay attention to listening to the opinions and voices of the masses, be concerned with their woes, help them eliminate worries and difficulties, try all possible means to solve the problems that the masses [words indistinct], and do more good and real deeds for narrowing the relationship between the party and the masses. [end recording] In regard to the issue of strengthening the leadership over the judicial, procuratorial, and court work, Cheng Weigao said: The party and government leaders at various levels should regard the judicial, procuratorial, and court work as an extremely important work of the party committees and governments and put it in a prominent position. We should further support the departments of political science and laws to strictly enforce laws. We must neither replace the laws by words nor use power to prevail over laws. The nation will be powerful when its judicial, procuratorial, and court work has been strengthened. The nation will become weak when its judicial, procuratorial, and court work has been weakened. The commissions for political science and laws should realistically assume responsibility, make efforts to be advisers and assistants to party committees, and make fruitful achievements to embody their important positions and functions.
