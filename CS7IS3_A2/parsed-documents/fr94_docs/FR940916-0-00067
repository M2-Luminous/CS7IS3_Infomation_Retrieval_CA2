FR940916-0-00067 FR940916-0-00018 One commenter proposes to add the words ``*␣*␣* for use by ground personnel *␣*␣*'' between the words ``provided'' and ``which'' in §§27.1305(u) and 29.1305(a)(25). The FAA agrees, and the change has been made. Another commenter states that because of the number of warnings being introduced by §29.1305(a)(24), some guidance material is needed. The FAA agrees and will address these concerns with forthcoming advisory material. A third commenter suggests adding the word ``automatically'' before the word ``records'' in §29.1305(a)(25)(i). The FAA agrees, and the amendments are adopted with the changes. Sections 27.1521 and 29.1521␣Powerplant Limitations The notice proposed to add paragraphs (j) and (k) to §27.1521 and paragraphs (i) and (j) to §29.1521 to include the 30-second/2-minute OEI power limitations, along with rotorcraft applicability and the conditions for their use. One commenter supports this proposal if the amendments to Parts 1 and 33 ensure mandatory maintenance of the engine following use of the 30-second OEI power rating. In addition, the commenter further states that the transmission and gearbox should not be subject to mandatory maintenance. The testing requirements proposed in §§27.923 and 29.923 for the 30-second/2-minute OEI power ratings will minimize the need for mandatory maintenance of the transmission and gearbox following application of the 30-second/2-minute OEI power in service. The amendments, which concern the airframe requirements, are adopted without change. Sections 27.1549 and 29.1549␣Powerplant Instruments The notice proposed to revise §§27.1549(e) and 29.1549(e) by defining the instrument markings associated with the 30-second/2-minute OEI power ratings. One commenter supports the proposal and suggests that some guidance material is needed. The FAA agrees, and guidance material will be developed. These amendments are adopted as proposed. Section 29.67␣Climb: One Engine Inoperative The notice proposed to revise paragraph (a)(1)(i) to specify that for rotorcraft certificated for the 30-second/2-minute OEI power, only 2-minute OEI power may be used to comply with the 100-foot-per-minute rate of climb required by this section. One commenter supports the proposal. Another comment concerns paragraphs (a)(2) and (b), which are not changed by this rulemaking. It is noted that OEI climb performance required by the current rules can be determined by using either 30-minute or continuous OEI power. There are no restrictions on which long duration OEI power rating may be used with the short duration 30-second/2-minute OEI power ratings. OEI climb performance will be based upon the highest long duration OEI power for which certification is requested. The amendment is adopted without change. Additional Discussion Training Although outside the scope of this rulemaking, the FAA has recognized the need for additional training for flight crewmembers in the correct procedures and use of these new OEI power ratings. A commenter notes that the use of these new ratings could result in serious damage to the operating engine and that additional training must be available to satisfy the operational and airworthiness needs. The FAA agrees, and these training procedures will be considered by operations specialists during the certification process.
