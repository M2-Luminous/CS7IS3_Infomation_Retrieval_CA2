Sensitive Security Information; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 233␣/␣Tuesday, December 6, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Parts 107, 108, 109, 129, 191 [Docket No. 27965; Notice No. 94&hyph;32] RIN 2120&hyph;AF49 Sensitive Security Information AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to strengthen the rules protecting information from release to unauthorized persons. The current rules fail to: Require individuals to protect security sensitive information that is in their control; and specify all sensitive security information that should be protected from public disclosure. This proposed rule would specify all sensitive security information that must be protected and would require air carriers, airport operators, indirect air carriers, foreign air carriers, and individuals to be responsible for protecting it from disclosure to unauthorized persons. DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 6, 1995.
