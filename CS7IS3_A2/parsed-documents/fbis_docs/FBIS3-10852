This confirmation was made yesterday by President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, during an approximately 20-minute meeting with Gaviria at the Carreras Hotel in Santiago. It has also been learned that the U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, Alexander Watson, asked Paraguay to vote for Gaviria, whose efforts in the struggle against drug trafficking and the Colombian mafia have satisfied Washington. "We confirmed our support for him," said Wasmosy after the meeting with Gaviria, even though the previous administration of General Andres Rodriguez had promised its support to Costa Rican Foreign Minister Paul Niheaus, who is also here in Santiago holding meetings seeking support. NOTICIAS talked with Gaviria on his desire to become OAS secretary general. Gaviria said he hopes the result of the final elections in the OAS will serve to strengthen that inter-American organization. He said: "I have great confidence in their maturity, in how the countries value my representation and what I can do as leader of OAS." Asked about the pressure the United States is reportedly exerting in favor of his candidacy, he said: "I believe the United States is simply expressing the opinion it has always held on the qualifications I may have for holding that position. That or any other country of the Americas has the right to express an opinion publicly."
