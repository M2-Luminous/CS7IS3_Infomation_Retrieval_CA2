Hence, my main wish to all of us is that in 1994 the mechanism should begin working in full and we should begin to overcome a political, economic, and spiritual crisis that all of us are going through. The most important thing -- my sincere wish is that finally, there should be a reconciliation at places where blood is being shed and civil war is under way. I am saying this with pain in my heart. My sincere wish is that people should return to a peaceful life. One more thing, I would particularly like to wish to the citizens of Russia that 1994 should be a year of peace, stability, and progress. It is the destiny of world history that without great Russia there can be no harmony, peace, or stability not only on the Eurasian continent, but in the whole world. I would like to address all of us, CIS countries citizens, as my compatriots since we all come from a single Fatherland. Compatriots: I would like to wish you peace, well-being, solidarity, and fraternity in 1994. Happy New Year!
