Having relatively low displacement, it had no equals in foreign fleets of those times in terms of the effectiveness of searching for and fighting submarines. Following publication of the article "Cruiser Carriers" (see MORSKOY SBORNIK, No 7, 1991) by Captain 1st Rank V. Kuzin, which contains brief information on these cruiser helicopter carriers, the editor's office received many letters requesting more details on them. Therefore, we offer the reader the recollections of a participant of its planning, Arkadiy Borisovich Morin, who at that time was the chief of the planning division of the TsKB-17 [Central Design Office No 17]--the principal executor of efforts to create our first cruiser helicopter carriers (presently the Nevskoye Planning and Design Office). The scientific and technical revolution that began soon after World War II had a great influence on development of naval equipment. It universally brought on fundamental changes in views on the role of naval fleets in the new conditions. The United States of America, which was the undisputed leader among sea powers at that time (and even now), was the first to reexamine the priorities of its navy's missions. It was then that use of the world ocean as a "launch pad" for ballistic missiles carrying nuclear warheads, launched from nuclear-powered submarines (SSBNs) and targeted chiefly on the most important objectives in the USSR as its main enemy, assumed first priority. At approximately the same time, the Soviet Union decided to create a nuclear missile ocean-going navy capable of carrying out the entire complex of missions at sea to defend the interests of the state and counter possible aggression against it from the seas and oceans. One of the necessary components of a balanced navy was recognized to be presence of effective antisubmarine warfare (ASW) forces within its composition, including nuclear-powered and diesel torpedo submarines, shore-based and ship-borne ASW aviation, and surface ships of various classes equipped with submarine search and destroy resources. Creation of surface ASW forces began with modernization and improvement of the armament of destroyers and patrol escorts in the navy at that time, and refitting of some first-generation missile ships into ASW ships. Then began planning and construction of specialized ASW ships. However, the advent of American SSBNs carrying Polaris-A1 missiles (with a range of up to 2,200 km) raised the issue creating ASW ships for our navy that could operate in the outer ASW zone and would satisfy high requirements on armament, navigability, range and endurance. In its search for an optimum direction of solving this problem (optimum according to the criteria of combat and economic effectiveness), the TsNIIVK [Central Scientific Research Institute of Military Shipbuilding] (presently the Central Scientific Research Institute No 1 of the RF Ministry of Defense) conducted comprehensive research jointly with other naval and air force institutes as well as the TsNII-45 [Central Scientific Research Institute No 45] and the TsKB-17 of the USSR State Committee for Ship Building (GKS), later transformed into the Ministry of Ship Building Industry. Their results persuasively demonstrated that successful combat with nuclear-powered submarines, chiefly SSBNs, required wider use of ship-based aviation. A continuous search for submarines over vast and remote regions over the course of several days and integrated operations against detected submarines jointly with other naval forces had to be provided for. Basing itself on the results of this research, the TsKB-17 wrote up, and submitted in 1958, technical proposals on designing two classes of helicopter carriers--small (based on a special design) and large (based on mothballed hulls of unfinished project 68-bis artillery cruisers awaiting "resolution of their fate"). Defense Minister R. Malinovskiy gave his support to both variants, and they received approval in the government. The project requirements, which were approved by naval commander-in-chief S. Gorshkov on 31 January 1959, defined the purpose of such a ship: "Seeking and destroying the enemy's SSBNs and multipurpose submarines in the outer ASW zones within the composition of a ship hunter-killer group and in coordination with other naval ships and ASW airplanes." The objective was to "provide for continuous 24-hour searching for submarines by not less than two helicopters during the ship's entire cruising time." On the basis of the project requirements and with regard for results of rough plans drawn up on their basis, with the participation of a number of naval and air force institutes, the TsNIIVK prepared the draft preliminary specifications for the design of a ship with minimum displacement carrying eight helicopters. (This corresponded to views of higher organizations upon which creation of the new ships depended). Concurrently, the TsKB-17 established the need for designing a ship of greater effectiveness and ability to resist the enemy. Considering the real limits placed on use of helicopters in strong winds, the office proposed reinforcing the ship's submarine detection and strike resources by including in the preliminary specifications a long-range sonar system, an antisubmarine missile system, torpedoes and mortars, and air defense resources. Supporting the TsKB-17 the TsNII-45 raised the question as to the suitability of increasing the number of helicopters aboard. The navy and the GKS also insisted on basing 10-14 helicopters aboard the ship. After the initial studies were carried out to determine the principal ship building elements more specifically, and after the specifications were coordinated with the GKS, on 25 January 1960 the naval commander-in-chief approved the preliminary specifications for the design of the ship, which was code-named project 1123. However, when he forwarded the assignment to the TsNIIVK, G. Kozmin, chief of the navy's Main Ship Building Directorate, emphasized: "Considering that attention is being turned at many levels of government to the standard displacement of a ship, the work of the TsKB-17 and supervision by the navy should be oriented on arriving at a more sensible solution to all design problems and implementing all measures to reduce the displacement (7,000-8,000 tonnes) indicated in the preliminary specifications." For the same purposes, the GKS received conceptual designs submitted on a competitive basis by both the TsKB-17 and the TsKB-53. A. Savichev (1904-1983), who formerly led the designing of project 68K and 68-bis artillery cruisers, was appointed chief designer of the ship at the TsKB-17. V. Fedin became the chief observer from the TsNIIVK. A. Fisher, who was the chief designer of the project 30-bis and 56 destroyers, was put in charge of the conceptual design at the TsKB-53. The project was carried out at the TsKB-17 in close cooperation with the OKB-938 [Special Design Office No 938] of the State Committee for Aviation Equipment (GKAT), headed by N. Kamov (who designed the Ka-25 helicopter), and specialists of the air force's Scientific Research Institute No 15 supervised development of the ship resources of the ASW helicopter system. The office submitted eight variants of the ship offering different propulsion units and different armament packages, to include in a catamaran scheme. During the search for new technical concepts, and particularly to reduce displacement, a variant with an aluminum-magnesium alloy hull was additionally developed on the initiative of the chief hull designer A. Marinich (1909-1989), but it did not enjoy any support. Studies showed that the prescribed displacement could be obtained with a steel-hulled ship by equipping it only with a gas turbine propulsion unit. However, this variant was rejected, as was the plan developed by the TsKB-53. The final decision was to continue the planning on the basis of a variant calling for a boiler and turbine propulsion unit, similar to the main propulsion unit of the "Groznyy" class guided missile cruiser (project 58), which made it possible to increase displacement to 8,500 tons. The main elements of the preliminary specifications were approved by a government decree almost at the end of work on the conceptual design, on 29 September 1960, while the conceptual design itself was completed on 1 December of the same year. Of course, the office was instructed to carry out additional studies to improve the helicopter technical maintenance conditions, to foresee the possibility for basing progressive [perspektivnyye] helicopter models on the ship at sea states of up to 6 points inclusively, reduction of the crew to 300-350 (by extensively introducing automation), reduction of displacement by combining personal-service systems and other devices, accommodation of personnel according to submarine, escort vessel and destroyer norms, and exclusion of redundancy in technical resources, posts and so on. As a result, another 16 variants of the project appeared, and out of all of them, what was referred to as variant 23 with a displacement of 9,300 tons was approved on March 1961 as the basis for the detail design, though with a general orientation on reducing its displacement. It should be noted that the work of designing the ship's principal armament--the ASW helicopter system--encountered serious difficulties due to the absence of approved "requirements on grouped basing of helicopters aboard ships" at that time. The TsNIIVK began developing such requirements only concurrently with work on the cruiser's plan. However, immediately after approval of the conceptual design, the air force institute suddenly reported that "its new manning structure did not foresee the function of supervising the planning of ships with helicopter armament in industrial central design offices, for which reason the group of observers is being disbanded, and beginning in 1961 observers will not be appointed to ship projects." Numerous appeals by the navy and the GKS to the air force command regarding the need for reinstating supervision produced no results. In addition, the air force and the GKAT were late in providing the basic data on progressive ASW helicopters, mentioned in the government's decision, as a result of which development of the ship's detail design was based on data from the OKB-938. But when the detail design was nearing its completion, the air force reported that "the Ka-25 helicopter adopted by them cannot be said to be sufficiently progressive in terms of its performance characteristics and the composition of its equipment and armament." It became necessary to convene an expert commission. The detail design that was submitted for examination was for a ship of standard displacement of 9,000 tons and a speed of 29 knots. The number of ship personnel was determined at 370. In its conclusion on the project the TsNIIVK proposed increasing the crew by 31. The naval commander-in-chief ordered the Main Staff to examine this question. With regard for the requirement of maintaining a three-shift underway watch at the main battle stations during a length sea cruise, the latter substantiated the need for a manning level of 497 persons. During joint examination of the justifications the TsKB-17, the TsNIIVK and the naval Main Staff compromised on a crew of 415. Detail design 1123 was approved on 25 January 1962. A number of amendments and supplements were of course once again introduced into it, to include: the possibility for landing 14 progressive Ka-25 and Mi-8 ASW helicopters on the ship, increasing crew size, changing the composition of radio communication resources, and raising the ship's navigability at a sea state of 6-7 points-- which made it possible to increase its standard displacement to 10,600 tonnes, with the corresponding decrease in speed and cruising range. The TsKB-17 was instructed to make the corrections to the project by May, and to transfer the first set of working drawings on the hull to the plant, so that the prototype could be laid down in that same year, 1962. Diagram of the General Arrangement of Weapons and Armament Aboard the Cruiser Helicopter Carrier Correction of the detail design revealed that in order to accommodate the progressive helicopters aboard the ship, the hangar volume would have to be increased by 81 percent, a second hangar for two helicopters would have to be set up on the top deck, and the area of the flight deck would have to increased by 77 percent. This evoked major changes in the main dimensions and in the theoretical outline of the hull. As a result, the ship's standard displacement grew to 10,750 tonnes, while speed dropped to 28.5 knots. Designing of the ship was seriously complicated, besides by several changes in the initial data on the helicopters, by presence of considerable quantities of experimental and prototype armament still in the design stage. Consequently, the office's designers had to work with the technical data and even the conceptual designs of these models. One other thing should be noted. Construction of a ship of a fundamentally new class, which required a complex cooperative effort in delivering armament, equipment and materials, was complicated by reorganization of the country's industrial management system on a territorial principle beginning in 1957. As a result, the TsKB-17 had to draft the government decree "On Approving the Basic Elements and Providing for Construction of the Prototype of an Outer-Zone ASW Ship." It foresaw participation of around 200 enterprises and organizations of five sector state committees, two RSFSR ministries, the All-Russian Council of the National Economy, and republic and territories councils of the national economy in designing the cruiser helicopter carrier. This also necessitated additional work and coordination of the supply plan with the executors and higher organizations. In the course of planning the ship, the office and its contractors successfully solved a number of new troubling problems in practically all specialties with the participation of naval and air force specialists for the first time in Soviet ship building experience. Special attention was naturally devoted in this case to resources of the ASW helicopter system. Items developed as part of these resources included: a helicopter transport system that was semiautomated (providing for longitudinal and transverse towing in the hangar) and mechanized (using tractors on the flight deck); helicopter elevators making the most economical use of hangar space possible; fuel, oil, nitrogen and hydraulic systems, and helicopter electric power supply. The flight deck (with the main hangar beneath it) was foreseen in the aft part of the cruiser helicopter carrier as being the best protected from wave action in the presence of strong winds. That left the fore part to accommodate the ship armament systems. Because of this the ship acquired such an unusual architecture that it was jokingly named a "half a steamship." Another characteristic feature of the cruiser helicopter carrier was presence of a high-power, long-range sonar system (employed for the first time on surface ships not only in our country but even abroad!). Owing to its considerable dimensions, its acoustic system was installed inside a retractable faring beneath the keel (with dimensions of 21x6.5x9 m), which had a raising and lowering device of unique design. An entire series of special measures had to be developed and implemented aboard the ship in order to reduce acoustic interference during operation of the sonar system and in order to support its prescribed range. There were many other unique design features as well. Thus, much attention was devoted during planning of the hull to making it resistant to hits by enemy missiles and torpedoes, and the top deck above the hangar (with an area of around 2,000 m[.sup]2[/]) was built with a unique design requiring a minimum number of supports. The following were located aboard a ship for the first time: an automated system for controlling water systems; electric systems for automatic or remote control of impulse valves, ventilation covers, fuel receiving and transfer fittings, and water protection; a fast-acting firefighting equipment activating system. A new anchoring device making it possible to weigh anchor without requiring personnel on the top deck was developed during the planning. Basing of the helicopters required development of special devices: fire curtains in the lower hangar, doors to the upper hangar, and an automated collapsible railing on the flight deck. Controllable fin stabilizers were used as roll stabilizing devices, as being the most reliable and effective in comparison with active and passive stabilizing tanks. The project 58 guided missile cruiser adopted as the basis for the main propulsion unit was modified and improved. The productivity of the main boilers was raised in connection with the increase in steam consumption. Auxiliary boilers and automated desalinization and evaporating units were designed anew. The ship's electric power supply system foresaw the full volume of automation of both power plants. New models of electrical equipment were developed on instructions from the office: automated turbogenerators and diesel generators, synchronous generators with an amplitude-phase compounding system, automatic starting switches, and so on. In the course of planning the electric power system, with the participation of the Naval Academy, the office solved a number of complex technical problems in order to provide for: - reliable, lengthy parallel operation of generator units equipped with different kinds of primary engines and with speed governors having different dynamic characteristics; - the needed quantity of electric power in the presence of major consumers which additionally imposed sharply pronounced pulsed and cyclic load requirements; - the necessary dynamic and statistical stability of generators. At the same time, the fight to reduce displacement was very much complicated by the need for creating good living conditions for the personnel. Considering the ship unsinkability requirements and protection against mass destruction weapons, portholes had to be rejected in the main hull. Nonetheless, the design foresaw one-and two-man cabins with an area of 5-6 m[.sup]2[/] for officers, four- and six-man cabins with an area of 6-12 m[.sup]2[/] for warrant officers and chief petty officers with the beds arranged in two tiers, and, for the crew, mess decks with a space norm of 2.1-1.2 m[.sup]2[/] per person and with beds arranged in two tiers. A ventilation and air conditioning system and soundproof partitions were installed, soundproofing and noise suppressing devices were employed, a maximum amount of plastic furniture was introduced, and thought was given to the architectural and interior design and color scheme of living and public spaces. A ward-room was foreseen for officers and chief petty officers, and two messes with a centralized dishwashing facility were foreseen for the crew. [Sentence incomplete in original]...after the TsKB-17 sent the planning documents and orders to the manufacturing plant in June 1972 together with the initial working drawings for the hull. In July the corrected detail design was approved, but as it turned out, the drama surrounding the designing of the ship did not end with this. During N. Khrushchev's visit to the Northern Fleet (in summer 1962) the navy and the GKS were instructed to "significantly increase the endurance of warships and widen their sailing region." After this, the main developer of surface-to-air missile systems submitted a proposal to the naval command and to the leadership of the corresponding sector state committees to increase the ammunition reserve aboard ships by reexamining the design of the surface-to-air missile storage and delivery system, as a result of which instructions were given to carry out the corresponding studies, to be followed by instructions to study installation of a radar station aboard the ship that was more powerful than the present one. These and other instructions necessitated development of 26 variants of particular changes for examination. And later on, during publication of the working design documents, consideration had to be given to new decisions and orders of the navy and the GKS (Ministry of Ship Building Industry), changes in standards and the minutes of technical meetings. When it published the design documents, the TsKB-17 devoted great attention to checking the ship's weight distribution. On instructions from B. Chilikin, the chief of the TsKB-17 and its chief designer (1905-1967), each week the planning division submitted a summary of the current loading conditions (with regard for published drawings) and the position of the ship's center of gravity for his approval. He also made the final decisions when approved weight limits and their moments (on three coordinates) were exceeded. In late 1965 the TsKB-17 carried out test calculations of the ship's stability and its ability to remain afloat when damaged, and tested dangerous cases of flooding with a scale model (1:50) in a physical modeling laboratory created in the office. The results turned out to be somewhat worse that the calculations carried out when correcting the plans. In order to meet the unsinkability specifications, recommendations were drawn up to increase the quantity of liquid ballast used in tanks after they were emptied. These recommendations were approved by the navy and the GKS by their decision in August 1966. A decree of the CPSU Central Committee and USSR Council of Ministers foresaw construction of two ships on the basis of project 1123. Captain 1st Rank A. Khokhlov was appointed chief observer from the navy, and N. Prudnikov was appointed the chief builder of the prototype, which was christened the "Moskva". This cruiser was laid down on 15 December 1962 in Nikolayev at a large building dock of Plant No 444 (presently the Chernomorskiy Sudostroitelnyy Zavod Production Association) under rather mundane circumstances. After the two bottom sections of the hull were installed and a field joint was welded between them, plant director A. Gankevich and naval GUK [shipbuilding main administration] representative N. Grushin signed the ship's lay-down certificate on a table covered with red fabric standing beside the hull. In this case, only a few dozen plant workers and seamen and a small group of specialists who had to come to Leningrad from the TsKB-17 under the leadership of the project's chief designer, A. Savichev, were in attendance. But when the ship was lowered into the water on 14 January 1965, it was under festive circumstances, in the presence of several thousand people, and it was a major event at the plant. The initial general timetable called for completion of construction of the prototype in 2.5 years; however, changes in the plans that had been approved in 1962 in the course of construction itself, a number of alterations, and late deliveries of the main armament and equipment increased the volume and laboriousness of the work. Consequently, the mooring trials of the "Moskva" went on from November 1966 to May 1967, plant sea trials were held in May-August, and state trials were conducted in August-December 1967. The state trials were conducted by a government commission under the leadership of Rear Admiral B. Lamm. His deputy was the new chief designer of the project, A. Marinich, who replaced the retiring Savichev in March 1967. After the state trials were completed Captain 1st Rank F. Starozhilov was appointed ship commander. (He replaced the first commander of the cruiser helicopter carrier "Moskva" G. Kopylov, who commanded the crew from February 1965). V. Konovalenko was appointed the manufacturing plant's chief inspector during the sea and state trials; (they were conducted in the Black Sea). During the state trials around 100 Ka-25 helicopter sorties were flown day and night, in good and adverse weather, with the ship both at rest and under power, and with different specifications of heeling, trim and speed of the resultant air flow above the flight deck. The results confirmed that the shipboard resources of the ASW helicopter system met the requirements completely. By the beginning of this stage of the trials 19 new models of weapons and equipment not yet adopted by the navy had been installed aboard the ship. They were checked out and accepted simultaneously with the ship, which significantly complicated the organization and conduct of the trials. After their completion, on 25 December 1967, a government commission accepted the ship into the navy. It was noted in the acceptance certificate that the latest models of armament and equipment installed aboard the cruiser helicopter carrier would keep its specifications and performance characteristics at a modern level for a long time to come (see Table).

In 1.5 months and in a complex situation of constant contact with ships and aviation of the USA and NATO, and a sea state of up to 6 points, the cruiser traveled around 11,000 nautical miles. Its helicopters flew around 400 sorties during the time of the cruise, surveying up to 10,000 square miles per day with good results in searching for, detecting and lengthy shadowing of submarines. This complex cruise confirmed the high reliability of the armament and equipment of the cruiser helicopter carrier. Creation of the cruiser and the Ka-25 helicopter was marked by state prizes. In fall 1969 the second ship of this class--the "Leningrad"--joined the navy. In 1974, after the end of the Arab-Israeli War, it helped to clear mines from the Suez Canal (together with Pacific Fleet minesweepers) at the request of the Egyptian government. Because our country did not possess any minesweeping helicopters at that time, eight Ka-25 ASW helicopters had to be refitted quickly for this operation. The minesweepers cleared moored mines from the channel, while helicopters removed ground mines, as well as moored mines in places where ships could not operate because of reefs and shallow water. The helicopters also worked reliably and without incident in these unusual operating conditions, and their crews demonstrated a high class of piloting. In three months the canal once again became navigable. For this operation, the crews of the Soviet ships and helicopters earned the gratefulness of the Egyptian government and the USSR minister of defense. In the mid-1980's the "Leningrad" visited the city in honor of which it was named. It stood on the Neva, not far from the building occupied by the design office that gave it life, where the collective of designers was already working on the design of new, larger aircraft carrying ships. Both cruiser helicopter carriers sailed many long cruises and combat patrols. In 1990 the "Leningrad" was retired from the navy, while the "Moskva" is still one of the active ships of the Black Sea Fleet. COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy Sbornik", 1994.
