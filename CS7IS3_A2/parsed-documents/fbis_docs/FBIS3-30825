He regarded air strikes against Serbian cities "just as if Russian cities were being bombed", Zhirinovskiy told the Prague-based newspaper LIDOVE NOVINY. "This would completely change Russian foreign policy," he said. If the bombings take place, all of those countries involved should be aware "that whatever they do to Serbian cities, the same will happen to their countries. Bombs will fall on the cities of those countries that bomb Serbian cities." Zhirinovskiy confirmed that he had received an invitation from the extreme-right Czech Republicans. He would very much like to come, even though this would not be welcomed by all sides. Zhirinovskiy predicted that the Czech Republic would come to a speedy end. "Your country will be destroyed. I assure you that, in 10 years' time, neither Moravia nor the Sudetenland will exist. The Czechs will be forced to speak German, forget their native language, attend German churches, and polish the boots of German officers."
