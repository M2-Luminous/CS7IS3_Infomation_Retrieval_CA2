Here is the first news from the meeting held today. [Begin recording] [Prime Minister Josef Moravcik] The government, which had taken the oath, met for its first regular meeting tonight. The agenda included organizational issues. We clarified the nature and the style of our work and cooperation, as well as the schedule of our meetings. Besides these general matters, the government deemed it necessary to make one personnel change. It has recalled the president of the police corps as of today and appointed Mr. Lastovka to this post, as of today. The government considered this inevitable in order to ensure that the police corps operate with full efficiency. Apart from that, the government has adopted a statement that will be read now by Mr. Simko. [Simko] Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present to you the statement of the Slovak Government. The government of the broad coalition is a government formed by several political parties, by people with different political opinions. It emerged due to the need to overcome the authoritarian way of ruling and to create conditions for respect, tolerance, and cooperation among citizens. The government is resolved to do everything in its power for the good of the Slovak Republic. The government honors and respects the principles of a law-governed state and will act in line with them. The government will focus on a realistic transformation policy that will create conditions for economic stability. The citizens' conditions of life and certainties will become the government's priority. The government identifies itself with the appeal made by President Michal Kovac for civic, political, and national reconciliation. In this spirit, the government intends to take part in creating conditions for the citizens of the Slovak Republic to freely express their will in early elections. [Moravcik] The selection of state secretaries will be carried out in a similar way to the formation of the government--that is, it will be the subject of coalition talks, and a similar key will be used. Individual ministers should have their say in the matter. [end recording]
