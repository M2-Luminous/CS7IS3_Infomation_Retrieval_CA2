I refer to President Clinton's recent pronouncement on the Punjab. Personally he may not know the distance between Tarn Taran and Timbuctoo but he has a large embassy in New Delhi which must keep him informed of the ground realities of the Punjab of today. And the ground reality is that terrorists who had been losing ground have been wiped out. They forfeited the little sympathy they had among the peasantry as they degenerated from being politically or religiously motivated to gangs of thugs bent on loot, murder and rape. More than the Army or the police, it was the peasantry of the Punjab which barred their doors against them. I have no doubt that there must have been incidents of police high-handedness and violation of human rights, as they would be in the best organised societies in the world faced by goons who have no respect for laws or norms of civilised behaviour. In the Punjab they were not on so large a scale as to invite censure from the head of a friendly state. More unpardonable than ignorance of the changed situation in the Punjab is the White House lending ear to the culmination of a handful of emigrants styling themselves as the Council of Khalistan. Whatever support there was for Khalistan has eroded leaving one man with a tiny office in Washington publishing grossly exaggerated stories of anti-Sikh repression by the Punjab police and para-military forces. This one man financed by a rich farmer in California has, however, established contacts with members of the American Congress and Senators and raised funds for them. In return they make anti-Indian noises in Congress and the Senate. It may not be too bad an idea for our Government to extend invitations to these American politicians to visit the Punjab, talk to the people including erstwhile terrorists and see things for themselves.
