The Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] would open soon. Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, and other comrades left a reception room amid light-hearted music and went to the rostrum of the full session. The 10,000-man hall was lighted by ceiling lights, wall lights, and correspondents' flash bulbs. Facing numerous cameras, General-Secretary Jiang Zemin pulled Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and Li Ruihuan together and happily said: "Come, let us have a group photo taken!" Photographic correspondent rushed forward to photograph their smiling faces. Earlier, a reception room in the rear of the main assembly hall was bustling with noise and excitement as a closed circuit TV was broadcasting the video recording of Li Ruihuan's visit to three countries in Southeast Asia. When Vice Chairman Wang Guangying saw Li Ruihuan coming into the room with a smiling face, he pointed at the TV and said: "Chairman Li, the TV is broadcasting you. You are the first person visiting abroad in the position of chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. It was very significant to developing foreign contacts by the CPPCC!" Li Ruihuan said repeatedly: "The achievements of the CPPCC all depend on your joint efforts." At a reception room, Ye Xuanping and Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee, were greeting party and state leaders who came to extend their greetings. Ye Xuanping held talks with some responsible persons of democratic parties, and later extended his greetings to Ann Tse-kai, Henry Fok Ying-tung, and Ma Man-kei, vice chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee who were elected from Hong Kong and Macao regions; Wang Zhaoguo asked for advice from Wang Hanbin, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, concerning legal matters in contacts between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and other comrades entered the reception room to express their congratulations to Li Ruihuan on the opening of the CPPCC session. Li Ruihuan introduced Zhu Xun, minister of geology and mineral resources and first deputy secretary general of the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, to comrades Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Qiao Shi, saying: "This is our newly elected member and Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources Zhu Xun." Jiang Zemin shook hands with him and said: "We knew each other long ago." Li Peng said to Zhu Xun: "The CPPCC can do a lot of things. You must continue your efforts under the leadership of Comrade Li Ruihuan." The preparatory bell sounded, and Zhu Xun requested those leading comrades to take their seats at the rostrum. When General-Secretary Jiang Zemin saw Ye Xuanping wearing a feather-padded coat, he asked the latter: "You will make a report at the plenary meeting wearing just this?" Ye Xuanping took off the feather-padded coat and said smilingly: "I wear a western coat underneath!" Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, and other comrades all laughed.
