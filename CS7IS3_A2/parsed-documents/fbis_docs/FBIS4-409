FBIS4-409 "drafr069_c_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-069 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 10 Apr South African Press Review for 10 Apr MB1004165294 MB1004165294 BFN [Editorial Report] SUNDAY TIMES Political Position of Zulu Monarchy Viewed -- "The failure of the ANC and NP [National Party] this week to persuade King Goodwill Zwelithini to withdraw his support for the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] boycott tactics may well count as one of our country's defining moments," begins a page-26 editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 10 April. "The implications for peace or continuing war are enormous." Although the king on Friday rejected the proposal of having a constitutional monarchy entrenched, the editorial urges the king and his advisers to "carefully consider the implications." "The institution of the Zulu monarchy has survived war, invasion, plague and natural disaster," "yet now the king, the institution, is deeply locked in politics, caught in a violent war of position between the ANC and Inkatha." The editorial continues by admitting that "the IFP's decision not to take part in the election is legitimate and democratic. Its steadfast defence of federal powers -- long after the National Party had capitulated in a welter of nudges, back-channel deals and obfuscatory rhetoric -- is to its eternal credit. But that is not the point. Inkatha's opposition to the election now verges on the seditious -- a campaign to destabilise the election and to deny citizens their fundamental right to vote. Unimaginable violence looms." SUNDAY NATION Transition Urged on After Failed Leaders' Summit -- "We believe that after the failure of this summit where the ANC presented an extraordinary package to address the king's so-called concerns, to no avail, the ANC, the NP and the South African society as a whole have finally discovered that Buthelezi will never be satisfied," states the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 10 April in a page-6 editorial. "Therefore -- no matter how radical it sounds -- the only reasonable thing to do is to ignore Buthelezi and move ahead with the transition process. It is also a shame King Goodwill Zwelithini has not yet discovered that Buthelezi is geared to make him lose something for nothing." In conclusion the SUNDAY NATION writes that "we hope that the three remaining weeks before the adoption of the new constitution will be enough for the king to see the light and take a more realistic approach if he really cares about the well-being of his people and the Natal province as a whole." RAPPORT Kruger Park Leaders' Summit -- "A mountain gives birth to a mole hill" is how a page-18 editorial in the Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 10 April dubs the unsuccessful leaders' summit meeting at Skukuza on Friday night. "In spite of healthy skepticism from those watching the complicated political process, there had been great expectations in the South African public that the summit between the government, the ANC, the IFP, and the Zulu king would send out a positive message. Correctly or incorrectly, these expectations had been built up like the proverbial mountain. The one that gave birth to a mole hill." "Expectations have been cherished and built up -- but disappointment and dissatisfaction have followed with regular monotony." At the Skukuza summit, the ANC reiterated its standpoint: postponing the election was out of the question. "And indeed the postponement of the election date was the one item high on the IFP's agenda." Furthermore, nothing has come from the proposed international mediation which had earlier built a "glimpse of hope." "At this late stage, RAPPORT is appealing to all political leaders to seek with renewed enthusiasm an all-inclusive solution," while the "thinking" South African public appeals for "room in which all views will be considered."
