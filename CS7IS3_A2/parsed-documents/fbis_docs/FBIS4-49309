Tsai] [Text] Taipei, May 5 (CNA) -- The manufacturing industry's investment willingness, a leading economic indicator, remained sluggish in the first quarter of 1994, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) said Thursday [5 May]. IDB statistics show that the number of newly established enterprises hit 1,413 during the period, up 1.9 percent over the same period last year. The aggregate registered capital of these new companies, however, decreased 26.8 percent to NT [new Taiwan dollars] $18.6 billion (US$701.88 million). The figures pointed to a slowdown in the growth of large-size enterprises, officials said. Meanwhile, a total of 1,505 companies increased their investment by NT$76 billion (US$2.86 billion) in the three-month period, down 60.3 percent from a year ago. The officials noted that both new investments and capital increments have been on the decline since January 1993. The whole year of 1993 saw a 35.45 percent drop in manufacturing investment growth, they added. Investment growth reached a peak of 40 percent in 1992 after four consecutive years of growth, they said. IDB Director-General Yin Chi-ming pledged that the bureau will keep a close watch on the continued slump in domestic manufacturers' investment willingness.
