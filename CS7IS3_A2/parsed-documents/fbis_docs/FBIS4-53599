"We had a good start," U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told reporters after emerging from a 40-minute opening session with the Japanese delegation. Officials from the two sides huddled for several hours behind closed doors at the office of the U.S. trade representative as they weighed terms and conditions for resuming stalled trade talks under the so-called "framework" agreement concluded last July. Japanese and U.S. officials taking part in the talks, which are expected to stretch over into Friday, maintained a virtual news blackout on what transpired across the negotiating table. Kantor said the two sides "had an exchange of detailed ideas," but declined to shed any light on what the Japanese officials are offering for resumption of the framework talks. The trade talks, which are aimed at widening foreign access to the Japanese market and reducing Japan's vast trade surplus, broke down in February after Tokyo rejected U.S.-proposed yardsticks to measure Japanese imports. Japan's Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, in talks with President Bill Clinton over the phone shortly after he took office in late April, has promised to work to get the talks back on track. Tokyo dispatched two senior officials -- Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice trade minister for international affairs, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs -- for the exploratory talks after Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa held another round of telephone conversations with Kantor last week. "The fact that the foreign minister and the prime minister directed these officials to come here ... for discussion is at least a potentially hopeful sign," Kantor told a congressional subcommittee Thursday. While Kantor says the U.S. has set no "time limit" for a deal, one obvious deadline is June 30 when the U.S. Government is due to decide whether to cite Japan for discriminating against U.S. firms on government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment. Both industry sectors are among the priority areas covered under the framework negotiations. Meanwhile, in an television interview Thursday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown reiterated that Washington will insist on "measurable, monitorable results" in fashioning a trade agreement with Tokyo. Brown, speaking after fresh trade data showed that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan jumped 25.4 percent to 5.80 billion dollars in March, warned that sanctions against Japan remain an option if there is no improvement in trade ties. "You have vehicles such as (Super 301 trade sanctions) to use when necessary. That is not said in any kind of threatening way. We have not made any decisions as to whether use that but that is certainly an option available," Brown said in the interview.
