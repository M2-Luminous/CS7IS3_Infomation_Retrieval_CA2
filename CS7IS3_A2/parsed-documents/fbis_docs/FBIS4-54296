FBIS4-54296 "dreas103__a94029" FBIS-EAS-94-103-A Daily Report 4 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Report on Optical Fiber Network Improvement Report on Optical Fiber Network Improvement OW2005051994 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 4 May 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2005051994 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Details of a draft report on how the optical fiber network ought to be developed to build a multimedia society, which has been worked out by the Telecommunications Council (chaired by Fumio Watanabe, adviser to Tokyo Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.), an advisory panel to the post and telecommunications minister, were revealed on 3 May. With regard to the focal point of allotting roles between "the government" and "the private sector," the draft report specifies the need for the private sector to play a leading role in developing the network, saying "it is desirable to make utmost use of vital power of the private sector." According to the draft report, the optical fiber network is scheduled to be completed in 2010. The draft report urges the government to revise related laws and to establish an assistance and loan system to promote the use of the optical fiber network for such services as remote medical care and education at home by 2010. The council plans to submit a final report to the post and telecommunications minister on 31 May after working out final details. The United States is an advanced nation in building the optical fiber network, in which a large amount of demand for related services is expected following the spread of multimedia and software equipment. With Vice President Gore playing a leading role, the country is promoting the national information infrastructure (NII) project designed to make various use of the optical fiber network. In Japan as well, there is now a growing demand for coming up with policies that will serve as a "guideline" for establishing the optical fiber network. For example, people in the government, the industrial circle, and the medical and education fields have shown strong interest in development of the network. The draft report is comprised of seven chapters. In the first chapter, "The Need To Improve the Information Communications Infrastructure," the draft report makes it a condition for developing the optical fiber network that "everyone everywhere in Japan is able to enjoy life at the same level as in the most convenient place in the world, to get a job, and to touch culture." Moreover, in analyzing the "new media" project that drew attention in the eighties, the draft report states that the project failed because measures to use new media were insufficient in creating new demands. In the seventh chapter, it cites laws that have to be reviewed to materialize the following services that are now regulated by laws: remote diagnosis and medical treatment; education at home; working at home with telecommunications; an inquiry of a witness and a meeting of a board of directors through a teleconference system; home shopping for medicine, rice, and real estate. With regard to the scale of domestic markets concerned, it predicts that business in the multimedia market as a whole will amount to approximately 123 trillion yen in 2010. Of this amount, the optical fiber network business is expected to reach about 56 trillion yen. In the sixth chapter, the draft report clearly says the private sector should take the initiative in developing the network. It also points out that the government's role is "to promote necessary deregulation, to encourage highly motivated companies' access to the business, and to emphasize improvement of conditions based on the current move toward a fusion of communications and broadcasting." Moreover, since the development of the optical fiber network costs approximately 1 trillion yen every year, the draft report proposes setting up an interest-free loan system designed to assist communications enterprises such as NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation]. It also urges the "government" to help the private sector develop new ways of using the optical fiber network, to bring about the on- line system for dealing with services at the window and public relations bulletins, and to reduce exchanges of notes between organizations. Noting the schedule for developing the optical fiber network in the fourth chapter, the draft report indicates a plan to finish installing fiber-optic lines to cover households nationwide in 2010 when Japan's population is expected to reach a peak. It proposes the three-step procedure for installing fiber-optic lines: the first step is to install fiber-optic lines in areas of cities where prefectural offices are located, by 2000; and the second step is to install the lines in all areas of cities with a population of over 100,000 by 2005. It also indicates that it is necessary to install fiber-optic lines in public organizations, including schools, libraries, and hospitals, by 2000, in an effort to have them play a leading role in promoting the optical fiber network.
