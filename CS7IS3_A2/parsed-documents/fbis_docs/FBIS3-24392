Petrova and N. Manzhurin: "And No Loose Ends"] [Text] Our correspondent asked Senior Counselor of Justice V.N. Chichayev, a senior assistant to the Maritime Kray procurator, for comments on everything that took place in the mayoralty: "On 15 March a decision was made to initiate criminal proceedings against City of Vladivostok Mayor V.I. Cherepkov. And since he is a candidate for a deputy to the kray duma, in keeping with the Temporary Statute on the Elections to the Maritime Kray Duma, he cannot be the subject of criminal proceedings or subjected to administrative punitive measures imposed by the court, without a concurrence of the kray procurator. A measure to secure the appearance of the accused and other criminal process measures may be applied to a candidate only by the ruling of the kray court; therefore, the kray procurator did grant his consent. There is also a kray court ruling." This is the process basis. The requirements of the law formally have been observed in this case. "But was it necessary to do it all so crudely, with the help of the OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments]?" "Having received the procuracy investigator's decision, the kray administration had all the grounds to carry it out. In what form to conduct this action is no longer the issue of a legal process, but a purely administrative one. If the law has been violated in the process of carrying out this decision, then the procuracy will look into it. Meanwhile, one side is standing there with posters, while the other guards the mayoralty; we do not have any problems with either. Problems will come up when unlawful actions are committed on one or the other side. So far we have not received such information. "This is all I can say regarding the events around the mayoralty." * * * To the question whether it would be possible to review the kray procurator's decision--which, by the way, had been read over kray radio--Veniamin Chichayev replied that he does not have this document in his possession and does not even know its registration number. Just as fruitless turned out the search for a copy of the decision by A.I. Vysotskiy, a deputy procurator and an investigator of the Frunzenskiy Rayon Procuracy. Like kray procurator V.V. Vasilenko, he also took sick and was not in the office. As to Aleksandr Ivanovich's colleagues, they said that they do not have any documents relevant to this case. No documents in which we were interested were at the kray administration's press service. Neither were we able to meet with deputy head of the kray administration I.P. Lebedinets, who had signed the decree on I.V. Cherepkov's dismissal and directed the operation on the seizure of the "Gray House." We were told that he probably had gone on a trip to Ussuriysk. An interesting kind of glasnost. For the chosen only. * * * We telephoned the kray court chairman, N.S. Vinogradova, and asked her to comment on the events that had taken place on the night from 16 to 17 March in Vladivostok. "No comment; all questions should be directed to the kray procuracy," said Nina Sergeyevna. And confirmed at the same time that the court is aware of the happenings and has given its permission for such measures, based on some local-level documents.... Nina Sergeyevna refused to show the newspaper any official court document on the subject.
