Rumors running through the Hong Kong stock market Friday said the patriarch had died or was critically ill, sparking a 2.37-percent drop in stock prices on strong selling in the morning session to 8,972.59 points -- its lowest level in a month. The market recovered to a provisional 9,108.61 points at the close of trading Friday. Deng has not been seen in public since February when he was shown on television during the Chinese New Year accompanied by two of his daughters. Since then, rumors about his health have persisted and are consistently denied by the government and his entourage. On Wednesday, his daughter Deng Rong said her father "is not suffering any illness and is in good health."
