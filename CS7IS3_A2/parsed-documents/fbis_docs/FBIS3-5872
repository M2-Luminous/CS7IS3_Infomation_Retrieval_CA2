The directive says: The effective preventing and fighting of social evils -- first of all prostitution and drug addiction -- is currently an urgent task that our party and government must resolutely carry out with clear success in 1994. The decisive factors in successfully preventing and fighting social evils are the acceleration of socioeconomic development, the launching of public movements, the increasing management of state organs, and the expansion of the active role of mass organizations under the leadership of party committees and party organs throughout the country. The PCCS requests: 1. All party echelons and organs from the central down to the grassroots level must consider the work of preventing and fighting social evils -- first of all prostitution, drug addiction, and AIDS -- a very important task for 1994. 2. Party echelons and organs must work with local governments and state organs to outline and execute plans and programs to prevent and fight social evils in their localities. 3. First of all, a widespread public campaign must be launched to accelerate propaganda and education on a large scale to create strong public support for condemning and eliminating social evils. 4. Grassroots party committees must incorporate the duty of preventing and fighting social evils, waste, corruption, and smuggling into their regular work. Party organs must conduct regular checks on the work and lifestyles of party members in the family and society. Party members with unhealthy lifestyles must be quickly educated and prevented from any wrongdoing. If they commit social offenses, they must be dealt with strictly according to party discipline and state law. Party members who are addicted to drugs or involved with prostitution or debauchery must be expelled from the party. The PCCS asks provincial, city, and central organ party committees to execute this directive urgently.
