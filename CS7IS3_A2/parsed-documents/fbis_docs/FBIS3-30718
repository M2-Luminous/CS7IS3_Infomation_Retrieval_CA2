Has the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] or the Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ] changed since then? [Szajer] If we compare [FIDESZ Chairman] Viktor Orban's budget speeches, we can see that the 1993 speech was a much tougher criticism of the government than the 1990 one. Presumably, in 1990, the press more markedly emphasized that it was a speech in opposition to the government. [Elo] We can hear the FIDESZ mentioned together with the MDF increasingly frequently. Does this mean that you are starting to befriend the party in power? Is it a gradual withdrawal from the opposition role? [Szajer] Anyone who, three months before the elections, expects to get into power through the MDF is making a miscalculation. Hungarian citizens will have this government coalition replaced at the next elections. It can only harm us if we are seen to be on the same platform as the MDF. What would be the point in befriending a party in power that will only last a few weeks or months? [Elo] Then what is the reason for the change? I do not suppose you want to attribute this to the media's manipulations.... [Szajer] No, I do not, but somehow it has become a public view, although there is no basis for it. [Elo] Let me remind you of Orban's mental experiment when he drew the picture of a coalition to be formed with the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] and the MDF. [Szajer] In Hungary, it is accepted that a so-called social- liberal coalition will have to be formed after the elections. All Orban said was that at least another five other versions are also possible and the coalition possibilities should not be predetermined. [Elo] Nevertheless, this means that you would also enter into a coalition with the most criticized government parties. Do you not feel this as a significant shift in the FIDESZ's policies? [Szajer] The FIDESZ's goal continues to be to replace the current government coalition and to end up in front of the socialists. This was our goal in 1990, but we did not manage to achieve it. We are criticizing the MDF government just as firmly and severely as in 1990. In 1993, a new element was added with the increase of the socialists' chances to get into government. We are very strongly criticizing several elements of the Hungarian Socialist Party's [MSZP] policies because, in the future, they can be detrimental to the country, and we cannot forget about past experiences, either. At the same time, I can perceive a shift to the left in public opinion; therefore, someone who remains in the same place appears to be moving to the right. [passage omitted] [Elo] The liberal bloc has not even made its election agreement and conflicts have already surfaced. In fact, some people even think that the FIDESZ's agreement with the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is in danger. [Szajer] We initiated this agreement a year ago. We have always had some friction between the two parties and will always have them since we are two independent organizations. [passage omitted] [Elo] What can the FIDESZ expect from cooperation with the Agrarian Federation and the Entrepreneurs' Party? [Szajer] Through this, the liberal bloc almost covers the whole society. The FIDESZ has a disposition of a people's party and it can talk to the country's citizens regardless of which strata of society they belong to. The SZDSZ mainly has a basis among the intelligentsia. The Entrepreneurs' Party represents a very important group in the economic change of the regime, and the fourth is an agrarian party. [passage omitted]
