The impressive line-up of the armed forces leaders was an overkill for the increasingly beleaguered administrator which seems to be limping towards the end of the road. What has inspired the military leaders to take such a bold move could be anybody's guess. Government weakness is a simple answer. To the public, this is indeed a bad sign. The upbeat statement on the barter trade made by the generals on Friday would have been unthinkable in the days after the May 1992 bloodshed. It was the worst moment for the administration which has been closeting itself in a self-woven political cocoon amidst the public criticism over its lacklustre performance. It cannot pick more fights, especially with the armed forces. The timing was good for the military chiefs because they know that not many people would want to side with the administration which has alienated itself from former allies and supporters. They are also aware that the administration has been fighting on many fronts and struggling to stay in power. Its energy has been drained by inept handling of critical issues such as protest rallies staged by farmers and other victims of grievances while creating more adversaries in the same process. Had the government been able to maintain a cordial relationship with public-interest groups, such as NGOs, academics, students, labour unions, and the Confederation for Democracy -- or even the press -- things would have turned out differently. The armed forces chiefs would have thought twice before flexing their muscles -- something quite unfamiliar during the past two years. Alas, many cabinet members seen on television with sound bytes showed only sheepish smiles, while avoiding reporters' eye contact when they were pressed for their reactions to the military hyperbole. Obviously, it was not their day. The ego, inflated during the verbal duels with academics, seems to have shrunk considerably. We suspect that the way the armed forces bosses thundered their statement, echoed through a spokesman, must have driven some cabinet members out of their wits. They might be fretting over a question: Would the doomsday for the government come so soon? There was one positive aspect though, when we saw that the top brass behaved much less like bullies -- a style preferred by their predecessors. May be they know the current limits, and prefer to wait until the government can no longer function with enough credibility. But that was still not enough. The commanders should have adopted a more subtle method, a low-keyed approach, in dealing with this issue. A quiet chat would have been sufficient to avoid unnecessary ill feelings and public concern when it looked more like a confrontation. At the same time, their rejection of the government's proposal for a barter of agricultural products with defence procurement must be amply justified instead of saying just that such arrangements would be too complicated and unworkable. They cannot spend other people's money on their own will. They should explain why. If they do not have much regard for the administration, they must still take the taxpayers into consideration. The people have become more wary. They certainly want to know who will be the eventual targets of the expensive firearms and other fearsome weaponry bought with their sweat and toil. There was a painful lesson for the people who had braved the bullets and batons on Ratchadamnoen Avenue two years ago. The military leaders have to come up with some sort of assurance that the weapons they intend to acquire, with cash or other means, are not the defence equipment which have defects and fail to perform reasonably well in time of war as witnessed in the purchases of Stingray light tanks and the Spada air defence missile system last year. Things have changed. The commanders have to learn to cope with the ongoing social evolution. At least a sense of accountability to the public should be instilled in the holders of public offices, no matter what branches in the government they are in. If the commanders want arms to modernize their forces, they should produce credible proposals and allow more public scrutiny to display sincerity. These are also means to ensure that some fat-cat generals are barred from ill-gotten gains. An embracing excuse such as "national security" cannot impress the people all the time, especially those who are not gullible enough. A fact is that there are no secrets anymore, even in the arms bazaar. All countries know what are being bought and sold, by whom and to whom, with the smallest of details and specifications. What remains a secret, or little known, is the extent of commissions, or kickbacks, given by arms merchants to grease the hands holding the pen to sign the procurement contracts. All commercial transactions offer commissions, and only foolish buyers or traders would be unaware of the existence of kickbacks. This is a major factor which has enriched so many people involved in arms deals in our country in the past three decades. This is no wonder at all. Many military officers with simple family backgrounds -- some as poor as church mice -- have been able to amass wealth before their retirement like acquire foreign assets and generously acting as political paymasters. If Prime Minister Chuan and his administration think that the military show-off was in fact a bullying tactic, then they must show some spines themselves. Chuan's legendary razor-edged tongue must brave the menace of the bayonet. Beseeching should not be an alternative to a compromise. The taxpayers and nobody else, always have the final say with their money. They are entitled to a sensible explanation as well. Who knows? If government leaders are willing to take the bull by the horns, cheering fans might emerge from somewhere to give them a push while temporarily burying their hatchets only for this particular incident. The last thing the government should do is underestimate the power of the people. After all, the people know that the bull cannot be allowed to run amok and frighten the public so that it can gain more ground, and eventually dominate the whole arena again. The government should not take pleasure in committing failures so much that it is producing another one.
