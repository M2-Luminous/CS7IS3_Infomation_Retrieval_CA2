FR941116-2-00105 FR941116-2-00079 Factors Considered The Department of State (``the Department'') is charged with issuance of Presidential Permits for the construction of international bridges under the International Bridge Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 731; 33 U.S.C. 535 et seq., and Executive Order 11423, 33 FR 11741 (1968), as amended by Executive Order 12847 of May 17, 1993, 33 FR 96 (1993). The Department considered four alternative actions in this case: (1) Denial of a Presidential Permit (the ``no action;'' alternative), (2) the City providing public transportation services between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo, (3) issuance of a Presidential Permit with a condition requiring diversion of all commercial traffic from the two existing downtown bridges in Laredo and (4) issuance of a Presidential Permit without a condition requiring the diversion of all commercial traffic from the two existing downtown bridges. In considering the ``no action'' alternative, and the alternative of the City providing public transportation services between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo, the Department noted the continuing increases in commercial truck traffic on the existing Laredo bridges. Truck traffic (southbound only) increased from 274,743 trucks in 1987 to 781,332 in 1993. It also noted the implementation of NAFTA beginning January 1, 1994, which it believes will further stimulate the growth of truck traffic through Laredo. Approximately 60 percent of the commercial truck traffic between the United States and Mexico already passes through Laredo and Nuevo Laredo. The population of the Laredo Metropolitan Statistical Area increased from 99,258 in 1980 to 133,239 in 1990 and is expected to increase to 259,000 by the year 2010. The City of Nuevo Laredo in Mexico has also seen considerable growth in the last ten years; its population is expected to increase to as much as 350,000 by 2010. The increasing population, urbanization and commerce in the Laredo area mean that existing problems of air pollution, traffic congestion, and danger from hazardous waste caused by heavy truck traffic will continue to cause the quality of the environment of the Laredo/Nuevo Laredo downtown areas to deteriorate if no acceptable alternative route for such traffic is provided. The third alternative considered and the alternative chosen was to issue a Presidential Permit for construction of a bridge with a condition requiring diversion of all commercial traffic from the two existing downtown bridges in Laredo. The advantage of issuing a permit with such a condition is that it virtually eliminates the above-mentioned problems of air pollution, traffic congestion and danger from hazardous waste from the Laredo downtown area, insofar as these problems are caused by commercial truck traffic. The City has agreed to designate the new facility as a commercial crossing only and to route all commercial traffic from the two existing downtown bridges. The fourth alternative considered was the issuance of a Presidential Permit without a condition requiring the diversion of all commercial traffic from the two existing downtown bridges. Under this alternative, the environmental effects would be essentially the same as described below, except that benefits to the environment of downtown Laredo would not be as great as in the third alternative, as there is no assurance that commercial trucks would leave the downtown area and use the new bridge. Except as a condition of issuance of a Presidential Permit, the Department of State has no authority to require the City of Laredo to reroute traffic from the downtown bridges. If the new bridge is not constructed, the City of Laredo is under no obligation to ban commercial truck traffic from the downtown bridges at all, and such traffic would not be diverted to other bridges in the area, such as the Colombia/Solidarity bridge. The Environmental Assessment submitted by the City provides information on the environmental effects of the construction of a new bridge. On the basis of the Environmental Assessment, and information developed by the Department and the other federal and state agencies in the process of reviewing the Environmental Assessment, the Department makes the following conclusions regarding the impact of construction of a new international bridge at the proposed location. Air Quality Webb County, Texas, within which the proposed bridge is located, is designated as an attainment area for National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Since Webb County is in attainment, meeting the currently established National Ambient Air Quality Standards, the U.S. Clean Air Act does not mandate that the State Implementation Plan (SIP) address non-attainment requirements. Virtually all the air pollution caused by the City's proposal would be vehicle emissions. As noted above, rerouting commercial truck traffic from downtown Laredo bridges to this bridge and the Colombia/Solidarity bridge will have a positive impact on air quality in downtown Laredo. Overall emissions in Laredo would be reduced because of reductions in idling time, startups and stops associated with long waits for inspection at the existing bridges. Construction of the bridge and related infrastructure will have some transient impacts on air quality but it is not expected that the ambient pollutants will cause violations of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Based on the project descriptions provided, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission does not expect that air emissions associated with the project will substantially impact ambient air quality.
