[passage omitted] Police also discovered a Shining Path training camp the so-called "People's Liberation Army" and "People's Help" had been using for training, physical preparation, and the use of guns and explosives. Police reported on 10 February that the training camp was located at the top of Casablanca Hill, in the Jose Carlos Mariategui shantytown, near Miguel Castro Castro prison in San Juan de Lurigancho. During the raid on the area, police found explosives and the inscriptions of the aliases of the 10 [number as published] alleged terrorists arrested. According to the Dincote report, they have been identified as Miriam Tarazona Trujillo (21), alias "Rocio," and Jorge Manuel Linares Bustamante, 25, alias "Francisco" or "Santiago." The two are members of the PCP-SL [Peruvian Communist Party-Shining Path] defense department "leadership cell." Police agents presented to the press the following individuals as "People's Liberation Army members:" Rolando Hector Limachi Arevalo, alias "John," responsible for the southern zone; Marco Antonio Huamani Soriano, alias "Mario," from the political command; and Shiomara Velasco Chavez, alias "Edith," from the military command. Police also presented "combatants" Miguel Angle Santillan Coronel, alias "Jefri;" Jesus Honorato Alfaro Barrientos, alias "Helton;" Oswaldo Cuya Garcia, alias "Luis;" and Carmen Consuelo Llanos Inga, alias "Laura." Also presented in striped uniforms were communicators Alejandro Arturo Mayta Manrique, 33, handicapped -- he walks with an orthopedic leg with a lot of difficulty; and Jose Carlos Lopez Torres, 25. According to Dincote, the last two are allegedly members of the Shining Path's "People's Help" apparatus support department (health section). The Dincote agents stressed that with the arrest of these individuals, police neutralized terrorist activities being planned for metropolitan Lima's southern area. In the individuals' possession police found six sketches of streets, markets, and religious temples drawn by the PCP-SL People's Guerrilla Army to be used in the sabotage of bank offices and Pension Fund Administration (AFP) offices, and to paint walls, distribute pamphlets, and murder policemen. Dincote charged the arrested subversives with the destruction of five bank branches, Guido de Surquillo's bakery in San Juan de Miraflores municipality, and the frustrated homicide of a PNP [Peruvian National Police] lieutenant whose last name is Valle. They also were held responsible for the sabotage against the Peruvian Radio Television (Channel 7) station and Latin Frequency (Channel 2) building on 14 January 1991 and 5 June 1992, respectively.
