Jordan's drive aims to enlighten the world community about the need to apply pressures to end this embargo, which is harmful to both Jordan and Iraq, particularly since the outlets of the countries neighboring Iraq are wide open to trade with Iraq, whereas only Jordan is besieged in this regard. Jordan is next only to Iraq in terms of the harm caused by this embargo. Responsible Jordanian sources said that the Jordanian moves will take the form of royal visits abroad, the dispatch of envoys carrying royal messages abroad, as well as extensive diplomatic efforts on the international scene to be led by Jordanian Embassies abroad. The Jordanian campaign aims to end the blockade clamped on the Port of al-'Aqabah and the embargo imposed on the Iraqi people. Lately, Jordanian-Iraqi contacts have been activated. Iraqi Culture and Information Minister Hamid Yusuf Hammadi, who is currently visiting Jordan, has relayed a message from President Saddam to His Majesty King Husayn. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Sa'id al-Tall is visiting Baghdad, where he has met with several Iraqi officials.
