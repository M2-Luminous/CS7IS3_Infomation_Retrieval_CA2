He had 1.5 kilograms of refined opium which he was preparing to mail through the Lao postal system. Following an investigation by the counternarcotics police, he confessed to officials that he had received money to buy opium from Mr. (Yorker), an American citizen living in California. After receiving the money, on 24 November, Bue Xoua entered Laos under the pretext of visiting relatives for the Hmong New Year. On arrival, he sought to buy opium from bad elements in Laos. He refined it so as to decrease the volume for convenience in shipment. Then he hid the opium inside stuffed cat dolls. He then wrapped the dolls as if they were gifts, sending them under the name of Mr. Thongtak in Hom District. (This was an alias created by Bue Xoua himself.) He sent them to Mrs. (Fervilameui) in California.
