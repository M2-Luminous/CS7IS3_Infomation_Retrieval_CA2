Any process in that direction should be inseparable from a democratic, participative, and pluralist summons [convocatoria], Haroldo Dilla stated in his article "Cuba: The Crisis and New Articulation of Political Consensus," published recently in CUADERNOS DE NUESTRA AMERICA. He explained that any plan for development bears a cost, while its viability depends to a large extent on the establishment of a national consensus on the advisability of the proposed objectives and the appropriate means of achieving them. In this respect, he noted that the "capacity of the Cuban socialist program to guarantee strong popular support has been conditioned by diverse factors that cannot be solely or chiefly attributed to charismatic mediation of historical leadership summarized in the person of Fidel Castro." The goals contained in the original revolutionary program -- public honesty, economic development, social justice, national independence, substantial democracy -- left little room for capitalist options, the expert from the nongovernment organization recalled. He indicated that for over one decade (1959-70) popular political consensus was based on the implementation of measures to redistribute income and power and got off the ground through a system of extensive participation in national defense and the revolutionary program in the face of U.S. hostility. Later, the fate of Cuban socialism was linked to the progress of the countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, which Cuba joined in 1972. At the beginning of 1987, the process to correct errors and negative trends, spearheaded by the Communist Party of Cuba, had as it most novel element the attempt to articulate the return to what was homegrown, with greater democratization and institutional improvement of the political system. Beginning in 1990, he noted, an emergency plan known as the special period was implemented throughout the country, which meant above all "guaranteeing national survival in an severely hostile international environment given the permanent U.S. aggressiveness against the Cuban socialist program." Therefore, Cuba is facing, as are other Third World economies, the so-called "export challenge" under disadvantageous and contradictory conditions. According to Dilla, the latter is seen at the international level in an abrupt end of what was for almost three decades its preferential markets and, at the same time, in the introduction "into a world market that is competitive and economically exclusive, politically conditioned by Washington's obsessive hostility." Internally, he stresses, it presupposes a costly and gradual technological reconversion process and a vast reorganization of relations among economic factors like production, distribution, and consumption. With regard to the latter, he believes that in order to maintain liquidity within manageable limits (the excess money supply is estimated at 10 billion pesos, which is the same amount in dollars in accordance with the official exchange rate), it will be necessary to disrupt traditional consumption policy by reducing demand. A basic principle of consumption policy since the 1960's was the preservation of a rationed basic family basket at very low prices, which presupposed subsidies that between 1976 and 1981 amounted to 2 billion pesos. Furthermore, in spite of the virtues of such a projection, under current conditions its modification is a basic premise for economic takeoff, even if it means ethical-ideological discrepancies. The Cuban economic-financial situation was widely discussed in late December by the parliament, which decided to meet again in a special session early this year to study the possibility of implementing measures aimed at solving the crisis and preserving the conquests of socialism.
