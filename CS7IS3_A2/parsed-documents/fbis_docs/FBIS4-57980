He also denied Argentine reports of an alleged "territorial barter deal." The minister emphatically denied Buenos Aires press reports that Argentina had assured for itself a favorable decision in the dispute, and that in compensation Chile would be granted some territories in the continental glacier zone, which is also under dispute. "The two areas are being considered in an absolutely independent manner, and there is no link whatsoever between the conversations or negotiations over the arbitration in Laguna del Desierto and the treaty that was proposed for the continental glacier zone," Figueroa said. "We are very calm and very confident in the defense Chile has made of its interests before the international tribunal, and what we will do now is wait for the decision," the minister added. He said that the decision on Laguna del Desierto is unlikely to be made before the end of the year. He reiterated that Chile and Argentina have no pending border problems, recalling that in October 1991 the presidents of the two nations resolved 22 of the 24 border disputes. On that occasion, only the Laguna del Desierto dispute was left unresolved, and it was decided to submit the matter to arbitration, while a solution -- which must be ratified by Congress in the two countries -- was reached for the continental glacier zone. He added that the Peace and Friendship Treaty that the two countries signed in 1984 has mechanisms for finding consensus solutions through juridical channels for any difficulty that may appear during the ongoing border negotiations. Figueroa reiterated that Chile had made "a very good defense" before the international tribunal, which is headed by Colombian jurist Rafael Nieto and includes four other Latin American jurists. The disputed territory in Laguna del Desierto covers a bit more than 500 square kilometers between parallel 62 south [as received] and Mt. Fitz Roy. Minister Figueroa also announced that on 8 June he will travel to Argentina to start negotiations in search for a formula for a partnership with the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) countries.
