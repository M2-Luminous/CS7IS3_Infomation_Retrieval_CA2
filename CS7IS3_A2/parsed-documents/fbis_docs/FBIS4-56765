During an informal meeting with Caribbean, Pacific, Mediterranean, and Atlantic NGO representatives at the Sherbourne Center in Bridgetown, Castro said these organizations did know about environmental policy and many other fields. "Perhaps roles will be switched one day; perhaps the NGO's will organize a world conference, and the presidents will hold like forums," Castro said to the audience's delight. At the beginning of the dialogue, Caribbean NGO Coordinator Joan French cited the support for Cuba during the recently concluded forum these organizations held. On that occasion, they issued a resolution to defend the Cuban people's right to choose their own development model and to condemn the U.S. Government for the economic and financial blockade against the island. Castro appreciated the expressions of support and solidarity and said "we need to change the negative atmosphere the United States has created around us with the blockade, which is causing us serious supply problems in the areas of food, medicine, and many other products that are fundamental for our development." In this regard, he said, your support fills us with enthusiasm because we not only need physical strength, but also moral strength. "Many people have approached us to tell us marvelous things about the Cuban revolution, Che Guevara, things that demonstrate a spirit of justice, freedom, and dignity that are present in many delegations to this island conference." Castro drew a great round of applause when he said: "I feel as if I am among friends, among brothers. That is why I will be leaving this country and conference with great joy." During the discussion of another topic of the informal meeting, the Cuban leader joked about speculations regarding his health, speculations that appeared today in the local media and which journalists from a Miami television station who traveled to Bridgetown last night insisted on asking him. "They are constantly asking me about my health, if I sat down before or after the speech delivered during the plenary session. Actually, I can no longer do the things I did during the days of Sierra Maestra, but I still walk around much and swim for several hours," Castro said. In his final statements, the Cuban head of state talked about the importance of the meeting to draft an action strategy to allow for the defense of the islands from the serious problems threatening them, such as pollution, radioactive wastes, and climate changes. Castro will meet with the 15 other heads of state present here at a round table behind closed doors this afternoon to discuss the latest version of the Barbados Declaration and the action program that will be the basis of this world conference. The meeting began in the capital of Barbados on 25 April with the attendance of delegations from 21 countries, which are members of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS).
