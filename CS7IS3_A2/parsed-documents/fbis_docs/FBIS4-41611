[Ryshenko] That would suit the Russians very well. The Crimea belongs to Ukraine. Our countrymen live there. We will defend them with weapons, if necessary. [DIE WOCHE] Ukrainian and Russian warships are berthed in the same harbor at Sevastopol. Is a conflict not inevitable there? [Ryshenko] The Russians want to force us out of Sevastopol. We are prepared for any provocation, for they know that as long as our fleet and soldiers are stationed in the Crimea, we will not permit an annexation to Russia. [DIE WOCHE] The division of the Black Sea Fleet has been a subject of negotiations for two years. Does this fleet still have any strategic significance? [Ryshenko] The fleet is outdated, its fighting power exists only on paper. [DIE WOCHE] Then why does Ukraine not want to give up its share of the fleet? [Ryshenko] Ukraine would do so immediately provided that the Black Sea Fleet left the Crimea. But the Russians will not hear of it. [DIE WOCHE] Will the Fleet support the Crimean separatists in an emergency? [Ryshenko] The commanders are doing what they want. They do not even obey Moscow. But I hope things will not get that far. And even if they do, we have enough strength in the Crimea to control any such mutiny. [DIE WOCHE] The Russian commanders are warning against provocation. A clinic is supposed to have been stormed by Ukrainian special units. [Ryshenko] Those are all lies. Why should we do anything like that? Everything in the Crimea belongs to Ukraine. It is the Black Sea Fleet that is stealing Ukrainian property. [DIE WOCHE] What do you mean? [Ryshenko] Many officers are engaged in business deals. Lubricants, spare parts, and maritime electronic equipment are being stolen from the bases. Vessels of the Black Sea Fleet are just like freighters that are transporting goods. They ignore Ukrainian customs and tax laws. [DIE WOCHE] Is there any proof of that? [Ryshenko] In April, the ship Tshelekyen left Odessa harbor without permission. It had smuggled goods on board. Should anyone ever try that again, we will torpedo the ship. [DIE WOCHE] Is Kiev not heating up the situation in the Crimea unnecessarily? [Ryshenko] There is no Republic of Crimea. The Crimea is a part of Ukraine. It was a great mistake to give the Crimea special status in 1992. Now the tension is increasing every day. The Black Sea fleet and the so-called Crimean president are to blame for that.
