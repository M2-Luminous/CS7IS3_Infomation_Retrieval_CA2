Jiang Zemin, who is also the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, made the call here today when he visited Guangdong deputies to the National People's Congress, whose second session concluded this afternoon. The general task of "seizing development opportunities, deepening reform, opening wider to the rest of the world, promoting development, and maintaining stability" is in conformity with the objective of "striving for a sustained, rapid and healthy" economic development, Jiang said. "The key to its success lies in a correct handling of relations between reform, development and stability," he said, adding this is the "basic spirit" of the general task. Jiang also stressed the importance of improving economic and social management. "All party and government officials should learn managerial knowledge, improve management systems and raise management levels," he said. "This is an important condition for economic development and social stability." Guangdong Province bordering on Hong Kong and Macao, Jiang said, is the earliest to open to the outside world and relatively more developed economically. It has created some important experience in developing a socialist market economy. He expressed the hope that Guangdong would take advantage of its good conditions to make greater contributions to the fulfillment of the general task set for the nation by the central authorities.
