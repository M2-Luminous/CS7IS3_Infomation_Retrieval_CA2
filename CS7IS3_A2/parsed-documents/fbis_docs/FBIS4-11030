The banker indicated that the increase in the U.S. interest rate is going to cause an increase in the interest rates on deposits, and "this is an incentive to save, something that is not bad." "It is bad when the active rates on loans increase," he said, and explained that monetary authorities are studying "how this incentive on the passive rate will favor savings." The measure the Central Bank has under study is a decrease in the spread [preceding word in English], in other words, banking costs, "so the active interest rate will remain where it is."
