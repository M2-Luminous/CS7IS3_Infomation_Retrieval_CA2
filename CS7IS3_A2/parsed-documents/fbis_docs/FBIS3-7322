The study body, attached to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, will file an interim report later this month calling for a redesign of the local networks under the "Neo Teletopia Project." Under an upgraded version of the 1983 "Teletopia Project," all local areas will eventually be integrated into a nationwide network. The Telecommunications Council, an advisory panel to the posts minister, has discussed the development of an optical fiber information network, officials said. The Neo Teletopia Project is preparing for Japan's next- generation telecommunications network in the age of multimedia, which will require vast data-processing resources. Under the current Teletopia Project, local governments receive financial aid to improve their telecommunications systems if deemed necessary. So far, Okinawa Prefecture and 287 cities, villages, wards and towns have received such support from the central government.
