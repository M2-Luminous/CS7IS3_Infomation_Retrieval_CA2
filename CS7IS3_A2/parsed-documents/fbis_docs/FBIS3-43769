They are presently at the Dondo Military Training Center in Sofala Province. Our correspondent Matias dos Amores reports. The 540 military instructors will train soldiers selected from the government and Renamo armies to form units of the new Mozambique armed forces, within the framework of the peace process in the country. The Mozambican instructors who travelled to Mozambique by road in UN vehicles, left the Nyanga Military Training Center in Zimbabwe at 0730 [0530] yesterday and arrived at the Dondo Military Training Center at around 1800. They were received by Lieutenant Generals Tobias Dai and Mateus Ngonyamo, heads of the government and Renamo delegations to the Joint Commission for the Formation of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [CCFADM], respectively. Lt. Gen. Tobias Dai said that with the end of the military training course, part of the General Peace Accord has been implemented. [Begin Dai recording] Dear Mozambican finalists who have just concluded a military training course in Zimbabwe, on behalf of the Mozambican government and as head of the government delegation to the CCFADM, I would like, first of all, to thank the people who have come here, some from very far, to witness the arrival of Mozambican finalists from the Republic of Zimbabwe where they were being trained by British and Zimbabwean instructors. They have been here since this morning to see their brothers who have just returned to the fatherland. To you finalists, we say welcome to the fatherland, welcome to the Republic of Mozambique. We say welcome in particular to the Dondo Military Training Center which is the point of departure for you to begin carrying out your tasks. [end recording] Renamo's Lt. Gen. Mateus Ngonyamo said the presence of government and Renamo troops in Dondo, after concluding their military instruction course, marks the true steps toward national reconciliation. [Begin Ngonyamo recording] For me, I view your arrival, as an implementation of the objectives of peace and reconciliation. As you can see, it is difficult to know who is the former soldier of the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] and who is the former Renamo soldier. Here, we see a unit of military instructors of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces. This is the foundation of our new army. We cannot have good units with good soldiers, without good military instructors. [end recording] Mateus Ngonyamo called on Mozambican politicians to follow the example of the soldiers in the process of national reconciliation, having guaranteed that despite [words indistinct] politicians, the Angolan situation will not be repeated in our country.
