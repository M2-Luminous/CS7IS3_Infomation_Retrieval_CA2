An International Expert from Frankfurt Inspects CIS Nuclear Power Stations"] [Text] Even tragedies can turn into farce, apparently. A year or so ago information was published on the extremely poor fire protection at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station. You might expect, after everything that had happened, that the station would be properly protected against fire. A year ago, when Doctor Achilles delivered his report at an international symposium, he showed some slides: Rusty hydrants, which would be hard to operate when trying to get water into the hoses in the event of a fire; emergency exists clogged up with garbage; failure to observe the rules for dividing the station area into sections that can be sealed off, with special fireproof doors.... According to the international rules, Doctor Achilles said, the buildings must have a fireproof partition with a special door every 60 meters. But at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station this year, as last, you can cover 200 meters and not encounter a partition. This means that, if a calamity were to occur, the fire would spread like lightning, without hindrance. The fire protection system has not been put into shape in the year since the first inspection at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station. How many years now has a vast multitude of people been enduring the consequences of the Chernobyl accident -- a massive accident with massive consequences. As the oncologists predicted, there continue to be more and more cases of thyroid cancer among children exposed to radiation. People from various countries are pooling resources and efforts (the new child cancer experts' seminar that has just been held in Minsk was an example of this) to devise a treatment strategy, indeed to provide basic drugs and equipment for sick children. I do not have to remind you that it is all very expensive. According to the experts, the personnel responsible for fire protection at the Chernobyl station are military people without special training, and there are only 14 of them. There are four on duty at night and two by day -- in the enormous station building. Many of the instruments that are intended to warn of the danger of a fire are in locked closets and are not freely accessible. Instead of special fireproof doors you have conventional doors, which would rapidly melt in a big fire, and in some cases simple wooden doors. The EC is allocating funds to plug these gaps, although the money has not been received yet. But what money do you need to provide free access to instruments and clear away garbage blocking emergency exits? Electricity produced by the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station goes to Austria, and the station is making good money. But it remains an open question why, here and at other nuclear power stations, notably Zaporozhye (also visited by an international commission recently), they have virtually the same, forgive me for saying so, fire condition red. If the technical impotence and nihilism of the station personnel are cause for amazement, then Doctor Achilles himself is a source of equally strong emotion. Do you think he stamped his feet and hollered "I'm leaving"? Not a bit of it. He is quite determined to effect positive changes in the mental outlook of our engineers and technicians -- a truly Herculean task. Without making a song and dance, doggedly and systematically, Achilles is getting through and securing a willingness to cooperate. It is to be hoped that the impetus is converted into positive change before, God forbid, fire breaks out again owing to faulty wiring, negligence, or whatever.
