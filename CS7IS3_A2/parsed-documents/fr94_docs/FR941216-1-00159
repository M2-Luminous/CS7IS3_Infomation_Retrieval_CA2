The distance to be maintained between any two operating buildings and sites within an operating line, at least one of which contains or is designed to contain explosives. Launch pads . The load-bearing base, apron, or platform upon which the rocket, missile, or space vehicle and its launcher are positioned. Liquid propellant(s) . Liquid and gaseous substances (fuels, oxidizers, or monopropellants) used for propulsion or operation of missiles, rockets, and related devices (see Appendix A to Subpart G of this part). Loading docks . Facilities structure, or paved areas, designed and installed for transferring ammunition and explosives. Lunchrooms .

A breakroom in an operating building may be used by personnel assigned to the PES to eat meals. Magazine . Any building or structure, except an operating building, used for the storage of ammunition and explosives. The types and general specifications of various magazines for ammunition and explosives follow: (1) Reinforced concrete, arch-type, earth-covered magazines whose construction is at least equivalent in strength to the requirements of The Office of Chief of Engineers (OCE), Department of the Army, drawings 652&hyph;686 through 652&hyph;693, December 27, 1941, as revised March 14, 1942, 33&hyph;15&hyph;06, 33&hyph;15&hyph;58 (atomic blast resistant), 33&hyph;15&hyph;61, and 33&hyph;15&hyph;74. For new construction use drawings 35&hyph;15&hyph;74. 22 22 Copies available from U.S. Army, Chief of Engineers, Pulaski Building, 20 Massachusetts Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20001. (2) Magazines constructed according to Navy drawings 357428 through 357430, August 19, 1944, and modified in accordance with NAVFAC drawing 626739, March 19, 1954; and NAVFAC drawings 627954 through 627957, 764597, 658384 through 658388, 724368, 751861, 764596, 793746, and 793747. 23 23 Copies available from Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332&hyph;2300. (3) Box-type A magazines constructed according to NAVFAC drawings 1404000 through 1404007; box-type B magazines constructed according to NAVFAC drawings 1404018 through 1404025; box-type C magazines constructed according to NAVFAC drawings 1404430 through 1404440, dated 20 September 1985; box-type D magazines constructed according to NAVFAC drawings 1404464 through 1404478, dated 20 September 1985; box-type E magazines constructed according to NAVFAC drawings 1404523 through 1404535, dated 23 April 1987; and box-type F magazines constructed according to NAVFAC drawings 1404541 through 1404555, dated 23 April 1987. (4) Earth-covered, corrugated steel, arch-type magazines at least equivalent in strength to those shown on Army OCE drawings numbered AW 33&hyph;15&hyph;63, March 5, 1963; AW 33&hyph;15&hyph;64, May 10, 1963; 33&hyph;15&hyph;65, January 10, 1963; and NAVFAC drawings numbered 1059128&hyph;30, 1059132, 1069906, and 1355460&hyph;61. OCE 33&hyph;15&hyph;73 (oval 1 -ga steel arch) is no longer approved for new construction; however, existing magazines are considered ``standard.'' For new construction of large magazines of this type use the earth-covered steel, semi-circular-arch magazine design shown on Army OCE drawing number 421&hyph;80&hyph;01, and for new construction of smaller magazines of this type use OCE drawing number AW 33&hyph;15&hyph;65 addressed above. Mass detonating explosives . High explosives, black powder, certain propellants, certain pyrotechnics, and other similar explosives, alone or in combination, or loaded into various types of ammunition or containers, most of which can be expected to explode virtually instantaneously when a small portion is subject to fire, to severe concussion or impact, to the impulse of an initiating agent, or to the effect of a considerable discharge of energy from without. Such an explosive will normally cause severe structural damage to adjacent objects. Explosive propagation may occur immediately to other items of ammunition and explosives stored sufficiently close to and not adequately protected from the initially exploding pile with a time interval short enough so that two or more quantities shall be considered as one for quantity-distance (Q/D) purposes. Maximum credible event (MCE) . In hazards evaluation, the MCE from a hypothesized accidental explosion, fire, or agent release is the worst single event that is likely to occur from a given quantity and disposition of ammunition and explosives. Event shall be realistic with a reasonable probability of occurrence, considering the explosion propagation, burning rate characteristics, and physical protection given to the items involved. The MCE evaluated on this basis may then be used as a basis for effects calculations and casualty predictions. Military pyrotechnics . Ammunition manufactured specifically for use as signals, illuminants, and like items.
