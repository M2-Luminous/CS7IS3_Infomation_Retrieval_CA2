Mayors Yuriy Luzhkov and Anatoliy Sobchak could meet on the screens of monitors defying the distance of 675 km between them. This unusual video link-up took place simultaneously in the capital and the town on the Neva. It crowned the efforts of three firms -- "Metrokom," "Raskom," and "Makomnet" -- established in Russia by "Andrew Corporation," a U.S. company which is a world leader in telecommunications. On the Russian side, the partners were the subways of both towns, the October [Oktyabrskaya] railway, and the "High-Speed Tracks" joint-stock company. The video equipment used for this special news conference was connected to the sections of the optic fiber network laid down in subway tunnels in each town and along the entire October railway. The technology transmits simultaneously huge volumes of audio, video, and computerized data both within the country and to international communications satellites. [passage omitted]
