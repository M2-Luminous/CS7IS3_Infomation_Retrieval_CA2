In an article published today, the paper calls it a qualitative shift and positive step indicative of a growing sober, understanding, and fair approach uninfluenced by an antagonistic United States out to manipulate the commission's work and steer it away from its declared goals. The progress the commission will report will be a virtual certificate that the international community is increasingly showing an understanding of Iraq's cooperation vis-a-vis Resolutions 686 and 715. The paper applauds the constructive and fair stands of France, Russia, the PRC, and Brazil during the council's debate at which the the four countries departed from the U.S. position calling for dragging the sanctions out. This positive development at the Security Council would not have been possible had it not been for Saddam Husayn's letter of facts, carried to the council by the Iraqi delegation. Credit must also go to Iraq's proven capacity for steadfastness and tenacity. This appreciable change at the council clearly shows a conflict of interests between these states and Washington, which tries to commandeer and monopolize decision making for its own ends. It is also the result of Iraq standing up for its legitimate rights and its valiant resistance to all pressure and blackmail, AL-THAWRAH concludes.
