This phrase is suitable to describe the outcome of the prime minister's visit to the United States. Anyone who expected miracles was probably not satisfied. The "uncle from America" cannot do miracles any more. And if he could, he would do them for himself... [punctuation as published] So, was this a customary visit? Or better, an acquaintance meeting for one to find out the language that the other speaks? There is, however, one question: If we assume that we know the language that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou speaks, then what language does the U.S. President speak? Lately, the U.S. press is full of analyses signed by the "elite" of U.S. journalism on Bill Clinton's inconsistent foreign policy. The examples are several: Haiti, Somalia, North Korea, and surely Bosnia-Herzegovina. What accusations do the top U.S. journalists make against the U.S. President? That he has no foreign policy and that he makes his choices based on public opinion polls. As a result, the only remaining superpower is being continuously exposed. The Greek prime minister's visit to Washington was held within this unstable atmosphere. Therefore, we must not be surprised that it did not achieve any specific results. This does not mean that anyone can blame the prime minister for paying an official visit to Washington. At the same time, we must wonder which acts or omissions were made at a foreign policy level so that this "transition" to better relations would become possible. A country like ours, that geographically belongs to a sensitive and unstable region, does not have the luxury to reject alliances. Good relations with the United States, the great European countries, and Russia are useful. This is one issue. The more substantive one is on which axes, other than circumstantial alliances, a country like Greece must base its foreign policy. It could be said that this issue has been solved because the axes on which the Greek foreign policy moves are already established: the Atlantic Alliance and the European Union [EU]. We know very well that things are not so simple after the end of the Cold War. In the past three years Greece has faced problems that its partners and allies have not faced, at least directly. This has led to some misunderstandings that have isolated Greece (let us not forget the country's reference to the European Court). So, the question is what would be the best way to get out of isolation? The current government chose to cultivate privileged relations with the United States to overcome some of its problems with the EU. There would be nothing reprehensible in this if the United States had a similar desire. However, this was not seen during Papandreou's visit to Washington. It is reasonable to assume that the United States would have wanted such relations if Greece played some important role in the Balkans. But today, when Greece has burned almost all of its bridges, what would be the substance of privileged relations? The United States has no need to mediate in countries such as Albania, Bulgaria, and Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. It has direct access. In the former Yugoslavia, the United States is playing with the large European countries. What services can Greece offer the United States when it is isolated in the EU? If we had some role to play in the Balkans--and we certainly had--it would have depended on a strong position in the EU. Then maybe we could have taken advantage of the competition that often characterizes the relations of the United States with some European countries. But what about today? Today our relations with the community are ruined and our hopes of "privileged" relations with the United States are futile. To whom shall we send the bill?
