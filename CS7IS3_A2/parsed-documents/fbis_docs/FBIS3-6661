It says: Though the criminal drafting of "comfort women" was committed long ago, it is not a problem of the past but of today because the truth of the crime and its culprits have been confirmed in recent years. Japan must honestly admit this crime, apologize for it and make compensations. The Japanese authorities are evading the responsibility under the international law and ridiculously argue that the demand of the victims for compensations has already been settled through bilateral and multilateral agreements. The international law defining war crimes and "crimes against humanity" demands compensations to the victims and punishment of those responsible. It is a crafty ruse to dodge punishment at any cost for Japan to persist in its attempt to evade the responsibility under the international law. The Japanese Government has no legal right to rescind the human rights of an individual. The demand for a compensation is a right of the victims whose human rights were abused. The Japanese authorities are nowadays even foolishly claiming it is impossible to verify that the victims demanding compensations were really "comfort women". This reveals their moral inferiority. They are lost to elementary human conscience and morality. If those responsible are not punished, Japan must be brought to the international court. The Japanese authorities must admit at an earlier date the responsibility under the international law for the crime of Japan in drafting "comfort women for the Army" and seek its solution.
