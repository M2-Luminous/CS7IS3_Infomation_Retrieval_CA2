Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary, told INTERFAX that Yeltsin had listened to Ella Pamfilova's reasons for resigning and found them convincing. But Boris Nikolayevich voiced the hope that Pamfilova would not abandon the social sphere and would continue to tackle the problem as a deputy in the State Duma. Ella Pamfilova has already, as INTERFAX recalls, tendered her resignation twice this year, following the the departure from the government of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov.
