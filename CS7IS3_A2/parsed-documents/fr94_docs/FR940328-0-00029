FR940328-0-00029 FR940328-0-00012 Historically, Lobelia oahuensis was known from Kahana Ridge, Kipapa Gulch, and the southeastern Koolau Mountains of Oahu (HHP 1991g1, 1991g4 to 1991g7; St. John and Hosaka 1935). Nine populations totalling between 100 and 200 individuals are located on private and State land or on the boundary of private, State, City and County, and Federal lands. Lobelia oahuensis grows on steep slopes along Koolau Mountain ridgetops from Waikane and Halawa to Mount Olympus and the summit ridges above Kuliouou and Waimanalo, a distance of about 17 mi (27 km) (HHP 1991g1 to 1991g3, 1991g6, 1991g8 to 1991g10; HPCC 1991d; J. Obata and S. Perlman, pers. comms., 1991). Ken Wood of HPCC and Joel Lau of TNCH recently discovered a single mature individual of L. oahuensis on the boundary between State land and Schofield Barracks Military Reservation, extending the distribution of this species to the Waianae Mountain Range of Oahu (J. Lau and Kenneth Wood, HPCC, pers. comms., 1993). These nine populations are located between elevations of 2,800 and 3,000 ft (850 and 920 m) on summit cliffs in cloudswept wet forests or in areas of low shrub cover that are frequently exposed to heavy wind and rain (HHP 1991g1 to 1991g3, 1991g6 to 1991g10; HPCC 1991d; Lammers 1990). Associated plant taxa include 'ohi'a, uluhe, 'uki, Cheirodendron trigynum (olapa), Dubautia laxa (na'ena'e pua melemele), and Labordia hosakana (kamakahala) (HHP 1991g1, 1991g2, 1991g7, 1991g8, 1991g10; HPCC 1991d; J. Obata, pers. comm., 1991). The noxious alien plant Koster's curse is the primary threat to Lobelia oahuensis because it effectively competes with this species for water, space, light, and nutrients. Lycopodium nutans was described by William D. Brackenridge in 1854 from a specimen collected from the ``high mountains'' of Oahu by Charles Wilkes, commander of the U.S. Exploring Expedition of 1840 on which Brackenridge was the horticulturist (Ollgaard 1989). The specific epithet is probably in reference to the species' ``nodding'' or pendant spikes. Other names by which this species has been known include Huperzia nutans , Lycopodium phyllanthus var. nutans , and Urostachys nutans , which are not accepted by current authorities (Ollgaard 1989). Lycopodium nutans is an erect or pendulous herbaceous epiphyte (plant growing above ground on other plants) of the clubmoss family (Lycopodiaceae). Its stiff, light green branches, 10 to 16 in (25 to 40 cm) long and about 0.2 in (6 mm) thick, are covered with stiff, flat, leathery leaves, 0.5 to 0.6 in (12 to 16 mm) long and about 0.1 in (2.5 mm) wide that overlap at acute angles. The leaves are arranged in six rows and arise directly from the branches. The branches end in thick, 2.8 to 5.1 in (7 to 13 cm) long fruiting spikes that are unbranched or branch once or twice, and taper toward a downward-curving tip. Bracts on the fruiting spikes, between 0.1 and 0.2 in (3 to 5 mm) long, are densely layered and conceal the spore capsules. This species can be distinguished from others of the genus in Hawaii by its epiphytic habit, simple or forking fruiting spikes, and larger and stiffer leaves (Degener 1934, Hillebrand 1888, Wagner and Wagner 1987). Historically, Lycopodium nutans was known from the island of Kauai and from scattered locations in the Koolau Mountains of Oahu bounded by Kaluanui Valley to the north, Paalaa to the west, and Mount Tantalus to the south (HHP 1991h1 to 1991h9; Skottsberg 1936). This species is now known from only two sites within its historical range: Kaluanui Valley; and along Waikane-Schofield Trail on Oahu. One population, located on State land, was described as ``scarce'' when last observed in 1965 (HHP 1991h3). The other population, located about 5 mi (8 km) away on the boundary of State (Ewa Forest Reserve) and Federal lands (Schofield Barracks Military Reservation), grew in ``several places'' according to its collector in 1961 (HHP 1991h4).
