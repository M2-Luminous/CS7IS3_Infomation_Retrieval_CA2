Cabotaje] [Text] The country is not totally unprepared for a more liberal trade environment under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito said that the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) has made initial moves with Congress to amend the necessary laws to concur with the principles of the Gatt accord. Gatt members, for instance, will have to rewrite or enact national laws that will protect patents, trademarks, copyrights, industrial designs and trade secrets. "We are all for the Gatt. The president has given us instructions to do the necessary consultations and communications on the impact of the Gatt," he told the INQUIRER. Senate Minority Leader Wigberto Tanada earlier expressed alarm over the "state of unpreparedness" of the country in light of a new trade order under the Gatt. "I have not seen any organized program, written or un-written, on how the country can take advantage of the so-called liberalization of the global economic order under Gatt," he said in a privilege speech. Meantime, the Pambansang Ugnayan ng Mamamayan Laban sa Gatt [National Association of Citizens Against Gatt] (Pumalag), an anti-Gatt coalition of 12 agricultural sector organizations, continued to lobby against the ratification of the accord. "Third World countries are neither technologically nor financially equipped to benefit from competing head-on with their foreign counterparts," the coalition said in a position paper. Citing an Asian Development Bank report, the coalition pointed out that the country is bound to gain a minimal 0.5 percent increase in trade under the Gatt. The Gatt accord, signed 15 April Marrakech, Morocco, calls for the cutting of tariffs on industrial products by an average of more than one-third. Domestic and export subsidies given to agricultural goods will also have to be reduced. Phasing in of these commitments will be over five to 10 years starting 1 July next year. Aside from the Gatt, the Philippines is also set to overhaul its tariff system to meet the requirements of the Asean Free Trade Agreement (Afta). A number of industries already raised concern about the possible impact of a liberalized trade among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. They noted that the country had already reduced a number of tariff lines on several import products upon the proddings of its major creditors.
