AL-SHA'B said nine militants of the outlawed al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group, IG] group, currently on trial in a military court, planted explosives at Sidi Barrani airport near the Libyan border and at Mubarak's residence at the town's military base. They planned to detonate them during a visit by Mubarak, who holds regular meetings with Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at the base. AL-SHA'B said the trial of the nine accused began in secret at the Sidi Barrani military court on January 30. The plot was uncovered when an al-Jama'ah militant was arrested in a raid in the southern suburbs of Cairo on January 19. The militant, who was wounded in the raid, made a full confession in hospital under the influence of drugs, the paper said. It is the second assassination plot against Mubarak to be revealed by the opposition press in Egypt. In October two militants, among a group of 19 who planned to kill the Egyptian leader, were sentenced to death by the Alexandria high military court. [passage omitted]
