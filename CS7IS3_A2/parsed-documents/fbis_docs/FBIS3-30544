Senada Cemurovic reports. [Cemurovic] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, addressed a large number of domestic and foreign journalists. Several tens were killed and an enormous number injured, although the final toll is not yet known, by a Chetnik shell that landed at about 1230 on Sarajevo's busiest market, Markale. The Presidency has already held an extraordinary session. The Executive Committee of the city of Sarajevo, which also met, decided to declare 6 February as a day of mourning. [Unidentified correspondent] Ladies and gentlemen, according to the latest report of the Bosnia-Herzegovina press agency 49 people were killed and 140 wounded killed by a 120-mm mortar shell fired from the direction of either Mrkovici or Poljine. The mortar shell was recently made and had not been painted yet. That is one report. As you may already know President Izetbegovic has ordered our state delegation to withdraw from the negotiations at Sarajevo airport in the light of what has happened. I would now like to ask President Izetbegovic to comment on this crime. [Izetbegovic] First of all, my deepest condolences to the families of the victims. This is a black and horrible day for the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have decided to withdraw from the talks at the airport. We have decided to hold an emergency session of the Presidency, a joint session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and government, to examine the justification of our presence at further talks in Geneva. We are preparing a very brief letter to 30 or 40 statesmen of these countries to inform them of what [happened] in Sarajevo today. It will be a brief letter in which we will say that we feel as if we have been condemned to death. We will demand that the right to defend ourselves -- that was taken away from us -- be granted back. We will let them know that all those who are depriving us of this natural right to self- defense -- contained in Article 41 of the UN Charter -- will be considered as accomplices in this crime. Prime Minister Silajdzic and I are now at your disposal to answer your questions. [Correspondent] I would like to ask Prime Minister Silajdzic -- who was at the airport at the time with representatives of the Serb aggressor side -- how that side reacted to the largest massacre in Sarajevo so far. [Silajdzic] As always, they have rejected any responsibility for this attack in Sarajevo. [Izetbegovic] I should add here that I saw an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] document today that unambiguously confirms that the shell that killed those people -- two children among them, if you recall -- in Dobrinja yesterday, had been fired from Serb positions. This was a classified report to their superiors. [Correspondent] What do you expect from UNPROFOR as a result of this? [Izetbegovic] We do not need confirmation as to where the shell had come from but nevertheless, they will investigate into this. We want them to tell the world about what happened today, to present their view to the world. It has become common practice for the Serbs to claim, whenever a heinous crime like this is committed, that we are killing ourselves -- [Nikola] Koljevic, [republic of Srpska vice president] said this about Dobrinja. If I get killed some day they will claim it was a suicide. [Izetbegovic's spokeswoman] We are receiving information from moment to moment. The figure we gave you -- 49 dead -- is unfortunately, not final. However, it was confirmed that the mortar shell came from Mrkovici. [Correspondent] Do you think there is any special significance in the fact that these two incidents happened in two successive days in the week before the beginning of the Geneva talks? [Izetbegovic] We are wondering whether they wish to goad us into making the wrong move. The first emotional response would be to refuse to take part in any negotiations. However, I believe we will not make such a wrong move, we will most probably go to the talks. Of course, the final decision will be made at the joint government and Presidency session, but I believe we should keep a cool head and think rationally about what we should do next. [Correspondent] When will this joint session take place? [Izetbegovic] At 1800 today. Are there any more questions? Thank you.
