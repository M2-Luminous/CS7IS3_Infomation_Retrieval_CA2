This was stated by Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis at Larnaca Airport upon his return from Paris, where he participated in the conference for stability in Europe. Mikhailidhis added that tomorrow's meeting with the Greek foreign minister is considered necessary due to the developments in the Cyprus issue. During the meeting, he said, we will exchange views and information and discuss the National Council's visit to Athens. Mikhailidhis accused Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf Denktas of delaying tactics on the Cyprus issue and added that, with his stance, Denktas is trying to cause confusion in an attempt to avoid finally being blamed for the failure to implement the confidence-building measures. The foreign minister repeated that the Greek Cypriot side accepts the 21 March document as the final text, and warned that our side will not participate in any discussion to change it. On the sidelines of the Paris conference, the foreign minister met with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and U.S. Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff, with whom he said he had an interesting talk. Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis also announced that Greece and Cyprus have finalized a series of demands that will be put forth at the European Union summit that will be held on Corfu. These demands aim at promoting Cyprus' application to join the European Union. Mikhailidhis discussed the whole issue with Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos behind the scenes at the Paris conference. Our goal on Corfu, Mikhailidhis said, is to take another step toward setting a date for the beginning of accession talks.
