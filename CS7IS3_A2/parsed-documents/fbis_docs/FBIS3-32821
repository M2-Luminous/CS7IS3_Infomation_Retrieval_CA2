Representatives of the Ecuadoran, Guatemalan, Honduran, Panamanian, and Mexican governments a few days ago presented to Rene Speicken, European agriculture commissioner, a Latin American proposal to abolish the current license system and establish a higher tariff without allocation to countries for non-EU suppliers. [sentence as heard] The European Union had labeled as unrealistic the new proposal presented by several Latin American countries on the system to export bananas to the EU market. Jose Vicente Maldonado, Ecuadoran industries and commerce minister, has said labeling the proposal as unrealistic is equivalent to labeling as unrealistic the commercial opening and economic globalization processes that have originated in the European Community. The European Union today announced the withdrawal of its most recent proposal on banana imports due to the five Latin American countries that had filed a lawsuit at GATT; only Colombia and Costa Rica had accepted the proposal. According to a report from Santa Fe de Bogota, the Colombian banana industry on Friday considered the possibility of joining forces with Guatemala to file a third recourse at GATT against the EU's banana-importing system. Juan Diego Velez, president of the Association of Uraba Banana Producers, has said this possibility will have to be studied, because the Colombian banana market's situation is unfavorable. According to Velez, Colombian banana producers have already lost approximately $32 million since the EU changed the terms for importing bananas.
