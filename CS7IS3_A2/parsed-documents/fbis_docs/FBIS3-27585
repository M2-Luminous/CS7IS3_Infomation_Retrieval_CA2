Measures include persuading all Hong Kong-based red-chip conglomerates to relocate their headquarters to Shanghai, opening doors to foreign brokerages and rating agencies and setting up various specialist short-term fund markets. Shanghai, which outshone Hong Kong in the 1940s, has long been talking about regaining its past glory. But this is the first time that the city has come up with concrete measures to match its words. And it has enlisted an important ally in the People's Bank of China. The country's central bank had urged the government, in a comprehensive report, to allow Shanghai to realise its dream by the year 2010, the Beijing-backed HUANAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL reported yesterday. The newspaper did not say how the government had responded to the report. According to the People's Bank report, Shanghai would try to persuade the Hong Kong- and Beijing-based China Merchant Group, China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC), China Everbright Group, Bank of China and others to relocate to the city. It would also try to get all the new national financial institutions to set up bases in the city, and the People's Bank would like to station a deputy governor permanently in Shanghai. In an attempt to link-up with international financial markets, the city would allow foreign brokers or joint-venture brokerages into the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Two international rating agencies, possibly Moody's and Standard & Poor's, would be allowed in to assess Chinese companies for domestic and international listings. The city would soon abolish restrictions to allow free trade in A and B shares. At present A shares are traded solely by domestic shareholders while foreign investors can only trade B shares. Shanghai would step up efforts to attract foreign banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, and broaden its business scope. Foreign banks have been lobbying for the right to accept yuan deposits from mainlanders, whose savings in Chinese banks total 1.4 trillion yuan (about HK$1.243 trillion). The city plans to set up several specialist short-term fund markets in the hope of linking with other international financial markets. These include markets for commercial notes, inter-bank borrowing, short-term loans, bank discounts, one-year Chinese state-treasury bonds, Euro money and international currencies. The Shanghai bourse plans to expand its issues of new stocks and bonds in a bid to increase its market turnover to 65 percent of national volume by the end of next year. In the short term, it plans to increase its membership to 800, with 3,000 trading seats. To attract foreign investors, the city would introduce more financial instruments such as foreign-currency and interest-rate options, share buy-back arrangements, convertible bonds, mutual funds and loan securitisation. A report in the Beijing-controlled Hong Kong newspaper, TA KUNG PAO, said yesterday that about six international companies, including Mercedes-Benz, were still negotiating for secondary listings in Shanghai, and a breakthrough was expected this year. The report said the Shanghai exchange was negotiating to buy a telecommunications satellite.
