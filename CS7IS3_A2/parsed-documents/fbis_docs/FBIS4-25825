Data gathered in this respect shows that various localities have generally increased their input in education to solve the shortage of educational funds. In addition to ensuring that educational funds will increase along with economic growth and increases in financial revenue, Guangdong Province has, since last year, collected 1 percent of the annual income derived from secondary and tertiary industries as special funds for educational development, and raised funds in society through various channels to support education. Last year, the province's total input in education was 9.462 billion yuan, up 61.8 percent from the previous year, while educational expenses rose by 38 percent from the year before. Input in education by Beijing Municipality hit an all-time high last year, with total input reaching 2.035 billion yuan. Input in education covered by the municipal budget accounted for more than 20 percent of the total budgetary expenditure for five consecutive years, while expenses for promoting universal education rose by an average annual rate of 14.9 percent for eight years in a row. Besides increasing its budgeted educational funds by 20.9 percent, Jilin Province last year set up special funds for universalizing nine-year compulsory education, for establishing major colleges and universities, and for introducing major disciplines, and promulgated 10 policies on raising educational funds. Last year, Yunnan Province allocated 360 million yuan for education, an increase of more than 150 million yuan from 1992. While ensuring increases in educational funds in two areas, Tianjin Municipality last year established an educational development fund and decided to set up a Tianjin University Scientific and Technological Industrial Zone and use the returns generated by it to supplement educational funds. Last year's input in education by Hainan Province was the highest since the island was designated a province, with educational expenses increasing by 26.8 percent from 466 million yuan in 1992 to 591 million yuan. Last year, Qinghai Province also unveiled 13 measures designed to ensure steady growth in education-related input. Meanwhile, party and government leaders in all localities intensified their efforts to help teachers as they worked hard to increase teachers' pay and did practical turns for teachers. Last year, Jilin Province decided to pay special government allowances to 15 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and one foreign academician who worked in the province, as well as 214 tutors for doctoral candidates. Liaoning's Dalian City invested more than 200 million yuan to build a "teachers' apartment building," thus enabling more than 1,300 teacher families to move into new houses. Liaoning's Xinmin City built a new village for teachers, thereby improving the housing conditions of 1,456 teacher families. In Zhejiang's Ningbo City, the recently promulgated policy on "double preferential treatment" aimed at doing practical turns for education was well-received by teachers. According to the policy, both single workers and working couples are entitled to 5- to 10-percent price discounts when they buy public housing. When teachers in rural areas build houses, the government will provide homesteads at government-set prices, and reduce certain taxes and charges or exempt the teachers from those taxes and charges. Over the past two years, the city has made arrangements to change the status of more than 2,000 private teachers to public-school teachers, fulfilling all relevant tasks ahead of schedule. Jiangsu Province decided that the provincial financial department would allocate 20 million yuan annually as subsidies for provincial colleges and universities to build houses for faculty members during the Eighth Five-Year Plan. Last year, 40,000 square meters [sq m] of houses were built, with another 40,000 sq m to be built this year. The province also decided to concentrate apartment houses for college and university faculty members in Nanjing and other areas. The Sichuan Provincial Government also proposed that the hospital affiliated with the Chengdu Traditional Chinese Medicine College be renamed the Sichuan Provincial Hospital for the Prevention and Control of Teachers' Occupational Diseases, where teachers can receive medical treatment and be hospitalized on a priority basis and on preferential terms. Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Provinces have all drawn up measures to ensure that salaries will be paid in full to primary and middle-school teachers every month. The measures specify that beginning this year, educational funds covered by local budgets will be placed under county management, and they will be listed separately and budgeted in full amounts.
