This conclusion is based on reports to this daily by intelligence experts who are evaluating military operation "Aries," which was held recently in the Huallaga Front. Analysts stated that SL members, who until a few weeks ago camouflaged themselves by exchanging the rifle for the hoe and who several times tried to ambush Army patrols, are in Ancash after crossing the Jircan and Aranca (Huanuco) jungle. The experts explained that they travel in small groups of four to six subversives, looting settlements and forcing peasants under death threat to house them in their small cabins and to feed them. They said operation "Aries" was 80 percent effective but due to the harsh terrain and other factors, an undetermined number of terrorists escaped from Huanuco toward the Ancash mountain range. They said the subversives may be in Llamellin on their way to Choccho and Sinachang but their objective is to reach Acobamba and the Callejon de Conchucos where there are SL columns who repeatedly conceal their weapons and mix with the peasants who raise sheep. The analysts said these subversives, like all SL militants, ambush their enemy and then hide their weapons and appear to be peasants or businessmen who have nothing to do with subversion.
