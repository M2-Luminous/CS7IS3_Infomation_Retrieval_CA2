C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, April 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan interest in visiting Mainland China substantially cooled in February and is expected to remain low in the wake of the March 31 robbery and murder of 24 Taiwan tourists while on a pleasure cruise of Qiandao Lake, the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Thursday [21 April]. Council statistics show that the number of Taiwan residents who applied for a "Taiwan Compatriot Certificate" to enter the mainland totaled 80,000 in February, down 31.62 percent from the year-earlier level. MAC officials said that Taiwan residents have made more than 6.12 million visits to the mainland since a Taiwan Government ban was lifted in November 1987. People here were prohibited from visiting the mainland since the Kuomintang Government moved to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the Chinese Communists. Currently, Taiwan residents must apply to mainland authorities in Hong Kong for the certificate to enter the mainland. The officials noted that mainland travel is expected to remain lackluster as Taiwan residents have been enraged by Beijing's callous handling of the Qiandao Lake murders and the local tourist industry has launched a drive to boycott tours to the mainland.
