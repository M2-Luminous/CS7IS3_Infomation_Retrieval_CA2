And Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council, spoke for the second time about his willingness to step down if this is going to serve Yemen, its unity, and its democracy. Sources in Sanaa have said that Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, vehemently attacked President 'Ali Salih before the Yemeni Political Forces Dialogue Committee, with which he met the day before yesterday in Aden. The sources said that al-Bid accused 'Ali Salih of "planning the military incidents witnessed recently in Abyan Governorate in the south of the country and in the Harf Sufyan area." He also said that "'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was happy with the offensive launched against some refugees in the Harf Sufyan area and with the treacherous ambush set up in Abyan by the al-'Amaliqah Brigade against a small battalion from al-Wahdah Brigade." Addressing members of the Dialogue Committee, al-Bid said: "I fear that we might lose control. I stopped an integrated military force which was on its way to hit and discipline al-'Amaliqah Brigade. And the central security camp in Aden is under siege, but we are not going to kill them in retaliation for what 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih did in Abyan and Harf Sufyan." In his meeting with the Dialogue Committee, al-Bid proposed that Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier Mujahid Abu-Shawarib assume all military powers as regards the Armed Forces, in order to ease the severity of the military tension and return matters to their previous status. al-Bid asked Brig. Abu-Shawarib to contact President 'Ali Salih during the meeting to obtain permission to do so. The sources emphasized that Brig. Abu-Shawarib did indeed contact the president and later told the meeting that 'Ali Salih had refused to give him the authorization. He told him: "How can we breach the authorization document given to the Yemeni-Jordanian-Omani military committee, when its ink has not dried yet? Such talk represents a contradiction in positions, and I do not believe that you would accept that, nor do I believe that it is honorable for us as leadership to do it." So al-Bid said: "Did I not tell you that his intentions are not sincere," pointing out that he knows well the GPC's military strength. And that he knows how many troops that force includes from the GPC, the Reform Grouping, and the Nasirites. He added: "So we believe that our position is the strongest. But our characteristic is that we examine the situation before making a decision." Concluding, al-Bid said that the al-'Amaliqah forces in Abyan "attacked the party's offices and militias -- actions which explode the situation." He renewed his warning about losing control of the military situation if such actions continue. In Aden, sources close to the Political Forces Dialogue Committee, which convened in the southern governorate of Abyan in the evening of the day before yesterday, said that "the committee's members failed to stop the deterioration in the situation in Abyan -- the deterioration which began on 21 March."
