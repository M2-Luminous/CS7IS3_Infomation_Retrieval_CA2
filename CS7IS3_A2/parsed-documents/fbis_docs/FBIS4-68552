FBIS4-68552 "jpusr051___94054" FBIS-USR-94-051 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 8 April 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS Journal Appeals to Readers for Aid Journal Appeals to Readers for Aid 944F0611D Moscow LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA in Russian No 14, 8 Apr 94 p 16 944F0611D Moscow LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA Russian CSO [Text] LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA is in danger! Deprived of state subsidies, with no other means of financial support, and put in the position of a "blockade-raiser," independent LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA is experiencing severe financial difficulties. The editorial team has done everything within its power to weather the constant rise in the exorbitant prices of printing services, newsprint, and so forth. Whatever cost thousands yesterday already costs a million today, and whatever used to cost a million now costs 8-10 million. We are appealing for aid from all those who grew to love and need LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA in the last few years. The disappearance of a newspaper which has consistently defended the principles of Russian statehood and state dignity, and which is now in the midst of a fierce confrontation with all those who are disgracing and destroying Russia, will be an irretrievable loss. This loss would be another example of the annihilators' skill in dislodging the strong props of Russia's substructure and the foundation of our common Russian home. We hope we can rely on the support of entrepreneurs and businessmen in Russia and on the empathy of our readers. The commercial account of the editorial offices in the Business Commercial Bank is MFO 201638 IPO Writers (with the notation: for LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA). Our readers in any part of Russia and the CIS can transfer whatever amount they can spare to that account. Muscovites should transfer funds to the following: Business Commercial Bank, MFO 44583478, acct. 74, 129110 IPO Writers (indicating: for LITERATURNAYA ROSSIYA).
