This initiative meets the call made by EC leaders, at their EC Summit last December in Edinburgh, to make EC law consistent with the subsidiarity principle, which sets out the limits of the Community's area of business and leaves the Member States responsibility for matters better dealt with on a national basis. Amongst the list of Directives targeted for simplification feature the EC's Directives on water. The Commission plan will be worked up into a report to be presented to the institution's weekly executive board meeting on November 10. This will then be forwarded for the imprimatur of EC leaders when they meet in Brussels, on December 10/11, for their end-of-year Summit meeting. Proceeding in a highly practical manner, the EC's executive arm has undertaken to re-examine more than 30 years of EC legislation, leaving aside Regulations, Directives or Decisions less than two years old. As a result of this examination, the Commission has been able to arrange the pieces of legislation into three different categories: 1. Rules and Regulations To Be Recast The aim is to upgrade and tidy up EC legislation in certain policy areas. The category includes notably pharmaceuticals, competition rules and trade provisions for the sale or purchase of farm produce. 2. Rules and Regulations To Be Simplified This, the most important category, is designed to both streamline EC legislation and repeal excessive technical details that could be covered by national or regional measures or by international agreements which the EC has signed. The sectors pinpointed by the Commission comprise a set of existing rules and regulations referred to by EC leaders at their Summit in the Scottish capital, notably legislation on farm produce, the so-called "new approach" technical harmonisation Directives, legislation on water, air and animal welfare. The Commission also intends to simplify and streamline existing legislation on water, as announced in its 1993 legislative programme. The general idea is to set essential quality and health parameters at the EC level, leaving the Member States free to add secondary parameters if they see fit. The Commission has divided the future Directives on water into two groups: Framework Directives (which will replace the current Directives) -- a framework Directive on drinking water quality which would define general parameters (some technical parameters will be set at Community level, others at national level). "One of the thorniest problems here will be the question of pesticide residues," says the Commission's document. This framework Directive will ultimately replace the existing EC drinking water Directive and perhaps part of the Directive on surface water intended for the abstraction of drinking water. -- a framework Directive on the ecological quality of surface water which will set geneal objectives to be fleshed out by national or regional authorities if need be (if this general approach is accepted, the existing Directives on fish and shellfish waters and on surface water for the abstraction of drinking water can be repealed). -- a framework Directive on the quality of bathing water (here parameters need to be simplified and adapted to new scientific knowledge, and provision also needs to be made for subsequent revision). -- a framework Directive on freshwater management and groundwater protection which would replace the existing Directive on the protection of groundwater from pollution by certain dangerous substances. This Directive would define guiding principles for the qualitative and quantitative protection of groundwater, integrating it into a geneal freshwater management policy. Directives Designed To Control Pollution at Source (Which the Commission Insists Will Respect the Principle of Subsidiarity) -- the Directive on the treatment of urban waste water -- the Directive on the prevention of water pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources. 3. Rules and Regulations To Be Repealed In most cases, the sprucing up of EC legislation because of recasting or streamlining will result in a number of EC Regulations and Directives being repealed altogether (nearly 77 solely because of the recasting of the customs code). In other cases, (these repeals will be the result of a ruling by the EC Court of Justice (particularly with regard to texts related to the freedom of establishment and freedom of movement for people providing services).
