Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended by redesignating part 892 as part 792 and by revising the newly designated part 792 to read as follows: PART 792_HOUSING AGENCY SECTION 8 FRAUD RECOVERIES Subpart A_General Provisions Sec. 792.101␣Purpose. 792.102␣Applicability. 792.103␣Definitions. Subpart B_Recovery of Section 8 Funds 792.201␣Conduct of litigation. 792.202␣HA retention of proceeds. 792.203␣Application of amounts recovered. 792.204␣Recordkeeping and reporting. Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1437f note; 42 U.S.C. 3535(d). Subpart A_General Provisions §792.101 Purpose. The purpose of this part is to encourage public housing agencies and Indian housing authorities (HAs) to investigate and pursue instances of tenant and owner fraud and abuse in the operation of the section 8 housing assistance payments programs. §792.102 Applicability. (a) This part applies to an HA acting as a contract administrator under an annual contributions contract with HUD in any section 8 housing assistance payments program. To be eligible to retain section 8 tenant or owner fraud recoveries, the HA must be the principal party initiating or sustaining an action to recover amounts from families. (b) This part applies only to those instances when a tenant or owner committed fraud, and the fraud recoveries are obtained through litigation brought by the HA (including settlement of the lawsuit), a court-ordered restitution pursuant to a criminal proceeding, or an administrative repayment agreement with the family or owner as a result of an HA administrative grievance procedure pursuant to, or incorporating the requirements of, §882.216 or 887.405. This part does not apply to cases of owner fraud in HA-owned or controlled units, or where incorrect payments were made or benefits received because of calculation errors instead of willful fraudulent activities.
