The students condemned the U.S. for posing a nuclear war threat to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and creating a war atmosphere on the Korean peninsula. They called for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and a peace pact between the U.S. and the DPRK. Some 37,000 American troops are now stationed in South Korea and the U.S. deployed Patriot missiles in South Korea last month in the name of enhancing its ally's defense capabilities against the DPRK. The demonstrators also accused the South Korean government of opening the domestic rice market and called on the National Assembly not to approve the government's final documents related to the world trade accord of the Uruguay Round. Police forces were mobilized but no clash was reported during the demonstration. Earlier today, some 400 students staged a demonstration near the American center in Kwangju, capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province, charging the U.S. with creating a war atmosphere on the Korean peninsula. The students tried to storm into the American center but were blocked by riot police firing tear gas. A clash between the police and students wielding paint bottles and rocks followed, wounding some 10 policemen and students who were then taken to nearby hospitals for treatment.
