This time it would be similar to the popiwek between 1990 and 1991--without any tax allowances. It is possible that this bill would allow only one method of establishing wages, in line with the index determined by the government. In the event that the president's veto is not rejected by the Sejm, the Finance Ministry is already preparing a bill that would stop the automatic valorization of retirement and disability pensions as well as unemployment benefits. Therefore, the possibility should not be ruled out that, in 1994, a strictly fixed amount of money would be earmarked for the increases in retirement and disability pensions, just as has been done for the past three years with the salaries of the budget sphere. Asked what the government will do if the Sejm does not pass the new popiwek law, Finance Deputy Minister Jan Kubik responded: "Nothing." However, immediately after that, he "admitted" the ministry's plans. The ministry has received information that last Thursday and Friday more money was taken out of banks for salary increases in enterprises. This especially goes for the Silesian banks, Director Zbigniew Boniuszko, of the Finance Ministry, said yesterday. He fears that, if there is no law regulating this problem, wages and salaries may increase in April by 18-20 percent. The government was going to submit another proposal to the deputies: Instead of adopting the new popiwek law once again, they might try to amend it. Thus, the Sejm would have to override the president's veto, pass this law, and, at the same time, amend it. What would this amendment consist of? The government would abandon the famous Article 21--that is, the right to extend the control of salaries and wages to private companies. So far the government has justified this with the necessity of "combating special threats to the financial balance of the state." All the revenues derived from the new popiwek would go to the state budget; at the beginning the government wanted half of those revenues to be forwarded to the Agency for Industrial Development (amendment of Article 31). After yesterday's visit to the Finance Ministry, Prime Minister Pawlak approved the amendment bill prepared by the ministry. However, from the standpoint of the law, it is not possible to amend this law. A law that has not been announced in the Legal Gazette cannot be amended. It is possible, then, that the government will do the same but in a different manner: If the Sejm does not override the presidential veto, the government will submit another bill after several days. The only difference between this bill and the previous one would be that it would not allow for wage controls in private companies and would classify the popiwek revenues as the revenues of the state budget. The problem is that the new law would have to be forwarded to the senate and then wait to be signed by the president. Most certainly, then, it could not come into effect on 1 April of this year. "As a result of the government's statements that it is preparing a new law, perhaps similar to the one we had in 1990, enterprises will start paying additional money in panic," claims Maciej Manicki, deputy chairman of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement and chairman of the Sejm Extraordinary Committee for the Pact on State Enterprise. The committee decided yesterday that it would propose that the Sejm reject the new popiwek law.
