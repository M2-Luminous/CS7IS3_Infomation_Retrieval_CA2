Members of the Party's Supreme Committee met Monday morning and agreed to make the compromise in an effort to get the investigation started as soon as possible. The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and the DP have held a series of consultations but failed to reach a compromise on who should testify in the parliamentary probe. Chongwoo Construction Co. allegedly set up a slush fund while carrying out an Army project to relocate training facilities in Sangmudae, Kwangju. The DP alleges that the fund was established to supply bribes to ranking officials of the previous administration and for political contributions to Kim Yong-sam during the 1992 presidential election. The opposition party plans to begin the parliamentary probe first by questioning 30 witnesses that it agreed with the DLP to question: It will demand that more people testify if it is disclosed that those who were excluded from selection were involved in the scandal. Furthermore, the DP has decided to demand 20 more days for the probe, in addition to the 20 days already agreed with the DLP, considering that the period is too short for parliament to conduct a thorough investigation.
