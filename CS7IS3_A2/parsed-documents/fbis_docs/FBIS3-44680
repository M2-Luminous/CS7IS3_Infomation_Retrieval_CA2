R.G. Hollifield, deputy general manager of the Sdupac company [name as received], and nine Chinese heads of different kinds of firms in the zone received the special awards here today. Sdupac is the first joint venture the U.S. Dupont Company has funded in China. It went into production in November 1992. The company mainly produces a weed killer called "nongdeshi". Since its founding it has paid close attention to abiding by the local rules and regulations concerning safety, health and environmental protection in both its production and sales. Efforts have also been made to guarantee the quality of its products. It sets aside 16 percent of its fixed assets for environmental protection, including the planting of trees and grass around the factory. An official of the Pudong New Area said that one of the goals of the zone's development is to maintain a fine natural environment. All the new structures of the Pudong New Area will be extended into the next century. Sdupac has set a good example for other foreign- funded companies in the zone in protecting the environment.
