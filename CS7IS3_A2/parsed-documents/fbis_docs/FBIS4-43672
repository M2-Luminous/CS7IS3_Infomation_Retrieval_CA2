FBIS4-43672 "drweu119__a94023" FBIS-WEU-94-119-A Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 ANNEX Germany Kinkel, Envoys to CIS Stress Support for Reforms Kinkel, Envoys to CIS Stress Support for Reforms AU2106122594 Hamburg DPA in German 1107 GMT 21 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2106122594 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The partnership promotion of the Russian reforms remains a main goal of German ostpolitik. With this guideline, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel concluded the first working conference of the German ambassadors to the 12 successor states of the Soviet Union (CIS) in Bonn on Tuesday [21 June]. Speaking to the press, Kinkel, who expressed "some shock about the gigantic problems of reconstruction," stressed that another urgent goal is the stabilization of Ukraine, which is still "the world's third largest nuclear power." In this process, making the Chernobyl nuclear power plant -- there are another 21 reactors of this type in operation -- safer must be a priority. The foreign minister admitted that at the forthcoming European summit on Corfu over the weekend, there is once again hardly any chance to make the partner states agree to the immediate aid program with lasting safety, which has been proposed by Germany and France. Regarding East Europe, German policy must also -- in addition to priority support to the reform processes -- contribute to defusing the nationality conflicts, develop markets, and satisfy the enormous need for cultural information in the new states. With this balance sheet of the ambassadors' conference, Kinkel linked a renewed rejection of Russian ideas concerning a new European security system, in which NATO is to make itself subordinate to CSCE. "For us, NATO remains the absolute security anchor," Kinkel stressed.
