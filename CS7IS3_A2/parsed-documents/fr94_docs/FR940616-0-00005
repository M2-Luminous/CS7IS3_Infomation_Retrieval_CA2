FR940616-0-00005 FR940616-0-00002 The Food and Nutrition Service is issuing this interim rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866 and it has been designated ``economically significant.'' Executive Order 12372 The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set forth in the final rule in 7 CFR part 3015, Subpart V and related Notice (48 FR 29115), this Program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612). Ellen Haas, the Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, has certified that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. State and local welfare agencies will be the most affected to the extent that they administer the Program. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Regulatory Impact Analysis Need for Action This rule is required to eliminate inconsistent policies resulting from litigation, promote equity in the treatment of housing and energy assistance, and increase consistency with the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Benefits This action increases benefits to low-income households responsible for paying utility expenses separately from their rent who receive utility reimbursements from HUD and FmHA. Costs It is estimated that this action will increase the cost of the Food Stamp Program by approximately $13 million for each month of its implementation in FY 1994 and $160 million in FY 1995. Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the Food Stamp Program the administrative procedures are as follows: (1) For Program benefit recipients_ State administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(1) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_ administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities) or Part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities); (3) for Program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 278.8. Public Participation and Effective Date The provisions of this rulemaking are required to be effective and implemented no later than August 1, 1994. Because of the need to establish a consistent nationwide policy with respect to the treatment of the specified utility reimbursements, Ellen Haas, Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, that public comment on this rulemaking prior to implementation is impracticable. However, because we believe that the administration of the rule may be improved by public comment, comments are solicited on this rule for 60 days. All comments will be analyzed, and any appropriate changes to the rule will be incorporated in the subsequent publication of a final rule. Background The HUD utility reimbursements excluded from Food Stamp Program (Program) income consideration by this rule are provided pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the Housing Act), 42 U.S.C. 1437, to comply with a provision of the Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 1437a(a)(1)) that requires HUD to limit the shelter costs of tenants in Federally assisted housing to 30 percent of their income. In calculating a tenant's rent payment, HUD has interpreted the term ``rent'' to include the cost of utilities and other services, including electricity, gas, heating fuel, water and sewerage, and trash and garbage collection (24 CFR 813.102, 965.472, 965.476). In some housing, utilities are included in the tenant's rent. In units in which the utilities are paid directly by the tenant, HUD permits a deduction to be made from the rent paid to the owner on account of the separate payment being made to the utility supplier. This deduction, provided for in 24 CFR 813.102 and 913.102, for the estimated value of utilities and charges for other housing services payable directly by the family is called a ``utility allowance.'' The amount of the utility allowance is based, not on an individual family's expenses, but on a community-wide standard. Therefore, the tenant's actual utility costs may be more or less than the allowance.
