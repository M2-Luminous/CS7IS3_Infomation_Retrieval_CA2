This point is borne out by relevant statistics. In China, the number of prison inmates receiving reduced sentences is 20-25 percent a year, 95 percent of ex-convicts are reformed, less than 10 percent of convicts are "second timers," and only 6 to 8 percent of those offended again within three years of being released from prison. China has one of the lowest rates of recidivism in the world. "Prisoners are humans too; most prisoners can be reformed." This saying by Mao Zedong serves as the foundation of Chinese criminal reformation. In recent visits to prisons in Shanghai, Shandong, and other places, this reporter saw that another saying by Mao Zedong had been hung in each prison: "Our prisons are not the usual prisons of past eras. Ours are actually schools, factories, or farms." This is also the reality. Statistical work by the Ministry of Justice shows that each year 150,000 people serving custodial sentences are awarded grammar school course or study graduation certificates by educational departments and 100,000 various technical course certificates by labor departments. Zhang Xiufu said: There are many methods for reforming criminals in China, the most notable of which is labor. People commit crimes for varied reasons, but mainly because of sloth, aversion to work, and coveting wealth. Through labor, prisoners can be corrected of their bad habits and made to realize that you have to "work hard to earn everything you own or consume." Collective labor can also heighten the sense of cooperation among prisoners, strengthen their physique, and maintain their physical and mental health. The acquisition of a skill or knowledge of production also helps prisoners find jobs and make a living and prevents them from returning to crime. China also gives consideration to political education in reforming criminals, which has been attacked by some Western countries as "brain washing." Zhang Xiufu said: Discounting those who say this with malicious intent, most have no idea about the real situation. There was indeed something wrong with China's political education in the past, but "leftist" elements have been weeded out, and what remains now is education in morality, ideals, and the legal system. "Ultimately people need something spiritual." Political education in reformation work benefits criminals a great deal. Behind every criminal are their parents, spouses, or children who have sincere expectations of them. Wang Fei, a former reform- through-labor bureau chief in Shanghai and vice chairman of the Chinese Society of Reform-Through-Labor Law, said in an interview with this reporter that Chinese criminal reformation has two objectives: To work for the country's stability and social development and the future of criminals and their familial happiness. The former is the essence, but the latter cannot be ignored. "Punishment is merciless but reformation merciful," said Wang Mingdi, reform-through-labor bureau chief of the Ministry of Justice. Chinese prisons are the most humane. They are like hospitals and want prisoners to return to society as healthy and normal individuals. All work is done with an eye on the prisoners' futures upon being released from prison. The humanist light of Chinese criminal reformation work can be seen from the last emperor, Pu Yi. Many criminals have obtained a new lease of life through it.
