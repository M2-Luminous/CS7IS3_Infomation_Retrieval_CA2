FR940429-0-00093 FR940429-0-00012 Despite the Secretary's efforts to encourage complementary functions for each of the triad members, it is theoretically possible that, in some instances, an institution could be subject to three different standards regulating the same area of operation. For this reason, where a Title IV standard has been promulgated at the Federal level, the Secretary expects accrediting agencies and States to take this into account in establishing their own standards to insure that varying standards do not pose an unnecessary burden on institutions. It is also important that accrediting agencies and States not impose any standard that is weaker than a comparable Title IV, HEA program standard. The Secretary believes coordination of this is a federal responsibility. In view of the complementary approach to the functions of the triad members, the Secretary believes, for example, that institutions should not have to develop different methodologies to provide data that the three members of the triad may require. The Secretary also believes that, to the extent feasible, any other requests for data about the institution, its students, or its graduates should rely on information already in the institution's possession. To that end, the Secretary expects accrediting agencies and States either to accept student data based on the methodology that will be specified in the regulations governing ``Student Right to Know,'' also mandated by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, or, where the institution may have other methodologies for calculating data, such as a system designed to provide data to a State higher education commission or other State agency, to accept data in the format already being used by the institution. Similarly, the Secretary expects accrediting agencies and SPREs to use the audited financial statements institutions are now required to provide to the Secretary on an annual basis to the extent those statements are compatible with the nature of the reviews conducted under their respective standards. The Secretary also recognizes that other Federal agencies, such as the Department of Labor and the Veterans Administration, also regulate institutions in some areas that are similar to those included in part H. The suggestion has been made that the Secretary should promulgate Federal standards in the areas of overlap so that institutions would not be subject to varying standards developed by other Federal agencies and the triad members. However, the Secretary interprets part H as permitting States and accrediting agencies to establish their own standards, as opposed to using a Federal standard, and also believes that this is the most effective approach. In addition, it is not clear how the requirements of the different agencies are capatible with the requirements of part H. The purposes of these programs administered by other agencies may be very different. As a result, the Secretary has not pursued this alternative. The Secretary does believe that it would be useful to explore how the varying requirements of other Federal agencies that are similar to those of part H might be coordinated to reduce any burden on institutions and will initiate such exploration. The Secretary believes that, where possible, data developed at the national level should be made available to institutions, as well as to States and accrediting agencies to assist them in carrying out their responsibilities under part H. In particular, data concerning labor markets and compensation for specific fields and information concerning graduation and withdrawal rates at various types of institutions may be helpful to both triad members and institutions. The Secretary will facilitate the development of this type of information and, where possible under the auspices of the Department, will coordinate the development of data that will be helpful to institutions and the triad. Finally, as part of the commitment to providing leadership to the triad, the Secretary will convene representatives of the triad members and institutions to exchange information about the gatekeeping process and to discuss how the triad is functioning, both in identifying institutions whose performance is questionable and in reporting requirements that have proven to be unreasonably burdensome. The Secretary invites comments concerning the functioning of the triad, as it is implemented through these and other regulations governed by part H. The Secretary will seek improvement, where possible, within existing regulations and will propose modifications to regulations and to the statute itself if experience indicates those changes are both necessary to achieve effective gatekeeping, with minimal burden, and compatible with the need to maintain, and assure the public of, the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs. The following is a summary of the significant changes from the NPRM: Section 667.1␣Scope and purpose. Section 667.1(a)(1) has been revised to clarify that the purpose of the SPRP is to reduce fraud and abuse in the Title IV, HEA programs. This section also has been revised to clarify that under the SPRP a State's standards apply only to referred institutions and a State may review only referred institutions under those standards. Section 667.2␣Definitions. The proposed definition of professional program has been revised to maintain a clear distinction between the terms vocational program and professional program in view of the changes made to the definition of vocational program. A professional program is therefore an undergraduate or graduate educational program that prepares individuals for an occupation, if that occupation (1) is listed in a Federal classification manual, (2) requires at least a bachelor's degree to qualify for entry; (3) involves the independent practice or application of a defined or organized body of competencies that is unique to the occupation; and (4) is formally recognized and regulated under a national or State licensure, accreditation, or permit system. Also, the definition is expanded to allow a SPRE to use its State's statutory definition of the term ``professional program.'' The proposed definition of vocational program has been revised to be consistent with that used in IPEDS. A vocational program is therefore defined as an educational program that is below the bachelor's level and is designed to prepare individuals with skills and training for employment in a specific trade, occupation, or profession related to that educational program. Section 667.3␣State agreement. Paragraph (b)(3) of this section has been revised to clarify the type of records that a SPRE must keep or have access to, and the type of information that must be provided to the Secretary. Thus, paragraph (b)(3)(iii) has been revised to indicate that a SPRE must keep or have access to records of referred institutions, related to activities under this part, and must provide requested information to the Secretary for financial or compliance audits of referred institutions. Paragraph (b)(3)(iv) has been added to indicate that the SPRE must keep or have access to records relating to its activities under this part, and must provide such information to the Secretary upon request when the Secretary evaluates the SPRE's performance under the SPRP. Section 667.4␣State postsecondary review entity. This section has been revised to make clear that the SPRP does not authorize a SPRE to (1) grant State authorization to provide postsecondary education to an institution, or (2) require nonreferred institutions to comply with the standards established under §667.21. Section 667.5␣Criteria the Secretary uses to refer institutions to a SPRE for review. The criterion in paragraph (b)(11) of this section has been revised to limit complaints the Secretary considers in determining whether to refer an institution to a SPRE for review to student complaints. This section has also been revised to allow an institution an opportunity to challenge the accuracy of the information that the Department uses to refer the institution to a SPRE for review before the Department refers that institution to a SPRE. Section 667.6␣SPRE selection of institutions for review. This section has been revised to allow an institution that has not been referred by the Secretary an opportunity to challenge the accuracy of the information that a SPRE uses to select the institution for review. Section 667.8␣Notice to nationally recognized accrediting agencies of SPRE actions. A new section is added to these final regulations to require a SPRE to notify the appropriate nationally recognized accrediting agency before the SPRE conducts a review of an institution the agency accredits. The SPRE is also required to notify that accrediting agency of significant and relevant decisions, reports, or actions taken as a result of the review.
