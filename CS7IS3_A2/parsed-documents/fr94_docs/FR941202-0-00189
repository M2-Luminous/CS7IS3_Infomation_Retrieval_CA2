FR941202-0-00189 FR941202-0-00019 Friday December 2, 1994 Part XI Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 121 Protective Glove Requirement; Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 231␣/␣Friday, December 2, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 121 [Docket No. 27926; Amendment No. 121&hyph;243] RIN 2120&hyph;AF37 Protective Glove Requirement AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comment. SUMMARY: This action amends the final rule requiring that disposable latex gloves, or equivalent nonpermeable gloves, be located onboard aircraft operated in air carrier, air taxi, and commercial operations. This amendment responds to a petition for exemption filed by the Air Transport Association for an extension of the compliance date of December 2, 1994. With this amendment, the FAA will permit, for the next 18 months, that the protective gloves required for the emergency medical kit may be placed in a location that is readily accessible to crewmembers. With this action, the FAA will avoid a possible disruption in service to the traveling public because of the unavailability of sufficient numbers of modified medical kits. DATES: Effective date December 2, 1994. Comments must be received on or before January 3, 1995. ADDRESSES: Send or deliver comments on the rule in duplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Chief Counsel, Attn: Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;204), Room 916, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591. Comments may be examined in the Rules Docket weekdays, except Federal holidays, between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Daniel V. Meier, Jr., Regulatory Branch (AFS&hyph;240), Air Transportation Division, Flight Standards Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591, telephone: (202) 267&hyph;3749. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background By Federal Register publication of October 18, 1994, the FAA issued a final rule with comment that required disposable latex gloves, or equivalent nonpermeable gloves, to be located onboard aircraft operated in air carrier, air taxi, and commercial operations. This amendment responded to concerns of the FAA and some members of the aviation industry that a potential health risk exists to crewmembers and passengers from the possibility of incidental exposure to blood borne pathogens. The FAA stated that the amendment would lessen the possibility of that exposure and therefore increase the level of safety for both passengers and crewmembers. The FAA also found that notice and public comment for the rulemaking was impracticable and contrary to the public interest. The FAA stated that ``Because this rule will lessen a potential health risk to passengers and crewmembers, those persons should not be further subjected to that potential risk by a delay in issuing a final rule.'' By letter dated November 14, 1994, the Air Transport Association (ATA) requests an extension of 18 months beyond the December 2, 1994, compliance date. ATA states that the 45-day compliance requirement of the final rule puts the air carrier industry in an impossible position in that the emergency medical kits (EMK) are prepared and serviced by a very few vendors. Airlines have been notified by these few vendors that the 45-day modification schedule adopted by the FAA will be impossible to meet, forcing the possible cancellation of flights due to the unavailability of modified EMK. ATA proposes in its petition that, for the next 18 months, carriers be allowed to provide a sufficient quantity of protective gloves distributed throughout the cabin of each aircraft in accessible locations. ATA notes that in many cases, it will be possible to affix the gloves to the EMK. Further, ATA states that an equivalent level of safety will be provided by maintaining the required numbers of pairs of gloves on the aircraft in accessible locations. ATA posits that good cause exists for waiver of publication because of the pressing deadline and because the final rule was not published for notice and public comment.
