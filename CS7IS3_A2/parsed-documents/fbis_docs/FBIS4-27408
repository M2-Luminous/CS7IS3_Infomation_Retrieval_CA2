China's official XINHUA News Agency on Sunday quoted a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying Saturday [28 May] his country and the IAEA met May 25-27 to negotiate technical matters related to removing fuel rods from the 5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, revealing that Pyongyang would continue independent discharge of the spent fuel. During the negotiations, North Korea reportedly proposed that under IAEA supervision it would independently replace and store the fuel rods, which would later be measured by the agency, after the preparation of a package deal between Washington and Pyongyang. In response, the IAEA asked Pyongyang to submit the proposal in writing for further examination, the news agency said. XINHUA quoted the Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that Pyongyang was ready to continue the negotiations whenever the IAEA offers to meet, even though a final agreement was yet to be made between the two sides. North Korea has been discharging nuclear fuel rods faster than expected, virtually blocking the IAEA's plan to take samples. The agency wishes to conduct direct tests of the discharged fuel rods to determine whether North Korea has diverted plutonium, the key element in manufacturing atomic bomb, for other purposes.
