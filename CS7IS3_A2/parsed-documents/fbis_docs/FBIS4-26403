Books to be published in one year will be controlled at the level of some 70,000. In recent years, some publishing houses in China published a large quantity of books beyond the scope of their business, or even resold book registration numbers for profit. After 1985, book registration numbers increased by an average of 15 percent each year. This seriously affected book quality. Recently, three publishing houses in Beijing which seriously violated the relevant regulations were ordered to suspend operations. They were China Broadcast and Television Publishing House, Beijing Yanshan Publishing House, and Haiyang Publishing House. In its recent circular, the China Press and Publications Administration laid down rules for controlling the use of book registration numbers every year. In the future, if any publishing houses are found to be reselling book registration numbers for profit, the numbers they can use will be reduced by over 15 percent.
