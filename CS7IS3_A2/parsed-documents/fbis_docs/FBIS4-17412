The cost of the work, which began four years ago, has been estimated at $14 million. The modernization of the airport and its terminal was paid for by the "Pulkovo" aviation enterprise, which did not take a single kopek from the city budget. The modernization of Pulkovo-2 will make it possible not only to improve the quality of passenger services but also considerably to increase the airport's handling capacity. St. Petersburg now has direct flights to 27 cities in Europe and can cope with a maximum of 5 million passengers a year. Meanwhile the airport's increased capacity will be sufficient for three years. The construction of Pulkovo-3, a major new airport on the banks of the Neva, will begin in 1997.
