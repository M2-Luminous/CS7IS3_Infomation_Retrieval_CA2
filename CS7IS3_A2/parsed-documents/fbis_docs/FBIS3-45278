The provincial party committee and government in Heilongjiang always place the development of agriculture and the solidification and expansion of the country's "huge granary" in Heilongjiang in a position of paramount importance, from which a complete set of work ideas and specific measures has been formed. They have paid serious attention to the construction of agricultural infrastructure. In 1993, nearly 100 million yuan was invested in farmland capital construction so that the entire province boasts an annual production capability of more than 22.5 billion kg. Moreover, they persisted in invigorating agriculture through the application of scientific and technological advances and disseminated advanced technology. In the area of education, more than 4 million young and middle-aged peasants were trained through various channels in 1993 so that there is a crack hand in the farming line in every household. The building of the service sector has been intensified, and the former emphasis on technical services has been shifted to an emphasis on supplying the means of production and helping peasants sell their grain in an effort to resolve the tough problems facing the peasants. In order to solve the problem of having difficulty selling grain after bumper harvests, leading cadres from prefectures, cities, and counties personally went to various localities across the country to set up a marketing network, an example of which is the secretary of the Qingan county party committee, who succeeded in selling grain to Beijing. The provincial party committee and government also tried by every possible means to resolve the problem of "IOU notes." In a bid to lighten peasants' burdens, over 600 improper apportionments have been rectified; 48,000 nonproductive personnel in villages, towns, and townships have been laid off; and reserve funds and the unified budget for the entire province has been reduced by 4.9 percent, which is lower than that stipulated by the State Council. All this has greatly released peasants' enthusiasm so that the province's grain yield has exceeded 22.5 billion kg for four consecutive years. The public will is stable thanks to adequate grain. Over the past couple of months, monthly sales of grain throughout the province have stabilized at about 250 million kg, the market price has never reached the ceiling set by the state, and the phenomenon of panic buying has never occurred in the entire province. A leading cadre from the provincial authorities told this reporter: "At present, the province has 10 billion kg of grain in stock, and is ready to offer full assistance to any fraternal province or city which is in difficulty."
