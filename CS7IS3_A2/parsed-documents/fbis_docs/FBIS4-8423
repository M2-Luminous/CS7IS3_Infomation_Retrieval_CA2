The spokesman recalls the Foreign Ministry statement regarding NATO's ultimatum on withdrawing heavy weapons around Sarajevo, which also expressed the hope that there will be no need for radical means to halt military actions on the territory of Bosnia. However, developments in the situation showed that certain sides in the conflict are taking steps that contradict the decision of the UN Security Council. This causes serious concern and reduces the chances of finding a lasting peaceful solution to the conflict. The reaction of the international community under the UN aegis is an expression of its determination to take all possible measures to implement the relevant decisions on defending the safe areas and the personnel of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], the statement points out. Those actions are a clear signal to the sides to the conflict to enter active negotiations to end the conflict. At the same time, the Foreign Ministry statement expresses the hope that similar radical measures will not cause a chain reaction. The sides to the conflict are called upon to refrain from actions that could delay the achievement of the vitally important peace agreements.
