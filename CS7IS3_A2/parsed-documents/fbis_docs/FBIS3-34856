The Jordanian side to the talks was headed by Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, deputy prime minister and minister of higher education, while the Palestinian side was led by Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department. During its meetings, the committee reviewed issues of bilateral and Arab concern to promote the overall bilateral cooperation and coordination to the required level in all areas. The committee also reviewed recent developments in the peace process, including the agreement the PLO and Israel signed in Cairo on 9 February, which constitutes a major step toward the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord, which is the first part of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. The two sides expressed satisfaction with the climate of understanding that permeated the talks, something which promotes bilateral coordination. This climate also demonstrates the need to promote and enhance this coordination in all areas, given that it is a realistic response to the special, historical, and fateful relationship between the two peoples, as well as a response to the common challenges facing them.
