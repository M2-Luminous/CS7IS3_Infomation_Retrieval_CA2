Ruling out any plans to seek resumption of the stalled bilateral trade talks, Fujii stressed that a meeting with Bentsen is not yet set but if it takes place in Hawaii it will be to discuss Asia-Pacific affairs. "It all depends when the talks are actually held," Fujii said, expressing uncertainty over what Bentsen may want to discuss. Fujii will leave for Hawaii on Friday evening to attend a two-day meeting of finance ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Noting that APEC nations are highly interested in Japan's economic trends, Fujii said he would explain the latest 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package that includes "extremely big" tax cuts worth some 6 trillion yen. He said the single-year tax cuts would have sufficient effects to put the economy into a "full-fledged recovery phase in fiscal 1994." Asked what measures will be taken in and after fiscal 1995 to attain the "stable growth" aimed for by the government, Fujii said the Finance Ministry will stay "neutral." He declined to elaborate but said the ruling coalition parties are now discussing how they can decide on a permanent tax reform by the end of the year. Fujii remained cautious over the ministry's quarterly survey released Thursday that showed signs that corporate earnings may have bottomed out in the October-December period. "Some figures turned upward but the overall figures remained sluggish," he said.
