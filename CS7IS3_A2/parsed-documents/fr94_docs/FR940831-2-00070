FR940831-2-00070 FR940831-2-00051 7. The potential of the project to continue on a self-sustaining basis after the period of grant support; and 8. The adequacy of the project's plan to develop and use methods designed to attract and maintain minority and disadvantaged students to train as physician assistants. Other Considerations In addition, the following funding factors may be applied in determining the funding of approved applications: 1. Funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of approved applications ahead of other categories or groups of approved applications, such as competing continuation projects ahead of new projects. 2. Funding priority is defined as the favorable adjustment of aggregate review scores when applications meet specified objective criteria. It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request consideration for a funding factor will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. General Statutory Funding Preference As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_ (A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (B) during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile that have been recommended for approval by the peer review group. ``High rate'' means that 20 percent of the physician assistant program graduates in academic year 1992&hyph;93 or academic year 1993&hyph;94, whichever is greater, are spending at least 50 percent of their work time in clinical practice in these settings. ``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94, the rate of physician assistant program graduates in these settings has increased by at least 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of the academic year 1993&hyph;94 graduates are working in these settings. Additional information concerning the implementation of this preference was published in the Federal Register at 59 FR 15741, dated April 4, 1994. To allow new programs to compete more equitably in FY 1995, criteria for the statutory and the administrative funding preferences have been developed to apply only to them. These criteria are provided in the application materials. Funding Preference for Fiscal Year 1995 The following funding preference which was established in FY 1994 after public comment at 59 FR 2624, dated May 9, 1994, will be continued in FY 1995: A funding preference will be given to established physician assistant training programs which can demonstrate that (a) more than 50 percent of their graduates in 1994 entered a generalist specialty (family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics); or (b) an average of 40 percent of graduates over the last 3 years (1992, 1993, and 1994) entered a generalist specialty. Funding Priority for FY 1995 The following priority which was established in FY 1994 after public comment at 59 FR 2065, dated May 19, 1994, will be continued in FY 1995: A funding priority will be given to approved applications that can demonstrate either substantial progress over the last 3 years or a significant experience of 10 or more years in enrolling and graduating trainees from those minority or low-income populations identified as at risk of poor health outcomes. To allow new programs to compete more equitably in FY 1995, criteria for the funding priority have been developed to apply only to them. These criteria are provided in the application materials.
