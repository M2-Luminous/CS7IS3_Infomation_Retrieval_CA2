ACTION: Final rule; extension of compliance dates. SUMMARY: RSPA is extending the compliance dates for classification, hazard communication, and packaging requirements of the Hazardous Materials Regulations applicable to infectious substances, including regulated medical waste. The extension is intended to provide RSPA with time to evaluate the need for changes to regulatory requirements which had been scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 1994, and to continue coordination with other Federal agencies that have jurisdiction over infectious substances. The extension is responsive to the concerns of shippers and transporters that more interagency coordination is needed in order to avoid overlapping or inconsistent Federal requirements for infectious substances. DATES: This amendment is effective on September 22, 1994. However, if RSPA receives comments by September 30, 1994, that illustrate that an extension of compliance dates is not in the public interest, RSPA will remove this final rule amendment and propose another date.
