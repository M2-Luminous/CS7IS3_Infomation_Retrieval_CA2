At the first federal congress in Kassel delegates from six laender elected a Federal Executive Committee and decided to participate in the European elections on 12 June. However, the precondition for the definite participation in the European elections is the founding of associations in most laender by 12 May. The party congress elected Bernd Schoenemann, a 49-year-old criminal-law professor from Munich, as new federal chairman. Last June the Instead Party was founded by ex-Christian Democratic Union rebel Markus Wegner in Hamburg and is represented in the land government there. During a discussion on Sunday, which lasted for four hours, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, and Thuringia called for participating in the European elections, while representatives from Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, and Hesse came out against it. [passage omitted] The federal congress has not yet agreed on new guidelines for federal policy but has taken over the principles of the Hamburg mother party for the time being. These principles proclaim the introduction of plebiscitary elements, the slimming down of parliaments, the abolition of mandatory party vote, and more business-like instead of ideology-oriented policy. Mike Bashford, Juergen Pilligrath, Sabine Winter, Bernhard Engelbrecht, and six assessors from the land associations were elected to the Executive Committee in addition to Schoenemann. The next founding of associations of the Instead Party, which has about 2,500 members all over Germany, is supposed to take place in Berlin on 23 April and in North Rhine-Westphalia at the beginning of May.
