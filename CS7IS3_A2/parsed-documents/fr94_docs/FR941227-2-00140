FR941227-2-00140 FR941227-2-00091 [Release No. 34&hyph;35120; File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;22] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change Providing for the Execution of Cross Transactions on the PSE Equities Floor December 19, 1994. On August 18, 1994 the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to facilitate the execution of large agency cross transactions on the Exchange equities floors. On October 13, 1994, the Exchange submitted Amendment No. 1. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 See letter from Michael Pierson, Senior Attorney, PSE, to Sandra Sciole, Commission, dated October 10, 1994. The proposed rule change, as amended, was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34849 (October 18, 1994), 59 FR 53695 (October 25, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. The proposed rule change adopts Commentary .05 to PSE Rule 5.14(b), which governs the execution of stock cross transactions, to facilitate the execution of large agency crosses. The proposed Commentary is designed to permit the execution of ``clean'' agency crosses of 25,000 shares or more at or within the prevailing quotation without regard to the priority of existing bids or offers where both the buy and sell orders are for accounts other than that of a member or member organization or non-member broker dealer. The proposal, however, would allow the cross to be broken up at a price that is better than the proposed cross price for one side or the other, but in doing so the member must satisfy all other existing bids and offers at that price. The Commission notes that similar rules are in place at the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') 4 and at the American Stock Exchange (``Amex'') 5 . The NYSE and Amex rules, like the PSE proposal, restrict clean crosses to agency orders, of 25,000 shares or more, and permit such crosses to be broken up only if price improvement will result therefrom and all other bids and offers at that price are satisfied. 4 See NYSE Rule 72(b) (Priority of Agency Cross Transactions). 5 See Amex Rule 126(g), Commentary .02. The clean cross proposal should facilitate the ability of PSE members to execute block agency cross transactions on the PSE by giving such orders priority over orders at or within the prevailing quotation. At the same time, the proposal preserves the auction market principle of price improvement by permitting the cross transaction to be broken up at a better price. The proposal also preserves the principle of priority by requiring that a member who breaks up a cross by providing a better price must first satisfy all existing market interest having priority at that better price before trading with any part of the cross. The Commission recognizes that approval of the clean cross proposal could disadvantage orders on the book, or in the trading crowd, at the same price as the cross transaction. This is the only aspect of the proposal that really represents a departure from existing auction market principles. Thus, under the proposal, a clean cross could be executed while a public investor's limit order on the book remains unexecuted. For example, if a public customer left a limit order on the specialist's book at 10 a.m., bidding for 500 shares of XYZ at 40, a so-called clean cross could be executed at 10:10 at a price of 40 without satisfying the public customer order. As previously noted in the approval of the NYSE and Amex proposal, the Commission still believes that a preferable approach would be to establish a means of intermarket price protection for all limit orders in all market centers. However, with no means of intermarket price protection for public limit order, and given Commission approval of the NYSE's and Amex's identical clean cross proposals, as well as other regional exchange proposals designed to minimize interference with cross transactions, it could be unfair to preclude the PSE from adapting to the present competitive environment by facilitating the execution of agency block cross transactions on the Exchange. Thus, the Commission believes that it is not unreasonable or inconsistent with the Act for the PSE to react to competitive pressures for block business by permitting large agency crosses to occur at or within the bid or offer price. In this regard, the proposed rule change should further competition among exchanges and other competing market centers and increase opportunities for the more efficient execution of block-sized agency cross transactions. The Commission believes that the proposal restricts sufficiently the circumstances in which members may execute clean cross transactions on the Exchange. In particular, the Commission believes that the share size threshold of 25,000 shares or more should help to ensure that the clean cross proposal will apply primarily to large block-sized orders where the depth of the prevailing bid or offer may be less likely to satisfy either side of the clean cross. In addition, because the proposal is limited to agency orders only, the proposal should assist public customers in effecting cross transactions on the Exchange and should not give any special advantage to members, member organizations, and non-member broker dealers in their proprietary trading. In summary, the Commission believes that the clean cross proposal should allow the Exchange to compete with other exchanges for block-sized orders more fairly while upholding the auction market principle of price improvement. In this context, while the proposed Commentary allows market interest of any size to break up a cross transaction, the Commentary also requires that a member breaking up a cross must provide a better price than the cross price to one side of the cross and he or she must satisfy in their entirety any bids or offers that have priority at that better price before taking any part of the cross.
