The Group of Seven (G-7) nations apparently will adopt the chairman's draft statement noting that international trade will help boost employment, baring in mind the relation between trade surpluses and unemployment. The statement, to be released after the two-day summit, will avoid singling out individual nations for criticism. But Japan may be the exception if the nation leaves its huge trade surplus untouched, the sources said. The economic ministers of the G-7 countries will participate in the jobs summit, to be held March 14 and 15. Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi will represent Japan. According to the sources, these are the main points of the chairman's statement: -- Major industrial nations have been battling against unemployment. -- The unemployment rate has been rising in Europe and Japan, whose rate is the smallest among the G-7 nations. -- Each nation needs to provide equal opportunities to all workers, particularly those in the low-skill sector. -- Structural reforms will only be effective when they are supplemented and supported by appropriate macroeconomic policies. -- International trade is essential to boost wealth, employment and wages. -- The development of new technology regarding data processing, has the potential to increase the wealth of participating nations.
