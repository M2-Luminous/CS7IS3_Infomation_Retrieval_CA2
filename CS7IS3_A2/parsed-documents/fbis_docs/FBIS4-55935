FBIS4-55935 "dreeu101__a94025" FBIS-EEU-94-101-A Daily Report 21 May 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Meciar: Kovac Breached `Constitutional Duty' Meciar: Kovac Breached `Constitutional Duty' AU2405094094 Prague CTK in English 1941 GMT 21 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2405094094 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, May 21 (CTK) -- The opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) intends to lodge a complaint with parliament, the Council of Europe and foreign human rights organizations, concerning of the rejection of a petition drive launched by the HZDS earlier this year and aimed at organizing the first referendum in the country. This follows from a session of the HZDS National Board held in Nimnica u Puchova, west Slovakia, today. The petition drive for the referendum, through which the HZDS wanted to solve the questions of the early elections, the withdrawal of mandates from "disobedient deputies," and the "purity" of money involved in privatization, was rejected in mid-March by the Presidential Office, which argued that the constitutional condition of gaining at least 350,000 petition signatures which enable the president to launch the referendum, had not been met. Signatures started to be collected in late February, and on March 2 the petition committee handed to the Presidential Office lists with 422,054 signatures. However, after their verification only 232,957 were recognized as valid. HZDS representatives said today that the party experts had re- examined the lists and stated that more that 372,000 signatures were valid, it means more than required by the Constitution. HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar insisted that his former collaborator and current adversary, President Michal Kovac, had breached his constitutional duty to call the referendum. Referring to the HZDS pre-election strategy, Meciar said it was correct for its former partner in the government coalition, the Slovak National Party (SNS), to enter the autumn parliamentary elections separately. Nevertheless, the HZDS counts on post-election cooperation with the SNS, he added. Polls show that the HZDS and the SNS could gain more votes if entering the elections separately. But while the HZDS's popularity among Slovak citizens is 27-32 per cent, the SNS has less than five per cent of followers.
