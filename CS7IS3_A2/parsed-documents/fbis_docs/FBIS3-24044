Simultaneously, the LDDP is accused of having usurped the aforementioned means of information and of implementing a Soviet era policy, when there was one set of speakers and one truth. So that we might better comprehend those on the right, let's return to the recent past. From the very moment that the independence of our state was restored, they had unlimited opportunities for presenting information. The right of all representatives of the national government to have precedence in using Lithuanian Radio and Television on issues pertaining to their duties was fixed in article 6 of the Charter for Lithuanian Radio and Television. This is why we watched "Atgimimo banga" ["Wave of Rebirth"] each week, which was gradually converted into a platform for government representatives from the right side of the political spectrum; on many an evening we listened to the speeches of always the same politicians. Television acquired its "talking heads" appellation. Representatives on the left side of the political spectrum, who made up an insignificant minority in the Supreme Council, were unable to make use of the Article 6 right. They were chastised as "enemies" by the "patriots", so it was not permissible for the people to remember that they existed. Besides that, all the air time was divided up among "one's own". After the relationship of political forces in the government changed in the wake of the Seimas elections, the Radio and Television Board proposed relinquishing Article 6. Since this elicited tempestuous dissatisfaction on the part of the right, the Seimas education committee made the decision to give each political party air time proportionate to the number of members it had in the Seimas. The right, which had initially concurred, later reconsidered and abandoned this proposal, demanding that the opposition be assigned a special weekly slot of air time. Then the majority of Seimas members supported the Radio and Television Board proposal not to allot special slots to any political party, nor to the opposition or the government. Does the fact that neither side has its own program mean--in the words of those on the right--that the LDDP has usurped the radio and television? People of various political persuasions work on the Radio and Television Board, but most of them do not belong to political parties. Does the presence of 2 LDDP representatives and 1 social democrat in a body of 16 members really constitute domination by the left? According to the Radio and Television Charter, the board establishes the political and cultural strategy for broadcasts (II. sec. 9.4.). The representatives of the right, e.g., S. Saltenis, N. Ozelyte, V. Landsbergis, and others criticize the board's work, accusing it of inaction, lack of national topics, etc. It may be that the board is not sufficiently active, but that is the fault of its own members, one of whom is N. Ozelyte. I also do not like all the broadcasts that are on television and radio; however, I believe that those responsible for the poor work are the specific people who prepare those broadcasts. How much and what kind of political information is presented is a different matter. It is perhaps possible to say that the broadcast programs confine themselves to quite narrow commentaries. In addition, those invited to comment are people whose opinions on most issues have been known for a long time. What is missing are some markedly more diverse opinions, educated dispute, and most importantly, serious and objective analysis of political events. This I believe is essential, because it would help people orient themselves with respect to rather complex international as well as domestic events. There are enough qualified political scientists in Lithuania, who, if invited to appear on radio or television, could help form the country's political culture. Do the representatives of political parties or the opposition have absolutely no opportunity to use the radio and the television? In listening to daily radio programs, e.g. "Aktualijos" ["Topical Issues"], one can almost always hear the voices of well-known politicians from the right. There has never been an instance when only representatives of the left talked about political events on the informational television broadcasts, especially on the program "Naujienos. Nuomones" ["News and Opinions"]. We also see representatives of both sides on special political broadcasts. It is possible, of course, to understand the annoyance of active politicians from the right, since they can't make use of state television in the same way that they make use of the "Tele-3" studio. But those on the left should be even more disappointed, because they have to be content with only the attention of journalists from state television. Therefore, assertions that the LDDP has usurped radio and television are fabricated. If we were to consider it usurping that we frequently see the president and the prime minister on our television screens, then we would also have to term as usurpers of our television the heads of other countries, who are shown during the overview of international events.
