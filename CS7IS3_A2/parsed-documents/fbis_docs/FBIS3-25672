There would also be a general shake-up in local agriculture as export subsidies and domestic support were reduced. Addressing the Agricultural Outlook Conference in Pretoria, Dr van Niekerk said the conclusion of the Uruguay Round should lead to an increase in world prices of agricultural products. "This will strengthen the comparative advantage of South African products on the world and domestic markets." Dr van Niekerk said the country would gain many advantages from its recent admission to the UN's food and agricultural organisation and other bodies. Onderstepoort was to become a cooperation centre for Africa, and South Africa would host the World Veterinary Association congress later this year. He said the cabinet had in principle endorsed the guidelines contained in the report of the Agricultural Marketing Policy Evaluation Committee which recommended one agricultural marketing policy to serve the commercial and developing sectors and provide market access for both. Dr van Niekerk said continued single-channel marketing schemes and marketing boards for commodities could not be ruled out. But all marketing systems would have to be transparent, supported by all those involved and applied without political interference.
