On the contrary, he added, Turkey and Rauf Denktas are struggling to escape from the suffocating encirclement being created around them. In an address at the Lions Club in Paralimni, President Kliridhis noted that the Turkish side now opposes the suggestions by the UN Secretary General and his representatives for the implementation of the confidence-building measures [CBM's] on Famagusta. He further said that in January 1995 Cyprus will open talks with the EU for accession to it whether or not there is progress in the Cyprus issue because of Turkish intransigence. He also noted that the accession talks will concern the whole of the Republic of Cyprus. President Kliridhis is heading for accession to the EU. He added: The road to accession has opened because the Greek Cypriot side's behavior toward the CBM's has been irreproachable; this is affirmed by the five permanent members of the Security Council. Mr. Kliridhis said that at the proximity talks the Turkish side did not accept the UN suggestion that the Famagusta area between the sea and Dherinia, including the road, be abandoned by Turkish troops and placed under UN control so that there will be safe access to and from Famagusta. He added that the Turks did not accept UN administration of the town and demanded a trilateral administration with the participation of Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots, and some presence of the international organization. Mr. Kliridhis further noted that the Turks also did not accept the schedule for handing over the town or a series of other UN suggestions.
