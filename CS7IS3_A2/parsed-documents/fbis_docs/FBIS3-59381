Regardless of how prosperous the times, they can change to troubled times because of absolute corruption, which produces what Du Fu's historical pen described as the tragedy of the nation breaking up, and the people's being subjugated. After more than 14 years in prison, Wei Jingsheng [7614 0079 3932] has just been released on parole. The reason for his sentence was that he raised a self-evident truth: An autocracy can only hatch a new autocrat under the autocracy, just as an egg can only hatch chickens; if China does not realize the fifth modernization--democracy--Deng Xiaoping will have been an autocrat, identical to Mao Zedong. Therefore, Wei Jingsheng was jailed by Deng Xiaoping's "imperial edict," but his subject is something which people seek continuously to prove. People Associate Tang Xuanzhong With Deng Xiaoping Recently, mainland Chinese television carried a lengthy series titled "The Tang Ming Emperor," an exquisite, big-budget production. In addition to being on mainland TV, this series was also released on video tape, bringing to the Chinese community worldwide its story of what happened over 1,200 years ago. Although Tang Xuanzhong, the Tang Dynasty's "general designer of opening and reform" had created an historical era of so-called "unprecedented prosperity," his absolute power still led to absolute corruption of society and of the autocrat himself. So regardless of what kind of prosperous era it was, there was a change overnight to troubled times due to absolute corruption, with the result being the tragedy recorded by the historical pen of Du Fu: The nation disintegrated and was subjugated by others. It could be that the director Chen Jialin [7115 1367 2651] and the playwrights Zhang Xian [1728 1720] and Ye Nan [0673 2809] were not originally motivated to "borrow the past to satirize the present"; however, looking at the conclusion of the series, it does objectively have that effect--relating the tales of history to let people make comparisons with the subject of Wei Jingsheng. Forty-four years after the death of the Tang Ming Emperor, Bai Juyi wrote the epic poem "eternal regret." At the end of the poem, Tang Xuanzhong dies in sorrow due to his longing for the concubine Yang, who had been forced to die: "Heaven and earth have an end, but this regret is endless." Bai Juyi was a contemporary poet, so his description of Tang Xuanzhong's feelings before his death should be credible. Logically, the ending of "The Tang Ming Emperor" need only adapt Bai Juyi's poem to the TV screen, which would have been both easy and good, as well as having a romantic artistic sense. However, the director and the playwrights purposely ignored Tang Xuanzhong's passion and grief over his lost concubine Yang; rather, they purposely exercised their imaginations to express how much Tang Xuanzhong missed his lost imperial power, his reluctance to be alone, his attempts to summon his former officials, to see his people, and his dreams of one day regaining imperial power. Even when his situation was completely hopeless, he would still sit on his abandoned imperial chair, dreaming of accepting the adoration of his officials and subjects, clinging with all his might to the symbols of the highest imperial power. When Chinese people view this TV production, so widely divergent from Bai Juyi's poem, how can they not call to mind the reality that Deng Xiaoping, a "common party member," still holds the highest power in the Communist Party? Absolute power is absolutely attractive, so it produces what Wei Jingsheng tried to prove; i.e., that an autocracy must produce an autocrat. Rapid Rise of Reform Under Autocracy "The Tang Ming Emperor" expresses the idea that Tang Xuanzhong Li Longji was, in conducting "opening and reform" through perceptual knowledge, the most brilliant of the more than 400 emperors in China's history. In the process of viewing this show, Chinese people will naturally make associations and comparisons, forming a hazy proof of reality. When Li Longji first ascended the throne, he immediately reformed the bad government left over from the harsh regime of Wu Zetian, which had not been reformed by Zhong Zong and Rui Zong. In these actions, he was extraordinarily open and brilliant. He favored equality under the laws whereby "the son of the emperor should receive the same sentence as a commoner should he violate the law." He diluted the special privileges of the imperial family. He dealt strictly with the "politics of exchanging money for power" by which official positions could be purchased. He advocated a society of coexisting multiple theologies; one in which his subjects could freely choose Daoism, Confucianism, or even the outside religions of Buddhism and Islam, without the "ideological violence" that comes with a single sanctioned religion. His economic policy was one of "opening to the outside," where each of the Western nations had a flourishing commercial trade with the Great Tang. He was so open that he even permitted foreigners (such as the Japanese Abe Nakamaro) to be officers in the imperial government. He was opposed to witchcraft, paid attention to science, used the imperial military forces to destroy locusts, ordered the making of a new calendar, and promoted water conservancy projects; thus, science and technology were very advanced. He opposed the policy begun in the Qin Dynasty of stressing agriculture while ignoring commerce. Rather, he implemented the "economic freedom" of agriculture and commerce developing together, reformed and carried out new policies so that throughout the country emerged the boom era of "flourishing markets" and "the nation strong and the people rich." He paid considerable attention to "intellectuals," established an academy of classical learning, and invited people of talent from throughout the world to Chang'an, bestowing upon them very high wages and social position, making China one of the world's leading nations in the humanities and in science and technology. Through economic and cultural (but not political) reforms, Tang Xuanzhong indeed lifted the Tang up to an extremely high level of prosperity, producing as many talented people as there were stars in the sky. Tang poetry was the pinnacle of ancient Chinese poetry, while the poetry of Tang Xuanzhong was the zenith of Tang poetry. The so-called "poetry immortals" of history--Li Bai, the "Saint of Poetry" Du Fu, and the "Buddhist Poet" Wang Wei, etc.--all appeared in the Tang Dynasty. In addition, there were such masters in the history of poetry as Zhang Yue, He Zhizhang, Zhang Jiuling, Meng Haoran, Gao Shi, Chui Jin, and Wang Changling. Wu Daozhi, referred to in history as the "Saint of Painting," was Tang Xuanzhong's royal court painter. Both the great calligrapher Zhang Xu, famed for his cursive hand, and the calligrapher Yan Zhengqing, who created the "Yan style," displayed their talents in the Tang Xuanzhong era. The major Chinese composer Li Gui, who had a voluminous output of vocal music, dancing music, and instrumental music, was a royal court musician, while the Tang Ming Emperor himself was a player and composer. Tang Xuanzhong created theater (by absorbing a great many dances from Western regions), which set a precedent for Chinese dance. There were such major dancers as Lady Gong Shun who was adept at wielding the sword, as well as the sword player Fei Weng. At that time, Fei Weng's sword dance, Li Bai's poetry, and Zhang Xu's cursive hand were called "the three peaks of perfection." Among religious specialists, there was the great monk Jian Zhen, who traveled east to Japan and established Japanese Ritsu.... There can be accomplishments in reform under an autocracy, even great accomplishments. It does not matter whether one is speaking of "Weng Jin's reform" or "Zhen Guan's reform" in Chinese history, or even the second imperial regime of Napoleon the 3rd in the period following the great French Revolution. The latter saw the great achievement of completing the industrial revolution in France, making France the world's second great industrial nation, in which there were such literary stars as Hugo and Flaubert, and such great impressionist artists as Monet, Degas, Manet, Renoir, Cezanne, and Pissarro, the founders of modern painting. Associating with Deng Xiaoping in today's China, although his reform achievements cannot be placed on a par with Tang Xuanzhong's "unprecedented era" of boom, it is in degree several figures higher when compared with the Mao Zedong era. In addition, the pace of economic growth over the past several years has caused the Western nations, which have been in a state of decline, to treat China with increased respect. Like the Tang Ming Emperor, Deng Xiaoping has carried out reform only in the economy, not in the "imperial regime." Achievements have obviously been possible, even great achievements. However, all the boom eras under autocracies in this world have the same special features--like a rising balloon, the faster it ascends, the faster it will break. "The Emperor's achievements" will not last five generations but will frequently collapse in "his own era." "Rapidly Endangered Syndrome" of Reform Conducted by an Autocrat Comparing Deng Xiaoping with the Tang Ming Emperor, we find that reform under an autocracy has a "rapidly endangered syndrome" with the following symptoms: Corruption. Absolute power must accelerate in a boom era, leading to corruption of the autocrat himself or his governing group. Tang Xuanzhong began by corrupting himself. He indulged in women and song and, especially after he obtained the concubine Yang, he indulged in "night life" to the point of not going to the "imperial court to attend to the nation's business." In addition, when a man made it to the top, all his friends and relatives made it there with him. This put his uncle Yang Guozhong in power, and with this relative running things the entire imperial court was soon corrupted. An era of boom collapsed in the "Anshi chaos." Although there is nothing about Deng Xiaoping which compares to the personal corruption of Tang Xuanzhong or Mao Zedong, the Communist regime, its absolute power unrestricted by a division of powers and a legal system, must corrupt rapidly like the imperial regime of the Tang Ming Emperor. In the 1980s, Deng Xiaoping promised that, "Even though we risk being shot by people who hide in the dark, we will attack economic crimes to the end, and no matter who is discovered, we must punish them by the law." The result was that even Hu Shiying [5170 4258 5391], the son of Hu Qiaomu [5170 0829 2606], was arrested for committing fraud then released, arrested again, and finally released again after pressure from all sides. For other cases, it also is that the law cannot touch many people, "there are no results." Now, corruption has led to complaints from people everywhere. Jiang Zemin has conducted an anti-corruption campaign on his own, trying to save a dangerous situation. While it is an incurable disease caused by absolute power, no one can effect a miraculous cure and bring the dying back to life. Old and useless powers. Imperial power is a lifelong system. When the Tang Ming Emperor was 70 years old, and the An Lushan rebellion broke out, he lacked the talent and strategy that he had in his youth when he rooted out the power grabs of Queen Wei and the Princess Taiping. He made many mistakes as a military commander, which caused the losses of Tongguan and Changan. So also with Deng Xiaoping: When he had just regained power, he had a complete doctrine of reform, but later violated it completely by such actions as abandoning Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, imprisoning Wei Jingsheng, carrying out a system of power for life in total disregard of the law, and the "4 June" incident. Today, he is close to 90, yet still holds absolute power. This presents 1.2 billion Chinese with a self-evident truth concerning the old and useless--when anyone enters old age, they enter an unchangeable process of decreasing talent until they lose their capabilities completely, the final stage of life. The wages of old and useless power is often manifested in the exercise of power by relatives of the royal court, eunuchs, secretaries, and children. This sort of illegal power-wielding stems from extreme greed, usually the source of the most dangerous disorder. Violent change. For talented people, no matter if they be in or out of government, there is a feeling of helplessness when confronted with a situation of social corruption and treacherous court officials in power, because the autocrat's power is for life. Moreover, there are no means of correcting the autocrat's mistakes, such as in a democratic political system. Therefore, the only recourse is to wait for the corrupt autocrat's death, or carry out a palace coup and social rebellion in order to accomplish a violent change in power. Doing it this way means that society must pay an extremely high price, with the immediate destruction of an era of prosperity built up through painstaking efforts. "Tang Ming Emperor"'s Warning The "rapidly endangered syndrome" that "The Tang Ming Emperor" warns of is: We are now 1,200 years removed from Tang Xuanzhong, and for 200 years there has existed in the world a modern democratic political system which can cure the absolute power syndrome. How then can the Chinese still stupidly await the "new autocrat" who will bring us good fortune? Even the most brilliant autocrat, who carries out reform and operates the whole era of boom, will also be like a rapidly rising balloon which will quickly burst; how can we take a political mirage as our future? Reform under absolute power is absolutely unreliable!
