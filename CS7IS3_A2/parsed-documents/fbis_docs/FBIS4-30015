And how did you feel when you were asked? [Toyoda] He whispered in my ear during a party held on 13 January to celebrate the accomplishment of the economic report by the Economic Reform Research Council [a private advisory panel to Morihiro Hosokawa, the previous Prime Minister]. I did not know what answer to give, because I was taken unawares by his proposal. Moreover, the next day, I had to leave for Britain on business. So, I replied: "Please let me have time to consider it. I will give you a definite answer after I return." [Sato] But, I suppose you had a hunch that you would be picked as the new chairman, after Vice Chairman Akio Morita [chairman of Sony Corp.], who had widely been viewed as the most likely successor to Mr. Hiraiwa, suffered a sudden illness at the end of 1993. [Toyoda] No, I never had such an idea. I read on the electronic newsboard that Mr. Morita was struck by a sudden illness while on board a Shinkansen bullet train. Moreover, the electronic newsboard further reported: "Opinions would be adjusted within Keidanren, with Toyoda as the top candidate for the next chairmanship." To speak the truth, I felt embarrassed when I saw it saying that I was regarded as likely to take such an important position of high responsibility. However, I have been pondering over the matter since the beginning of January, when Mr. Hiraiwa, the previous chairman, spoke to me in private about the next chairmanship. After due consideration, I decided to take up the post and fulfill my duties by offering myself to the organization, since the post must be assumed by someone, and since it came to be my turn to take it. When I explained my resolution to my company's honorary chairman (Eiji Toyoda, honorary Toyota Motor Corp. chairman and former Keidanren vice chairman), he got really angry with me. He said, "What are you talking about? Our company will be quite embarrassed if you undermine your health by assuming such a post." However, he never said: "All right, take up the post but just take it easy." (laughter) I think he wanted to say, "Do your best but take care of yourself." His words are now engraved in my mind. [Sato] The business world is also being driven to reform following the collapse in the summer of 1993 of the so-called "1955 order" of one-party rule by the Liberal Democratic Party. In terms of Japanese corporate management, the current recession has killed the business world's 1955 order premised on growth. The business world is now under pressure to restructure itself. [Toyoda] Yes, I am fully aware of the situation. In a word, Keidanren's role under the 1955 order of the business world was to represent corporate interests. Keidanren was built based on the idea of the high-growth period; namely, the idea that corporate interests are directly connected with improvement of the nation's standard of living. Such an idea was warrantable under an economic system based on high economic growth and founded under the slogan "Let's catch up and pass the West." However, whether we are willing or not, it is now indispensable to build a new economic structure that gives priority to consumers interests, given that the Japanese economy has not only caught up with the West but surpassed it. This inevitably brings on a change in Keidanren's role, and it is only right for us to change our way of thinking. The Power of Execution Produces the Power of Execution [Sato) This is why Keidanren's raison d'etre is now called into question. Some people are of the opinion that since the economic structure under which corporate interests were equivalent to the people's welfare has disappeared, Keidanren's mission is over. They say that Keidanren should now transform itself into a think tank. [Toyoda] It is true that, until now, Keidanren's activity has been based on the idea that corporate interests are equivalent to the people's welfare. However, it is not at all the case that this was the only justification for Keidanren's existence. Since its inauguration, Keidanren has made policy proposals to the government and the relevant agencies, after canvassing the opinions of major industries and companies. Keidanren's definite opinion was a reflection of the times. Keidanren once represented corporate interests, but from now on, it will attach greater importance to the protection of consumer interests. Making proposals does not represent the only justification of Keidanren's existence. Translating these proposals into action is also its raison d'etre. For instance, until now, there have been many pertinent policy proposals, such as the so-called Maekawa Report [submitted in 1986, the Report called for changing Japan's export-oriented economy to one led by domestic demand] and the five-year economic plan for a better quality of life [submitted in 1992]. Unfortunately, these proposals were not realized. In the case of the Maekawa Report, right after it was submitted to the government, Japan's domestic consumption rose sharply due to the so-called bubble economy. This is why we got a false impression that the proposals made by the Maekawa Report were somehow put into effect. However, after the collapse of the bubble economy, we realized that nothing had been carried out. [Toyoda continues] Many important issues of the day, including deregulation, are raised in the so-called Hiraiwa Report submitted by the Economic Reform Research Council. The proposed plan is realizable. Since it made the proposals, Keidanren has to execute them in a definite way. That is Keidanren's great mission. [Sato] In September 1993, the previous chairman, Mr. Hiraiwa, decided to stop channeling billions of yen in political donations to political parties through the National Political Association on the behalf of major industries and companies. Many people now wonder what will be left to Keidanren, once it is deprived of its function of passing along political donations. The argument is that, because the organization's influence on politicians and bureaucrats will decrease if its function of passing along political donations ceases, Keidanren will lack the power of execution. [Toyoda] I have to correct this misunderstanding. I would like to make it clear that Keidanren's influence has not been grounded only on passing along political donations. Its influence overlaps with its raison d'etre. As I just explained, Keidanren gathers different opinions from major industries and companies to make proposals. It also urges the Diet, the government, and the concerned agencies to take the necessary steps to implement these proposals. Meanwhile, member companies act together to put them into effect. Our words are backed up with deeds, and this is the source of our influence. Keidanren played an important role in maintaining and developing a liberal economic system during the Cold War era. Channeling billions of yen in political donations to political parties was simply a means to attain this end. However, political donations are now perceived differently, given that political parties differ little from each other in policy following the 1955 order's collapse that triggered political realignment. With the growing public opinion that political parties should depend less on corporate donations and that political fund-raising should be made more transparent, Keidanren decided to abolish its political-donations role. Keidanren's position is that political parties should depend on government subsidies and private donations, while corporate donations should be reviewed, or even abolished, after a certain period of time. With such a trend of the times, there is less and less significance in passing along political donations. From now on, Keidanren's influence should be based on its power to implement its proposals. Therefore, I will stick with Mr. Hiraiwa's decision to abolish Keidanren's political-donations role. Moreover, to study how business and politics should be, I am planning to set up a new committee within Keidanren. It will called the Committee on Business and Politics. The Influence of Japan's Largest Manufacturer [Sato] Your remark that implementing its proposals is the source of Keidanren's influence has deep significance. When we look at the history of Keidanren, we realize that each time Keidanren has exerted great influence, its chairmanship was always assumed by a business leader from a major company that had a great influence on the Japanese economy of the time. In other words, if the said company sets an example to others by promptly translating Keidanren's idea into action, Keidanren's other member companies are forced to follow suit. Therefore, it is certain that your background will help strengthen the power of execution not merely of Keidanren, but of the whole business world. You come from the automobile industry, one of the key Japanese industries of today. Moreover, you belong to Japan's largest manufacturing company. [Toyoda] Japan is a nation without natural resources. Therefore, it imports materials, processes them, and exports the resulting products in order to earn dollars. With the money earned, Japan can buy food and oil from other countries. This is the foundation of Japan, at the center of which is the nation's manufacturing industry. Personally, I do not feel that I am chairing Keidanren as a representative of the automobile industry. I simply think that the automobile industry's turn to take the chair has come because of the needs of the times. Seen from the viewpoint of industrial changes, Keidanren's top post should preferably be assumed by a business leader coming from an industry that stands half a step behind the leading edge, because unity and consensus is forged more easily within the organization under a leader coming from such an industry. It so happened that I have been working for an industry that is half a step behind the leading edge. Of course, having a chairman from the automobile industry is a plus for the organization in some respects. The automobile industry has always walked in step with consumers. My experiences may be useful in developing the theme of living together in harmony with consumers, which will be the core of Keidanren's future policies. Let me add a few more words as the leader of a company that bears the brunt of attack in the Japan-U.S. trade friction. Our company has been ahead of the government in trying to ease trade friction. When U.S. President George Bush came to Japan in January 1992, we committed ourselves to increasing our purchases of foreign auto parts and trying to sell more imported vehicles in Japan. We have fulfilled our pledges. If you ask me, automobiles have been raised as an issue in the Japan-U.S. Framework trade talks, but there have been no problems in talks between companies at the industry level. The problem is one of macroeconomics rather than microeconomics. [Sato] Let me now ask you about specific policy proposals. What kind of new goals does the "Toyoda's Keidanren" have in mind? [Toyoda] Our first goal is deregulation. Since March, Keidanren has announced a series of deregulation proposals for each area. We put all these proposals together and submitted a report to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 13 May. We will now strongly urge the concerned authorities, including the government's office for the promotion of administrative reform, to put them into practice. In fact, deregulation is not likely to be implemented if we continue to leave it to government officials to examine deregulation plans and monitor their implementation at their own discretion. This is why a third-party monitoring body composed chiefly of individuals from the private sector is going to be set up in accordance with the law. We are tentatively calling it the "Administrative Reform Committee" and are planning to implement deregulation through it. I have already asked previous Chairman Hiraiwa to head the Committee. Administrative reform, which is directly connected with deregulation, is also an important issue. When companies try to do something new, they generally meet strong administrative resistance. We cannot achieve our goal as long as interministerial barriers are not abolished. As an example, let me explain the case of the Export Inspection and Design Council, in which I am involved. This advisory body to the international trade and industry minister still has many posts that were created a long time ago when Japanese export products had to be examined carefully because of poor quality. I am really surprised that even a ministry like the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] still preserves such posts. However, if the ministry decides to abolish the regulation related to export inspection, it will have to relocate about 2,000 officials elsewhere. The fact is that it can hardly eliminate the regulation immediately. Deregulation inevitably inflicts pain not merely on ministries and agencies but on the industry as well. Despite the pain, we should promote deregulation. Otherwise, Japan will fall into discredit with the world. Once deregulation measures are implemented, the Japanese market will be opened, bringing about a decline in prices. In other words, we are convinced that deregulation will serve the best interests of the Japanese people. To make our conviction known to our overseas partners, we should make greater efforts to promote deregulation. [Sato] The Japan-U.S. framework trade talks have made clear that Japan is not trusted by the world, right? [Toyoda] I think that, when the bilateral framework talks collapsed in February, what collapsed in particular was the relationship of trust between Japan and the United States. Although the United States expected that Japan would implement income tax cuts for three consecutive years to stimulate domestic demand, the Japanese side came up with a plan to cut income taxes for just one year. Moreover, Japan was unable to give specific figures to explain the impact of the yearly income tax cut on the Japanese economy. Under such circumstances, a relationship of trust can hardly be established between the two countries. [Sato] It is certain that the government's decision was influenced by the Finance Ministry's firm resolution to accept income tax cuts only in exchange for an increase in the consumption tax to cover the loss in revenue. The problem is that Japan passed up a precious opportunity to stimulate its sluggish economy because of the Finance Ministry, which strongly put forth such an argument from the very beginning. [Toyoda] I once said to former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa: "If we compare the government to a company, the Finance Ministry is equivalent to the general accounting division. If there is no prospect of good business, the general accounting division would never say that the company can spend as much money as it wants. However, the decision does not lie with the general accounting division, but with the company president, which is you, Prime Minister Hosokawa." Then, I added: "Let's revive the national economy first by implementing income tax cuts. We can expect extra tax revenue once the economy picks up. The president should not leave the decision to the general accounting division. He must decide by himself." Unfortunately, all my advice was in vain. If the prime minister had followed my advice, Japan would have not incurred the mistrust of the United States. I really regret this. [Sato] You may say so, but the problem is that Japan's top leader changes too frequently. The general accounting division probably exercised precaution against a possible change in government (laughter). What do you think of the current political chaos? [Toyoda] It is very difficult to foresee future political developments because Japanese politics is now in a transition period. Starting with the Diet deliberations for the fiscal 1994 budget, the government must tackle a pile of pending domestic and international issues, such as tax reform and the G-7 summit meeting. Therefore, I want both the ruling coalition and the opposition to proceed with the Diet deliberations in all seriousness without producing a political vacuum, and to cooperate with each other in dealing with the pending domestic and international issues. Sorry for repeating myself, but I would like to remind the government that if Japan disappoints the United States again with its tax reform plan, it will completely lose the confidence of its partner. With respect to political realignment, the industrial world is not in a position to say much, because this issue should reflect the will of the people. However, I think it would be desirable for Japan to have a political system of alternating governments. I have no idea about the ideal number of political parties. At least, however, I think that it is a problem to have so many small parties, as we do now. There is no basis to the argument that Japan must establish a two-party system like that of the United States. However, it is no good to have 10 or 12 political parties. [Sato] Concerning Japan-U.S. trade friction, what, specifically, are your thoughts on plans to cut Japan's trade surplus? [Toyoda] Japan first has to achieve economic growth led by domestic demand in a domestic economic recovery, that is, through a revised and expanded public works program. We would then promote a structural reform of the Japanese economy through deregulation and market opening. There is no alternative to putting these two sound proposals into practice. It is also necessary to correct the value of the yen against the dollar to an appropriate level that corresponds to the real state of the Japanese economy. In my opinion, the Japanese economy can tolerate appreciation of the yen to the 110-yen level against the dollar. The ideal level would be around 120 yen to the dollar. Many companies, which recently announced their performance for the past year, have said that they have projected an exchange rate of 105 yen against the dollar for the next term. They are all dispirited because of the gloomy future. I think the 110-yen level is the maximum handicap that Japan can overcome somehow or other by making strenuous efforts. [Sato] Regarding the bilateral framework talks, there was a long dispute over the question of whether or not to set numerical targets as a political pledge. Seen from a macroeconomics viewpoint, setting numerical targets is not considered necessarily a minus for Japan. [Toyoda] Numerical targets, which are directly connected to managed trade, conflict with the spirit of GATT. Therefore, it is not possible to endorse such an idea. Meanwhile, it is certain that Japan will not be able to win the confidence of the United States, as long as it does not clearly indicate its policy to its partner. Japan and the United States had previously agreed to apply objective criteria to measure progress in sectoral talks, which is part of the framework trade negotiations. Both sides had agreed to use objective criteria, and not numerical targets. However, the problem is that once the yardstick is fixed, concrete figures can easily be obtained anytime through measurement. I think Japan and the United States should bear this in mind when they try to restore a relationship of mutual trust. No Change in Nation Based on Processing Trade [Sato] The upsurge of the yen against the dollar is fueling fears over a hollowing out of Japanese industry. What kind of measures are you considering to cope with this situation? [Toyoda] A hollowing out of industry worries me the most. Japan is based on processing trade, and this will not change in the future. We must not forget that Japan is a country that works hard and exports the fruits of its efforts, namely high-value-added products. Therefore, if industry hollows out, Japan is finished. Having said that, what is to be done? First, industrial restructuring should be done quickly to protect the international competitiveness of domestic industries. Second, new industries should be created. Concerning the creation of new industries, I think that nothing is more pressing than improving the educational system. Japan has heard the cry a number of times that there was a crisis of hollowing out. Each time, Japan successfully created new industries. Education is the source of new industries. However, of present concern is the recent lag in education, particularly in the teaching of science and technology. One of the causes is the poor condition of the facilities at university engineering departments. But I think that another problem is corporate attitude. The corporate attitude on hiring has perhaps been one of educating people once they enter the company. Individuals with a master's degree are welcomed, but those with doctorates are not needed. Therefore, companies usually try to recruit postgraduate students right after they have completed the master's course. This is not an environment for bringing up creative people. I think Keidanren can lend a hand here to help improve the situation. [Sato] Did your appointment to Keidanren's top post bring on a change in your company's behavior? Toyota Motor Corp. was once noted for what has been called the "Toyota Monroe doctrine." Toyota used to withdraw into its shell. [Toyoda] When I became chairman of the company, I completely left the company's business in the charge of the new president [Toyoda's brother]. I did not give any specific instruction to my company after I was appointed Keidanren chairman. As a matter of course, I want my company not to hesitate to feel the pain of deregulation, because in some way, Toyota is also living in peace within the framework of government regulations. Will deregulation mean a conflict of interests between Toyota and its partners? Or will Toyota try to change its corporate culture to seek common interests with its partners? That will be the problem. For the moment, I have already warned our dealers and our auto parts suppliers that Toyota will probably annoy them in the near future (laughter). As for Toyota's behavior, I have been worried that my company might exercise severe restraint in its behavior because it produced a Keidanren chairman, and that it might consequently lose its vitality. On the other hand, I have also been worried that my company might take an attitude of arrogant superiority because it produced a Keidanren chairman, and that it might lose its philosophy of working hard to provide good products at lower prices. Fortunately, I recently understood that there was no need for such apprehension, after observing the behavior of our employees. It may sound paradoxical, but the current recession is turning out to be advantageous to Toyota in this case. The Japanese economic situation is so serious that our employees cannot be in a festive mood just because their chairman was appointed to Keidanren's top post (laughter). [Sato] We understand that you decided the lineup of vice chairmen in the new Keidanren after consulting with former Chairman Hiraiwa. Do you think you made the best choice? [Toyoda] For now, this is the best lineup. If possible, I had wanted the four outgoing vice chairmen to remain. However, that is expecting too much, because I have to follow Keidanren's bylaws. I believe I made the best choice under the existing bylaws. If we consider that Keidanren consists of major industries and companies, however, the securities and construction industries are also needed. Considering the structure of industry, I would like to request that those two industries join us at some point. Many people seem to find it strange that the steel industry is missing from the new lineup. This is because I have asked recently departed Vice Chairman Hiroshi Saito (Nippon Steel Corp. chairman) to take up another important post, namely that of chairman of Keidanren's council. There is no vice chairman from the steel industry simply because my first consideration was keeping a balanced representation. I Will Be a Chairman of the Toshio Doko Type [Sato] Do you have any specific Keidanren chairman in mind as your ideal? [Toyoda] Personally, I am not very conscious of it, but since I am from a manufacturing company, I should bear some resemblance to the two former chairmen from Toshiba Corp.: Taizo Ishizaka [who served as Keidanren's second chairman, from 1956 to 1968] and Toshio Doko [who served as the fourth chairman, from 1974 to 1980]. As I do not know Mr. Ishizaka very well, I feel closer to Mr. Doko. However, in terms of personality, the person I know the best is Mr. Hiraiwa. So I feel strongly inclined to follow Mr. Hiraiwa's pattern, because I have a long acquaintance with him and because I am very familiar with his ideas and remarks as Keidanren chairman. As for Mr. Yoshiro Inayama of Nippon Steel Corp. [who served as the fifth chairman, from 1980 to 1986], he had a strong tendency to favor managed trade, such that he was even dubbed "Mr. Cartel." There was always a conflict of opinions between us. Each time I objected to him, he always said, "You may say so, but I and the Prime Minister are the only Japanese that really have the best interests of the nation at heart. You fellows, you do nothing but think of your own companies." I have now come to believe that there are many things to be learned from his arrogant remarks. [Sato] You said at the beginning that you have been told by honorary Chairman Eiji Toyoda to take good care of yourself. Are you still playing golf to maintain your health? [Toyoda] These days, my score is always 90 or more. I get into my stride on the front nine, but I go off my game on the back nine because my stamina gives out. A few days ago, I shot a 42 on the front nine. Although I thought I would easily finish with a total of less than 90, I shot a 48 on the back nine. I usually explain to my golf partners that I am adjusting my score on the back nine to make my partners win the game because I am now a shrewd merchant (laughter). [Sato] That's funny. This is why Mr. Eishiro Saito [who served as Keidanren's sixth chairman, from 1986 to 1990] jokingly said that you are like the chief of the secretarial section, who makes every effort not to win the game when he plays with important persons with whom his company has dealings. [Toyoda] But now, even if I give my whole heart to the game, my score differs little from the one of the secretarial section chief (laughter).
