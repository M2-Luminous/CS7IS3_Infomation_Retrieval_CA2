Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, made the call during an inspection of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province this week. He stressed that government officials should help people with difficulties to enjoy the Spring Festival holiday, which falls February 10. The living standards of the Chinese people have been markedly improved thanks to rapid economic growth. However, some people have not benefited as much as others from the economic prosperity, he said. He emphasized that the party is determined to make sure that economic development is geared in such a way that nobody is left out in the national drive for a better life. Li, who also doubles as chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the country's top political advisory body, said that the government should consider the interests of the people in every aspect. He pointed out that it should by all means guarantee the basic living conditions of the broad masses, who have not so far benefited from the reform measures. He noted that while most people will benefit from the reforms, not every individual is entitled to improvement at the same time and to the same degree. He urged Communist Party officials to attend to people's needs and curtail official spending in order to appropriate funds to aid people suffering hardships.
