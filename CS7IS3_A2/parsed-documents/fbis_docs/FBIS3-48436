The North side headquarters of Pomminnyon said this in a statement Monday denouncing the South Korean authorities for blocking the southern trip of the North side's mourning group for the late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a pro-reunification patriot. The statement brands this act as an intolerable insult to the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon and all those concerned with Pomminnyon and compatriots at home and abroad and one more political persecution of the deceased who devoted his all to the patriotic movement for reunification of Pomminnyon. It further says: "The Rev. Mun Ik-hwan was a leading figure of the movement for democracy and reunification who, from the first days of the Pomminnyon-led movement, fought for the founding of an organisation of Pomminnyon and its legalisation in South Korea, braving all manner of persecution and suppression. "To regard Pomminnyon as an `organisation benefiting the enemy' is, in the final analysis, to regard the whole nation as an enemy, and is a criminal act that can be done only by those who are opposed to the unity of the nation and reunification. "By blocking the Seoul trip of our mourners' group the Kim Yong-sam group made it plain that `national reconciliation' and `divorce from the military dictatorship' declared by it so often are lies and that it is a group of traitors and anti-reunification elements outdistancing the preceding military dictators." Noting that today all the fellow countrymen in the North, the South and overseas are turning out as one in the struggle to achieve reunification in the 90s by united efforts of the nation at any cost, the statement stresses the need to immediately cut out the cancerous being swimming against this trend of the nation.
