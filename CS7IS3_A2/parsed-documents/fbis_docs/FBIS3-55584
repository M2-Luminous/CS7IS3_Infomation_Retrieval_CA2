The presidents of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan are expected to hold a meeting there on January 11. This meeting will continue the work started in Kyzyl-Orda last March when the leaders of the five countries agreed on joint action to rescue the Aral Sea and help the coastal areas. The coordination committee of the Central Asian countries has drafted numerous documents for this meeting, notably guidelines on the interstate council and its executive committee and a concept of ways to revive the Aral Sea. Informed sources close to the Uzbek government told Interfax that the leaders of the Central Asian republics would discuss numerous economic problems in introduction of national currencies when they meet in Nukus. Cooperation in the ecological or any other sphere is impossible unless these problems are resolved, the sources believe.
