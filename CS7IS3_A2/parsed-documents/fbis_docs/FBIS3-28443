An instance of it is the report of the Japanese weekly magazine SHUKAN BUNSHUN that Russian scientists helped the DPRK in "the development of nuclear weapons". Recalling that the chief of the general staff of the Russian Armed Forces laid bare the falsity of the article carried in the Japanese weekly, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today exposes the purpose of the anti-DPRK smear campaign of the Japanese reactionaries. The analyst says: The Japanese reactionaries are trying to hinder the triumphant advance of our republic and the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. They have so far noisily vociferated about "nuclear development" by the DPRK in an attempt to isolate it and used it as a pretext to step up their own nuclear armament. If the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is fundamentally solved, Japan will lose the pretext to accelerate its nuclear armament. In setting abroad the fiction of "assistance of Russian experts," it is motivated by a sinister design to obstruct the solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. It is a foolish act for the Japanese reactionaries to attempt to disparage our socialism with fabrications. They should clearly understand the anthropocentric socialism of Korean style and stop running amuck. Their anti-DPRK false propaganda will bring no favorable result to Japan.
