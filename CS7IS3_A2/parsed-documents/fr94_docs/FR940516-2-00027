FR940516-2-00027 FR940516-2-00021 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Morgantown Energy Technology Center; Financial Assistance Award (Grant Renewal) AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Morgantown Energy Technology Center. ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance renewal award. SUMMARY: Based upon a determination made pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) Criteria (A), the DOE, Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC) gives notice of its plans to award a grant renewal to Syracuse University, Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials Science Department, c/o Office of Sponsored Programs, 113 Bowne Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244&hyph;1200, in the amount of approximately $150,000 and covers a twelve (12) month budget period. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly J. Harness, I&hyph;07, U.S. Department of Energy, Morgantown Energy Technology Center, P.O. Box 880, Morgantown, West Virginia 26507&hyph;0880. Telephone: (304) 291&hyph;4089. Procurement Request No. 21&hyph;94MC28072.501. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The pending award is based on a renewal application for continuing work of an activity presently being funded by DOE and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the activity. The grant is to provide financial assistance to Syracuse University for conducting research focused on the utilization of low-quality natural gas by economically upgrading the gas to pipeline quality via membrane separation processes. The objective of this follow-on effort is to evaluate the potential usefulness of membrane separation processes for the removal of acid gases, water vapor, and nitrogen from low-quality natural gas. The effort will comprise gas permeability and separation measurements, process design studies, and economic evaluations using novel membrane configurations which were developed under the current grant. By providing financial support, DOE expects to stimulate utilization of U.S. natural gas resources, reduce oil imports, and help stabilize our energy supply. Louie L.
