MITI will reduce the number of items subject to the "government certification system" which makes it mandatory for the government to check whether commercial electrical goods meet the safety standard and expand a "self-certification system" which leaves the makers of commercial electrical goods free to manufacture them if their goods are found to meet the government-set safety standard. MITI plans to allow about 100 items including washing machines be manufactured under the new self-certification system. MITI intends to put the new self-certification system into effect within this year after concluding that technological progress has reduced the danger of accidents. MITI intends to take these measures to help Japanese enterprises lighten their burdens and make it easy for foreign firms to gain access to the Japanese market. Nonetheless, Japanese enterprises will take greater responsibility for the safety of their goods. Currently, the Consumer Goods Safety Law sets the safety standard for passenger helmets and other goods, whereas the government sets the safety standard for commercial electrical goods including gas appliances. Hence, no Japanese makers are allowed to manufacture and sell their commercial electric goods unless their goods meet the safety standard. To manufacture and sell commercial electric goods under the self-certificate system, makers are required to file their registrations with MITI and then to obtain model certificates from the Japan Electric Goods Research Institute and other government-designated research institutes after passing MITI's on-site inspection of their plants. At the present, 282 commercial electrical goods items are subject to the government certification system. MITI plans to apply the self-certificate system to about one hundred commercial electrical items, whose manufacturers guarantee that those commercial electrical goods meet the government-set safety standard. The Electrical Goods Safety Study Panel (an advisory body for chief of the Public Utilities Department in the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy) will hold a meeting in July to compile a list of specific commercial electrical goods which can be manufactured under the self-certification system. Such gas appliances as gas bathroom heating valves, gas-heated pressure pans and pots will be kept under the government certification system. MITI, however, will study the possibility of shifting the government certification system to the self-certification system for other consumer gas appliances including gas hot water heaters. The Consumer Goods Safety Law puts six items such as passenger helmets, baby beds, pressure pots and roller skates under the government certification system, but MITI will study the possibility of shifting them to the self-certification system. The "safety standard and certification system in Japan is complex and the system has been criticized by other nations as Japan's nontariff barrier." Preparations for enactment of the property liability law have made headway and a system is being created whereby consumers are kept from suffering damages from defective goods. MITI has decided to increase the number of electrical consumer goods that can be manufactured under the self-certification system with those developments taken into consideration. The relaxation of the government safety standard and certification system will be incorporated in another package of external economic measures that the government will map out in June this year.
