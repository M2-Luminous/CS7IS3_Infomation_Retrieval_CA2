On December 18 to 22 last year, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) on the Chinese Mainland and the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) held working talks in Taibei [Taipei]. The working talks attained positive results, including the consensus that in principle hijackers must be repatriated, the commentary says. However, the SEF issued a statement on December 22 saying, that although the ARATS eagerly wants to have the hijackers repatriated, it is not willing to face up to the "equal judicial jurisdiction entitled to our side." Originally, the discussions between the ARATS and the SEF were aimed at seeking practical and realistic measures acceptable to the two sides to solve concrete problems in the people-to-people contacts across the straits, considering that political differences exist between the two sides across the straits. The ARATS has reaffirmed that the political differences between the two sides should not become an obstacle to consultations between the two organizations. Many times the ARATS has put forward practical and realistic and rational suggestions for seeking ways to reach an agreement. However, the Taiwan authorities called the suggestions "defying the equal judicial jurisdiction entitled to Taiwan" and refused to accept them. It should be pointed out that, under the present situation in which political differences between the two sides can not be resolved at once, the practical way to solve the repatriation of hijackers and other issues is to avoid sensitive political problems and take a positive and realistic attitude to seek measures for resolving the issues, which can be accepted by both sides, within the scope of discussions of the two organizations. The issue of judicial jurisdiction is essentially a political one, the commentary says. The Taiwan authorities' sticking to the so-called "equal judicial jurisdiction" or "reciprocal right to the judicial administration" during the routine business talks of mass organizations is a covert attempt to create "two Chinas" and will never work. The "Wang-Ku" meeting concluded agreements and the two organizations have made progress in routine talks, thus paving the way for solving concrete problems in contacts among compatriots on both sides of the straits. To better prevent the criminal offense of hijacking, the civil aviation departments on the mainland have strengthened safety examinations. Naturally, the Taiwan authorities should adopt necessary measures to cooperate in settling the issue of a handful of evil-doers hijacking passenger planes to Taiwan, the commentary says.
