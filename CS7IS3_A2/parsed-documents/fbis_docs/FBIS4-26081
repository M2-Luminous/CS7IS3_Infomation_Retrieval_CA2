According to media reports, the council has churned out a document to propose that the government proceed into the second phase of the National Reunification Guidelines next year. The second phase of the guidelines allows official exchanges in direct trade between Taiwan and Mainland China, which are currently banned. The first phase currently in effect only allows indirect trade and civilian contacts. The media reports said: The council has made a proposal anticipating Taiwan will join the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade at the end of the year. A council spokesman stressed: Only after Peking recognizes Taipei as a political entity and stops isolating Taiwan internationally will the government here proceed into the second phase of the National Reunification Guidelines.
