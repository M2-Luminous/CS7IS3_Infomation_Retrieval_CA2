"We can make plenty of efforts to improve the standard of living in North Korea. I would like to ask you to open your hearts," Hata told an interpellation session in the House of Representatives Budget Committee. He stressed, however, that Japan should tie up with the United States, South Korea and China to discuss a response to the breakdown of negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea. IAEA inspectors left Pyongyang on Saturday after being denied an opportunity to take samples from spent fuel rods, discharged from North Korea's 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, to verify whether nuclear material has been diverted in the past. The United Nations Security Council, which has the power to impose sanctions to enforce the IAEA request, is slated to discuss this latest development in the longstanding nuclear controversy Tuesday. Speaking at the same lower house budget panel, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said that the UN nuclear watchdog, nonetheless, continues unofficial talks with Pyongyang over the monitoring of the fuel rod exchange and full inspections of the country's nuclear facilities. "The IAEA after its pullout is continuing (negotiations), though it is not possible to say publicly where and with whom," Kakizawa said. The U.S., South Korea and other Western nations allege that North Korea is attempting to build atomic weapons. North Korea claims its nuclear program pursues strictly civilian purposes, but has repeatedly refused to comply with nuclear safeguard accords it signed with the agency.
