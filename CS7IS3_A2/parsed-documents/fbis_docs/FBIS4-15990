Replying to questions, he noted in particular: "On the whole, I am satisfied with the elections to the new parliament but I expected somewhat better results... I think (and I am not the only one: the overwhelming majority of Ukrainian citizens are striving to create a democratic, law-based society) that it would have been impossible not to have held the elections. A competent and full-blooded Supreme Council was elected which, I think, will do everything to continue and improve drafted legislation and continue the legislative process." Touching on the issue of political forces which are now emerging on the political arena, Ivan Plyushch stressed: "This is an ambiguous issue. Today, in my view, some journalists and politicians are attempting to draw hasty conclusions such as whether the `left-wing' or the `right-wing' gained victory. If we had a structured society, a `left-wing' and `right-wing', then one could draw such conclusions. There are now accusations that almost 100 `left-wing' deputies won seats in the new parliament. I personally know many of these people and am familiar with their elections programs. I would not be able to find a single person among them who would state that he is taking up his seat in order to fight against the process that is currently taking place. They have different views as regards the tactics... We cannot unequivocally accept the assertion that the democratic forces suffered defeat. In the new parliament there is a strong center. It is a constructive force that will be the base which will attract both the `left-wing' and the `right-wing'... Obviously, there will still be a radical `right-wing' and `left-wing,' but this situation also exists in civilized and democratic countries. The speaker expressed his views on the defeat at the elections of famous politicians. "I think this is a perfectly normal phenomenon for a young democracy and for our society because when they were in parliament many of the deputies often spoke in the name of our people but had contacts with an insignificant part of the population. They would express the `people's views' from such a small number of people but when they went to the masses it transpired that their views were not shared or there was a lack of trust that these deputies reflected these views and actions. Second, I am not making a tragedy out of the fact that people expect changes. Objectively, people always relate this to hopes for a new democratic or political force and to its arrival in parliament..." The chairman of the Supreme Council also touched on relations with Russia. He noted: "When I met representatives of the Duma after 27 March, I thought that the forces in Russia who understood that Ukraine is here to stay would begin to mature. The latest actions by the Ukrainian president and the Supreme Council give no grounds for an aggravation of relations between Ukraine and Russia and other countries. But recently, for some reason, just when the shoots of political stability appeared in Ukraine, when a positive tendency was observed in the economy, and when debts began to be paid back to Russia, political forces appeared in Russia which attempted to convince everybody that Russia could not live without Ukraine and Ukraine could not live without Russia. Obviously, the `Crimean card' is being played more and more although in a conversation with members of the Duma, I said that I could not imagine resolving the Crimean issue in favor of Ukraine or Russia. There are representatives of three nations there. Who is going to say that the Crimean Tatars do not have the right to their own autonomy? Who is going to say that Crimea's Russian-speaking population is guilty of something? What is going to happen with the Ukrainians who make up a third of the population? Crimea should be Crimean. It should be an autonomy within the composition of Ukraine. The borders have already been recognized. Treaties have been signed within the framework of the CSCE and the United Nations and interstate treaties have been concluded. A tripartite statement was signed between the presidents of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia on the recognition of borders. I estimate that the population of Crimea is very cautious about all these processes and people there are now troubled by where President Meshkov's policies could lead to..." The speaker noted that provided deputies support the proposal, the first session of parliament will take place between 10-15 May.
