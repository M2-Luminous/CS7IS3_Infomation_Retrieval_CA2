At a forum on the management and supervision of futures markets in the country, Liu said that at present, the conditions for China to promote all-round development of the futures market are not ripe. More than 40 futures markets have been set up in China over the past few years. There are also more than 300 futures trading companies approved by local authorities. Liu said that some of the futures markets and futures trading companies operate in line with the standards of the international market and a few futures exchanges have produced effects on the formation of the prices in China's production and circulation sectors. He said that the development of the futures exchanges has also met many problems such as exceeding the allowable number of exchanges and nonstandard operation of some futures exchanges. These problems not only impede the positive function of the futures market, but also affect the implementation of the state's macro control policies and social stability, he said. He pointed out that the development of futures markets requires some conditions, involving law and regulations, personnel, business experiences and people's concepts of risk factors. The market environment and market mechanism for futures exchanges also call for improvement. Liu said that the State has to enhance the management and supervision of futures markets. The State Council recently approved the Securities Committee's circular on stopping the tendency of blind development of futures markets, which demanded that local governments rectify futures markets and exchanges. The circular stressed implementing special measures over the futures abroad and dealing with illegal futures trading. The circular said that local governments and all central departments should cease to approve setting up new futures exchanges. No agencies are permitted to engage in futures trading of renminbi (Chinese currency) and foreign currencies. Liu noted that the state enterprises and institutions taking part in futures exchange must be under strict control. The officials of provincial securities management departments and specialists attended the forum.
