"Restrictions on arms sales have been quite strong so far," he said. "Also countries that have been politically close to us and with whom we are cooperating closely for integration with Europe have not been ready to sell us weapons," the Defence Minister said. Estonia has only bought weapons from Israel, Romania and China. Minister Kannik expressed hope that other countries will follow the example of United States and lift their arms sales restrictions. U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday lifted the embargo on arms sales to the three Baltic states, and to Bulgaria, Romania and Albania. A memorandum from the U.S. President to the Secretary of State says that "furnishing of defence articles and services to the governments of ... Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace."
