K. Kozlov, candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, and V. L. Filippov, doctor of physical and mathematical sciences; UDC 535.372:621.892] [Abstract] A study was made of the absorption spectra of some motor oils in the range 25...0.25 �m, fluorescence spectra, excitation of the fluorescence of oils and their change in the course of their use in internal combustion engines. For the identification of these products it was necessary to define those spectral intervals in which considerable differences are observed in the spectra. There are no significant spectral differences for used and unused oils in the range 25...0.6 �m. Several types of spectrometers were used in studying the fluorescence spectra of different oil samples. Substantial differences in the absorption spectra of oils begin to be manifested only in the visible and near-IR spectral ranges. The fluorescence spectra of oils are very highly dependent on the wavelength of the exciting radiation. There also is a change in the form of the fluorescence spectra for used oil in comparison with pure oil. The greater the wavelength of the exciting radiation, the more are the fluorescence spectra shifted into the shorter-range region. A design of an instrument for determining the total quantity of petroleum products in water, accompanied by a block diagram, is briefly described. It is based on a nitrogen laser operating at a wavelength 337.1 nm. Figures 4; references: 3 Russian.
