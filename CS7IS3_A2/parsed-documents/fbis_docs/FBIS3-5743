Hosokawa made the remark in a meeting with Gerard Longuet, the French trade and industry minister, at the prime minister's official residence Thursday [10 March]. Longuet invited Hosokawa to France as early as possible, the official said. Hosokawa did not make clear when he wants to visit France, the official said. Longuet was quoted as telling Hosokawa that France and Japan can cooperate in helping reconstruct Cambodia from years of civil strife and contribute to the international community together. He also lauded Hosokawa's courage to institute national reforms, including the recently achieved political reform, the official said. Longuet arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday for talks with Japanese Government and business leaders and to attend an international conference on assistance to Cambodia, which opened its two-day session at a Tokyo hotel Thursday.
