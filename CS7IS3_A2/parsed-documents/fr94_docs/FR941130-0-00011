FR941130-0-00011 FR941130-0-00002 The Board notes, however, that under the final rule the Board may grant exceptions, for good cause shown, from the requirements of the final rule. In response to comments on this issue, on a case-by-case basis the Board will consider waiving the depositor voting requirement if it is demonstrated, to the Board's satisfaction, that the alternative voting mechanism established under the applicable state law satisfies the concerns expressed above about the need for a vote on the conversion by parties that are not insiders and do not have a potential conflict of interest in reviewing the proposed conversion. The Board also continues to believe that, given the material change in structure represented by the bank's conversion to stock form, it is imperative that any vote on the proposed conversion be made on the basis of full and current information on the proposed transaction. For that reason, the final rule prohibits the use of running proxies in such transactions. This is in keeping with the FDIC's interest in assuring full disclosure of all information on the proposed conversion in order to assure that approval of the proposed conversion is fully informed. Thus, the final rule adopts the prohibition in the Proposed Rule on the use of running proxies in the mutual-to-stock conversion process. 4. Restrictions on Management Stock Benefit and MRPs The Proposed Rule included certain restrictions on insider benefits in mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks. In particular, no converted savings bank would be permitted, for one year from the date of the conversion, to implement a stock option plan or management or employee stock benefit plan, other than a tax-qualified employee stock ownership plan, unless: Each of the plans is fully disclosed in the proxy solicitation and conversion stock offering materials; all such plans are approved by a majority of the bank's stockholders, or in the case of a recently formed holding company, its stockholders, prior to implementation and no sooner than the first annual meeting following the conversion; in the case of a savings bank subsidiary of a mutual holding company, all such plans are approved by a majority of stockholders other than its parent mutual holding company prior to implementation and no sooner than the first annual meeting following the stock issuance; for stock option plans, stock options are granted at no lower than the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant; and for management or employee stock benefit plans, no conversion stock is used to fund the plans. These proposed restrictions were prompted by the FDIC's concerns about abuses in many past mutual-to-stock conversions. As indicated in the Proposed Rule, based on a review of numerous proposed conversions, the Board believes that some bank insiders may sacrifice the interests of their institutions and depositors in order to acquire significant amounts of conversion stock and other benefits more advantageously than depositors. Also, in some instances, the issuance of conversion stock to an MRP decreases the opportunity for depositors to obtain conversion stock. Moreover, the issuance of stock options at the conversion price, rather than at the aftermarket trading price, which in many cases has been substantially higher than the conversion price, creates the impression that insider enrichment may be the main reason for the conversion. These factors can reflect negatively on management's fulfillment of its fiduciary obligations. In fact, it may be an inherent conflict of interest for management to decide to convert the bank to stock form when, as part of the proposed conversion, management will reap significant benefits. Independent business judgment is essential to the proper carrying out of a manager's obligations. This judgment may be severely clouded when MRPs are provided as part of the conversion transaction. The FDIC received many comments on the issue of management benefits in conversions and on the proposed FDIC restrictions. Several of them stated that insiders should share in the benefits of conversions because the insiders managed the institution in a safe-and-sound manner. One state thrift regulator (and other commenters) suggested that MRPs be based on the size of the institution and not on ``straight across-the-board percentages''. One national industry trade group noted that ``avoiding the use of across-the-board percentages for MRPs and tailoring their availability more to the size of the institution and their specific business plan objectives and needs would be a reasonable approach''. One mutual savings bank noted that MRPs, stock option plans and employee stock ownership plans ``all encourage more stock ownership and cement an identity among outside shareholders and those who run and work for the company''. It also noted that OTS rules are workable in this regard and should be adopted by the FDIC. Another savings association commented that conversions should not be permitted where there is excessive compensation for insiders, but ``without benefits to insiders there will be no conversions''.
