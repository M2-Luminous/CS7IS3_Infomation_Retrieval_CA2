[Jarcevic] Good evening! [passage omitted] [Reporter] To return to the Serbian-Croatian normalization agreement, a document that only expresses a will and desire to normalize the relations, and constitutes no treaty or anything similar. You have already spoken a bit about this document, finding in it your place as an independent country that will, in a certain historic moment, decide where and with whom it wants to live, observing the political will of the people to the greatest possible extent. Therefore, how do you perceive what is being called the interpretation of this document, the interpretation venturing into the sphere of mutual recognition and the establishment of economic and transportation links. [Jarcevic] The interpretation of this agreement coming from Zagreb should worry us. However, we are used to this as the Croats never speak about the events and their relations with the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] and other countries realistically. They always express their wishes and many people have noticed that this is only a dream of the Croatian politicians. [Reporter] However, I was listening to television last night, I cannot recall exactly which channel it was, to a man who, as I understood it, is envisaged to be the chief of the Croatian bureau in Belgrade, who was stating precisely that the Serbs and the Croats have had enough of mourning clothes and ruins and spoke very calmly, I would say, without any aggravation or stubbornness, or any dwelling on those well-known stories about bits of territories of this or another country. [Jarcevic] Mr. Markovic is right when he says that both sides have had enough of war, bloodshed, destruction, and the decreasing standard of living on both sides. He is right, and I have nothing to add here. However, Mr. Markovic, if he represents the government in Zagreb, could have eliminated all this a few months earlier, in February 1993, when a RSK delegation offered Croatia the establishment of transport, railroad, and postal links, the use of oil pipelines, and everything else that is in the interests of the Republic of Croatia. Without this it cannot consolidate itself and get its economy and its society back on their feet. What is preventing the Croats from accomplishing all these goals is an agreement that they must sign with the RSK representatives. [passage omitted] The Croats have rejected signing any sort of agreement in this sense with the RSK government as everybody would know that this would mean a signature between two countries. Croatia was in a dilemma whether to recognize us or not. It has decided not to recognize us and not to sign any agreements, hoping to now sign such agreements with the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. However, this is illusionary. Croatia will sign with the FRY only the agreements that regard the territory, the economy, and all the rest, of the FRY. Everything that should be regulated on the RSK territory, Croatia must anyway sign with the RSK government. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Mr. Jarcevic, you are a member of the present RSK government. The presidential elections have just ended. It is well known that this post went to Milan Martic. Regarding the events relating to the constitution of the assembly, can you briefly tell us when the constituting session of the assembly, the election of the government, and everything else are envisaged? [Jarcevic] I believe that the assembly will convene next week already and that the new president, Mr. Milan Martic, will entrust the mandate to one of the politicians who originates from the RSK. It is certain that the reconstruction of the government will take place. It is impossible for it to remain in its present makeup, because the president has announced that he would employ more people in the state administration for it to be more efficient. Namely, what has hindered the RSK's development was precisely the lack of efficient administration. You know that the Republic of Croatia has inherited almost the entire state administration and other institutions on the RSK territory, for example, there was not a single archive center. This means that, for decades, the Croatian leaders in the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] have been deliberately taking away from the Serbian ethnic territories anything that resembled an attribute of a state. [Reporter] Therefore, it will be a major task to put all this in order? [Jarcevic] There will be a lot of work and I think that President Martic intends to invite numerous cadres who have sought refuge in the FRY into the administration, economy, police, and the army. [Reporter] Thank you very much.
