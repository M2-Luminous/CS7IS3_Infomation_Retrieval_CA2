Less money for research and development does not automatically dictate a step backward for a company. Consultants of Prognos AG see in outsourcing a chance to become more successful by way of a decreasing trend in costs. Michael Eyett is a physicist with a PhD. He was the technology consultant at the VDI [Association of German Engineers] Technology Center in Duesseldorf. He has been a project manager for Prognos AG in Basle since 1991. Jorg Thietke is a chemist with a PhD. He also worked at the VDI Technology Center in Duesseldorf before he began as a project manager at Prognos Ag in 1991. [Hess] German industry spends too little money for research and development. Do you believe this, Dr. Thietke? [Thietke] I don't buy that lock, stock and barrel. The economy spent just under 56 billion marks for research and development -- R&D for short -- in 1992. This continues to be a large amount. However, in contrast to earlier, the competitive pressure has changed and thus the pressure on the costs for research and development. Results that can be more quickly converted are expected today. [Hess] Consequently, the size of R&D outlays may not be used as the only indicator to measure the economic significance of research. [Eyett] The effective and efficient acquisition of technologies for practical use is much more important. [Hess] Have German companies become too complacent? [Eyett] We find repeatedly that the greatest source of inefficiency in the area of research and development is setting hazy goals. Technology strategies should be matched to the company strategy. For example, take a sensor manufacturer who wants to offer his products for sale at the lowest price. The R&D efforts of this company must consequently concentrate on shorter turn-around times, a lower reject rate, and higher reliability. Too great a fixation by R&D on the further development of product features misses this business strategy. [Hess] Are you saying that in industry often the wrong thing is being researched or developed? [Eyett] In many companies, this is unfortunately correct. [Hess] Can you be somewhat more specific? [Eyett] I do not know of any empirical data. I believe, however, that more than half the companies suffer from the situation that the R&D department is not working in accord with the company goals. [Hess] Does this mean that even industrial researchers are sitting in an ivory tower? [Thietke] I think so. Meanwhile, many companies have recognized this problem. This is one reason why R&D is being decentralized more frequently and organized as a profit center. Such a profit center must finance itself by getting contracts from the operating sectors. [Hess] Prognos AG has recently been advocating the outsourcing of research and development. What do you understand by this? [Thietke] On the one hand, a company can do research and development alone. On the other, it is possible to acquire technologies under license. However, this only works if a developed technology is also available on the market. If this is not so, there is a third option known as outsourcing. This means getting the technology by awarding R&D contracts to third parties. Ideally, this allows access to external know-how permitting a quicker, less expensive and lower risk development than would have been possible within the company. In production, outsourcing is already practiced extensively by shifting component manufacture onto suppliers to an ever increasing degree. After reducing the manufacturing depth, optimization of the R&D depth is the next step. Lean research and development follow lean production. [Hess] To make progress with the development of a product, you need an intensive insight into the problems accompanying this. A company allowing insight into their blueprints opens the way for industrial espionage. [Eyett] In those segments that a company counts among its technological core areas, thus to its main body of knowledge, the company must of course pay attention that not too much of the know-how leaves. This is especially the case for know-how that a company is counting on for its future competitiveness. [Hess] Consequently, is outsourcing only considered if a product development is being started from scratch and thus no know-how can be lost? [Thietke] That is one area. However, even outside the technology core areas--if the object is to round out the main body of knowledge of a company--outsourcing can be worthwhile from a cost perspective in the core business. If the core area of a company lies in the development of complex systems, individual components may be developed somewhere else without the company having to fear that the contractor will turn around and work itself up to become a direct competitor. [Hess] Despite the advantages that you have pointed out, industry is exploring the path of outsourcing only cautiously. [Eyett] That is not so. Of the almost 56 billion that German industry spent for R&D in 1992, six billion flowed to external institutes or companies. I can confirm with numbers that outsourcing in the economy is becoming more popular. In the past 15 years, the total R&D outlay by German industry has tripled. However, the outlay for external R&D increased tenfold in the same time. [Hess] And how will Prognos AG earn money by outsourcing? [Eyett] The matter of concern for us is strategic consulting. In this framework, we can support our customers in deciding what they should outsource and what not for reasons of company and technology strategy. We can also investigate the market to find out which third-party vendors can be brought on board at a reasonable cost for research and development projects. [Hess] Please show us with an example how your outsourcing approach looks. [Eyett] Let us take the following case. A company is a leader in the market of special optical systems and, with a lower priority, active in optical components and measuring technology. For producing the systems, both in-house developed components such as interference mirrors and coated precision mirrors are necessary as is sophisticated measuring technology. The decisive feature, however, is the precise knowledge of the system properties and of the precision mechanics. Our analysis showed that here it would be best to turn the component development over to a supplier, thus to outsource. The analysis also showed that the capacities of the existing and absolutely necessary holographic and interferometry measurement devices could be better exploited by finding contracts from aerospace companies. Here, we speak of insourcing. The company could save costs by this optimized mix. [Hess] Just how good externally developed products are can be proven by means of quality control. However, how do you check the intellectual performance of external researchers? [Thietke] In the example described, a project close to development was involved. The quality of this project could be checked simply because the system vendor continued to have the optical measuring technology in-house. For outsourcing close to development, this is more difficult. The basis for the joint venture can then usually be service contracts. In such cases, project management and R&D controlling similar to that used for internal central departments must be used. Most of such central departments are run as cost centers. [Hess] Which branches are particularly suited to R&D outsourcing? [Eyett] The stronger a company is in the sector of high technology, the more R&D outsourcing is used. Electrotechnology, electronics and the automotive industry make particularly extensive use of this potential. In Japan, for example, half the development cost for a new automobile is borne by the suppliers. In Europe, on the other hand, the portion provided by suppliers is less than one third. [Hess] How is that? [Eyett] The integration between research institutes and industry on the one hand and suppliers and consumers on the other is generally closer in Japan than here. Also, the interest in achieving a lofty goal together is very pronounced in Japan. In addition, the companies exert enormous pressure on the supplier. [Hess] German industry is currently spending more than 50 billion marks on research and development. How many billion marks could, in your opinion, be used to better effect if industry would make consistent use of R&D outsourcing? [Eyett] That depends greatly on the individual company. For a company that previously made no use at all of external technology sources, the potential for savings in the R&D area is more than 20 percent. To estimate this potential savings over all branches using a non-representative basis of individual cases would not be reputable. You will not get a number on that topic from us.
