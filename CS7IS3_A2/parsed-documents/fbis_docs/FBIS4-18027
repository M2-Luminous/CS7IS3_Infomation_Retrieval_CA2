Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin expressed confidence of this in an interview with the American ABC television network. There is, of course, opposition but it is weak, he said. It consists of nothing more than small groups. All state and administrative structures -- the army, internal troops, the Ministry of Internal Affairs -- are on the president's side. People have now changed. B. Yeltsin pointed out that he foresees no situation in which he, as president, could not control the situation in the country. Asked whether the idea of retiring has occurred to him, the Russian leader said that he has thought of this, but "each time I found myself remembering how much I still have to do before June 1996." Asked about his long-term plans, B. Yeltsin merely said that his aides advise him to stop saying that he will not seek reelection. During a discussion of international problems the Russian president was asked: "Are you not shocked, as many others throughout the world are, by the ethnic cleansing being carried out by Serbs in Bosnia?" "Not only am I shocked," B. Yeltsin replied, "I condemn the Serbs for not keeping their word." At the same time he expressed hope that a situation in which Serb positions would be subjected to fresh air strikes will not arise. "We have a partnership with the United States. Even if there are areas over which we disagree, we still must not react brusquely to them or conduct a dialogue from a position of strength," the Russian leader added. In another part of the program he was asked about his health. "I am a healthy man," B. Yeltsin said. "This problem is being brought up by the opposition, especially the communists. They simply want to spoil my mood."
