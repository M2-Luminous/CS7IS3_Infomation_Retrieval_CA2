The receipt has three different versions: a Chinese version (including the Tibetan and Uygur language versions), a Chinese-English version and a computerized version. The Chinese and Chinese-English versions both include three different forms, covering tax values of 10,000 yuan ($1,150), 1 million yuan ($115,000) or 10 million yuan ($1.15 million). The receipts are made by the money printing company under the People's Bank of China, the central bank. Enterprises or individual are forbidden to print the receipt themselves. The former receipts will be invalidated as soon as the new receipts are issued, the announcement says. Any enterprises or individuals who illegally forge, sell or lend the receipts will be severely punished. China launched a nationwide tax reform at the beginning of the year, aimed at setting up a fair taxation system to read just the industrial structure and promote equal competition, according to tax officials. A new business tax with the value-added tax as its major component is the main element of this taxation reform.
