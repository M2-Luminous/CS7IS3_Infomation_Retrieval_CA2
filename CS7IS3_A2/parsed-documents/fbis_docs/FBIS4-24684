Once known as the country's second biggest business and banking center next to Shanghai, Tianjin is now taking a number of forceful steps in an overall development strategy to restore its prestige, the official said. In the coming two years, Gao said, Tianjin will focus its effort on building 10 more influential markets for banking, labor, technology and information, real estate and enterprise property transference. So far it has built and put into operation some 28 national and regional markets for various commodities and means of production. Tianjin will also boost the development of township enterprises and overseas-funded joint ventures, he said, adding that the pace of state-owned enterprise restructuring will be quickened as well. In addition, the city will accelerate the building of some major projects such as the auto industrial company with an annual output of 150,000 autos and the 140,000-ton ethylene and 200,000-ton polyester production plants. The construction of the Tianjin seaside development area will also be accelerated. Gao, past governor of northeast China's Jilin Province and forestry minister, said Tianjin now has four major industries of machinery, electronics, chemicals and metallurgy with an output value accounting for 70 percent of the city's industrial total. And by the year 1996, he said, the city's profit and tax are expected to double the amount of last year, to exceed 11 billion yuan. In the development of China's Bohai Bay economic rim and the Beijing-Tianjin economic ring, Tianjin will play an important role, the official said.
