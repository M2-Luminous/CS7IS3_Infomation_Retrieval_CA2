During a meeting there Nazarbayev briefed his audience on the current economic situation in the Republic. He said that we should toughen up control over credit allocation to enterprises so as to speed up the process of lifting the country's economy out of crisis. The existing economic situation should be taken into account in addressing any issue. In a message to parliamentarians Nazarbayev dwelled on ways of overcoming the crisis. He paid special attention to the need for stability in society. This stability can be maintained provided all citizens have equal opportunities and a careful personnel policy based on regional characteristics is carried out. The main thing is not to allow any kind of provocations, and to observe the law on bringing charges against those who inflame national feelings. The president answered all the questions during the meetings.
