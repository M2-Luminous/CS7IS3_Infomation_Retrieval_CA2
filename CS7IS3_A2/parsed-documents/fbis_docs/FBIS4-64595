After the government's meeting at Toruplund in North Zealand, Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen announced that he wanted to create a program that would give Danes a better and more secure daily life. We know this. For it to be necessary to defend, there must be attackers. The prime minister must believe, then, that the opposition is out to sabotage or at least diminish the welfare society we have today. Now we might ask ourselves if the currently existing welfare state is really the best possible one of its kind. And we might also well ask if the nonsocialists are such formidable reformers that there is reason to take on the role of the defender of welfare. To be honest, 10 years of governments under nonsocialist leadership did not shake the foundations of society, regardless of how shrilly SiD [Special Workers Union] chairman Hardy Hansen lamented over the social mass grave while, at the same time, investing 180 million tax-subsidized kroner in a campaign to overthrow the nonsocialist government and return the Social Democrats to power. But it was not Hardy's millions that paved the way for the Social Democrats' return to power. It was Poul Schluter's (debatable) decision to go without Folketing elections that made possible Rasmussen's majority government. And one might ask if the majority government's performance has given it the right to play the role of the welfare society's defender. Moreover, we do not know if the government as such will defend the welfare state or if each of the four parties individually wants to assume the role of the good that will defend the people against evil. Why wait until after the elections to protect the people? There are plenty of opportunities now to take charge and demonstrate their good will. Start, for example, by taking Agriculture Minister Bjorn Westh by the collar for his shocking lack of a sense of justice. In connection with the payment of land subsidies to farmers, some payments were reduced and, of course, the farmers asked for compensation. But yesterday Westh refused to pay compensation, with the remarkable justification that if he did, then compensation would also have to be paid elsewhere when the government reduced payments. If this arrogant behavior by Bjorn Westh is truly the government's version of a secure life for the people, then almost any alternative would be preferable. The government is tough when it comes to making people pay their debts to it and it demands interest on overdue payments from the second they are overdue, plus a minimum of several hundred kroner in late fees. But that is only when someone owes the state. The opposite situation is a burden to welfare -- the welfare of the state, that is.
