From there and as part of the process of integrating into its geographic surroundings, Cuba will promote commercial, cultural, and athletic relations with the entire eastern Caribbean. Just before leaving for Bridgetown, Cuban Ambassador Lazaro Cabezas told PRENSA LATINA that the Barbadian Government's decision to authorize the opening of a Cuban Embassy in its territory was further confirmation of the Caribbean countries' willingness to integrate the largest of the Antillean islands into the region where it rightfully belongs. "Cuba and Barbados have had diplomatic relations since 8 December 1972, but based on our country's rapprochement with the Anglo-Caribbean community (Caricom) [Caribbean Common Market], we now have the opportunity to establish a Cuban mission in Bridgetown, Cabezas said. He reported that the main purpose of his activities in Barbados and as concurrent ambassador to the eastern Caribbean region will be to strengthen economic and commercial relations with the region and promote cultural and athletic ties, for which there is excellent raw material in the Caribbean and a considerable amount of experience in Cuba, he added. Cabezas explained that one of his goals is to implement a sports and cultural cooperation agreement signed with Barbados in 1983 but never put into affect. The ambassador announced he will present his credentials to the Grenadian Government on 5 April. Cuba reestablished relations with that country in March 1992. Relations between the two countries cooled as a result of the events surrounding the overthrow and murder of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and the subsequent 1983 U.S. military invasion. Cabezas is accredited as concurrent ambassador to the Governments of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Bahamas, St. Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago. The only Caricom members yet to normalize relations with Cuba are Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua, and Barbados. As of this past December, Cuba has maintained a joint commission before Caricom. At the beginning of the current decade, the Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry launched a diplomatic offensive in the Caribbean that was crowned by the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with nearly all Caricom pact members and Cuba's admission into the organization's cooperation mechanisms. The climax of the regional rapprochement was Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's official seven-nation tour this past November. On that occasion, Robaina stated that the region has become one of Cuba's foreign policy priorities. Cabezas said that at the end of April, Cuba will participate in the First Global Conference on Sustainable Development by Small Insular States, which is sponsored by the United Nations and is scheduled to take place in Barbados. He added that Cuba expects to participate in the event with the best proposals prepared by the country's social, scientific, and ecological nongovernmental organizations. In addition, Cuba expects to share its achievements in areas of common interests with its sister nations.
