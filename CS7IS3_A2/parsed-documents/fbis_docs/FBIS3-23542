Yelchishchev, chief of operational rear services and transport of the CIS Combined Armed Forces Staff: "Army and Navy Rear Services: Support to Collective Forces"] [Text] The political and economic processes now occurring in regions of the former USSR are resulting in destabilization in some places, causing crisis situations, and sometimes provoking adjacent countries to intervene in the affairs of significantly weakened and disunited republics. In this situation, the governments and parliaments of a number of CIS countries are giving serious thought to their national security and seeking to ensure it, among other ways, in the form of collective security, through integration in defense issues within the commonwealth framework. The member states of the Collective Security Treaty of May 15, 1992--Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan--are cooperating closest of all in the defense sphere. Among other things, the treaty calls for coordinating the member states' activities in basic areas of the mobilizational readiness of their armed forces and economic structures and for drawing up recommendations on key aspects of military-technical policy and on equipping the member states' armed forces with weapons and military hardware. An agreement entitled "On Military Observer Groups and Collective Peacekeeping Forces in the Commonwealth of Independent States" was signed earlier, in March 1992. Under this agreement, collective peacekeeping (also known as peacemaking) troops were designated from virtually all the CIS states. Depending on the capabilities and interests of each specific country, these forces take the form of a battalion, regiment, or division. In addition to combat units and subunits, the military observers group and collective peacekeeping forces can include command personnel, administrative services, an expert group, a military police group, and logistical and technical support subunits (units). The basic approaches to the organization of rear service support for the collective forces are still being worked out on the basis of the experience of UN multinational peacekeeping forces and command and staff games and exercises. The legal basis for rear services support to the peacekeeping forces is the protocol "On the Structure of Military Observer Groups and Collective Peacekeeping Forces in the Commonwealth of Independent States and Their Manning and Logical, Technical, and Financial Support." For example, it states that logistical and transport support for observers, units, and subunits is to be provided by the state that allocates the manpower and equipment or, alternatively, by other Commonwealth member states. This option for providing support was adopted as the basis at an operational assembly of the Main Command of the CIS Combined Armed Forces, as well as in the course of a command and staff war game that dealt with the training and use of peacekeeping contingents. The first phase of the command and staff game, which was held against the backdrop of the situation that has arisen in the Central Asian region by decision of the chiefs of states (the decision was confirmed by their parliaments), called for the creation of an observers group and collective peacekeeping forces from units and subunits of five Commonwealth countries. The need to clarify fundamental issues relating to logistical, transport, and other types of support in the peacekeeping operation mandate became apparent even then. This also applies to support to observer groups that, as a rule, will be sent far in advance of peacekeeping forces and operate in observation zones autonomously, in groups of five to 10 men. Unless it is determined in advance how they will be supplied, disruptions and misunderstandings are inevitable. In modeling the observers' actions, we relied on the experience of the UN, in which the observation areas and objects are determined first, and then the territory is divided into command and staff zones of responsibility for organizing the work of these groups and ensuring that they receive comprehensive support. A mobile transport subunit with communications equipment is set up in each zone. It is indicative that a number of the inspectors have life support sets containing all essential supplies, from binoculars and bullet-proof vests to food products and personal hygiene items. In speaking about the specific mechanism used to support the observer groups, it is quite clear that much will depend on the situation. For example, the observer group that operated in Tajikistan was based with units of the 201st Division, and no special supply problems arose. But not everything went smoothly. For example, the border troops command refused to supply a helicopter to evacuate 12 observers from Kurgan-Tyube when combat operations were under way in the city. Colonel I. Ozerov, chief of an operational rear services and transport group of the CIS Combined Armed Forces Staff, was then tasked with evacuating the observers to Dushanbe. Breaking through to Kurgan-Tyube and back while under fire in two armored personnel transports provided by the 201st Division, the officer accomplished his mission, for which he was decorated with the Order of Personal Bravery. The conclusion was drawn that if observers are operating separately in disparate areas, their main transport equipment must be armored, and their equipment stocks must guarantee that the groups are mobile and can operate autonomously. It was thus proposed at the command and staff war game that there should be one all-terrain vehicle, such as a command and staff vehicle, for every 10 observers, and that it should be equipped with work and rest areas and a life-support module allowing at least 10 days' functioning. It was proposed that the equipment and supplies be air-dropped together with the personnel using the manpower and assets of the countries providing the military observers. The example of providing rear service support to the multinational forces in the Persian Gulf region is indicative. Their success was to a considerable extent predetermined by the prompt creation of logistical and technical support facilities. The American command had 13 major arms and ammunition stockpiles, up to 10 fuel and lubricant depots, and 17 supply ships carrying aircraft fuel, diesel fuel, food, and other supplies in the region. All told, there were enough reserves to supply 180,000 men for 30 days. Consequently, in preparing the CIS collective forces for operations, it would obviously be a good idea to establish support facilities for them in advance. In general, this task can be successfully accomplished only on the basis of an analytical forecast of potential areas of tension, a study of their possibilities from a rear service standpoint, a determination of the manpower and equipment to be used in the operations, and a procedure for augmenting them. In view of the peacekeeping forces' coalitional character and the fact that it is not always possible to envision their exact makeup, we considered during the command and staff war game the option of creating modular rear service supply sets. It was proposed that the composition of rear services and their functional strength be based on the makeup of the peacekeeping forces: command structures and a regiment rear services supply set for every three to four battalions, command structures and a division rear service supply set for every three to four regiments, and so on. Only this approach would seem to ensure the possibility of maneuver of rear services personnel and equipment and of organizing reliable rear services support in any situation. An example of such organization is provided once again by the operations of the multinational forces in the Persian Gulf. The number of rear service units and subunits in the first command varied in relation to the grouping of forces and the character of combat operations. This was facilitated by a bloc, or nonattached, structure of the main rear service units. For example, a fuel and lubricants supply battalion could have from one to two supply companies and from two to four fuel and lubricant transport companies. The same applies to other rear service subunits. The command and staff war game also reviewed the option of using local economic capabilities to support peacekeeping forces. Specifically, it was planned to attach observers, for all types of supplies to units and subunits already in the observation zone. Furthermore, if, for example, there is a petroleum products depot with required types of fuel and lubricants in the zone of responsibility, efforts must be made to use that depot to augment stocks on site; the same applies to buying fresh vegetables and fruits, obtaining fuel and water, and carrying out sanitation-hygienic, antiepidemic, and other measures. In a number of cases, it is impossible for peacekeeping units to deal with such matters as restoring facilities along communication lines activated for their transport support. It must be pointed out that support can hardly come solely from the states providing the peacekeeping forces or solely from the use of local resources. Support is most likely to be of a mixed character. In any case, the use of local capabilities is always desirable. An indispensable condition for the timely and uninterrupted support to peacekeeping forces is clear-cut command. For this reason, it was deemed advisable at the command and staff war game to form a combined staff for the military observers group and the CIS collective peacekeeping forces under the Main Command of the CIS Combined Armed Forces. This staff would operate on a permanent basis and include a functional subdivision to manage rear services and transport supply. At the same time, it is important to have close cooperation between the rear service command structures and combined-arms staffs. A veil of excessive secrecy between them will be detrimental. This was the case in the Transcaucasus a few years ago, when an operational rear services group was not told which airfields would be used to bring in airborne assault units and how many units would be coming. The result was fuel shortages for the military transport planes. According to normatives, the basic peacekeeping force unit--the reinforced battalion--is to have supplies for three to five days. But to ensure autonomous operation, it realistically has to have food and fuel reserves for at least 30 days. At the same time, the battalion has no agencies that can take delivery, properly store, stockpile, and distribute equipment and supplies. The conclusion is clear: A peacekeeping unit or subunit operating autonomously must be reinforced from a rear services standpoint and be equipped with compact equipment for life in the field, for storing large reserves of equipment and supplies, and for obtaining, storing and disinfecting water. Calculations made at the command and staff war game show that the following supplies must be on hand in amounts over and above the prescribed levels: - at the regiment level, a mobile field bakery, MMP-2 (MPP-6) mechanized compact laundry units, a PKS-2m mobile field kitchen and mess hall, an AVTS-1.7 vehicle-mounted water tank, 200 bullet-proof vests, tanks for extra fuel supplies (nearly 600 metric tons), one camp tent for every 10 men, one officer camp tent for every two to three men, staff tents, and standardized tents for housing staffs, storing weapons, ammunition, food, and other equipment, and four bundles of canvas; - at the battalion level, one AVTS-1.7, one PKHB-0.4, tanks in an MSB [motorized rifle battalion] for 60 metric tons of fuel, for 1.8 gasoline refuelings, and for 1.4 diesel fuel refuelings (in a PDB, tanks for 50 metric tons of fuel, two gasoline refuelings, and two diesel fuel refuelings), and tents in the same ratio specified for the regiment level. The units must also have three MK-30 and KP-20 field kitchens per battalion to support an outpost, posts, and patrols. A peacekeeping operation can last a long time. And by the end of the first month, it will likely be necessary to have a temporary rear service group to take delivery of equipment and supplies from the republics' national commands and to distribute them to the peacekeeping forces. When operations are very prolonged, and also when forces are introduced to prevent local conflicts on external borders (based on the experience of the command and staff war game), it will be necessary to create up a forward support facility for the collective forces. It must be pointed out that supporting mixed collective forces is in itself a difficult task. And as some Commonwealth states introduce their own currencies, take steps to equip their forces with Western arms and equipment, set their own supply norms, and introduce their own uniforms, this task will become more and more difficult. When the Warsaw Pact countries' joint armed forces existed, a system of bases and stockpiles of equipment and supplies was created, and effective efforts were made to establish a common transport network and system for maintaining it. Protocols and agreements were rigorously observed. But the question of supporting coalitional groupings, especially in the course of counterstrikes and counteroffensives away from supply bases, has never been fully resolved. The same applies to standardizing rear services manpower and equipment. Therefore, in our view, in order to avoid or at least alleviate the problem of using collective peacekeeping forces in the Commonwealth of Independent States, the CIS states' armed forces must follow common rear service support principles and preserve a common rear service support system, common rear service organization and common operational tactics. Preserving the most important integrative components of the rear service system of the former Soviet armed forces is also invaluable--above all a common defense communications network and maintenance elements and regional rear service preparations. It is important to take common approaches to the creation, stockpiling, and siting of logistical supplies for the Combined Armed Forces and armed forces of the Commonwealth states and to the operation of mobilizational agencies to deploy rear service troops and installations. Finally, the mobilizational and operational plans of the former Soviet armed forces were formulated with due regard for the actual correlation of forces and equipment and capabilities for utilizing them. Corresponding logistical, technical, and transport facilities were created. In destroying it, the Commonwealth states are dooming themselves to a struggle for survival in which each state is on its own, and this poses problems.
