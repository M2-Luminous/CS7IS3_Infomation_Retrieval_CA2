Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, in presenting the summit logo here Monday [7 March], said that Italy as G-7 president was working at a diplomatic level for greater Russian involvement in political discussions at the July gathering. While awaiting the nod from the other members of the G-7 club of leading industrial nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, and Canada -- Italy is going ahead with its organization of the summit and is making it possible, in the event the others do agree, that Yeltsin, who is to arrive in Naples on Saturday morning of the second day of the summit, could take part in the G-7 sessions as early as Saturday afternoon, July 9. In any case, the evening of Saturday, July 9, Yeltsin will take part in an official dinner being offered to all participants by the Italian premier, in the presence of Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. The plan is for Yeltsin to take part Sunday morning in the final work session and at the subsequent presentation of the results of the summit. However, Ciampi's office today specified that no definitive decision had yet been taken with regard to how and when Yeltsin would be taking part in the Naples parley. A decision will be made by the Seven shortly before the summit opens, according to the same source. Meanwhile, it was learned here that Ciampi would take part in the opening session of G-7 environmental ministers set for March 12 and 13 in Florence. The meeting was convened by Italian Environment Minister Valdo Spini last year because, as he said today, the industrialized nations have a special responsibility to promote sustainable development for the entire planet. However, Spini also highlighted the role that the environment could play in creating jobs within the big industrialized states.
