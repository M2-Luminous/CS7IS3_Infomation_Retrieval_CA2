Franco guaranteed that "the government will not hesitate in using the instruments it is entitled to use by law to guarantee compliance with constitutional obligations," and he said: "Democracy must be tolerant with the expression of ideas but it cannot remain inactive in the face of deliberate disorderly actions." Itamar Franco began his message -- a rendering of accounts of his government's action -- speaking about corruption. "The past 12 months served as a painful examination of our political customs and the ethical behavior of a considerable part of the business elites," he said. He did not, however, delve deeper into the subject. "I excuse myself, on account of the natural pressures of the post I hold, from commenting on the behavior of those involved." The president of the Republic then referred to the constitutional revision and said: "States and municipalities must have greater political and administrative responsibilities." He then made mention of the deterioration of the [word indistinct] state and of some sectors of society" [no opening quotation mark as published] as the result of inflation. "The currency reflects the moral standard of society and the strength of the states," Franco wrote, before asking congressmen to support the economic stabilization measures: "The executive branch counts on your patriotism so that it will not lack the legal instruments needed to implement the measures that are being and will be adopted in the next few months." Franco ruled out any possibility of an economic shock that, he said, "would only help discredit the state and further erode our currency." When mentioning the restructuring of the state by the Constituent Congress, President Itamar Franco's tone became graver. He said that through the years "corporate groups ensured a privileged position for themselves," and he warned: "Without intending to intervene in the other government branches (legislative and judicial), it is my duty to warn them of the imminent danger the state and society run if we are unable to begin a fairer distribution of wealth." Franco then gave some figures that, according to him, "cause us shame and scare us," like the loss of 50 percent of Brazilian workers' purchasing power in the past 30 years.
