The dealers fled to nearby flats on January 24 when they saw the police arriving in the al-Harisiyah area, where they were exchanging money. The police opened fire, killing about 30 of them, the sources said. Another 10 dealers surrendered, and were still in jail, they said. The raid came two days after a warning published in the daily Babil, which blamed the collapse of the Iraqi dinar on street dealers, and called for them to be punished. The daily is run by President Saddam Husayn's son 'Udayy. The sources said the dollar was changing hands on the black market for 230 dinars the day of the raid, but the rate now was 265 to the dollar. The official rate is one dinar to 3.2 dollars. On January 27 the deputy governor of the central bank, 'Asim Muhammad Salih, announced a ban on foreign currency trading by street dealers.
