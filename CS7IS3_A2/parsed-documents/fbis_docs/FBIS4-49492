Yet the motion passed in the Legislative Council on Wednesday calling on both Britain and China to stop violating the Joint Declaration bore the support of all the main parties and the majority of independents into the bargain. Neither London nor Beijing should be under any illusion that the criticism was not deeply felt. The vote was an important message to both sides to remember that the point of the Joint Declaration was more than just the transfer of sovereignty. What was at stake was the maintenance of the welfare and the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. There have been times as the two distant capitals have confronted each other over recent years when that commitment to the people of the territory has been forgotten. And the feeling of resentment at that obvious neglect of Hong Kong's interest has rarely been stronger than today, when the two sides refuse to talk to each other in public. No doubt those at whom the motion is mainly addressed will attempt to fob off critics with the observation that different legislators had widely differing reasons for supporting the censure. The democratic parties are incensed at the lack of democratic reform, British acquiescence in China's position on the Court of Final Appeal and the apparent threat to Hong Kong's rights and freedoms. The Liberals fear the lack of convergence and cooperation for a smooth transition. But the criticisms from both sides are valid. And while Chris Patten plays political games to keep himself in the public eye and upstage Lu Ping, the majority wish he would buckle down to practical governing instead. Legislators have echoed Shakespeare's wish for "a plague on both your houses", rejecting both sides' unconvincing excuses for the neglect of their obligations to the people of Hong Kong. In that they will enjoy the public's full support.
