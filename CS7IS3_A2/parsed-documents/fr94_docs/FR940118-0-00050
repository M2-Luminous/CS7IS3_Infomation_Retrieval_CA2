ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: This interim regulation implements that portion of subchapter C, part I (Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities and Rural Development Investment Areas) of title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, approved August 10, 1993) dealing with the designation of rural Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. Published elsewhere in this Federal Register is a companion regulation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development which implements their portion of title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. This rule authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to designate not more than three rural Empowerment Zones and not more than thirty rural Enterprise Communities based upon the effectiveness of the strategic plan submitted by an applicant and nominated by a State or States and local governments. The purpose of this program is to empower rural communities and their residents to create jobs and opportunities to build for tomorrow as part of a Federal-State-local and private-sector partnership. Businesses will be encouraged to invest and create jobs in distressed areas, and comprehensive local strategic plans are to be adopted and implemented, encouraging entrepreneurship, furthering local self-development and assisting in the revitalization of these areas.
