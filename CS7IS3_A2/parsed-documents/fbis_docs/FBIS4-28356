The analysis indicates that the projects tend to be rigid with regard to advances in technology and that the results cannot meet current technology needs. The agency is harshly critical of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] on the issue of government-funded joint projects involving a number of corporations. The research group's analysis is that there is insufficient exchange of technical information among the participating corporations, a considerable departure from the essence of joint research. EPA's research group has taken as examples three representative joint development projects in the field of information/electronics that MITI ran from the 1970's to the 1990's, analyzing their significance and problems. The agency's research group had high praise for MITI's Very Large-Scale Integrated Circuit [VLSI] Project (fiscal years 1976- 79) aimed at developing high-performance semiconductors, in which Japan's major electronics manufacturers participated. EPA's group praised the project for raising Japan's semiconductor manufacturing technology to the highest level in the world, laying the foundation for the development of the nation's semiconductor industry. However, the Supercomputer Project (fiscal years 1981-89) and the Fifth Generation Computer Project (fiscal years 1982-92), two projects begun in the early 1980s, were found by the EPA research group to have set development goals which were less clear than those for the VLSI Project. In particular, the Fifth Generation Computer Project's goal of developing artificial intelligence despite declining interest in the technology was judged to have left the project behind developments. EPA's research group indicated that, although a number of corporations participated in the joint development projects, participation amounted to nothing more than each corporation being given separate development subjects. The problem was that there had been no joint development in the true sense of the term. EPA's group is calling for more emphasis on the merits of such practices as sharing technical information.
