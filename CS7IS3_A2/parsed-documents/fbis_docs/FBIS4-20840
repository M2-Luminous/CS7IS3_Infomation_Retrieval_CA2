The "Protocol on Transparency" concluded by the Russian Federation Atomic Energy Ministry and the U.S. Department of Energy outlines practical ways to implement the earlier signed bilateral agreement between Russia and the United States on highly-enriched Russian Uranium extracted from dismantled nuclear warheads. It will be degraded and delivered to the United States in the form of lowly-enriched Uranium to be sold to U.S. and other consumers. A senior Russian diplomat said in a conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent that the U.S. Government now has guarantees that the lowly-enriched Uranium coming from Russia has originally been extracted from nuclear warheads. The U.S. side is providing the Russian side with guarantees that the Russian lowly-enriched Uranium will be used exclusively for peaceful ends, not only in the United States, but also in cases of its re-export to other countries.
