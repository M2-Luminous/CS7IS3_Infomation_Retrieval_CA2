"In this so very delicate period of transition in Italy's political history and life," Scalfaro said, "the judiciary must represent a firm point of absolute certainty." Scalfaro then warned against "anyone touching these fundamental constitutional principles, that are the breath of life for democracy." He also urged magistrates to avoid "polemics and speculations" and not to fall into "weaknesses" towards those colleagues who fall astray. His statements appeared to be a multiple reference to a proposal by Forza Italia that would have public prosecutors appointed by the government, eliminating current career procedures within the judiciary itself, and to polemics over the handling of corruption cases. The independence of the judiciary is now "more important than ever" and judges must "make the abuse known if anyone touches it," Scalfaro said, adding: "Even more important, judges must not give in to polemics and speculation." Scalfaro, who as president is also chairman of the judges' self-governing body, the Council of Magistrates, apparently objects to the suggestion that the separation of powers between judiciary and executive be eliminated, a move critics claim would protect corrupt politicians from prosecution. His latter statement could also refer to several recent controversies involving magistrates, including criticisms of judges accused of using corruption cases for political ends and the proposed blacklisting of hundreds of leading figures, including several chief public prosecutors. The list was published by a right-wing weekly, which named people "whose heads should roll" under the new conservative regime of the Freedom Pole. The editors later defended the list as a satirical "spoof" but it was described by critics as the sort of purge to be expected if Forza Italia and its allies, the Northern league and the National Alliance, run the country. Scalfaro also had a word for magistrates who find themselves in the limelight because of corruption investigations involving famous or powerful people. He warned judges not to give in to temptations of notoriety and popularity, to maintain at all costs pretrial judicial secrecy and to avoid making comments about their colleagues "who make mistakes."
