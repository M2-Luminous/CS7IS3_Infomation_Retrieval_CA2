At a hastily-called press conference, the 58-year-old prime minister said that he would quit together with his ministers. Hata announced the cabinet resignation just hours before the House of Representatives was to convene a plenary session to vote on a no-confidence motion tabled by the leading opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The Hata administration was believed almost certain to lose the vote. He said the decision aims to avoid a "political vacuum" at a time when Japan faces a host of domestic and international challenges. "It is an urgent task to form a stable government. We will entrust the formation of a new government to the will of the Diet (parliament)," Hata told the press conference. "If the House of Representatives is dissolved, there will be a political vacuum in the nation and therefore dealing with the yen's rise and other issues will become impossible," he said. "I want to avoid a political vacuum by every means." Ruling coalition leaders, in making the decision to disband the cabinet at a meeting earlier in the day, agreed to allow the two largest parties, the LDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), to create a new coalition government. Coalition and SDP leaders failed to iron out their differences in the past two days of on-and-off talks on the socialists' rejoining the governing bloc. Coalition leaders rejected the SDP's demand that the Hata cabinet voluntarily resign, and instead opted to face the no-confidence motion. Last night, sentiment emerged within the ruling camp that Hata should dissolve the lower house if the motion was passed, and Hata himself reportedly hinted at his readiness to do so. Under Japan's constitutional rules, the prime minister should either disband his cabinet or dissolve the lower house for a snap election within 10 days after a no-confidence motion against him clears the Diet. But the situation changed overnight when the ruling coalition decided to meet the SDP's demand. The development left Japan watchers here with feelings that Japanese politics is really a changeable, unpredictable, and sometimes mysterious world. The Hata government was formed on April 28 after its predecessor, headed by Japan New Party leader Morihiro Hosokawa, collapsed in a protracted row over Hosokawa's alleged financial improprieties. The SDP was the largest contingent in the Hosokawa coalition which was formed after last July's general election that toppled the LDP after its 38 years of uninterrupted rule. But the socialists walked out of the ruling bloc after the formation within the coalition of the parliamentary group, Kaishin, which excluded the SDP.
