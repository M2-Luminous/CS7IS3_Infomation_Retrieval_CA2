We asked Andor Mandoky, head of the Economic Commmittee of the KDNP, about the Christian Democrats' economic concepts. [Hammang] The KDNP often criticized the current privatization practice. Will there be any change in this if you are part of the government in the next four years too? [Mandoky] We regard privatization as a fundamental issue of the new social and economic order. The new structure and the functioning of the economy will improve through privatization. We formulated our views on the issue at our congress held in Godollo in the spring of 1992. We had reservations regarding the methods of this process that started before the elections, methods that we took over without criticism in order to shape our new order. We want an evident list of property, something required by law. On the basis of this, we want a systematic privatization process, as well as openness, supervision possibilities, and the discovery of abuses. We are in favor of the emergence of broad strata of owners. We are in favor of developing strata of small and medium-size entrepreneurs. [Hammang] Many people claim that only a reform of the state administration could lead to real changes in the economy. Do you have any relevant concepts in your program? [Mandoky] Our economic program contains the reform of state administration, together with a program ensuring an economic revival as soon as possible. Experts are currently working on this. We think that a rational reduction of expenses in itself will not solve the problems of economic crisis and state administration. We count much more on the positive effect of an increase in production and services. Therefore, we attribute great importance to privatization in this respect. It is a basic requirement for both domestic and foreign buyers to use the property obtained at a favorable cost, rather than reduce it, use it up, or take it out. They should create jobs and provide services at competitive prices. The useful handling of state property is the other area with considerable resources. Saving and operating the viable state-owned production capacities for purposes of taxation and employment represents the basis of our economic program. The resulting positive processes could indirectly help the problems facing the budget by increasing the income. [Hammang] One can mostly achieve an increase in income by increasing taxes. However, we can no longer follow this road. Is there a solution at all? [Mandoky] In our view, for a more proportional tax burden, it is necessary to reexamine our taxation system, including a shift from income-type taxation to consumer-type taxation, the taxation of big properties, and focusing on a family-type taxation in the personal income tax. We also think that strengthening the taxation discipline is essential for financial stability. Supervision should be strengthened in order to discover the hidden incomes. Investments and research-development should be encouraged through tax allowances, and the tax policy should serve ventures that increase investment and create jobs. [Hammang] In addition to helping the ventures, it is important to develop a welfare network. Are there any possibilities of increasing welfare expenses in the near future? [Mandoky] Welfare expenses are closely connected to the economic situation. It was not by accident that we Christian Democrats were the first to turn to economic issues, because we have a strong commitment to correctly handling the social problems. Halting regression and starting an economic revival are the basic goals of our economic program. We know that this is a process that needs a longer time. Economic revival depends on the prevailing economic program and the professional abilities serving the implementation of this program. At the moment, it is irresponsible to promise an increase in the standard of living and to suggest the need to further increase the welfare burdens and expenses. We must concentrate all our efforts to accelerate the economy and to increase production, services, and exports. [Hammang] However, all this is hindered by the debt burden left to us by the previous regime and the need to repay the interest. [Mandoky] We have repeatedly expressed our position on the issue of debt servicing and credits, and this problem makes up one chapter of our program. Naturally, we accept the repayment of our debts. However, we wonder about the heavy burden of debt servicing, a burden that questions our ability to emerge from the prevailing economic crisis. Therefore, we think that a reexamination of the problem is justified in any case.
