[Bilget] At the moment our party is fighting a juridical struggle. As you know, six of our deputies were arrested in the Parliament in Ankara on 2 March after their immunity had been rescinded. In addition, investigations are underway against our party, which have the goal of banning it. We will defend ourselves for the last time at the Constitutional Court tomorrow. [Abidin] What do you think are the reasons for the investigations? [Bilget] In Turkey the Constitution is very reactionary. It is still the fascist Constitution of 12-September (date of the military putsch in 1980 -- NEUES DEUTSCHLAND editor's note). This makes it very difficult for someone to even just talk about the Kurdish problem, as the DEP does. Even stricter are the penal code and the law on political parties, which are particularly rigid regarding the Kurdish question. However, we have founded the DEP while observing these laws and we are orienting our work toward them, that is, we try to observe the existing racist laws. For instance, as representatives of the party, we have never used the term "Kurdistan." Instead, we speak of the "east" or the "southeast" so as not to give the state any trump card against us. [Abidin] What are you officilly accused of in the proceedings? [Billet] The state has decided to destroy us and it is looking for any reason: Our former Chairman Yasar Kaya participated in the congress of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan in Iraq in 1993 and held a speech at a Kurdish festival in Bonn. Proof of that is a video tape, which was probably made by the Turkish intelligence service. However, the law says that video tapes cannot be used as evidence in court. The second pretext is almost tragicomic: Shortly after the founding of the DEP, we started a peace campaign in August 1993. In a flier we wrote: "Be it soldiers or Kurdish youths -- in any case, it is our people who are dying in the east and the southeast. As of now no militant methods should be used anymore; instead, democratic solutions must be looked for." Saying this is obviously a reason in Turkey to be banned. In the investigation proceedings, our deputies are even accused of having entered parliament while having cloths in the Kurdish colors of green-yellow-red in their pockets. [Abidin] But that means that the juridical grounds for banning your party are, actually, very meager. [Bilget] Nevertheless, it looks as if the DEP will be banned just as its predecessor, the People's Labor Party (HEP). This is a political decision by the state, not a juridical one. [Abidin] In the Turkish public much excitement is caused by the fact that the DEP allegedly supports the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). This was also an argument for lifting the immunity of the deputies. The comment by your arrested party chairman Hatip Dicle about the PKK bomb attack on a railroad station in one of Istanbul's suburbs was given as an example. The attack killed several army cadets. [Bilget] This is the demagogy of Prime Minister Ciller and the other leading officials of the state, who want to flatter Turkish chauvinism. However, in reality, the DEP has nothing to do with the PKK. The PKK is an illegal organization that pursues an armed struggle. We, on the other hand, are a legal organization that struggles on a democratic basis; a mass party founded by educated Kurds from various fields of society. It is true that the PKK and we are supported by the same people, namely by the Kurdish population. It may be that some of our demands are similar. However, this is not so because we support the PKK but because we work for the interests of the Kurdish people. Let me use the above example: After the PKK bomb attack our party chairman said: "It is said that both sides use such places as military targets.... We want the war to come to an end as quickly as possible. The reaction to individual actions is no solution for that. There are other solutions than militant ones." The media wrote afterwards: "Dicle called the train with army cadets a military target." [Abidin] Will you found a new party if the DEP is indeed banned? [Bilget] We have not yet come to a decision on this matter, but we have not immediately started to prepare for founding a new party, as was done when the HEP was banned, because we do not want to make it so easy to ban the DEP. We will defend the party up to the last minute. If necessary, this time we will also turn to the international courts. According to Turkish laws, if the party is banned, our 2,500 local and city councilors are not permitted to exercise any political functions for 10 years or to become active in any other party for the same period. Therefore, it could be that shortly before the ban we will call on all members -- with the exception of our leading functionaries -- to leave the party so that they do not have to suffer under these consequences. For our parliamentarians, however, this is not possible. [Abidin] Your party is massively threatened not only juridically but also in physical terms. What are the consequences of this fact for your future political work? [Bilget] The DEP has had to pay a high price. When we add the HEP, a total of 70 of our representatives have been murdered. The assassination attempt on our parliamentary Deputy Mehmet Sincar could have hit me -- I was standing beside him during the attack, he died in my arms.... More than 20 of our party offices have been devastated by bomb attacks more than 300 delegates have been imprisoned. Our voters have been threatened, we ourselves aware not able to run in the local elections on 27 March. The sacrifices must not have been in vain. I think, in the future we must try to get closer to the Turkish working people, too, and to abolish the negative image we have among them. [Abidin] In many Kurdish areas, for instance in Diyarbakir, the Islamic Welfare Party (RP) won the local elections. Did your voters vote for the RP? [Bilget] Only a minority of them. Most voters either did not participate in the elections or handed in empty ballot slips. Thus, they behaved in line with our suggestions. By the way, in the Kurdish areas the RP was not able to increase its number of votes to the same extent as in the Turkish areas. It won in some communities only because there it did not have any serious competition and because very few voters cast valid votes. If we had participated in the elections, the DEP would have become the strongest party in this region. [Abidin] Where do you see the reason for the advance of the Islamic fundamentalists? [Bilget] In the Kurdish areas the RP was supported by the sate. The Government, which does not at all welcome this party in the Turkish areas, strengthened it in the Kurdish region. In particular the Turkish officers, soldiers, policemen, and the members of the special units stationed there voted for the RP. In western Turkey the situation is different. There the RP has indeed gained considerably more votes. The success of the Islamic fundamentalists is a result of the crisis of Kemalism (the official state doctrine of Turkey -- the editors) and of the weakness of the left. [Abidin] You have certainly heard about the events that took place at the Newroz celebrations in Germany. What do you think about that? [Bilget] It looks as if the German Government has still not understood the Kurdish problem properly. I think it is trying to give positive signals to the Turkish government with its actions. However, the Germans should now that this is not correct and a danger to democracy in our country, because under the slogan of "preventing terrorism" the uncivilized actions of the Turkish Government are virtually supported. The Kurds do not want to disturb peace in Germany, that would not be of any benefit to them, either. I think that German politicians sometimes exploit the sensibilities of the population, and if the Kurds become loud as people, they present it in a wrong light. [Abidin] What would the deportation of "Kurdish activists" from Germany mean? [Bilget] From my own experience I would like to say: It may be that the deported people will not be executed. However, in the prisons in Turkey there are neither rights nor rules. If it is not one's body that is executed, it is at least one's honor.
