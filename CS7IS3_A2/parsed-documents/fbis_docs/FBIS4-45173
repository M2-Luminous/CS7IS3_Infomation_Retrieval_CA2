On the evening of 23 May, the president of the court disclosed a letter suggesting the dangers of a presidential dictatorship. Darcy Quinn has this report: Quinn: Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango began his reply to President Gaviria by reminding him of certain basic provisions contained in the Constitution. Arango: "The Constitution recognizes the separation of state branches--namely, the legislative, executive, and judicial branches--under Article 103." He also told the president that he has overlooked one very important point: Common citizens are permitted to do anything that is not specifically prohibited by law, but public servants must limit their actions to the duties outlined by laws and regulations. Arango: "With due respect for his very important office, we must point out that the president of the Republic is not a common citizen and that there are limits on his ability to exercise power." He reminded President Gaviria that the duty of the Constitutional Court is to decide whether rules and regulations are in keeping with the Constitution. Arango: "In terms of reviewing laws, for example, this responsibility obviously cannot be fulfilled by Congress, which issues them. The chief executive cannot do this either, because this would imply a dictatorship." Finally, the Constitutional Court president outlined which branch of state would serve to pass judgment over members of the court. Arango: "If we fail to fulfill our duty, the Senate of the Republic is there. The Constitution states that the Senate should act as our judge."
