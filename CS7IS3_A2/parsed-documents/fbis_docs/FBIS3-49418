In greeting the diplomats, Dr. Zhelev expressed his confidence that, as in the past, also in 1994, their benevolence and good intentions toward Bulgaria are likely to contribute to our country's efforts for international support. Bulgarian democracy has reached the middle of its first seven years and is still expected to accomplish a great deal, but the path of changes that Bulgaria embarked upon four years ago is irreversible, the president assured his audience. Mr. Zhelev recalled the essence of Bulgaria's international policy and its Balkan policy in particular, which is aimed at building lasting good neighborly and mutually advantageous relations. Dwelling on the forthcoming summit meeting of the NATO member-states scheduled for 10 January 1994, the Bulgarian head of state pointed out our country's stand of principle, according to which it is striving to join NATO after the North Atlantic bloc has, possibly, decided to expand.
