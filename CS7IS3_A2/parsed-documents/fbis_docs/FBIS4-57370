FBIS4-57370 "drlat096_g_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-096 Daily Report 16 May 1994 Guatemala Official Discusses Attack on U.S. Woman, Adoption Case Official Discusses Attack on U.S. Woman, Adoption Case PA1605225994 Guatemala City Teleonce Television in Spanish 1900 GMT 16 May 94 PA1605225994 Guatemala City Teleonce Television Spanish BFN [From the "Telepress" newscast] [Text] Residents of the (Nimacuyu) neighborhood in Zone 21 last Friday tried to lynch a U.S. woman whom they claimed had stolen a child. The Attorney General's Office denied she had kidnapped the child, disclosing that there are legal adoption papers in an auxiliary office of the Attorney General's Office in Coban, Alta Verapaz. Francisco Daniel Flores, delegate from the Coban office, explained the case: [Begin recording] [Flores] Yes, it is true. At the Coban agency of the Attorney General's Office, we have studied the legal adoption papers of those gringos who appeared yesterday on television. They have complied with all the requirements demanded by the law, and their papers are in order in our office as well as in the court that has made the financial investigations. The mother was summoned by our agency, and she voluntarily turned over the little girl. [Unidentified reporter] Who are the parents of this minor? [Flores] I cannot remember the woman's name right now, but she lives in the Canton Las Casas neighborhood in Coban, Alta Verapaz. She has 12 children, and there are documents that prove she has given up another child for adoption. [Reporter] Did she sell her child, or was the child taken away from her against her will? [Flores] As guarantors of the investigations we conduct with regard to adoption, we summoned the mother, and she testified that she gave up the child for adoption of her own will. She says she cannot support this child because she has too many children. She is looking out for the child's well-being, and therefore she prefers to give her up for adoption. [Reporter] She did not sell the child? [Flores] Not at all, and there are witnesses at the agency where she said that she had given the child away as a gift and she had not sold the child, as many people claim. I repeat, the woman has 12 other children, and she previously gave up another child for adoption. She cannot support the children; she cannot buy food for them. [Reporter] How about the U.S. woman? Who is she, and what does she do? [Flores] Prior to legalizing the adoption, we investigated the dossier. We saw the dossier included authorization by the U.S. Embassy allowing the woman to adopt the child. [Reporter] Why was the U.S. woman interested in this minor? [Flores] The couple has problems and cannot have babies. They wanted to have a child, and, when the opportunity to adopt this Guatemalan child arose, they said they wanted this child. [Reporter] How long have they been working on this adoption? [Flores] They have been working on this adoption for approximately six months. They have been in Coban since last December when they started the legal adoption paperwork. [Reporter] How many adoption cases have you processed in this agency? [Flores] This is the first adoption case I have processed in the time that I have been working in Coban. [Reporter] How does the father of the child feel about this? [Flores] Unfortunately, the child is not a legitimate child, and there is no record of who her father is. We have only talked with the mother of the child. [end recording]
