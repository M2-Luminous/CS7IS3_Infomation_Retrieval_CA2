Hamiz Deronjic reports that "artillery attacks on the defense lines of the free Brcko territory are becoming more and more frequent and intensive. Thus, during last night, the Serbian aggressor fired 82-mm mortars on the positions of the 108th Motorized Brigade and the 108th Infantry Brigade, as well as [word indistinct] units of the 2d Corps in Krajinovici, Vitanovici, [name indistinct], the central section of the battlefield, and the region of Modrica. The region of Vranovaca was exposed to the most intensive fire from 82-mm and 120-mm mortars. The aggressor has been incessantly regrouping his forces on the Brcko battlefield. (?Major) movements of the enemy's armored-mechanized equipment were observed on the central sector of the Brcko battlefield last night." A report by the Press Center of the 3d Corps read by an unidentified correspondent says that "chetnik provocations on the Teslic battlefield" have become too much and that "yesterday, our forces carried out a strong counterattack whereby they took (Veliki Karanovici) and pressed the enemy deeply toward (Blato). Fierce fighting was waged on the Zavidovici region around Mahovski Vrh and, as the final outcome, the enemy was pushed back. Chetniks are continuing to shell the zone covered by the 7th South Operations Group. A 90-mm self-propelled gun [samohodka) at (Lovzije) shelled the village of Miljkovac, [name indistinct] and Alibegovici. With 82-mm and 120-mm mortars, they showered the village of Lepenica where a child was wounded. The fact that the chetniks are going to continue such activities is shown by a column of five tanks that is heading toward (?Putnikovo Brdo)." Viktor Boban reports from the Bosna Operations Group Press Center on "strong artillery fire by the aggressor on the Mahovski Vrh defense lines yesterday. The chetniks followed the artillery attack with a strong infantry assault trying to break through this defense line of the free Zavidovici territory. After heavy fighting, in the afternoon, the chetniks were pushed back to their original positions." Further on, Boban says that "following their defeat, the Chetniks have been fire fiercely on all defense lines as well as on populated places. Villages were occasionally shelled with 82-mm and 120-mm mortars until late into the night. Infantry arms attacks were launched on the stable defense lines of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade in Maglaj. Karadzic's paramilitary formations are still regrouping themselves, as well as bringing in new forces and military hardware, so new attacks on the zone covered by the Bosna Operations Group are to be expected." Mirza Sadikovic reports on the situation in the Bihac region saying that "[Fikret] Abdic's paramilitary was firing antiaircraft weapons and heavy machine-guns all last night" and that "the morning hours are passing as usual, with provocations on almost all sections of the zone covered by the 5th Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Main Headquarters of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] of the Bihac region."
