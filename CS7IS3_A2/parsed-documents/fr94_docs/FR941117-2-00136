FR941117-2-00136 FR941117-2-00092 [Release No. 34&hyph;34960; International Series Release No. 748; File No. SR&hyph;MBS&hyph;94&hyph;04] Self-Regulatory Organizations; MBS Clearing Corporation; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Establishing Additional Requirements Applicable to Participants November 9, 1994. On June 27, 1994, the MBS Clearing Corporation (``MBS'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;MBS&hyph;94&hyph;04) pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). 1 The proposed rule change establishes additional requirements in MBS's rules applicable to participants. The Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the Federal Register on August 1, 1994. 2 On November 7, 1994, MBS filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 3 The amendment was technical in nature and did not require republication of notice of filing. No comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34438 (July 25, 1994), 59 FR 38997. 3 Amendment No. 1 modified the filing by clarifying that the additional requirements in MBS's rules apply to all participants and not, as originally proposed, only to participants that are organized under the laws of a foreign country. Letter from David T. Rusoff, Foley & Lardner, to Ari Burstein, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (November 7, 1994). I. Description The proposed rule change establishes additional requirements in MBS's rules applicable to participants. Specifically, MBS is adding a new Section 13 to Article III, Rule 1 (``Requirements Applicable to participants'') of MBS's rules. New Section 13 requires that all participants prepare and maintain all required financial and other reports and a general ledger chart of accounts in English and in U.S. dollars, ensure the availability of an individual fluent in English and knowledgeable in securities and financial matters to assist representatives of MBS, and satisfy the financial net worth requirements in MBS's rules computed in accordance with generally accepted U.S. accounting principals. In addition, new Section 13 requires that all participants maintain an agent located in the U.S. for service of process and maintain an office or agent located in the U.S. that can adequately address all purchase and sales, margin compliance, clearance, and cash settlement functions for the participant. Section 13 explicitly sets forth that these requirements are in addition to all other requirements applicable to MBS participants. II. Discussion The Commission believes that MBS's proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act 4 and in particular with Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act. 5 Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) require, among other things, that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds within its possession or control or for which it is responsible. The Commission believes that MBS's proposal to establish additional requirements in MBS's rules applicable to participants is consistent with this obligation. 4 15 U.S.C. ยง78q&hyph;1 (1988). 5 15 U.S.C. ยง78q&hyph;1(b)(3) (A) and (F) (1988). Under the proposed rule change, all MBS participants now will be required to satisfy their financial and reporting obligations in a manner which will better facilitate MBS's oversight of participants. For example, a participant now will be explicitly required to satisfy the financial net worth requirements in MBS's rules computed in accordance with generally accepted U.S. accounting principals and maintain an entity located in the U.S. to tend to certain securities matters related to MBS. The Commission believes that the additional requirements applicable to all participants should facilitate MBS's monitoring of the communications with participants and should help ensure that participants comply with all requirements in MBS's rules. As a result, MBS should be better able to reduce its risk exposure and consequently should be better able to fulfill its safeguarding obligations. III. Conclusion On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act, in particular with Section 17A of the Act, and with the rules and regulations thereunder. It is therefore ordered , pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 6 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;MBS&hyph;94&hyph;04) be, and hereby is, approved. 6 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 7 7 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
