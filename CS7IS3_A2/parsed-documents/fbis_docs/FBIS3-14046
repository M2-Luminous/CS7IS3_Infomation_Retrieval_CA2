Over to TV reporter Souria Bouamama for more details on the visit: [Bouamama] In traditional Arab decor, Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the Libyan revolution, yesterday received Mohamed Salah Dembri, who handed him a letter of friendship and esteem from Liamine Zeroual to the leadership and people of Libya. During this meeting, al-Qadhdhafi renewed his satisfaction with Zeroual's appointment as president of state and wished him success. On the purpose of this visit, Salah Dembri had this to say: [Begin Dembri recording] This visit follows the recent visit which brother al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi paid to Algeria. During this visit we discussed ways to strengthen and bolster our bilateral relations. We also talked about all the issues of common interest, including matters concerning the situation in the Arab homeland, particularly the current situation in the Maghreb. We also talked about everything which concerns us in our natural environment, namely the African environment and our Mediterranean environment. [end recording] [Bouamama] On this visit, Mr. Jam'a al-Fazzani, general secretary of the People's Committee for Unity, had this to say: [Begin recording] [al-Fazzani] This visit is aimed at starting a new phase which is more advanced and clearer in the establishment of Libyan Arab-Algerian relations, which are based on a number of factors. These include the ties and bonds linking the two fraternal peoples, and also the principles on which the 1 November Revolution and the 1 September Revolution are based. These principles bring us closer together and do not separate us. [Bouamama] Now that we are flying in Libyan airspace, despite the embargo imposed on Libya, how is Libya living now under the embargo? [al-Fazzani] I am glad you have asked this question. The Libyan Arab people are standing fast in the face of the blockade because they are aware of the extent of the conspiracy being hatched against them. [end recording]
