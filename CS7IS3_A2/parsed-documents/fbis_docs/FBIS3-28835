The appeal was contained in the joint declaration issued at the second ministerial-level meeting on cooperation on the control of drug abuse between Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand which concluded on Wednesday. The joint declaration said: The three nations are deeply concerned with the unprecedented and alarming spread of narcotic drug abuse in all regions of the world, thus causing long-term adverse effects on the users themselves as well as on their families. The three sides unanimously agreed that coordination is needed at three levels -- national, regional, and sub-regional. The three countries agreed that the ministerial-level meeting on cooperation on controlling drug abuse should be held every two years to review progress of cooperation and to map out future cooperation plans. Senior officials on drug control from these countries will hold a meeting at least once a year to consult about the trends of drug use and trafficking as well as measures to suppress this problem. The next ministerial-level meeting of the three countries will be held in Laos in 1996.
