This follows the Independent Elections Commission's [IEC] finding on Wednesday against the ANC arising out of disruption of a National Party election meeting in Venda three weeks ago. "Although the happenings in Venda did not result from decisions by either the leadership or the structures of the ANC, the movement takes collective responsibility and will ensure that a message of political tolerance is disseminated to all our regions and structures," the statement said. It said the ANC had on a number of occasions publicly called on all members and supporters to desist from any activities that undermined the principles of free and fair electioneering. "In this regard, ANC President Nelson Mandela has issued a communique to all our regions and officials, to ensure that any ANC member found to have flouted the electoral code of conduct will be disciplined in terms of the ANC constitution." Thousands of posters and leaflets containing the electoral code of conduct have been distributed to all ANC regions and branches. "The ANC regrets all incidents of intimidation and disruption irrespective of who the perpetrators are," the statement said.
