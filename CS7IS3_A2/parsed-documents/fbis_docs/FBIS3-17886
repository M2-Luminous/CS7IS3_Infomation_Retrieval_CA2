Grigoriy Karasin, director of Foreign Ministry information and press department, stated this at today's briefing at the Foreign Ministry press center. He said that in September 1992 the governments of three countries (Russia, the United States, and the UK) adopted a joint statement envisaging a complex of measures to allay the parties' concern over abidance by the 1972 convention banning biological weapons. As part of the implementation of these accords, U.S. and British experts have visited four nonmilitary biological facilities in Russia. The experts' conclusions by no means correspond with the claims made in the British press, Grigoriy Karasin noted. It is regrettable that "information" of this kind is appearing at a time when Russia, the United States, and the UK, who are the depositories of the convention banning biological weapons, are making joint efforts to call a special convention on possible verification measures as early as this year, Grigoriy Karasin noted.
