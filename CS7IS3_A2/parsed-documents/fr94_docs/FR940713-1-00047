FR940713-1-00047 FR940713-1-00009 28. FAA Authorization. Pursuant to Section 17.4 of the Commission's Rules, we do not grant or modify a license until the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that the proposed transmitter site will not pose a hazard to air navigation. Applicants now state in their applications that they have applied for FAA clearance. However, once that clearance is obtained, applicants are not required to inform the Commission. To hasten the time that our staff learns of the FAA's hazard determinations, we propose to require the applicant to inform the Commission of the FAA's determination. We believe that this would accelerate service to the public. Commenters are invited to address the costs and benefits of adopting the proposal. 29. Interference Studies . Applicants often claim that their proposed facilities will cause no harmful interference, based either on their being beyond the radio horizon or on their signal being blocked by nearby terrain. However, such applicants frequently provide no terrain profiles to support such claims. Furthermore, whenever an applicant files a proposal claiming that no interference will be cause due to the signal's being blocked by the surrounding terrain, a question almost always arises as to the amount of signal that will be blocked. Many applicants conclude that any terrain obstruction, regardless of degree, completely blocks the signal. Our experience has demonstrated that this conclusion is not necessarily true. 30. Accordingly, we propose to amend the rules to require the submission of terrain profiles and a quantitative analysis of any additional signal loss calculated by using the Longley-Rice propagation model, Version 1.2.2, in the point-to-point mode. Adoption of the proposal would make mandatory a technical analysis that many applicants already use. The Longley-Rice model was derived from NBS Technical Note 101 and updated in 1982 by G. A. Hufford. Version 1.2.2 incorporated modifications described in a memorandum by Hufford in 1985. Terrain elevations used as input to the model should be from the United States Geological Survey three-second or 30-second digitized terrain databases. Further, we propose to disregard any claim of signal blockage caused by artificial structures. Such claims usually make impossible any quantitative analysis. Accordingly, we seek comment on these proposals. 31. Reasonable Assurance of Receive Sites . We have received a number of applications in which some of the schools listed as receive sites have subsequently informed us that they had, in fact, not agreed to participate in the proposed ITFS system. This practice forces the Commission to allocate its scarce resources processing an inaccurate application, then reprocessing it (and related mutually exclusive applications) when the information is corrected. Such duplicative processing significantly delays the final disposition of all ITFS applications. Therefore, we seek comment on how an applicant should demonstrate reasonable assurance of a receive site's legitimacy. We propose requiring a letter of assurance from the applicant, listing the receive sites' contact people, titles, and telephone numbers. With regard to noncompliance with any new requirement, should we automatically decline to consider any proposed receive site without adequate assurance? 32. Accreditation of Applicants Currently, pursuant to Section 74.932 of the Commission's Rules, an applicant to construct new facilities must report whether it, its members, or the receive sites it serves are accredited. The application form does not require the educator to specify whether it is the applicant or its members that are accredited. This ambiguity has opened the door to abuse of our procedures. Consequently, we have received applications in which the applicant is an accredited organization, but it proposes receive sites at non-accredited institutions. Applicants often evade the intent of the rule by having only one receive site out of many accredited, thereby defeating the fundamental purpose of the service, which is to serve the educational needs of accredited institutions. 33. Thus, we propose to require applicants to state whether and by whom each school listed as a receive site in accredited. We also propose not to consider in a tie-breaking proceeding a receive site that lacks this accompanying information, or that is unaccredited, as that would allow it unwarranted comparative consideration. Commenters are invited to address other ways we should utilize the additional information. Should we require a majority of receive sites to be accredited in order for the application to be grantable? Should we deny interference protection for any unaccredited receive site? We invite commenters to address any or all of the above proposals. However, we do not wish to limit the range of comments in this area. Thus, we welcome other proposals besides those discussed above that would safeguard both the efficiency of a window filing system and the integrity of our processes. Freeze of New Applications
