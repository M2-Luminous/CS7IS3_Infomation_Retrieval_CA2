Before yesterday's extraordinary Assembly of the Confederation of Trade Unions (KOZ), it was rumored that some trade union leaders disagree with this step. Yesterday, KOZ changed its original statement and, in a statement of the KOZ Assembly that was, according to KOZ Vice President Vladimir Stevko, approved "by all chairmen of indiviudal trade unions, with one or two exceptions," it declared: "On the basis of the nonfulfillment of the General Agreement by the Slovak Government in the preceding years, KOZ of the Slovak Republic regards the continuing nonfulfillment of the General Agreement for 1994 as a reason for KOZ to cease being a guarantor of social peace." As KOZ representatives specified at a subsequent news conference, the statement does not imply any immediate organizing of strikes or demonstrations. A decision on specific steps should be made by the next assembly, which will be held next week. [passage omitted]
