The conference had the following agenda: a) October 1994 elections b) Electoral guarantees The meeting amounted to a notable change in the relations among the various opposition political parties, and it stressed the will to overcome political and ideological differences with a view to forming a common platform. Although the meeting was not designed to make deliberations, important positions have been agreed upon regarding coalitions that the opposition could form for the presidential elections. The participating parties unanimously stated their intention of rapidly continuing with the negotiations with a view to forming coalitions because they believe only united can they constitute a serious alternative to the present government. Likewise, the participating parties stated the desire to begin consultations and to reach agreement on the choice of a single opposition candidate for the presidential elections to prevent the division of votes and to ensure a greater probability of victory. Regarding electoral guarantees, it was noted that there are objective situations that could endanger the electoral process -- namely, the impossibility of the opposition political parties to guarantee the deployment of monitors during the registration of voters and at polling and counting stations because the lack material and financial resources. Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] has been asked to fill this gap. Another serious cause for concern are the guarantees for the physical security of voters and candidates in view of the frequent persecution and intimidation carried out by local Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] authorities. To fill this gap it was decided to establish a commission to monitor and report such undemocratic actions. A commission was also established to begin contacts with the National Elections Commission, the UN Operations in Mozambique, and the international community with a view to facilitating the release of funds necessary for the electoral process. The conference unanimously rejected the use of computers for data processing and opted for a manual system, which is less susceptible to fraud and not as expensive.
