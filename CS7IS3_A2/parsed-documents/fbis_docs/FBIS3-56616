He described the situation in Belarus as complicated and contradictory, having noted that it should be fundamentally changed and that this can be done only through a new composition of parliament by early elections, which he is advocating. Having touched on a possible monetary merger with Russia, the Supreme Soviet chairman stated that if the merger of monetary systems produces merely a parity of prices for fuel, one could hope for an improvement of the economic situation. "However, no one will establish order in our house for us. It is for us to decide how we are going to go on living," he stressed.
