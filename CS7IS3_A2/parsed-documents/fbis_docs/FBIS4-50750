FBIS4-50750 "drchi098_m_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-098 Daily Report 16 May 1994 Military Jiang Zemin Instructs Army To Improve Style Jiang Zemin Instructs Army To Improve Style HK1905085994 Hong Kong KUANG CHIAO CHING in Chinese No 260, 16 May 94 pp 42-44 HK1905085994 Hong Kong KUANG CHIAO CHING Chinese BFN [By Leng Mou (0397 4188): "Jiang Zemin Performs an Operation on the Armed Forces in Order To Provide a Guarantee for National Security"] [Text] According to the instruction of Jiang Zemin, chairman of the Central Military Commission, the Central Military Commission and the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army [PLA] made arrangements for all military units to train officers in rotation by running courses to study the third volume of "The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" during this year. Reportedly, the CPC top leadership holds that it is necessary to improve the style of the armed forces through such study activities. Jiang Zemin stressed the need to link the theoretical study with reality and to send the officers to grass-roots units for investigations and studies so that they can work out solutions for existing problems. General Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, recently pointed out when inspecting the troops from the three services in Shandong, that the primary tasks for the armed forces at present are to defend the party's basic line, to defend the socialist system, and to "obey the orders of the party central leading body, with Jiang Zemin at the core, at all times." Zhang Zhen's remarks showed that a major aim of the current efforts to improve the style of the troops was to guide them in consciously following and serving the party's "overall work arrangements" [gong zuo da ju 1562 0155 1129 1444] and prompt them into faithfully defending the central leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core. This year is crucial for the mainland's reform and opening and because many major reform measures will be adopted, the country's socioeconomic and political stability will face tests in many aspects. This year, reform will enter the stage of dealing with some of the most difficult issues and will thus be rather risky. In such circumstances, the armed forces will have to provide effective security guarantees for the advances of reform. Zhang Zhen said that in order to follow and serve the party's overall work arrangements, the armed forces should act according to the general requirements put forward by Jiang Zemin, that is, "measuring up to standard politically, perfectly mastering military skills, keeping the fine style of work, being well-disciplined, and ensuring effective logistics support." Zhang Zhen told the troops of the three services in Shandong to put all of the five requirements set by Jiang Zemin into practice in a down-to-earth manner, with political integrity being of primary importance. In the third volume of Deng Xiaoping's works, one can find that Deng mentioned "Jiang Zemin as the core" of the central leadership on many occasions. This is of special importance for the authority of the third-generation leading body headed by Jiang Zemin. Jiang Zemin required that leading cadres at all levels reduce dining and other social activities to a minimum so that they will have more time to study the third volume of Deng's works. Jiang also required that while they themselves study in earnest, they should also organize their immediate subordinates to study properly; and that party cadres and officers at and above the county and regimental level should all attend the study classes in rotation within two to three years. He said that the means of propaganda, such as newspapers, radio and television broadcasts, and publications, should be used fully; experience should be summed up in good time and spread widely; and teaching materials about the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics should be compiled for political education. Jiang Zemin said that the theoretical study in the armed forces should also be closely linked with the reality of the troops and should serve the purpose of promoting the enhancement of the overall quality of leading bodies and the comprehensive development of the troops. On 26 April, Liu Huaqing held a discussion meeting with the commanders and political commissars of six military regions, who were attending the Third Theoretical Study Class for Principal Provincial and Ministry Leaders in the Central Party School, on the issue of studying the third volume of Deng's works and using Deng's theory to guide the work of the armed forces in all aspects. Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou, members of the Central Military Commission, attended the meeting. Liu Huaqing told the six military region leaders Li Xinliang, Liu Jingsong, Song Qingwei, Gu Hui, Li Xilin, and Li Jiulong that the troops should be commanded rigorously and officers at all levels should go deep into the realities of life and effectively enhance the military training for the troops. At present, it is particularly necessary to intensify the routine management of the troops and senior officers should set a good example for the troops they command. The establishment and development of the market economy will inevitably cause a range of new conditions and new problems for the management of the troops in China. The work of troop management and education will face a new challenge. In order to solve such issues, it is not enough to merely rely on ideological education and administrative and economic means. Only by relying on the legal system and intensifying troop management through enforcing the military rules and regulations can we effectively maintain good order inside the military units. In the last few years, Jiang Zemin has repeatedly stressed that leaders at all levels must attach importance to employing the rules and regulations for improving troop management. He instructed the PLA to "give priority to troop management" this year by rigorously commanding the troops according to the established military rules and regulations and rigorously enforcing military discipline in practice. Since the beginning of this year, the Central Military Commission has taken the work of strengthening and improving troop management as an important point in its work plan. Pilot schemes for improving troop management in various aspects and at various levels in the new period have been carried out. The primary aim is to enhance the quality of officers who are in charge of the troops and emphasis was laid on rectifying the style and enforcing discipline. Not long ago, the directors of the troop affairs and equipment departments of all military regions were summoned to Beijing. They analyzed the situation regarding the implementation of the instructions on "giving priority to troop management" and found that the key to improving troop management in the next stage lay in the rigorous enforcement of the rules and regulations. Zhang Zhen recently said that in the course of improving troop management, it was necessary to implement the Program for Consolidating Grass-Roots Military Units effectively. He said: This is not only a task for the combat companies, the roles of grass-roots officers, backbone soldiers, and military personnel committees should all be brought into play. Zhang Zhen said: "In a combat company, people are squad, platoon, or company leaders, or Communist Party members, or Communist Youth League members, or at least revolutionary soldiers. So, everyone should play a role in troop management and should be subject to management. Thus, troop management as a whole can be ensured." In the study classes for military officers on Deng's works, people summed up five major demonstrations of unhealthy "formalism" conduct among the troops at present: First, meetings were taken as a criterion for measuring the degree of importance being attached by leaders and for assessing work performances. Meetings were even taken as concrete action in implementing the instructions from the upper leading organs. As a result, innumerable meetings were held and leaders had to attend many meetings and deal with immense amounts of paperwork. Second, the speeches by leaders of the Central Military Commission, the military regions, the army corps, the armies, the divisions, and the brigades were relayed from top to bottom to the letter without regard to the contents of the instructions and the specific conditions of those listening to the instructions. Professional systems also had to relay instructions to the corresponding organs at the lower level. Sometimes, the spirit of one meeting or one document was relayed repeatedly on different occasions. Third, there were excessive comparisons and examinations adding burdens to the grass-roots units and adding too much pressure on the rank and file. Fourth, a number of officers and leaders at various levels were sent to grass-roots units as a measure to carry forward the style of going deep into the realities of life and they intervened excessively in the work at grass-roots level and set back the initiative of the grass-roots units. Fifth, some leaders liked to take expedient measures which might achieve quick and superficial results so that they would win a good name and would also save effort. Lieutenant General Li Xinliang, political commissar of the Shenyang Military Region, recently called for rectifying the work style among the troops and creating a new situation in the work of the military units. He said that "a major breakthrough can be made in the aspect of improving the work style of the troops." Recently, the Shenyang Military Region took the lead in the whole Army to improve the style of troops. The concrete requirements were laid down in the form of an official document. The specific rules include: Meetings and activities to be held by the military region and attended by army-level leaders and department heads should first be approved by the commander or the political commissar; and meetings to be held in subordinate military units should be approved by the party committee of the military region or by the military region leader's conference. When leaders of the military region inspect subordinate units, the unit leaders should not leave the barracks to meet the military region leaders or see them off. No security vehicles should be used if there are no major activities and no videotapes or photos should be taken. No welcoming ceremonies and welcoming banners or streamers should be arranged to greeting military leaders. Li Xinliang also set three requirements for more than 100 senior officers at and above the division level who attended the Deng's works study class: Make more visits to those units which have a weak foundation and cannot acquire advanced experience easily; do more things which may not bring fame but can bring solid benefits to the troops; and do more things that may not bring fame and benefit to the leaders but will enhance the combat effectiveness of the troops.
