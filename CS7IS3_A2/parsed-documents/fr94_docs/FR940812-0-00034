ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action revokes Class E airspace at Bozrah, CT. This action is a result of the cancellation of the Special Instrument Approach Procedures for Runway 2 and Runway 20 at Gager Field. The intended effect of this action is to remove the controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Bozrah, CT. This airspace is no longer needed for instrument flight rules operation at Bozrah, CT. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, October 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles M. Taylor, Airspace Specialist, System Management Branch, ANE&hyph;530, Federal Aviation Administration, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7532; fax (617) 238&hyph;7560. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On March 11, 1994, the FAA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to revoke Class E airspace at Bozrah, CT (59 FR 11561). The proposal was prompted by the cancellation of the Special Instrument Approach Procedures for Runway 2 and Runway 20 at Gager Field. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal of the FAA. No comments on the proposal were received. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298, July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace revocation listed in this document will be removed subsequently from the Order. The Rule This amendment of part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revokes the Class E airspace at Bozrah, CT. This action is a result of the cancellation of the Special Instrument Approach Procedures for Runway 2 and Runway 20 at Gager Field. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves only an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep these regulations operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air).
