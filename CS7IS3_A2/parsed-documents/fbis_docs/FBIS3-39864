Cindoruk sent a letter to the president of the European Parliament following the Parliament's decision on the subject. In his letter, Cindoruk noted that the decision by the European Parliament blatantly discriminates against the various regions in Turkey and ignores the maturity of democratic processes. Cindoruk remarked that there is no logical reason whatsoever to rely on observers to secure a just and free election atmosphere during the upcoming local elections.
