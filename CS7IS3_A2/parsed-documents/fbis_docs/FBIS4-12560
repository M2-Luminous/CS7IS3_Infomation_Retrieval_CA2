FBIS4-12560 "drnes069_o_94015" FBIS-NES-94-069 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 SYRIA Radio: Oslo Accord Will Not Achieve Israeli Security Radio: Oslo Accord Will Not Achieve Israeli Security JN0904155894 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1135 GMT 9 Apr 94 JN0904155894 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Station commentary] [Text] Gentlemen: After imposing a military siege on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Israeli Government decided to do without the Palestinian work force and bring in foreign labor from outside. It is noteworthy that nearly 100,000 Palestinians worked in various Israeli economic installations, especially in tedious fields of work, in return for low wages that are not tantamount to the Israelis' wages. Officials in Rabin's government hinted that these measures reflect the accelerating deterioration of security conditions and the impossibility of coexistence between Palestinians and Israelis. Many believed that this reality could prompt Rabin's government to continue on the road to a sound peace. However, this has not happened. Closing the occupied territories is a clear admission that Israel's previous proposals have failed, that the agreements it concluded with the Palestinian side did not change anything on the ground, and that tension could increase. Israeli officials are fully aware that the occupation contradicts peace and security and that the Oslo agreement and the following agreements and arrangements did not meet the minimum demands and ambitions of the Palestinian people. These agreements retained the settlers and the settlements, thus keeping the Palestinians in danger. The settlers are preparing for new massacres and are not hiding this fact. It is natural for the Palestinians to defend themselves and to raise their voices to demand real freedom and dignity. Indeed, there can be no freedom and dignity with the continuation of the occupation and settlements. There can be no freedom and dignity under an administrative rule in which the final say is for the occupying authority. Moreover, this contradicts the UN Security Council's resolutions that stipulate a full Israeli withdrawal and the removal of the settlements. If, according to its officials, Israel is first concerned about Israelis' security, then the separate Oslo agreement will never achieve security for Israel. This is because occupation contradicts security and the Oslo agreement did not remove the occupation and the settlements. A real, just, and comprehensive peace that uproots oppression and removes all manifestations of occupation and coercion is the only peace that can achieve security. Israel is building new walls and high racist barriers by imposing a siege on the Palestinian people, by turning the occupied territories into a detention center, and by ordering its army to raid houses and districts and arrest Arab citizens in a manner that only means further security deterioration for Israel. Instead of doing this, Israel should confront the roots of the problem and admit facts and realities. It should accept the UN Security Council resolutions and adhere to the bases and requirements of a just and comprehensive peace. Is it not appropriate for Israel to exchange land for peace and grant the Palestinian people freedom of self-determination? How long will Israel continue to disavow the UN resolutions and ignore the fact that the Palestinian people cannot remain the prisoners of its tools of repression, that is, its soldiers, policemen, and settlers. If Israel is using the impossibility of coexistence and the absence of security as a justification for its new repressive measures, then why doesn't it withdraw from the occupied territories and grant the Palestinians their right to self-determination and allow them to build their own future? Do Israeli officials think the struggling Palestinian people will submit for one moment to the schemes of occupation, Judaization, and settlements? Israel knows the answer, despite all its efforts to ignore it -- an answer confirmed by daily developments. Unless Israel submits to what developments dictate and admits that its first obligation, according to international legitimacy, is to withdraw and remove the settlements, then we do not think the blessings of peace will prevail over this region, which is plagued by the mentality of Zionist expansion, aggression, and hegemony.
