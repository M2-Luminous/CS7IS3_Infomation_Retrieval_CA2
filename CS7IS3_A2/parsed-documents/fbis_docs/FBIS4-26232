In the company of Xie Fei, CPC Political Bureau member and Guangdong provincial party committee secretary, and of other officials, Jiang Zemin arrived in Zhongshan the day before yesterday [16 June]. He met with some Taiwan businessmen who were running investment projects in the city, and visited a local Taiwan-funded shoe factory. This is the second inspection tour of Guangdong by Jiang Zemin in the past nine months. A reliable source told this reporter that Jiang Zemin and his entourage arrived in Guangdong on Wednesday afternoon (15 June). After staying in Guangzhou for one night, they left for Zhongshan by car on 16 June. On the afternoon of that day, Jiang toured the city of Shiqi in the company of local party and government officials. After that, he drove to Sanxiang to visit the Baolong shoe factory, a local, wholly Taiwan-funded investment. According to an informed local source, the Baolong shoe factory is the largest wholly Taiwan-funded enterprise so far operating in Zhongshan. Employing several thousand workers, the factory exports all its products abroad. Having had a brief chat with the Taiwanese hosts in the factory's reception room, Jiang Zemin visited two production workshops. Jiang Zemin stayed at the Zhongshan Hot Spring Guest House the night before last [16 June]. Yesterday morning, he met at the guest house with some Taiwan businessmen who are running investment projects in Zhongshan, mainly to solicit their opinions on the local investment environment. The informed source believed that Jiang Zemin obviously had a strong motive behind his behavior of particularly highlighting his concern about Taiwan-funded enterprises during his current inspection tour of Guangdong Province. After the Qiandao Lake case, the idea of "independence for Taiwan" has been activated daily in Taiwan. The CPC higher leadership's response to this development is to increase its economic influence on Taiwan, while using the mass media to strongly criticize Li Teng-hui's "radical" remarks. In light of their successful experience in dealing with the United States regarding the most-favored-nation status issue, the CPC higher authorities have made up their minds to play the "economic card" with Taiwan. Recently, high-ranking CPC officials have paid visits to Taiwan-funded enterprises across the country. For instance, Wang Zhaoguo, head of the United Front Work Department and director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, made an inspection tour of Jiangxi and Hubei. Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, with association Vice Chairman Tang Shubei, visited Zhejiang and Jiangsu. All of them assumed a "high posture" toward Taiwan businessmen during their inspection tours. So it is believed that Jiang Zemin's current visit to Guangdong will bring this round of the great united front work offensive to a climax. Jiang Zemin last visited Guangdong in late September last year. During that inspection tour, he called the party and government leaders of the six central-south provinces to meet in Guangzhou to solicit their opinions on the macroeconomic regulation and control operation. He also went to Zhanjiang to inspect the South China Sea Fleet, in his capacity as chairman of the Central Military Commission. Apart from the inspection of Taiwan-funded enterprises, Jiang Zemin's current visit to Guangdong also will focus on state-run enterprises and on local scientific and technological development. By the way, Zhongshan is one of the cities in Guangdong Province selected to run pilot projects under the "Torch Program" for the development of science and technology sponsored by the State Science and Technology Commission. Like his Shanghai trip earlier and like other leaders' visits across the country, Jiang Zemin's present tour has another purpose: Conducting surveys in preparation for the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, which is to be held later this year. The informed source disclosed that Jiang Zemin originally planned to further his inspection tour from Zhongshan to Zhuhai, but his plan to visit Zhuhai has been canceled for security reasons following a major fire in Zhuhai earlier. His motorcade left Zhongshan yesterday and turned northward. It is said that he may pay a visit to Foshan and Sanshui, both under the threat of flood. A Foshan resident said jokingly: "Jiang Zemin is not coming at the right time; perhaps he is bringing the flood along with him everywhere in Guangdong."
