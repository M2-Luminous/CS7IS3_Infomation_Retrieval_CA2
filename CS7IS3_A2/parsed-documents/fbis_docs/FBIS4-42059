Although history demonstrates that the Old Continent always manages in the end, for better or worse, to find solutions to apparently dramatic crises, the construction of Europe--at least at the pace and with the enthusiasm with which it progressed starting in the middle of the 1980's--appears to have reached an impasse. More serious than this, at times one has the feeling that Europe is increasingly lacking in thinkers and politicians of sufficient stature and charisma to reach the citizen and, in some way, to touch him--not to say excite him--to mobilize him behind an ideal that is not limited to the ambition to consume more and better products. The Old Europe appears to be showing troubling signs of real aging, in terms of lack of imagination, excessive bureaucracy, and the "officialization" of the system. Without going into a discussion of the very serious manifestations of this tendency (such as the relative unreadability, for most citizens, of such basic documents as the Single Europe Act or the Maastricht Treaty, a situation which is even worse when the respective government leaders determine that it is irrelevant to submit them to debate and referendum), it is at the very least troubling to look upon the dearth of ideas and the "deja vu" of the solutions recently appearing in such highly publicized and much discussed documents as the so-called green book ("European Social Policy--Options for the Union") or the white book ("Growth, Competitiveness, Employment--Challenges and Pathways to the 21st Century"). Both documents are a perfect illustration of the impasse that has been reached with regard to the evolution of the European Union and, moreover, of the inability to arrive at a convincing way out. The central issue is that, for many and various reasons, Europe is faced with a massive 17 million unemployed (who cannot be seen as occasionally or temporarily jobless), a situation which is not showing any significant signs of abating naturally. There are those who will say that unemployment is the price to pay for increased productivity, technological innovation, and the corresponding replacement of men by machinery. In fact, there are many examples of this; assessments of the French chemical industry, for instance, reveal that whereas production rose by 51 percent between 1980 and 1992, employment fell by 12 percent. Studies at the company level confirm this trend, as producers in various sectors (aluminum, glass, etc.) today need 40 to 50 percent of the workers they needed in 1981 to achieve the same volume of production. However, when it is acknowledged in the forward of the white book itself, that in the last 20 years the European Union has been losing ground to Japan and the United States in terms of foreign market shares, research and development, and economic growth, it would be expected that the problem of unemployment would afflict the latter powers much more than the European continent, which was apparently less actively engaged in the productivity race. Hence it is strange that, in the European Union, the unemployed represent 11 percent of the active civilian population (unemployment has risen regularly since the beginning of the 1970's, except for the period between 1986 and 1990), whereas the jobless rate has not gone beyond 7 percent in the United States and is barely 2.5 percent in Japan. Thus there seems to be no doubt that, for all that unemployment is a world problem, it must be admitted that it has a specifically European mien and salience. And it is precisely in the specifically European proposals intended to point toward a solution to the problem that the dearth of ideas becomes dramatic, particularly when it is argued that the European Union cannot be seen as a merely economic project, but is, above all, a political project with determined social goals and a humanistic conception of the rights and guarantees of the workers. Thus the response to an issue of this dimension and with this degree of political and social risk must necessarily call for deeper and more radical thinking than the mere reiteration, by the officials of the Commission and their advisors, that the key to the problem will be in the introduction of some modifications to the system of education and professional training, the strengthening of the social dialogue, the stimulation of competition within the single market, the creation of a trans-European communications network, the encouragement of research and development, and the vitalization of activities in support of the aged, children, etc. There is nothing radically new in these proposals, nothing that has not been said and tried in the past, nor can one hope for results that will be powerful enough to check or reverse the hemorrhage. In fact, the European Union seems more and more to be approaching relative isolation from the outside and real world, making decisions based on documents of an academic tone, prepared more to respond belatedly to requests for reports than to come up with serious solutions to the real problems (it is seen how Europe moved toward the single market, with political decisions based merely on estimates of the corresponding positive impact on some economic variables, and how, when such estimates were not confirmed, it simply undertook further studies on how to relaunch employment and competition...). Since the degree of exaction is relatively limited, who better than the Community officials, assisted by their advisers, to justify "a priori" the merit of certain hypotheses and to find "a posteriori" reasons for their failure? Meanwhile, they are always putting forward lines of thinking whose utility is closely linked to the criteria for the management of the structural funds, which are the true sources of power and influence. Thus Europe is closing up, becoming artificial and bureaucratized, managed by civil servants and supported by funds. And, dangerously, the entire social structure is beginning to fall under the influence of this way of life. An article appearing recently in NEWSWEEK notes that, since 1990, the European Union--which has one-third again as many inhabitants as the United States--has generated only 20 percent as many jobs as the United States (8 million jobs, as against 41 million jobs); perhaps even more telling is the fact that between 1970 and 1991, the United States created six new jobs in the private sector for each new job in the public sector, whereas the European Union only created less than two new public jobs for each new job in the private sector! [as published] And this may be the greatest risk hanging over Europe. In this rut, the citizens of Europe, lulled by bureaucrats and supported by funds, increasingly aspire to a peaceful spot in the protective shade of the bureaucracy and have distanced themselves more and more from any ambition to create competitive and dynamic enterprises. It might be more worthwhile to promote deep and straightforward reflection regarding issues of this kind than to engage in discussions that are only seemingly broad, considering that the documents under discussion are themselves grievously limited.
