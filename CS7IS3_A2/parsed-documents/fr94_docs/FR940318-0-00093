ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: USEPA is taking action to approve a revision to Wisconsin's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. USEPA's action is based upon a revision request which was submitted by the State to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended November 15, 1990 (Act), and the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) regulations. The PAMS regulation requires the State to provide for establishment and maintenance of an enhanced ambient air quality monitoring network in the form of PAMS by November 12, 1993. DATES: This final rule is effective May 17, 1994, unless notice is received by April 18, 1994, that someone wishes to submit adverse comments. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: Carlton T. Nash, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;18J), United States Environmental Protection Agency, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois, 60604. Copies of the SIP revision and USEPA's analysis are available for inspection at the following address: United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Air and Radiation Division, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois, 60604. Telephone Jacqueline Nwia at (312) 886&hyph;6081 before visiting the Region 5 Office.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jacqueline Nwia, Environmental Engineer, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch, Regulation Development Section (AT&hyph;18J), United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Chicago, Illinois, 60604, (312) 886&hyph;6081. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Summary of State Submittal On November 15, 1993, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) submitted to the USEPA a SIP revision, incorporating PAMS into the ambient air quality monitoring network of State or Local Air Monitoring Stations (SLAMS) and National Air Monitoring Stations (NAMS). The State will establish and maintain PAMS as part of the overall ambient air quality monitoring network. Section 182(c)(1) of the Act and the General Preamble (57 FR 13515) require that USEPA promulgate rules for enhanced monitoring of ozone, oxides of nitrogen (NO x ), and volatile organic compounds (VOC) no later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of the Act. In addition, the Act requires that, following the promulgation of the rules relating to enhanced ambient monitoring, the State must commence actions to adopt and implement a program based on these rules, to improve monitoring for ambient concentrations of ozone, NO x , and VOC and to improve monitoring of emissions of NO x and VOC. The final PAMS rule was promulgated by USEPA on February 12, 1993 (58 FR 8452). Section 58.40(a) of the revised rule requires the State to submit a photochemical assessment monitoring network description, including a schedule for implementation, to the Administrator within 6 months after promulgation or by August 12, 1993. Further, ยง58.20(f) requires the State to provide for the establishment and maintenance of a PAMS network within 9 months after promulgation of the final rule or November 12, 1993. On August 12, 1993, the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium (LADCO) submitted an alternative PAMS network description on behalf of the LADCO States of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana, including a schedule for implementation. This submittal is currently being reviewed by the USEPA and is intended to satisfy the requirements of ยง58.40(a). A joint network description and implementation schedule is allowed by ยง58.40(a)(3) for States where the State's PAMS network requires monitoring stations in different States and/or Regions. Since network descriptions may change annually, they are not part of the SIP as recommended by the Guideline for the Implementation of the Ambient Air Monitoring Regulations 40 CFR 58 . However, the network description is negotiated and approved during an annual review as required by 40 CFR 58.25 and 58.36 and the revision to be codified at ยง58.46. On November 15, 1993, Wisconsin submitted to the USEPA a proposed revision to the Wisconsin ozone SIP. This submittal included a copy of rule 144.31(1)(g) of the Wisconsin Administrative Rule, ``Air pollution control; powers and duties,'' and supplementary information demonstrating that the WDNR has the authority to conduct ambient air quality monitoring and other activities to determine the magnitude of air pollution throughout the State. This would encompass establishing and maintaining a PAMS network. A letter finding the submittal complete was sent to the State on January 4, 1994. The Wisconsin PAMS SIP revision is intended to meet the requirements of section 182(c)(1) of the Act and affect compliance with the PAMS regulations, to be codified at 40 CFR part 58, as promulgated on February 12, 1993. The WDNR held a public hearing on the PAMS on November 11, 1993. II. Analysis of State Submittal The Wisconsin PAMS SIP revision will provide Wisconsin with the authority to establish and operate the PAMS sites, secure State funds for PAMS and provide the USEPA with authority to enforce the implementation of PAMS, since their implementation is required by the Act. The criteria used to review the proposed SIP revision are derived from the PAMS regulations, to be codified at 40 CFR part 58, the Guideline for the Implementation of the Ambient Air Monitoring Regulations 40 CFR Part 58 (USEPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;78&hyph;038, OAQPS, November 1979), the September 2, 1993 memorandum from G. T. Helms entitled Final Boilerplate Language for the PAMS SIP Submittal , the Act and the General Preamble. The September 2, 1993 memorandum from G. T. Helms entitled Final Boilerplate Language for the PAMS SIP Submittal stipulates that the PAMS SIP, at a minimum, must: enable the monitoring of criteria pollutants, such as ozone and NO 2 and non-criteria pollutants, such as NO x , NO, speciated VOC, including carbonyls, as well as meteorological parameters; provide a copy of the approved (or proposed) PAMS network description, including the phase-in schedule, for public inspection during the public notice and/or comment period provided for in the SIP revision or, alternatively, provide information to the public upon request concerning the State's plans for implementing the rules; make reference to the fact that PAMS will become a part of the State or local air monitoring stations (SLAMS) network; and provide a statement that SLAMS will employ Federal reference (FRM) or equivalent methods while most PAMS sampling will be conducted using methods approved by the USEPA which are not FRM or equivalent. The Wisconsin SIP revision provides that the network will measure ambient levels of ozone, NO x , speciated VOC, including hydrocarbons and carbonyls and meteorological data. During the public comment period and hearing, Wisconsin provided a copy of the proposed alternative PAMS network description, including a schedule of implementation, to the public upon request to Ralph Patterson of the WDNR. The SIP revision provides that each station in the air quality surveillance network provided for by this SIP will be termed a SLAMS. Finally, the SIP revision provides that the methods used in SLAMS will be reference or equivalent methods as defined by USEPA at 40 CFR 50.1, while the methods used in PAMS will be approved by USEPA on a regional basis as part of its approval of the network descriptions. III. Rulemaking Action USEPA approves the revision to the Wisconsin ozone SIP for PAMS. Because USEPA considers today's action noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it today without prior proposal. The action will become effective on May 17, 1994. However, if we receive notice by April 18, 1994, that someone wishes to submit adverse comments, then USEPA will publish: (1) A document that withdraws the action, and (2) a document that begins a new rulemaking by proposing the action and establishing a comment period. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. The USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators). A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. Under the revised tables this action remains classified as a Table 2. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years (54 FR 2222). The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. Because the USEPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by May 17, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. See section 307(b)(2). The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the federally approved State Implementation Plan for conformance with the provisions of the Act enacted on November 15, 1990.
