FBIS4-9818 "drlat064_o_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-064 Daily Report 27 Mar 1994 Colombia Minister Sends Letter on Protocol to Gaviria Minister Sends Letter on Protocol to Gaviria PA0104171694 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 27 Mar 94 pp 1A, 8C PA0104171694 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO Spanish BFN [Text] The Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces suggested yesterday that Colombia join Protocol II of the Geneva Convention of 1949, a multilateral agreement that contains the international human rights principles that cannot be violated during armed conflicts. The protocol bans terrorism as a form of armed struggle, inhumane and collective punishments, torture, the taking of hostages, and, especially, attacks on the civilian population, church representatives, and medical missions, among others. The Cesar Gaviria government decided to submit to Congress a bill to include Protocol II in Colombian legislation after deeming that the agreement does not adversely affect the country's sovereignty, nor undermine the operational capabilities of the Public Force in the fight against armed rebels. Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda and General Ramon Emilio Gil, commander of the Armed Forces, sent a letter to President Cesar Gaviria yesterday saying it was "advisable" for Colombia to join the Protocol II. The defense minister said adherence to Protocol II "would not imply the recognition of the guerrilla groups as a belligerent force." The government's adherence to what has been stipulated in the aforementioned protocol is, in practice, Colombia's demonstration to the international community that in the country the rights of the participants in the armed conflict are respected, which means that international human rights norms are respected. Protocol II supplements Article 3 of the Geneva Convention, which refers to the protection of persons who are victims or who are adversely affected by the conflict. This agreement regulates the treatment given to persons not involved in the conflict or those who have intervened in the conflict but are no longer capable of participating in it. Protocol II, in addition to prohibiting the taking of hostages, homicides, torture, practices such as slavery, terrorism, pillage, and collective punishments, also calls for the protection of persons who have been stripped of their freedom. In the case of a noninternational conflict that is taking place on the territory of a high contracting party (the state, in this case Colombia), Protocol II is applied as long as the rebels are carrying out their actions under a responsible command and are exercising control over part of the territory that can allow them to conduct sustained military operations. If these conditions (as in the case of Colombia) are not fulfilled, the guerrillas may not apply the protocol rules. In this regard, in the letter sent to President Gaviria, Pardo and Gil pointed out that the country's adherence to Protocol II "would not imply recognition of the guerrilla groups as a belligerent force because adherence only implies a commitment by the state or the high contracting party. Besides, it is clear that the illegal armed groups are not subject to international law." The text of Pardo and Gil's letter sent to the president follows: Mr. President: At the direction of the Armed Forces General Command, the Joint Staff has conducted a study of the main recommendations that have been made regarding the advisability of adhering to Protocol II of the Geneva Convention of 1949. The arguments in favor and against have been reviewed, the results of which are contained in an attached document. In general, we have found that adherence to the aforementioned protocol would not imply recognition of the guerrilla groups as a belligerent force because adherence only implies a commitment by the state or the high contracting party. Besides, it is clear that the illegal armed groups are not subject to international law. We may conclude, therefore, that the aforementioned organizations will not have the go ahead to freely conduct gun-running activities or to have diplomatic representation abroad; in no case will the members of the aforementioned organizations, who may be captured, receive prisoner of war status and they must surrender to the justice system as it is now done. Seen in light of international law and other such protocols, particularly Article 3 of Protocol II, it is clear that national sovereignty will be respected at all times: To the letter, Article 3 of Protocol II states: "No provision of this protocol may be cited to undermine the sovereignty of a state or to defend the national unity and territorial safety of a state by all legal means." [sentence as published] Therefore, the state's ability to repress and control subversion will not be reduced at all. The Armed Forces are in compliance with those provisions of International Humanitarian Law that are included in Protocol II in question. The laws and regulations that govern the Armed Forces meet the requirements set forth in said Protocol II. Hence, its application will not imply any degree of limitation or diminishment of the Public Force's operational capability. Furthermore, as established by No. 2 of Article 214 of the Constitution, the provisions of International Humanitarian Law will be abided by during a state of emergency. This obviously includes those cited in Protocol II. These provisions, then, were in effect during the State of Internal Disturbance, from 8 November, 1992, to 4 August, 1993. Upon the conclusion of said state, this Ministry felt that the Armed Forces should continue to abide strictly by these same rules and issued Defense Ministry Directive No. 017 of August 1993. In so doing, the Ministry issued permanent orders and instructions to all members of the Armed Forces, regarding the respect for and adherence to Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law. The directive also provides for training personnel in these areas, which are the same areas invoked by Protocol II. Last, the attached document includes several recommendations, based mainly on the following two aspects: 1) The need to adopt the necessary legal measures to penalize serious violations -- yet to be defined -- of the regulations listed in Article 3, which are common to the Geneva Convention and Protocol II; and 2) The need for prior study of any reservations presented by other states regarding the provisions of Protocol II, as an important elements in analyzing the new instrument. As stated in this note and in the attached documents, therefore, we believe it would be beneficial to present this Protocol II of the 1949 Geneva Convention to the Honorable Senate for discussion during the current congressional session. Signed: Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda and General Ramon Emilio Gil Bermudez, the commanding general of the Armed Forces.
