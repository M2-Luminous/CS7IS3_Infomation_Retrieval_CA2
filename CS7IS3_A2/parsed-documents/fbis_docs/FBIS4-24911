Lake, with President Bill Clinton at D-Day celebration in Portsmouth, England, was quoted by REUTER NEWS AGENCY as saying the code-named "Rimpac" exercise "is not a show of force for North Korea's benefit." The United States have warned of a wave of international sanctions against DPRK which has dispute with the International Atomic Energy Agency over nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang has said the sanctions would be regarded as war. The U.S naval manoeuvre has aroused fears that tension on the Korean Peninsula would escalate. But Lake said the exercise was not targeted on DPRK. "There has been a long-scheduled routine exercise involving the United States and other nations," Lake said, "we are not making any new deployment or redeployment."
