This was reported by the Iraqi National Congress (INC), an umbrella organization of various opposition groups, in London on Friday [4 March]. Such a military strike would be a direct challenge to the West, which has undertaken to protect the Kurdish region. The area is being monitored by U.S., British, and French aircraft. According to INC's information, in talks with senior military officials in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on 23 February, Saddam announced the invasion of the Kurdish territory for early March. In a televised speech in January, the head of state said that he was intending to spend the Islamic (Id al-Fitr) feast in Kurdistan. The feast falls on 11 March. The British Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed the troop movements in Iraq. A spokesman said in London: "It would be extremely unwise of Saddam to take such action."
