Karstens, supreme allied commander Europe, intends to visit the air force base in the Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] capital and aviation units in the suburbs of Bishkek. The delegation arrived in the republic yesterday evening. According to the official version of the Kirghiz Defence Ministry's press centre, during its meetings with the republican leadership and with the heads of the Defence Ministry, the sides will discuss the prospects of the development of equitable and mutually advantageous relations and business contacts. However, some local observers assert that one of the subjects of the discussions will be the deployment of an air force base of the Atlantic bloc in Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan]. This explains the delegation's interest in aviation installations.
