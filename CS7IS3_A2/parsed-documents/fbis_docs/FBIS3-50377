English? Unfortunately I do not speak Serbo-Croatian. Thank you very much. However, this is not enough. Well, I had a one-hour conversation with President Milosevic and I was glad that Mr. [Andros] Agoston, chairman of the Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians, attended this conversation on the Serbian side. We discussed both bilateral issues and economic ones -- how we can work on the resumption of economic relations between the two countries, how we should work, and what kind of plans we should establish. We should obviously admit that the basic problem is economic life, and this is largely as a result of sanctions. I have listened very carefully to the president's stands and opinions, as well as Minister Jovanovic's on how a solution for Bosnia can be found. It is really not for me to say whether conditions offered for peace are sufficient, but I hope that on the basis of the proposals of the European Union, the so-called Juppe-Kinkel proposals, it will be possible to bring this conflict to an end. I can see that there is a readiness on the Serbian side to adopt these proposals and recommendations. With Mr. President I also discussed the question of the so-called Krajinas, regions that are close to Hungary, such as the Baranja region. We have a large number of refugees from Baranja who were forced to flee. I also expressed hope that a serious facility such as an oil pipeline should be opened. This is very important for Hungary, but also for Yugoslavia. I think that the present situation is such that the relations between Serbia and Croatia are promising and that this will perhaps enable all of us to enjoy the fruits of this facility which was in fact a joint investment of the whole of Yugoslavia and Hungary. I also think that it is important not only for your and my country, but also for Europe that these hostilities end and, as I said in an earlier interview, Hungary will be very happy to support the lifting of sanctions, but this can only happen when it receives international approval. [Jovanovic] It has turned out that with the end of the Yugoslav crisis coming nearer, prospects are opening for the strengthening of our relations with neighboring countries. The arrival of Mr. Jeszenszky here is also the first swallow, the harbinger announcing that the end of the crisis is coming closer and that the time for beginning the normalization of relations with neighboring and other countries is coming. We also had this in mind when we examined the prospects of development of bilateral relations. We also touched upon the conclusion of projects linked with the Belgrade-Budapest-Vienna railroad and highway. We also pointed to the geographic-strategic importance that the two countries have, being on the road connecting Europe and Asia. The interest number one in order that peace returns to Bosnia-Herzegovina immediately and that negative developments are prevented is for all countries to advocate immediate suspension or lifting of sanctions. This is the shortest and easiest cure for the belligerent policy that the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo persistently carries out at the persuasion of forces from outside who see their interests in continuing the crisis and continuing the war.
