The new year of 1994 is closely associated with elections to the new Parliament of Moldova. It was specifically this event of historical significance in the socio-political life of the republic that compelled me to insist on the conduct of this conference at the start of the year. The chairman of Parliament, the prime minister, chairman of the Supreme Court, chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, procurator of the republic, members of government, heads of state departments, section chiefs, state office managers, presidential counselors, chairmen of rayon executive committees, city mayors, Chisinau municipal authorities, as well as representatives of the mass media were invited and kindly agreed to attend. Under specifics of the first parliamentary elections on a multiple-party basis my constitutional duties as president of the republic require a firm and clear-cut formulation of a position with regard to the forthcoming election campaign. The four years that passed since the previous parliamentary elections were probably the most troubling and difficult times in our contemporary history. Despite political instability which evolved into an armed conflict on the Dniester, we nevertheless managed to move along the path toward creation of a Republic of Moldova in the world as an independent state, establish cooperation with a number of countries of the world, begin the realization of a strategy of economic reform which received the endorsement and support of international forums, and institute a reform of the political system of society within the overall concept of democratization. It is known that to a great extent political life in various countries of the world consists of the struggle for power. The electoral marathon is also a confrontation between parties and political formations, which in the final analysis culminates with the coming to power of those who manage to garner the votes with the most convincing program. The flourishing of highly developed countries is not and cannot be the fruit of work done by a single individual, perhaps even one who is highly intelligent. It is, first of all, based on competitiveness, and true and free competition of ideas and programs. It is specifically this that assures the stimulation and liberation of the thinking and creativity and labor of the free man. But competition as such cannot be considered in the world of today without a clearly defined selection of principles and laws establishing rigid rules of the game and ensuring control over its conduct in accordance with the situation. We find ourselves in that stage at the very start of the path. In essence that is our first step today on the way toward election of the new Parliament on a multiple-party basis. The manner in which we comprehend and evaluate the importance of state organs ensuring equal conditions for all candidates who take part in this competition will to a great degree determine not only the course of the election and activity of the new Parliament, but also the degree of faith in the government among voters with regard to its ability to comply with democratic principles on the whole. In the end that will shape the image of our country in the world as a law-governed democratic state. No matter how contradictory and sometimes even antagonistic the various election programs and ideas and strategies are to each other, some of which we already know and which are still to be announced to the parties, slates of candidates, and independent candidates, it is important not to forget that they are promulgated and propagandized by the sons and daughters of the people of this land, by our countrymen. It therefore follows that they must be studied tactfully and patiently and either adopted or rejected only by the citizens here, in our republic. It is in our interest to have this election campaign proceed in a worthy manner, wisely, in an atmosphere of tolerance. I particularly wish to stress the duty of responsible managers and state organs at all levels to prevent, interdict, and decisively deal with all attempts to win a parliamentary mandate through the fanning of hatred and enmity toward brothers, as well as toward representatives of other nationalities, regardless of which side these attempts are coming from. A special place during this period is allotted to the mass media. Its persuasive powers and role in the molding of public opinion are well known. Under certain conditions it could be decisive. Its contributions and dedication to the illumination of various turning points of critical significance in the past four years, for which it deserves respect and our gratitude, serve as convincing proof of that. I hope that during the election campaign which has already started the journalists will help voters separate the grain from the chaff, as Ion Drutse said. No great effort is required in order to distinguish the good from the bad. Everyone does that instinctively. It is far more complicated, particularly under our conditions, to propose clearly and precisely what should be done and together with whom for the common good. In that regard I would like to call on everyone, and primarily on figures in the cultural field and writers, to jointly think about the following question: how is it that in the past two years we allowed ourselves to be brazenly and hypocritically called "a republic of two sheep-folds and three districts," "a stillborn infant," "a spectral republic of Bolsheviks-separatists," "the CIS jungle," "Snegur's whim," and so on? I know that this is not just my own pain, and that its elimination is found in the clear and decisive position of those who stand for the statehood of the republic, a position which must be proclaimed in a loud voice and not in a whisper. We have forever been not only at the cross-roads of European geographical roads, but also in a space where the interests of large continental powers met and clashed, because of which we have constantly suffered. The empires established their regimes here, one more drastic than the other. Their cruelty and greed left a deep imprint on the soul, memory, and consciousness of generations. The sacrifices of our ancestors placed on the altar of our still fragile freedom are too great and abundant in order not to learn the lesson of history on this occasion as well. Are we going to allow the wheel of history to crush us just because some want to accelerate the speed at which it turns, while others wish to stop it? Perhaps it is time to roll up the sleeves and start laying the foundation of an edifice of integrity and prosperity, stone by stone, in a conscientious and diligent manner, leaving to the mercy of God those who have no other desire than to affix their name to it. I am counting on the consciousness and sense of high civic responsibility among representatives of the mass media, hoping that their thoughts on the electoral marathon will include these aspects as well. In connection with what was said above I would like to state the following: First. The constitution of our country obligates the president of the republic to involve himself in the election campaign in the most direct manner when it takes place on the multiple-party basis. I swore on the Bible to be the guarantor of rights and freedoms of all citizens, which is specifically stated in Article 113 of the constitution of the Republic of Moldova. That is why I firmly intend to promote the conduct of elections under the most optimal conditions, calling on the voters to give their votes to those who firmly endorse statehood and independence of the Republic of Moldova. Second. I have supported, support now, and will continue to support parties and socio-political formations which have conducted, are now conducting, and will continue to conduct a policy directed at the establishment of our state--the Republic of Moldova--as a sovereign and independent state, without any conditions or varying interpretations. Such a position clearly corresponds with my presidential election platform, toward which the electorate has clearly expressed its attitude. I am for those who have supported, now support, and will continue supporting the integrity of the republic through concrete action. I call on the electorate to follow my example in voting for those who offer and will prove able to implement into life clear-cut programs and concepts that would permit us to eliminate the economic crisis, while guaranteeing stable progress in creative and interested work of free people. In the new Parliament I want to see deputies who can rise above the vestiges and political configurations, who would be guided in their work by higher values and interests of the people, would come up with realistic and concrete proposals so that people who have lived for centuries in peace and harmony on both banks of the Dniester, could finally make peace with each other. Third. If in the first election campaign on a multiple-party basis we succeed in ensuring clear-cut observance of democratic principles of equality and freedom for all parties, slates of candidates, socio-political movements, and independent candidates, we will thereby promote an irreversible process of democratization of society, and that will allow us to prove to ourselves and to the entire world that we have mastered one of the most necessary attributes of a law-governed and democratic state. Four. In this period the task of organs of state executive power at all levels consists of guaranteeing to an equal degree to all parties, socio-political formations, slates of candidates, and independent candidates the necessary conditions for conduct of the electoral campaign in strict conformance with the law on election of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova. These tasks are explained in detail in the edict of the president of the republic. Five. I am expressing confidence in the fact that residents on the left bank of the Dniester have finally recognized who it was that wanted, how, and for what purpose to split us up and what must be done by everyone in order to prevent each vote in the election of the Parliament from being blocked by those who do not wish for us to live in peace and harmony as we have done for centuries. My esteemed audience! I would like for us to understand and remember another simple truth: before saying who we are, what it is that we want, and where we are headed, we must first of all exist. All the other disasters in our life cannot even be compared with the real threat hanging over us today when just a few hundred kilometers from us in the direction of the Adriatic Sea the merciless fires of war are raging which the whole world is powerless to extinguish. That is a tragedy which we too had experienced recently. It is our sacred duty not to forget that. In conclusion I would like to appeal directly to those beyond the walls of this building: esteemed lady, esteemed gentleman, all those who are listening to me right now or are reading my speech in the newspaper, stop for a moment, rise above the mundane and understand that to participate in the elections on 27 February and to vote for those who prove that they truly can transform Moldova into an independent and sovereign state not just for a day or two, first of all means assurance of the right to life both for yourself and for your children, brothers, sisters, and parents and the right to engage in creative labor for the good of the people and our country--the Republic of Moldova. Thank you.
