But how much more mature were his position and his judgement than those of the commanders and leaders who testified as witnesses at the proceedings! "For what purpose did you go to the 'White House' on 26 September 1993?", the military judge, justice Major S. Nechayev, asked the young officer. "I was defending the constitution and carrying out the order of the lawful authorities there," was the answer. There are not many officers and generals in the Russian Armed Forces today who have the right and honor to say such words, which are so simple and natural for a defender of the Homeland. Today, some even express condemnation addressed at those who did not betray their oath. "I warned Menshikov that to go there was an expression of lack of discipline," the temporary acting commander of the sub-unit, Lieutenant-Colonel Medvedev, complained to the court. The unit's assistant personnel commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Gerasimov, was no less "principled" in his court appraisal of Igor Menshikov's actions. "What kind of evaluation can there be," mused the trainer of the military servicemen, "if Menshikov had to be on duty during one of the days when he was at the House of Soviets? Another officer had to take his place. Yet this officer had some personal plans, family responsibilities..." Who is this Igor Menshikov, and what has he done? We spoke with him at length during the recess between court sessions and, honestly speaking, I was filled with pride at the fact that there are such young officers in the army, who could set an example of civic courage and high moral character for many of their senior comrades. By birth, Igor is from the Kazakh city of Aksay. His father is a senior lieutenant in the militia. His mother is a building engineer. In the summer of 1991, Menshikov graduated from the Leningrad Higher Military Engineering School of Communications and was assigned to the position of communications center engineer with the General Staff. Such an appointment without patronage means only one thing: Igor had distinguished himself as a model student. And the young officer had managed to show his best side also in his new assignment. In two years, there were four recommendations for exemplary fulfillment of his service responsibilities entered in his service record. Despite Igor's youth, he had a large and strong family, by today's standards: His wife Olga, a real friend in combat, and his two daughters, whom their father doted upon. Perhaps his love for them and his concern for their future largely facilitated the fact that, in spite of the hypocritical appeals by Grachev to the officers to stay out of politics, Senior Lieutenant Menshikov could not be satisfied with the "kitchen" struggle against the destruction of the state and the pilferage of the country. "For a long time, I sought my place in the ranks of the defenders of the Homeland," said Igor in his conversation with me. "I read about the Union of Officers in SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA and DEN. I went to the headquarters of this organization, familiarized myself with its program documents, and understood: This is for me, both in spirit and from a professional point of view." "In September of 1993 you went to the House of Soviets as a member of this organization?" "Yes. But not only that. Even if I had not been a member of it, I would have done the same thing. After all, only someone who really did not want to know could fail to realize that the fate of the constitution, the fate of Soviet statehood, and the future of the simple people were being decided there." The unit in which Igor served was stationed in Podmoskovye. From an informational point of view it, as perhaps all the military sub-units, were blocked. Therefore, at first it was difficult to understand what was really going on in Moscow. On 26 September, after being relieved from his watch, Igor left for the White House. He thought it would be for a day or two, but as it turned out, everything was immeasurably more complicated. Together with the members of the Union of Officers, he kept watch inside the House of Soviets and outside. ...The officer was detained by a group of OMON [special purpose militia detachment] militiamen and, without presentation of any accusations, taken to the 11th Militia Section. Then there were lengthy investigations. Finally, they came for Menshikov from his unit and took him back there. The leadership reported "to the top" about what happened and filed formal proceedings "for unwarranted absence from the garrison." Everything would have ended there, had it not been for the post-October purge in the Armed Forces. Menshikov, like the other officers who remained true to their oath, was dismissed from the Armed Forces by the Arbat generals. The formulation of the order, signed by the chief of the General Headquarters, sounds cynically frank: "Dismissed... for incompatibility of moral-psychological qualities." Yeltsin's "striped uniforms" went and decided for the people that they do not need defenders of the Homeland who are faithful to their oath. It is true that at the judicial proceedings on Igor Menshikov's claim against the Ministry of Defense for unlawful dismissal, the representatives of the defendant are trying to turn everything upside down. They are trying to present the young officer as a violator of discipline, and those who hid behind women's skirts in September-October of last year--as defenders of the Homeland who are true to their oath. Without mentioning the moral aspect of the question, which is ultimately clear, the juridical aspect is also synonymous. The oath obligates the military serviceman to defend the constitution and the constitutional organs of power. Article 121-6 of the Constitution in the edition adopted on 12 December 1992 reads: "The powers and authorities of the President of the Russian Federation may not be used for changing the national-state arrangement of the Russian Federation, for disbanding or stopping the activity of any lawfully elected organs of state power of the Russian Federation, otherwise they are terminated immediately." Senior Lieutenant Menshikov was able to understand all this back in September of last year. The representatives of the defendant pretend that they still do not understand this to the present day. The judicial process is not yet concluded. We hope that the court does not slip from the letter of the law onto the curve of anti-popular policy.
