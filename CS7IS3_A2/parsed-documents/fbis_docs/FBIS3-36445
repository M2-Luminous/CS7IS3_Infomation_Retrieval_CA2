In his opinion, "people are unlikely to be persuaded to support even Boris Yeltsin," it should have done two years ago. As Poltoranin remarked in an interview with Interfax on Friday, "the last coach of this train has already gone." Nonetheless, he urged setting up a formidable democratic party, which, as he believes, could comprise not only "Russia's Choice" but also Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's bloc, the Unity and Concord Party, and the "Democratic Russia" movement. "We need to nominate for the next presidential elections a single candidate capable of rallying the people around him," Poltoranin stressed. However, he declined to name such a nominee and only said that "a few candidates are being considered." He also voiced fear that during the debate over the president's amnesty decree the leftists would secure the legal release from Lefortovo prison of ex-Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy and nominate him for the Russian presidency in 1996. He recalled in this connection that the democrats did not have a stable majority in the Duma and for this reason participants in the October events in Moscow had a chance of getting on the list of persons subject to pardon. Poltoranin thinks it's possible for Rutskoy to collect enough votes at elections as "Russia loves martyrs."
