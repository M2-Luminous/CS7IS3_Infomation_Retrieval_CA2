President of the Tibetan trust and investment corporation Chen Irui said that satellite communications will link the Tibetan trading house and the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The computer system in the Lhasa stock exchange is already for operation. Entrusted by the autonomous regional government, Chen's company is responsible for the establishment of Tibet's first stock exchange. Like many other undertakings, the establishment of Tibet's stock market also gained support of other regions of the country. The company is now the 381st member of the Shanghai stock exchange, which has donated a full set of equipment to the Tibetan exchange and helped in its installation, Chen said. The Tibetan exchange will also be the first in China to have two- way communication links with the Shenzhen stock exchange, Chen said. He added that the four-star Tibetan hotel in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, has applied to be listed. If the application is granted, it will be the first shareholding company in Tibet. Chen stressed that what matters is not that stocks are available to Tibetans, but that Tibet is keeping pace with other Chinese regions in establishing a modern banking and investment system, and a modern enterprise system. As more Tibetan companies are considering adopting shareholding systems, stock trading faces a bright future in Tibet, the Chen said.
