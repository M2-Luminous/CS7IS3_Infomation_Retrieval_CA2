The new Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system hooks 33,000 of Korea's overseas trading firms to 33 banks for electronic issuance of export-import approval, opening of letters of credit and other trade-related banking transactions. Kim Myong-ho, governor of the Bank of Korea, demonstrated the system in yesterday's opening ceremony at the main branch of Hanil Bank in Myongdong in downtown Seoul. The system presents standardized forms on the screen for users to fill out. The governor processed one firm's request for export approval in less than five minutes as a demonstration of the system's efficiency. Data indicate that banks processed some 1.3 million similar requests last year alone. The difference was that those transactions took place at the expense of actual visits to banks through traffic and waits upon arrival. Officials at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy say that plans are now underway to expand the system to include shipping and customs by July and October of this year, respectively. By 1996, they are envisioning a comprehensive electronic network covering the A to Z of overseas trading. The current system is limited to 33 Korean banks handling foreign exchanges. But officials say foreign banks operating in Korea are likely to be added to the system by July.
