Without going into detail, Han said the Seoul government has prepared measures "for every possible situation." China, the uncertain variable if the council does opt for sanctions, could play an important role regardless of whether it joins in the sanctions, he said. Han, who is accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on a state visit to Russia June 1, said he hopes Seoul and Moscow will reaffirm their cooperation in resolving the North Korean nuclear row. Kim leaves for Russia in the midst of a tense situation, with North Korea refusing core inspection activities at a disputed 5- megawatt reactor that could reveal its past nuclear development. Han had said that Pyongyang would be crossing the line if it destroyed the opportunity for the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] to segregate and sample fuel rods from the reactor for later measurement. "If the fuel rod discharging work continues at the current pace, North Korea will, in a short while, cross that line," he said in a press conference at the Foreign Ministry. But Seoul has not been informed that Pyongyang actually crossed the line, said Han. Asked about the possibility of the Security Council opting for sanctions, he said the "chances are high that sanctions will actually be put into effect." "But it's not the time to discuss military sanctions," Han said, despite President Kim's earlier remarks in talks with the opposition leader that economic and military sanctions may be sought simultaneously. "We are not ruling out any possibility," he said when asked if Seoul is willing to seek sanctions outside the Security Council in case China refuses to go along. Predicting China's role will grow as the Security Council discusses whether to impose sanctions, he suggested other ways for Beijing to exert influence. "China would be able to assume various important roles, regardless of whether it does or does not participate actively in the sanctions," he said.
