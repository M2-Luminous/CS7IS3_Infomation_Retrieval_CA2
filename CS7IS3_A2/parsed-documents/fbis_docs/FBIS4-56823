Martinez Cuenca] [5 Apr p 7] [Text] As the month of March drew to a close, we once again saw the public agenda marked by debate on the economy. Nevertheless, the most striking thing that happened all month long was a sinister and unnoticed circular that the recently appointed board of directors of the National Development Bank (BANADES) sent to all producers enjoying access to that institution's services. The circular in question stated that effective 31 March, two options were being presented for all credits heretofore contracted for: either seek the protection of clause on the maintenance of value at an annual rate of 14 percent or, if the producer did not respond in writing before the fateful date in question, continuation of his credit without any maintenance of value, but at a new rate of interest that would no longer be 17 percent annually, but rather, 29 percent and subject to quarterly review! After doing a lot of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, those who received the circular were surprised to see that no matter which of the two options offered by BANADES they chose, their individual situation would tend to get worse. They naively wondered whether the bank had not perhaps made a mistake because they were asking for help, not for their situation to get worse! If, with a rate of 17 percent they were already on the brink of the abyss, either one of the two options now being presented to them was actually only asking whether they preferred to plunge to a valley a thousand meters below them or land in a rocky river 2,000 meters down! In either case, they would fall and be killed, no matter what! Borrow 100 and Give Back 200 If the bank loaned a specific producer let us say 100,000 cordobas in 1992 to make some improvements in his plan of production, a loan to be paid off in five years with a one-year deferment, the fateful notice informed him that, effective 31 March, instead of repaying 167,997 cordobas for the 100,000 that the bank had loaned him in 1992, he now had the option of paying 192,000 if he did not apply for the clause on the maintenance of value, or 196,000 if he did, in which case the reward would be that his interest would be lowered from 29 to 14 percent. The lack of logic in the "logic" had peaked. The producer had merely to pick the type of terrain on which his dead body would finally rest! In the meantime, the government insisted there was no other alternative because otherwise, it would have to grant subsidies or report losses causing it to fail to meet its commitments. Both government and private bankers backed the state's logic, arguing that it had to build up its capital and could not absorb losses incurred by keeping that body now on the brink of the abyss alive. After all, for the "efficient" government technocracy and a few of those bankers, fate had decreed that death would indeed occur and they thought this was just fine. After all, they do not think the "productive" sector knows how to work, is inefficient, and lives off the trough, having started to do so long before 25 February! It has always done so, failing to pay back debts or its taxes and diverting securities. Confidence? The logic that arises out of an understanding of the phenomenon of Nicaragua is that there are several reasons why the productive sector is broke. The undeniable fact is that it is broke and will require a great deal of effort and support if it is to become a driving force of the Nicaraguan economy. In addition, an atmosphere of confidence must be created in the country in order to make it possible for the measures which the government is taking to yield fruit within an as-yet undetermined length of time. And yet, what the circular did was to attack both premises, officially confirming that not even the government or its institutions have confidence in themselves. If the producer in our example, which might be one of those affected by the new provision, is involved more in domestic production rather than in activities strictly aimed at exports, his calculations are in cordobas rather than dollars. He takes in and spends cordobas. Under the new BANADES policy, this same producer is being asked--if he does not opt for maintenance of value--to pay, rather than 67,997 cordobas in interest in six years (which is already killing him!), the sum of 92,000 cordobas in six years, while also amortizing the 100,000 loaned to him. If this producer should opt for the 14-percent rate, his interest payment will go from 67,997 to 69,354 cordobas. However, the principal he has to amortize would go from 100,000 to 127,064, meaning that he would end up paying a total of 196,419 cordobas. In both cases, the bank and the government deplete the producer's capital! [6 Apr p 9] [Text] In drawing up the table below, we based our figures on the assumption that during the 1994-1998 period, the policy of devaluation would continue as it has worked so far, with a slip of 12 percent in the rate of exchange annually. This would mean that, on 31 March of every year, the rate would be 7.28 per dollar in 1995, 8.15 in 1996, 9.13 in 1997, and 10.23 in 1998. If the government had confidence in the soundness of its policies and we turned the payments into dollars based on the previously mentioned rates, the bank could even lower the 17-percent interest rate without any maintenance of value and still recover the entire loan of 100,000 cordobas granted (equivalent to $20,000). This would be logical if what one wanted to do were to recapitalize the productive sector. For this precise purpose, the government takes in enormous amounts of foreign aid in gifts and on extremely soft terms. As a result of the BANADES board of director's circular, a producer loaned the equivalent of $20,000 in 1992 is now being asked to pay, instead of the $22,037 that he would have to pay if the interest rate stayed at 17 percent and without any maintenance of value, the sum of $25,000 without applying for any maintenance value and nearly $25,200 with it. In other words, there was no need to change the terms of the credits since, as demonstrated here, neither the government nor the bank lost anything based on the situation existing before the circular. By its own action, BANADES has made it clear that: either they are not confident that the rate of exchange will behave in this manner--in which case it would be introducing a factor of great instability that attacks its own logic, by encouraging the people to doubt the magnitude of future devaluations--or the government and its institutions have truly not understood the meaning of the need to capitalize the sector called upon to be the driving force of the Nicaraguan economy. If the priority is to save the productive sector, no one is asking who will pay for the medicine. After all, if we seek such a reply, we might come to the tragic conclusion that if this government cannot, then the best thing for it would be for the patient to die and get it over with! Which is unacceptable and demonstrates an absolute lack of logic. If our producers have no capital left, the government must make a commitment to contribute to their capitalization. This cannot be done based on short-term planning or within the framework of an account-based, strictly commercial vision in which everything must come together simultaneously and without giving time a chance to do its work. It may be that today, applying medicine implies having to leave an account receivable for a later date in exchange for curing the patient. This would be the most logical thing of all and yet they are asking precisely the opposite. What the notorious BANADES circular does is merely give them a choice of what type of bed their falling body will finally come to rest in, rather than the prospect of life and progress! Finally, Some Advice Before choosing your final resting place, dear producer, I would advise you to consider the following: 1--The credits that you have received do not necessarily have the same makeup and structure. Consequently, analyze every credit individually before choosing a single option from those offered to you by the bank. You will find that no single rule is the best for all cases, except the rule telling you to get out of all the credits you can as soon as possible. 2--If your credit has at least five more years to run and amortization is set up to be accelerated in the final years, it will then be to your advantage to choose the option of not maintaining value even if you have to pay 29 percent in interest annually. However, if your amortization schedule is uniformly prorated, it may be more advantageous to choose the option of maintaining the value at 13 percent as your final resting place. In either case, neither of the options is a good one, but one can at least choose the lesser evil!
