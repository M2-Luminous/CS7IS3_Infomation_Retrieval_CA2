Interviewed by the newspaper TISHRIN today, Naji said that by this vile, hideous crime, the Zionists have proved their racist, Nazi, and fascist mentality. He demanded the world to uphold justice, human rights, and the right to self-determination. He expressed surprise that the United States was satisfied with the issuance of condemnation statements despite the ugliness of the massacre at a time when it would raise a hue and cry if the dead were Jews. He called on the international community to press for an immediate Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories and to impose sanctions on Israel for not complying with the international legitimacy resolutions and charters. Dr. Naji criticized Yasir 'Arafat for making concessions to Israel and said that 'Arafat's policy encourages the Zionist enemy and gives it the green light. [passage omitted]
