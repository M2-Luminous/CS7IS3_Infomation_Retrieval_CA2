The Russian side didn't accept the proof, claiming it was impossible to cross the border illegally from their side, since they are guarding the border 24 hours a day. Three students from Afghanistan, currently studying in Moscow, on Wednesday [27 April] applied for an Estonian visa at the country's embassy in the Russian capital. The students said their parents were among the group of Kurds who came to Estonia illegally. Estonia refused to issue visas to the Afghan students, saying it still insists that Russia would take back the Kurds who crossed the border illegally.
