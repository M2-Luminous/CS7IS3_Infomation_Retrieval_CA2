FR940304-2-00170 FR940304-2-00088 EEIC proposes to invest a total of $275,000 to be paid as consideration for the acquisition of 9.9% of the common stock of Quality Power Systems, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation engaged in the manufacture, marketing and sale of uninterruptible power systems, utility interface front-end power supplies and other electric and electronic devices and equipment. EEIC further requests authorization to acquire without additional consideration such additional shares of the common stock of QPS as EEIC from time to time may be entitled to receive to maintain a 9.9% ownership interest in QPS. EEIC also proposes to provide consulting services directly to QPS. In accordance with a stock purchase agreement (``Stock Purchase Agreement'') entered into on January 24, 1994, EEIC's investment would be used by QPS for the development and marketing of low harmonic distortion Uninterruptible Power Systems (``UPS'') manufactured by QPS under a license to QPS by Digital Equipment Corporation (``DEC'') pursuant to a license agreement between QPS and DEC. The Stock Purchase Agreement also imposes several affirmative obligations upon QPS to provide EEIC with certain financial and other reports, and it includes several negative covenants restricting the ownership and control of QPS. The primary purpose of the UPS is to improve the quality of power supplied by an electric utility provider to its customers by reducing harmonic distortion at the interconnection between the utility and its customers. QPS achieves such quality enhancement using DEC's HA6000 product, a system developed by DEC to satisfy new requirements being imposed on power line conditioning equipment and uninterruptible power supplies by International Safety and Electrical Manufacturing Compliance Standards. It is stated that use of the HA6000 technology will permit electric utilities in the New England region to reduce harmonic distortion in an extremely cost efficient manner by directing corrective attention specifically to customers whose equipment contributes to harmonic distortion at utility interconnections and by providing such customers with the lowest available rates on low maintenance modular units customized to such customers' respective needs. Customers who have no power quality complaints will not be required to contribute to such corrective efforts, yet will benefit from improved power servicing due to anticipated reductions in electric utilities' capacity requirements costs upon implementation of the HA6000 systems. It is also stated that EEIC and QPS believe that the increasing use of automation for demand side and load management of energy needs and the proliferation of computers and other sensitive electronic equipment used by customers of electric utilities will necessitate enhanced reduction of harmonic feedback into the distribution systems of electric utilities. Upon Commission approval of the proposed transactions, EEIC will enter into a stockholders agreement with QPS providing for EEIC's designation of one out of six director positions on the board of directors of QPS, with any vacancy in such position to be filled only by a subsequent designee of EEIC. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
