These forces also continued to shell, in a savage manner, residential quarters on the approaches to the capital, Aden. Our valiant Armed Forces confronted, and are still confronting with rare heroism and great steadfastness, all attempts by the forces of the ruling military regime to continue their defiance of the will of Arab and international society. Battles are still continuing between our defending forces and the forces of the (?corrupt) dictatorial regime in Sanaa and its arrogant adventurist head, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.
