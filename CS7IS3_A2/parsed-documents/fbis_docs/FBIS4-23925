"The pre-election bombing blitz on the Reef proved that there were people who know how to plant bombs. No force in the world will be able to stop rightwing terrorism if the government does not accede to our demands", he told SAPA in Pretoria. He was speaking after a protest march in the city centre by about 120 rightwingers demanding the cut-off date for political crimes be set at April 27, 1994. In a memorandum handed to an official of the Justice Department, the rightwingers also said Justice Minister Dullah Omar was biased against the rightwing in his definition of political prisoners. "Mr Nelson Mandela's conciliatory statements must be translated into conciliatory actions," the memorandum stated. The march was held under the banner of the political rights organisation, established last year to campaign for the release of "conservative political prisoners". Well-known rightiwngers such as Mr Barend Strydom, Mrs Gaye Derby-Lewis and Mr Piet Rudolph took part in the protest. Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg could not attend because of "over-commitments", local Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] leader Jan du Toit said. The group, led by an AWB band, marched from the Pretoria city hall to the corner of Paul Kruger and Pretorius Streets, where the memorandum was handed to justice official Dr Flip Jacobs. Mr Terre'blanche told a small crowd the government had to release rightwing leaders if it was really interested in peace. "Today we came in peace to put our request. The next time we may not be so peaceful as our leaders in prison cells will start calling for revenge," he warned. Referring to the small number of rightwingers who turned up, Mr du Toit said numbers were not important. "We don't force or pay our people to take part in protest marches."
