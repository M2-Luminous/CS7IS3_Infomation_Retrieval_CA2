It is learned that at present, Beijing has 158 wholly foreign-funded, joint-venture, or cooperative enterprises and organizations abroad. These overseas enterprises and organizations are distributed over 45 countries and regions. Among them, 32 are in developed countries and 126 in developing countries. Their investments cover many fields, such as industrial and agricultural production, exploitation of natural resources, general trade, banking and real estate, tourist service, medical care, project contracting, and landscaping and architecture. In Malaysia, an overseas enterprise mainly formed by the Beijing Municipal Building Works Group and the International Economic Cooperation Company has developed into quite a strong project contractor there. Its business ranges from undertaking residential district projects to building four-star hotels and from constructing exclusive apartment blocks to building factory facilities. Its annual business volume approximates $100 million. In Japan, the Jinglian Company reaped 27 billion yen of turnover in 1993 and made a profit of 120 million yen, ranking among 30,000 enterprises with good credit standing in Japan. As a leader in exploring international real estate business, the Beijing Municipal Real Estate Development and Management Corporation has set up many companies in the United States, Australia, Hong Kong, and Macao since it was founded in 1992. Despite the adversities brought on by the continuing recession in the Western economy and the real estate industry on a downward path, they have managed to get a preliminary foothold and shown relatively good economic performance. The development and expansion of these overseas enterprises have added a new dimension to the municipality's effort to broaden the international market and strengthen itself with overseas resources.
