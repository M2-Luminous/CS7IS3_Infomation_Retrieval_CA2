He said the agreement was reached earlier between UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi and Serb authorities meeting in nearby Pale, stronghold of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Under it, the multinational force -- more than half of whose members are French -- will be allowed to move around freely in Gorazde and helicopters will be able to fly to, in, and around the enclave, the spokesman said. Deployment of the force was one of the conditions Akashi set earlier for resuming peace negotiations in Pale. The force, composed of 170 Frenchmen, 66 Ukrainians, 50 Egyptians and 50 British, has been on alert at Sarajevo airport since Friday, ready to leave within two hours' notice of the signing of an agreement. The Ukrainian troops are to take up position on the hills overlooking Gorazde, to the southeast. Halloway said the French would leave first for Gorazde, travelling by road, and would be escorted by Bosnian Serb forces.
