Taranu, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Republic of Moldova in the Russian Federation, by V. Perushkin; place and date not given: "`We Insist on the Withdrawal of the 14th Army'"] [Text] Of all the wars that erupted on the territory of the former Union, the war in Moldova was the shortest. Military operations in this region were suppressed with the participation of the Russian 14th Army. There is at the present time a fragile armistice on both banks of the Dniester. Our correspondent V. Perushkin asked A. Taranu, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Republic of Moldova in the Russian Federation, how political events would develop in Moldova in the immediate future. [Perushkin] Anatol Mihailovic, do you not have the impression that all conflicts on the territory of the former Union have occurred and continue to occur not spontaneously but are a great bloody game being played according to a single script, the purpose of which is to unite everyone once again in a single union? [Taranu] The point is that the status of diplomat requires that I be guided exclusively by the facts. I do not, however, have facts confirming your conjectures. But I agree that many of the events that are occurring could speculatively be viewed this way. And I would like to mention here that if Russia is to build its relations with its immediate neighbors on the basis of commonly accepted, civilized standards, this presupposes respect for the sovereignty and independence of the states that have appeared since the disintegration of the Union. In this case, despite the long transformation process, the result will be the most desirable for all without exception. If, on the other hand, Russia attempts to spread its influence to its immediate neighbors by methods that were officially approved in Abkhazia or Moldova, the anti-Russian mood in the republics will intensify. [Perushkin] What effect, in your opinion, will the results of the elections in Russia have on the political situation in Moldova? [Taranu] Of course, both the October events and the results of the elections in Russia will, of course, be reflected in the political situation in the countries of the CIS, Moldova included. The surprising success of political forces which, generally, no one had taken seriously before could signify the consolidation of all conservative blocs in our republic also. Considering that parliamentary elections on a multiparty basis are to be held in Moldova on 27 February 1994, I would like to hope that our democrats would draw the correct conclusions and not repeat the mistakes made by Russia's democratic forces. In addition, the election struggle with us is being exacerbated by the intensifying economic crisis. And the unresolved Dniester and Gagauz issues are complicating the situation as well. [Perushkin] Certain Western newspapers are starting to say that economic assistance should not be channeled only to Russia. How, in your opinion, will Moldova attract the West's attention? [Taranu] The extent of the aid to be received by Moldova was specified prior to the elections in Russia. And even after the results have been tallied, no abrupt leap forward on this matter on the part of the West has been observed. We have obtained credit, which is more or less enabling us to support the introduction of a national currency. The Moldovan national currency as of the present is one of the most stable currencies of the "near abroad" in relation to the dollar. A decline in the dollar's rate against the lei has been recorded even. It seems to me that the West would be making a big political mistake were it not to render Russia the necessary support at this time in order to strengthen the democratic transformations there. There should be such assistance, but not at the expense of other republics, just as, equally, the latter should not obtain greater assistance at the expense of Russia either. Russia is today the main economic partner of the former Union republics. And the fullness and efficiency of economic relations with other regions will depend on how matters stand as regards the economic reform here. All of the former, us included, are interested in Russia standing on its own two feet economically as quickly as possible. [Perushkin] The introduction of a national currency has in many republics been more of a political than an economic step. Will Moldova not suffer the same fate as Ukraine? [Taranu] From Russia's viewpoint such a step could be considered political. From the standpoints of the other republics, however, it was a forced measure. And it was attended by the defense of the republics' economic interests. In introducing at home banknotes of the 1993 sample, Russia in practice kicked the rest out of the ruble zone. In Moldova the decision to introduce a national currency had been adopted back in 1991, but only now could it be implemented, in extremely inauspicious conditions, what is more. Any currency can function normally only under conditions of growing production. It is essential that in 1994 we halt the decline in production and then organize its gradual upturn. Otherwise couponization or karbovanization, which are one and the same thing, for that matter, await us. [Perushkin] Is there today a problem of the Russian-speaking population in the republic? [Taranu] Undoubtedly. But it is considerably less in terms of scale than in other republics. Instances of everyday nationalism are observed in Moldova, but even this is not that widespread. Our citizenship and language laws have undergone the corresponding inspection in international institutions and have been deemed to be perfectly acceptable. An attempt to play on the anti-Russian mood in Moldova is manifestly doomed to fail, therefore. [Perushkin] How, in your opinion, is the presence of the 14th Army in the Dniester region influencing the situation in the region? [Taranu] Our position here is quite categorical. We insist on its withdrawal from the republic before 1 July 1994. Many people are saying that were it not for the 14th Army, the war between Moldova and the Dniester region would still be going on. Maybe so. But the situation is aggravated by the fact that the 14th Army did not strictly maintain its neutrality throughout the conflict. Materially, politically, and militarily it supported the policy of the Dniester leaders. [Perushkin] A compromise between Moldova and the Dniester region has not, by all accounts, been found. Might not the war begin once again as soon as the 14th Army withdraws? [Taranu] I believe not, although the possibility of the resumption of the military conflict cannot be ruled out in principle. The events of the first half of 1992 were a stunning lesson for Chisinau politicians. Even the most unbridled among them realized that the problem of the Dniester region cannot be resolved with an assault rifle. [Perushkin] But what, then, will happen? Moldova's politicians have recognized that this matter cannot be resolved militarily, but the leaders of the Dniester region will not negotiate until the Dniester region acquires republic status. [Taranu] Compromise is needed. But solving these questions with the present leaders of the Dniester region is quite difficult. There has to be a change of policy signboards there. Whereas this has already happened in Chisinau, everything on the left bank remains at the 1991 level. We are prepared to solve the question with the corresponding status of the Dniester region within the framework of Moldova. This status would afford an opportunity to remedy the postwar syndrome, and people could in time recognize that they are all citizens of Moldova. But today's leaders of the Dniester region will never agree to this. And one of the main reasons is the fear of losing the benefits and power that they have today. [Perushkin] You maintain that there is in the Dniester region today a strict totalitarian regime not allowing of different viewpoints. Where are the guarantees that Moldova's policy will be different? [Taranu] You read our newspapers, what they write about President Snegur. The level of freedom of the press is very high. Even too high, what is more, I would prefer our journalists and politicians to express their views in more civilized fashion. Their opportunity to express their viewpoint is indisputable. There is none of this in the Dniester region. The only person who can permit himself to speak is General Lebed. But it is hard to argue with him: He is backed by tanks.
