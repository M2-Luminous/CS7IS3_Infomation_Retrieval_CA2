Nikitin: "How the Budget Was Replenished: Oblast Tax Inspectorate Collegium Summarizes 1993 Work"] [Text] Today, one can hear from everywhere: "The budget is bursting at the seams." There is no money to pay teachers and workers in higher schools and health services, culture, sports, the militia, and fire fighting. Indeed, where is it to be gotten, when there is a sharp slump in the economy, industrial enterprises are on the brink of closing down, and there is massive unemployment? Under these complicated conditions, the fate of the budget depends to a great degree on the successful organization of the work of tax organs and the completeness of the adoption by them of all of the measures stipulated in legislation for the receipt of payments. M.I. Chemodurov, chief of state tax inspection for Chelyabinsk Oblast and second rank state tax service adviser, noted that inflation processes had an influence on the growth of tax revenues in 1993. Simultaneously, the influence of factors grew that restrained an increase in budgetary incomes, in particular, the growing payment-financial crisis. According to estimated data, about R317 billion have accumulated in produced but unsold products. The drop in the volume of production, temporary stoppage, and sometimes the full closing of production determined the budgetary losses for another R260 billion. The lack of tough incentives that prompt enterprises to manage effectively and unpredictable changes in the formation of prices result in increasing growth rates in product cost with respect to sales volume and, as a consequence, profit level is lowered. This is about another R50 billion. Besides narrowing the tax formation base, the financial crisis is causing high growth in defaults. According to the status on 1 January 1994, overall it exceeded R70 billion in the oblast, which is almost 40 times more than a year earlier. The situation at the beginning of this year has gotten even worse. As a result of the growth in mutual indebtedness of enterprises (about R2 trillion), and the expansion of the practice of mutual offsets between them, the nonpayments to the budget increased sharply, and on 1 February 1994, R95 billion of taxes on profits, value added, and resource payments were in arrears. This exceeds the January sum of revenues for calculated taxes by almost nine percent, and the gap in Magnitogorsk amounts to a factor of 3.2.... Nevertheless, last year the oblast tax organs transferred R1.23 trillion to the budget and off-budget funds, which is 7.6 times more than a year ago, and R751 billion were collected for the needs of the oblast. The indicator in comparison with other oblasts of Russia is rather high. One documentary check conducted by the inspectorate on the average gives more than R5.5 billion of additional income. The most effective were the checks in Zlatoust where at one time R23.3 million more was added, and in Kopeysk and Trekhgornyy (former Zlatoust-36), about R13.5 million. Rural tax inspectors in a check declared more than R6 million additional in Agapovskiy and Argayashskiy Rayons. One of the reserves for the replenishment of the budget is the tax on persons who are engaged in entrepreneurial activity without the formation of a legal entity. Last year, their number grew by factor of 2.2, and it was in excess of 29,000 persons. It will not be an exaggeration to say that entrepreneurs are not the most law abiding payers. For violation of tax legislation, 3,600 persons were made answerable, and the sum of fines amounted to R43 million. An analysis of the results of raids conducted at mini-markets and places of unmanaged trade shows that only three to four persons out of 10 register as entrepreneurs. All of this requires a definite reorientation in the work of the service. The first experience of the oblast inspection indicates that the creation of a specialized group of workers who follow the activity of entrepreneurs could give a high return. In the second half of last year, the activity of 40 young businessmen was checked by a sector numbering only four persons, as a result of which R11.7 million more was added to the budget. Counter checks of another 22 enterprises added another R16 million to the budget. All told in the oblast, according to the results of joint actions with the Administration of Internal Affairs and the Procuracy, 250 enterprises were checked, which brought more than a half billion rubles of income. Every ninth ruble of revenues, or about R124 billion, was the share of the tax from physical persons. Under conditions when each citizen can work in several places, enterprises and organizations frequently forget to submit information on incomes paid to physical persons who are not permanent employees. Only in 3,000 of the 7,800 who were checked was the person within the field of vision of the tax inspectors. The mass of our citizens has not gotten into the habit of declaring incomes. Monitoring the implementation of the Law on Monitoring Control Cash Registers (KKM) in Conducting Monetary Calculations With the Population brought in more than a billion rubles in additional payments in several months of last year. According to the law, since 1 March 1994, KKM were supposed to be in all trade points of the oblast center, and, starting on 1 January 1995, in the entire oblast. Meanwhile, the naked eye can see that the stalls and kiosks and even the large stores in Chelyabinsk conduct monetary operations with the people in cash, while not using the cash registers. However, how is it possible to complain about the ordinary taxpayer, if the workers of inspectorates themselves do not succeed in understanding the numerous changes, refined points of the edicts of the president, instructions, and other documents of the government? The collegium appealed once again to the managers of the central organs with a proposal to simplify the system of taxation, to make it stable, easy to understand, and efficient, and one that promotes the development of production.
