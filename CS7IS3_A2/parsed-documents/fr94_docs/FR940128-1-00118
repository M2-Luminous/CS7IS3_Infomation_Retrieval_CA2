FR940128-1-00118 FR940128-1-00006 The agency points out that these processing parameters for vacuum-packaged hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish are minimums. Unless the comments on Example 6 of this appendix convince the agency otherwise, fish that have been processed at a lower temperature or with a lower water-phase salt level could provide the basis for regulatory action on the grounds that the product has been processed under conditions whereby it may have been reduced injurious to health and thus could represent a hazard for consumers. 2. Cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish. Cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish, by virtue of the temperatures used in processing, are not cooked because they are processed at temperatures lower than those that coagulate protein, i.e., 100 ○F (38 ○C) or lower. Because these temperatures are not high enough to inactivate C. botulinum spores, and because they provide a favorable environment for other food spoilage microorganisms, other inhibitive factors, such as higher salt content and sodium nitrite (where permitted by food additive regulations in §172.175) need to be used. The time and temperature relationship in the processing of cold-smoked and smoke-flavored fish is a critical factor in yielding a microbiologically safe and high quality finished product (Ref. 182). Modern establishments that cold-smoked fish generally process between 40 ○F (5 ○C) and 100 ○F (38 ○C) for 18 to 24 hours (Refs. 171 and 182). Based on the research data that are available and the requirements in the New York CGMP, the agency is proposing the following requirements for air-packaged and vacuum-packaged/modified atmosphere cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish (Refs. 25, 180, and 184). a. Air-packaged products. The agency is providing in section 5.a.3. of Example 6 of this appendix that air-packed, cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish should have a minimum water-phase salt content of: (1) 3.5 percent, or (2) 3.0 percent and contain 100 to 200 ppm of sodium nitrite in the finished product, or (3) 2.5 percent in the finished product if the product is frozen immediately after processing and cooling and is kept frozen throughout holding and distribution. The agency is providing that the finished product that contains a water-phase salt content of 2.5 percent should be frozen immediately and kept frozen to ensure the microbiological safety of the product, as well as to maintain the shelf-life of the finished product. As stated above, because these products are not cooked and contain a low water-phase salt content, these products may present a potential public health hazard because they provide an ideal environment for the outgrowth of C. botulinum spores and toxin production. Therefore, based on the discussion above, the agency is suggesting that air-packaged cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish be processed under one of the following sets of conditions: (1) A maximum 20-hour drying and smoking period with the temperature in the smoking chamber not exceeding 90 ○F (32 ○C) (section 5.a.3.i. of Example 6 of this appendix), or (2) a maximum 24-hour drying and smoking period with the temperature in the smoking chamber not exceeding 50 ○F (10 ○C) (section 5.a.3.ii. of Example 6 of this appendix) except that sablefish needs to be heated to a temperature not to exceed 120 ○F (49 ○C) for a period not to exceed 6 hours (section 5.a.3.iii. of example 6 of this appendix) (Refs. 25, 180, and 184). b. Vacuum-/modified atmosphere-packaged products. FDA is providing in section 5.a.4. of Example 6 of this appendix that cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish to be vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaged should have a minimum water-phase salt content of: (1) 3.0 percent and contain 100 to 200 ppm of sodium nitrite in the finished product, or (2) 3.5 percent in the finished product when no sodium nitrite is used. The agency is also providing that vacuum-/modified atmosphere-packaged cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish should be processed under one of the following sets of conditions: (1) A maximum 20-hour drying and smoking period with the temperature in the smoking chamber not exceeding 90 ○F (32 ○C) (section 5.a.3.i. of Example 6 of this appendix), or (2) a maximum 24-hour drying and smoking period with the temperature in the smoking chamber not exceeding 50 ○F (10 ○C) (section 5.a.3.ii. of Example 6 of this appendix) (Refs. 25, 180, and 184). The agency again points out that these processing parameters for vacuum-/modified atmosphere-packaged cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish are minimums. Failure to adhere to these parameters could provide the basis for regulatory action because the product that results may be injurious to health and thus could represent a hazard to consumers.
