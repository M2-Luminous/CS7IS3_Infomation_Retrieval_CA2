Document Type:FBIS TRENDSEE-08FEB94-YUGOSLAVIA Yugoslavia: Belgrade TV Shuns Zhirinovskiy During Stay Although Western media reported that Russian Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was warmly received by large numbers of Serbs at gatherings in eastern Bosnia and Montenegro, the Belgrade media gave short shrift to his 27 January-4 February visit to former Yugoslavia. Tanjug and Belgrade radio devoted a moderate amount of coverage to the visit, but Belgrade television, which appears to be strictly controlled by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, broadcast only scant reports of Zhirinovskiy's activities. After showing only brief glimpses of the Russian during the first days of his visit, when he visited Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Pavle for a closed-door meeting on the last day, Belgrade television news merely mentioned the fact of the meeting over a still photograph of the Belgrade cathedral (Belgrade TV, 2 February). On the eve of Zhirinovskiy's visit to Belgrade, the independent Belgrade daily Vecernje Novosti, which strongly supports Serbian nationalism and Milosevic, published an interview that appeared to be intended to poke fun at the Russian even if his statements were quoted accurately. In the interview, Zhirinovskiy rambled and made statements that made him appear ignorant about Yugoslav politics. For example, he professed not to know that Yugoslavia had a Federal president, Zoran Lilic, who is, in strictly constitutional terms, superior in the political hierarchy to Milosevic (Vecernje Novosti, 28 January). Milosevic had reason to be wary of Zhirinovskiy's visit. The Serbian president most probably did not want to antagonize Russian President Boris Yeltsin or Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who are both actively engaged in seeking a solution to the crisis in former Yugoslavia. Moreover, Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj, now a bitter opponent of Milosevic, served as Zhirinovskiy's host while in Belgrade (Tanjug, 2 February). Belgrade television rarely reports on Seselj's activities and was unlikely to give much coverage to any foreign visitor who embraced him, especially since he is now causing Milosevic considerable difficulty in the Serbian parliament. At the same time, in an apparent attempt to hold on to the support of the radical Serbian nationalists without stirring international ire, Milosevic ally Zeljko Raznjatovic-Arkan announced at a 4 February press conference reported on by Belgrade radio, but not Belgrade television, that his Party of Serbian Unity and Zhirinovskiy's party had signed an agreement on "cooperation" (Belgrade radio, 4 February).
