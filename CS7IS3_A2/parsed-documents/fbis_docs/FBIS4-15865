He added that even contacts of state delegations were impossible. Latvia cannot be satisfied with the explanations provided by Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev or Defense Minister Pavel Grachev who did not write the order or even know of its existence, Andrejevs emphasized. In his words, Latvia's painful response to the incident is largely attributable to the domestic political situation in the country. Andrejevs said that the Russian authorities had to be aware of the fact that the document on military bases in Latvia had fueled the Latvian radical opposition which had been taking a dim view of the agreements between the two countries. Now President Guntis Ulmanis had to do his best to have the passion calm and find the best possible solution. Andrejevs said that it would never be late to hold a summit and sign the initialed agreement on withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia. He admitted that even though the incident with the presidential order had not contributed to better Russo-Latvian relations, Latvia had no alternative to moving forward to signing an agreement with Russia.
