Latvia's response to Kozyrev's statements was not reckless because the full text of his speech contains the same ideas of continued military presence in the Baltic region as the ITAR-TASS news agency reported earlier. The Jan. 19 statement by Baltic prime ministers also does not misconstrue Kozyrev's words in the conference of Russian diplomatic corps representatives. Andrejevs described Kozyrev's comments as ambigous. They allow for various interpretations, the minister noted. The Latvian Government was also troubled because the statement followed President Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow, Andrejevs said. The U.S. State Department, however, demanded Russian clarifications on the statement "if the news accounts on Kozyrev's comments are accurate." This leads to believe that Russia did not coordinate its political course with the U.S. Government, Andrejevs said. State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said Jan. 19 that Kozyrev's comments are "certainly at odds with statements by President Yeltsin in Moscow and certainly (are) at odds with things that we've been told by high officials of the Russian Government in our meetings in Moscow and prior to Moscow." As reported, Kozyrev spoke out against a complete withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltics and other former states of the Soviet Union because of Russia's vital interests.
