The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting, and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with the Act. 1 A seventh requirement of section 507(a), establishment of an Ombudsman office, is discussed in the next section. The State has met this requirement. The SBAP will provide a system for developing, collecting, and coordinating information on compliance methods and technologies. Data bases and experts in different areas will provide definitive guidance information. The SBAP will include: (i) Methods for disseminating technical and compliance information to small businesses: The SBAP will act as an information clearinghouse by referring small businesses to State technical experts, specifically trained to handle specific questions relevant to achieving compliance with the CAA. The State has installed and is operating a toll-free telephone hot line to respond to inquires from small businesses. Services provided by the SBAP are to be publicized through an electronic bulletin board, association newsletters, industry groups, trade associations, and community roundtables. The flow of information includes two types of components: A proactive component and a reactive component. The proactive component involves adequate communication with and information outreach to small businesses in the form of easily discernable information which specifically details their obligations under the CAA. The reactive component involves the establishment of a clearinghouse for handling incoming inquiries from small businesses regarding methods for achieving compliance with air pollution control requirements under the CAA. A more detailed description of the SBAP elements follows. (ii) Information dissemination methods available to qualified small businesses are as follows: (A) An electronic bulletin board will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to provide guidance on applicable rules and regulations, a calendar of events, a listing of public hearings and workshops, and a menu of directories that include Federal, State, and private environmental hot lines and technology centers. The electronic bulletin board will also provide a mechanism that allows users to evaluate the system and provide anonymous comments on the program and information provided; the user can make suggestions. Application forms, instructions, brochures, and other technical and compliance information can be requested through the electronic bulletin board. Up-to-date State and Federal regulations for all media will be available with search capability for review and selection by qualified small businesses. The electronic bulletin board is available via computer modem (phone line) directly on the small business site or at a variety of locations within the State. (B) The SBAP will mail, upon request, information outlining the rights of small businesses and how those rights can be exercised. (C) Personal visits to small businesses may be made by the SBAP personnel. (D) Public service announcements by mass media methods such as newspapers, radio, and television are available.

(F) A toll-free hot line to receive technical and compliance information will be implemented through the SBAP office. (G) A clearinghouse will be established that will handle incoming inquiries from small businesses. Access to the electronic bulletin board, facsimile machine, printer, and other information tools will be available to staff to respond to the inquiries. Walk-in service will be provided, as well as electronic, written, and telephone contacts. All information developed by the SBAP will be available through the clearinghouse, as well as any appropriate reference materials needed to comply. c. The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies, process changes, products, and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. The State has met this requirement. The SBAP will assist small business stationary sources on methods of pollution prevention and accidental release prevention and detection, including information concerning different technologies, process changes, products, and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. Technical personnel from the TACB will be available to provide pertinent information from the regional offices or from the Austin office.

Mechanisms to provide assistance will include the following: (i) The SBAP will coordinate information relating to pollution prevention and accidental release prevention and detection with all Federal, State, and local agencies with environmental jurisdictions; (ii) The SBAP clearinghouse and electronic bulletin board will include information on pollution prevention, accidental release prevention, and detection; and (iii) A directory of contacts will be developed and made available of technical experts in the areas of pollution prevention, accidental release prevention, detection, and familiarity with pollution prevention technologies and alternatives to reduce pollution. d.
