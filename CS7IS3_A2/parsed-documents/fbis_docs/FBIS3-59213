[Mueller-Blattau] You say friendly; I have problems with understanding that, for example in the case of China. [Kinkel] Why? We have good, friendly relations with this country, that is the way I would put it. That changes nothing about the fact that at every meeting, such as last week with the president of the parliament, I emphatically and clearly say: you have committed such-and-such and such-and-such a violation of human rights in your country. You must please ensure that...[changes thought] I cannot sit there and say: we have an absolutely valid understanding of human rights, we are imposing our understanding of human rights onto you, a country like China with a great history and culture. They won't allow us to dictate to them like that. The way Mr. Mueller imagines this, that you can make foreign policy in this way, is just not possible. One must address the issue clearly, unambiguously, with an understanding of this country, its culture, its different history. That is the problem, and foreign policy is not a matter of getting up on a table, shouting heave-ho and thinking we can impose our views on others. [Mueller-Blattau] Quite another country, that is Japan with its great economic power, is a tough competitor for German industry, for example the car industry. Does something have to change there, in economic relations? [Kinkel] What does have to change mean? We must remain competitive, and we must assert ourselves vis-a-vis the Japanese car market, the engineering market, etc. It's as simple as that and at the same time so difficult, for the Japanese have, it is true, gained huge advantages over us and there are whole sectors where we have fallen behind technologically. Just take bio-engineering, where in America there are a thousand production facilities in this field and here there are 12. A thousand as against 12. Last week I spoke to the German Research Institute and the Max Planck Institute -- we must be very careful that, as a big industrial country, we don't fall behind in the technology sector, and of course one of our great competitors is Japan. [Mueller-Blattau] I deduce from that industry and foreign policy are quite obviously very closely connected. [Kinkel] Yes, far more than before. Foreign economic and trade policy has become a focal issue above all for German foreign policy and plays a very decisive, important part for example in European and transatlantic relations now that the security issue has gone into the background following the end of East-West confrontation, therefore, we must devote great attention to these foreign trade issues in our foreign policy.
