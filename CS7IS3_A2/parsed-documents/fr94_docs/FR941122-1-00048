ACTION: Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking; reopening of comment period. SUMMARY: On September 13, 1994, the Coast Guard published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register (59 FR 47034). This proposed rule would promulgate a new subpart regulating certain equipment requirements and operating procedures for fish tender vessels operating in the Aleutian trade. These regulations would allow for the continued cargo service by water to remote communities in Alaska while ensuring increased safety standards for the vessels engaged in this trade. The Federal Register incorrectly indicated the comment period would close November 14, 1993 vice November 14, 1994. In an effort to be responsive to the best interests of the public and receive the greatest amount of input possible regarding this proposed rulemaking, the Coast Guard has decided to reopen the comment period until December 31, 1994. DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 31, 1994.
