[passage omitted] Prince Sa'ud was addressing the 5th meeting between the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] foreign affairs ministers and the EU counterparts, which opened today. Karlos Papoulias, Greek foreign minister and head of the European side, also delivered a similar speech in which he dealt with the peace process in the Middle East, the situation in former Yugoslavia, and cooperation between the two sides in the economic sphere. In his address, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal stressed the GCC states' eagerness to bolster security and stability in the Gulf region and guarantee the safety of navigation in their waters. He expressed hope that political statements by Iranian officials expressing wishes to develop Iran's relations with the GCC states, would be accompanied, on the ground, by policies compatible with those wishes. Prince Sa'ud said he looked forward to a positive reply from the republic of Iran [as received] to the initiative made by the president of the United Arab Emirates in order to solve the dispute over the three islands [Abu Musa, Greater Tumb, and Lesser Tumb]. In his address, Prince Sa'ud called upon the Yemeni leaderships to resort to self-restraint, stop the fighting, avoid bloodshed and pursue means of dialogue to solve their bloody conflict. He also called for the use of the recent Israeli-Palestinian agreement to achieve a real progress in all other bilateral talks, particularly the Syrian and the Lebanese tracks. He added that any fundamental progress in the bilateral talks would help achieve tangible progress in the multilateral talks; this will accordingly help achieve the set goal for the peace process: a just, comprehensive and permanent peace in the Middle East. In his address, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal dwelt on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and called on the European Union, to which he attributed a particular responsibility due to its geographic location, to take necessary measures to guarantee the security and safety of all other areas following the example of Sarajevo. Prince Sa'ud called on the United Nations to take all the measures to prevent rewarding the Serbs for their aggression and called for the need to lift the arms embargo on the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to allow it to exert it legitimate right to self-defense. Regarding economic cooperation between the GCC and the EU, Prince Sau'd expressed hope that the recommendations submitted to the meeting by the joint cooperation committee, particularly the intertwined issues of energy and environment, would help drawing defined ideas to implement the contents of the joint report in the form of recommendations in order to achieve the goals included in the cooperation agreement concluded between the two sides in 1988. [Passage omitted] On his part, the Greek foreign affairs minister, Karlos Papoulias, affirmed the EU's support for the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement which was recently signed in Cairo. [Passage omitted] Minister Papoulias expressed worry over the continuation of the Yugoslav crisis and renewed the community's commitment to exert more efforts for achieving just and permanent peace. On the economic side, the Greek minister welcomed the agreement reached by the GCC finance ministers on unifying customs tariff among their countries, a matter which would facilitate the start of a joint trade agreement between the European Community and GCC countries. He said that the recommendations of the team which is made up of representatives from the two sides on energy and environmental issues would help [the two sides] to overstep the differences in the points of view in these fields. Papoulias asked the Gulf states for more commitment to protect the environment as a step towards participating in achieving an international strategy for this purpose. Shaykh Fahim al-Qasimi, GCC secretary-general, delivered a speech in which he reviewed what the GCC has been achieved since the fourth meeting, pointing out that the Council has continued its march among the member countries in the political, economic, military, and security spheres rapidly and continuously. He pointed out that the private sector's contribution in the economic sphere of the economies of the GCC countries has increased, and that the growth of the non-oil production sectors has continued. He pointed out that the council has adopted a number of decisions, among which was the creation of a trade arbitration center for the Council's countries for settling trade and investment disputes and facilitating the movement and exchange of commodities and services. He added that there were also directives to speed up the efforts aimed at reaching an agreement on the unified customs tariff. In his turn, Shaykh Muhammad Bin Mubarak Al Khalifah, foreign affairs minister of the State of Bahrain, emphasized that the Gulf-European meeting convened in Riyad acquired extreme importance which reflected the nature of the period in which it was held and expressed its aims in developing and strengthening coordination and political and economic cooperation between the council's countries and the EU. He said in a speech delivered at the economic discussions of the fifth joint meeting of the GCC and EU countries that the consecutive regional and international transformations and changes the world was witnessing called for the intensification of the dialogue and the exchange of opinions and expertise in order to deal with these changes and transformations which resulted from the ending of the cold war period, the comprehensive change in the map of international relations and the establishment of the new world order. He referred to the negotiation rounds between the GCC and EU countries and said that despite the correspondences or differences in the points of view accompanying such rounds on a number of political and economic issues, the continued objective dialogue has achieved positive interconnection and widened the area of agreement for achieving a cooperative and coordinated platform. He expressed the hope that this would in the end lead to an agreement for setting up the free trade zone between the two groups [GCC and EU] to safeguard their joint interests, particularly after some GCC countries have signed the GATT agreement.
