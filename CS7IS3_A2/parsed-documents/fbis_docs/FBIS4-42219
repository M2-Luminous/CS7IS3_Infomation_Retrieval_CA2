This only applies to Kurds who originate from the troubled regions in southeastern Turkey and who make their asylum applications in Brandenburg, government spokesman Erhard Thomas has announced. Criminals are excluded from the ruling. Brandenburg is thus following the Social Democratic Party-governed states of Schleswig-Holstein, Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse, and Lower Saxony.
