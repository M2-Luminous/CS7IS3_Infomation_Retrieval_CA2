He said: The use of air power in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be limited to the defense of the UN Protection Forces [Unprofor]. China cannot help but express anxiety and concern about the serious consequences which the air strikes may cause for the safety of Unprofor personnel and their humanitarian relief activities. The international community should act very prudently and refrain from taking any hasty action. Over 200 civilians have died or were wounded in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as result of a shelling incident there on 5 February. On 9 February, NATO issued an ultimatum to the warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina in which it warned them to remove their heavy weapons 20 km from Sarajevo or turn them over to the United Nations within 10 days, otherwise they would be subject to NATO air strikes. The UN Security Council meeting today was called at the request of Russia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Pakistan. The representatives of over 50 countries demanded to take the floor on the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation. Chen Jian said: China is opposed to the use of force, or the threat to use force, in resolving the conflict. He said: "The eventual settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue should continue to be sought within the framework of the principles set out by the international conference on the former Yugoslavia and relevant Security Council resolutions and through peaceful negotiations so as to ensure a lasting, fair, and reasonable solution that can guarantee the fundamental interests of the various parties and that can be accepted by all." In his speech, French Ambassador Merimee reiterated that the warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina should place their heavy weapons under UN control, otherwise they will be subject to air strikes. He added that France endorsed Russia's proposal for placing Sarajevo under UN control. Russian Ambassador Vorontsov said that the UN Security Council should come up with an "appropriate decision" so that its previous resolutions on a cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the removal of heavy weapons can be carried out.
