Polozkov was interviewed by Interfax following a REUTERS report on the exercises. REUTERS quoted the Chief of the Russian Navy's Press Center, Aleksandr Veledeyev, as doubting whether the exercises aimed to insure coordinated performance by the Russian and Western navies. Norwegian, U.S., British, German, and Russian warships are to take part in the Pomor-94 exercises in the Sea of Norway on March 21. The First Deputy Commander of the Russian Navy, Admiral Igor Kasatonov, has told Interfax the Pomor-94 exercises are part of a series of moves to enhance coordination between the Russian and NATO fleets. Admiral Kasatonov will be monitoring the exercises on behalf of Russia.
