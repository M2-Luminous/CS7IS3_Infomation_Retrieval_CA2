Zornichenko, leading economist of the city statistics department: "What We Breathe: Tomorrow Is World Environmental Protection Day"] [Text] Environment today needs protection more then ever. The large quantity of pollutants discharged into the atmosphere is one of the factors causing a drop in the birth rate and an increase in the mortality rate. In 1993 the number of births in Vladivostok declined by 13 percent as compared to 1992. In the same year, one and a half times more people died than were born. Vladivostok enterprises discharged into the atmosphere 691,000 tonnes of pollutants. Of them, 626,000 tonnes were intercepted by scrubbers and neutralized. While in 1992 an average of 169 tonnes of pollutants were discharged daily, this year the amount increased to 176 tonnes. The greatest culprits in atmospheric pollution are such major industrial enterprises as AO [joint-stock society] Dalzavod, Vladivostok central heat and power station No. 2, heat-distribution networks, the oil warehouse, and the maritime fishing port. Many of them, in addition to dust, "present" the atmosphere with ammonia, hydrocarbons, and a score of other hazardous substances. Over the year, 253 tonnes of soot, 1,239 tonnes of dust and inorganic compounds, and four tonnes of hydrogen sulfide are discharged into the atmosphere. The high level of discharge of hazardous substances--3,000 tonnes--is produced by means of transportation and transportation and road complex enterprises. The ecological policy should be one of priorities for the state. People's health depends on it.
