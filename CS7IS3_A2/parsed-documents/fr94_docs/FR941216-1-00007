FR941216-1-00007 FR941216-1-00002 §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Airbus Industrie: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;191&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes equipped with SOGERMA&hyph;SOCEA pilot, co-pilot, and third occupant seats; as listed in SOGERMA&hyph;SOCEA Service Bulletin 25&hyph;229, dated November 26, 1993; certificated in any category. Note 1: This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (b) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent fatigue cracks and/or distortion in the seat bracket of the backrest recline control lock, which could result in failure of the seat backrest attach fittings, the uncommanded 50 ○ angle recline of the pilot or co-pilot seat, and, subsequently, lead to the temporary inability of the pilots to control the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Prior to the accumulation of 10,000 total flight hours or within 500 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, perform a detailed visual inspection to detect distortion and/or cracks on the attachment brackets of the backrest recline control locks of certain seats, in accordance with SOGERMA&hyph;SOCEA Service Bulletin 25&hyph;229, dated November 26, 1993. (1) If no bracket is distorted or cracked, repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 5,000 flight hours. (2) If any bracket is distorted or cracked, prior to further flight, replace both of the brackets and their associated attachment fittings with new parts, in accordance with the service bulletin. Accomplishment of this replacement constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspection requirements of this AD. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note 2: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on December 12, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
