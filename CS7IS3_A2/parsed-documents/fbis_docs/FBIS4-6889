FBIS4-6889 "dreas079_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-079 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 North Korea Radio Denounces Patriot Deployment to Front Line Radio Denounces Patriot Deployment to Front Line SK2204131494 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1213 GMT 22 Apr 94 SK2204131494 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1213 GMT 22 Apr 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to Seoul KBS-1 Radio, on 21 April the U.S. imperialists finally began to deploy new-model Patriot missiles to the central region of the front line in South Korea, despite strong protest and denunciation by the Korean people and by a broad range of world public opinion. This is an open challenge to us and is aimed at threatening us militarily and carrying out a preemptive strike against the Northern half of the Republic. The beginning of the U.S. deployment of new-model Patriot missiles to the central region of the front line while talking about a nonexisting offensive threat by someone else is a deliberate, dangerous military act [uidojogin wihomhan kunsa haengdong] to make the situation on the Korean peninsula more unstable [touk puranjonghage hago], and further, to prompt [yubal] a new war. The deployment of new-model Patriot missiles in broad daylight plainly shows that the U.S. authorities can cast any international agreement away like dirt to achieve their goal of aggression, taking no regard of the Armistice Agreement or the armistice organization. The U.S. imperialists should discreetly act, being well aware what grave consequence will result from the deployment of new-model Patriot missiles, which pose a great threat to the peace and security of Korean peninsula and the Far East.
