The main task of the center is to improve the research and development of substitutes for ozone depleting substances (ODS), by developing new products and technology. The research center was set up on the basis of the chemical industry research center in Zhejiang Province under the Ministry of Chemical Industry. Zhejiang is an important production base of fluorine raw material ore in China. The amount of reserves, production and exports account for one-third of the total in the whole country. The Zhejiang Chemical Industry Institute has successfully worked out dozens of substitutes for freon that do little harm to the ozone layer. Some are under test use and are supplied to major refrigerator enterprises. The substitute for another ozone depletion substance -- halon, a fire extinguishing agent -- is under development. ODS are mainly used in industrial cooling and electronic cleansing devices. When the substances are released into the atmosphere they are likely to destroy the ozone layer, which absorbs ultra-violet light and reduces the sun's radiation. China is the biggest ODS producer and consumer among the developing countries. It joined the Vienna pact for the protection of the ozone layer in 1989. In 1992 China drew up its first national program for progressively eliminating ozone depleting substances.
