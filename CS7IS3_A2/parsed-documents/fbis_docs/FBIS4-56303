FBIS4-56303 "drlat085_g_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-085 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 Guatemala Death Penalty Approved in Child Abduction Cases Death Penalty Approved in Child Abduction Cases PA2904232994 Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 27 Apr 94 p 3 PA2904232994 Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE Spanish BFN [Text] The National Congress yesterday approved a law that will impose the death penalty in cases in which defendants are convicted of kidnapping children under the age of 12 or elderly people over the age of 70. The measure is included among the law enforcement amendments requested by the executive branch. The law is contained in Decree 38-94, which amends Article 201 of the Penal Code (Decree 17-73). After President Ramiro de Leon Carpio submitted a request asking for the death penalty, the Legislative and Constitutional Issues Committee made some changes and overturned a ruling by the Government Committee, which requested penalties of only 25-30 years in prison. Article 201 of the Penal Code now reads as follows: The abducting or kidnapping of a person to collect ransom or payment, or to exchange the abductee for a third party, as well as the committing of other related or similar illicit and money-making activities shall be punished with a 25-year prison term. The death penalty shall be imposed in the following cases: A) should the abductee be under the age of 12 or over the age of 70; B) should the abductee die, sustain serious or grave injuries, or suffer permanent physical or psychological trauma as a result of the kidnapping. Should the criminal repent at any stage of the process or provide leads to solve the kidnapping or abduction case satisfactorily, the corresponding sentence could be mitigated.
