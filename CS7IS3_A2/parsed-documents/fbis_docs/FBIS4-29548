The LDP officials said Hwang Chang-yop, a secretary of the (North) Korean Workers' Party [WPK], made the observation in a meeting with an LDP mission led by former Defense Agency chief Taku Yamasaki. Hwang also reportedly told the LDP group that it is "meaningless" for his country to have nuclear weapons. He proposed an end to power diplomacy and warned that North Korea will retaliate if economic sanctions were imposed on Pyongyang, according to the LDP officials who talked with the Yamasaki group after the meeting in the North Korean capital. Yamasaki explained Japan's commitment to the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and emphasized that a nuclear-free Korean peninsula is essential for peace and stability in North Asia, the LDP officials in Tokyo said.
