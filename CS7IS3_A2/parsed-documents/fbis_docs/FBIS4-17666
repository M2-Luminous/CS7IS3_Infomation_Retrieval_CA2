On 11 April, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov signed three edicts under the numbers 37/94, 38/94, and 39/94.... These are the edicts "On Currency Regulation and Currency Control," "On Banks and Banking Activity," and "On the Improvement of Taxation and the System of Settlements in the Economic Circulation." This has become a real shock for Ukraine's entrepreneurs. For example, the first of the edicts allows the circulation on the Crimean territory of any foreign currency and, to spite Zvyahilskyy, it envisages the creation of the Crimean Interbank Currency Exchange. By the second edict, the peninsula has placed Ukraine's National Bank and our commercial banks in a quite desperate situation. At present, the Central Bank in the Crimea may carry out functions of a national bank (with the exception of issuing money). It may be expected that newly created Crimean banks will gather speed very fast, because low fixed capital will be assigned to them and they will be allowed to purchase and sell precious metals and stones, as well foreign securities. Incidentally, it is now possible to expect a difference in the rates of exchange of the Ukrainian karbovanets because in the Crimea, its rate of exchange will be determined through auctions at the Currency Exchange. The third edict is a blow below the waist to Ukraine's Ministry of Finance. It envisages immediate replacement of the income tax by the tax (30 percent) on the profit and further improvement of the taxation system with canceling many types of Ukrainian taxes. If these innovations are taken into account, it may be expected that the activity of Ukrainian entrepreneurs will be focused precisely on the Crimea. The Crimea is now becoming a kind of entrepreneurs' paradise through which money can be easily transferred abroad (incidentally, this mainly attracts shadow capital). Crimea itself will lose large sums of money, because the profit of enterprises will immediately become (artificially) minimal. Yet, there also is a positive aspect: Such free convertibility of the karbovanets may be fabulously instrumental in raising its rate of exchange. However, an economic confrontation has added up to the political confrontation between the Crimea and Ukraine.
