Stir Over `Firm Decision To Appoint Yusuke Yoshinaga as Public Prosecutor General'"] [Text] The appointment of Yusuke Yoshinaga (61 years old), chief of the Tokyo High Public Prosecutor's Office, who is known as "Mr. Special Investigator," to the top prosecutorial post, public prosecutor general, on 10 December has been settled. Opinion is rife that the investigation of general contractors will gain momentum by the decision to make Yoshinaga public prosecutor general, but judging from established practice up till now, one can say that this appointment is an extreme exception. As the chief prosecutor in the Lockheed scandal, Yoshinaga arrested and prosecuted former prime minister Kakuei Tanaka, and he later had a hand in the Douglas-Grumman scandal, the Recruit scandal, and so on. But in November 1991 he became chief of the Osaka High Public Prosecutor's Office, which was said to be "the highest post that he will reach," so it was thought "there will be no more times for Yoshinaga to appear on stage." But in July 1993 he astonished everyone by being appointed chief of the Tokyo High Public Prosecutor's Office. Moreover, after a mere five months he is succeeding to the top post during the term of Public Prosecutor General Yasutaka Okamura because Okamura abdicated his position. A person related to the Public Prosecutor's Office explains this promotion. "The one who was controlling prosecutorial appointments up till now was Yasuchika Negoro, administrative vice minister for justice, and he was also scheduled to assume office as the next public prosecutor general. But confidence in him is at a low ebb because in the Sagawa Kyubin scandal he allowed the prosecution of Kanemaru to end with only summary legal proceedings. The fact is, the prime mover was Negoro, who has close ties with politicians. By this appointment, the chance for Negoro, who was born in the same year as Yoshinaga, 1932, to assume the office of public prosecutor general disappeared, and one can say that it severed the union of the judiciary and politics." It appears that prosecutors actively engaged in prosecution gained further strength from this appointment; it is said "there are many prosecutors who would like to do something to enhance Yoshinaga's appointment as public prosecutor general. The investigation of general contractors is winding down; at present Kajima President Rokuro Ishikawa is the focal point, but the exposure of politicians is also being narrowed to two politicians and brought to a close" (a person connected with the District Public Prosecutor's Office). It is really very promising, but there is also a view which has misgivings about an appointment to public prosecutor general that is too early. Because a rumor that when Yoshinaga made a comeback to chief of the Tokyo High Prosecutor's Office there was a secret agreement between him and a powerful former public prosecutor general, is widely believed among those connected with prosecution. The secret agreement "was that the condition for becoming public prosecutor general was that Yoshinaga retire midway in his term and yield the post of public prosecutor general to Negoro. It is rumored that there even exists a signed and sealed memorandum. If that were true, it would mean that the highest post in prosecution, which should be the most open and aboveboard, is held in rotation by the same group by private agreement" (person connected with the Tokyo High Public Prosecutor's Office). Attorney Kazuo Kawakami, former chief of the Special Investigations Department of the District Public Prosecutor's Office says this: "Speaking from Yoshinaga's real ability, I think it was a natural appointment. I would like him to hunt down great evil for the full extent of his term, without being led astray by such things as disputes over appointments." There are signs that early this month the investigation of general contractors will finally begin to move toward central political circles. We also desire a thorough investigation in order to negate the rumors of a secret agreement.
