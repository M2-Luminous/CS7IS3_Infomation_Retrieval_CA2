Stressing on the fact that his visits "have marked a relaunch of bilateral ties with the three states," Nicolae Vacaroiu mentioned that several agreements and firm contracts worth $80 million have been concluded, to which the contract-framework accounting for $800 million is added with real possibilities for rapid capitalization. "The tour has brought to the fore an extensive potential of growing Romanian exports," Minister of Industries Dumitru Popescu commented, "and this because the area is rich in raw materials and we must operate exports to get them. An example is Brazil with which we have set ourselves to reach a volume of trade worth some $70 million, half of which being expected to represent Romanian exports. We are to focus on car, metal and chemical products and equipment exports." Minister of Trade Cristian Ionescu stated in his turn that prospects are in place for relaunching Romanian commercial exchanges with the three states, especially with Brazil: "The fact that our Brazilian partners have shown special interest in growing ties with Romania is an extremely encouraging fact for us. Obviously, ties will also grow with Peru and Paraguay". According to Education Minister Liviu Maior, conditions are in place "to send student researchers in Latin America, as well as prospects to open lectorships of Romanian language and civilization in three major universities. As for culture, there is a high demand for Romanian exhibitions, first of all of Brancusi works, as well as for tours of musical groups, especially for the Madrigal Choir. Moreover, we were asked to promote a tighter collaboration in the field of Romance studies". As for the political-diplomatic field, Foreign Ministry State Secretary Marcel Dinu stated that "we are collecting the results after promoting a constant policy of close ties with Latin American countries, which is one of our main priorities. Certainly some could raise the question if these visits were put under the sign of integration in Europe. I view these priorities as complementary, and by no means one is excluding the other."
