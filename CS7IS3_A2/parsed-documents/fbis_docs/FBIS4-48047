Tonight we give you the first ever interview with the minister of national defense, Mr. Joe Modise. Mr. Modise, good evening and welcome, and let's congratulate you on being appointed national defense minister of the new South Africa. [Modise] Thank you. [Mashokwe] Mr. Modise, what do you regard as priorities? What is important to you as defense minister? [Modise] Your question is a loaded question. From the side of defense, naturally, the priority is to put these armies together. As you know we had the former South African Defense Force [SADF]; we had Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army]; we also had the Transkei Defense Force and Bophuthatswana Defense Force and the Ciskei Defense Force. All those forces on 27 April became the South African National Defense Force. Now we are faced with the task of preparing them. In other words, they've got to undergo training -- in fact all of them -- so that we've got one uniform form of training. For the process, we have requested the British in particular to come and assist us in preparing these forces, and also in taking part in the adjudication especially when infiltration, I mean when integration begins to take place, so that we don't have a lot of wrangling. So basically the starting point would be to prepare all these forces so that the level of training is more or less the same. [Mashokwe] Putting together these forces from different backgrounds, in a way from different thinking, and former enemies becoming compatriots or colleagues in the army -- is it doable, let me use that word? [Modise] It is doable, but it's not an easy task. It's a mammoth task, because here you are not just dealing with ordinary training; you are also changing attitudes. It has been done in Zimbabwe; it's done in Namibia; there is no reason why South Africa shouldn't do it. And what I saw today, in this parliament, is a clear indication that our people are now on the doorstep of progress. We are on the threshold of building a nation, and I am very confident that that South African nation is going to be built. Unlike the factions that we had in the past, if we can build a nation, there is no reason why we shouldn't put these different forces together and build a truly national defense force. [Mashokwe] Apparently we had this failed attempt at putting together the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF], and many cynics look at that and say: Will we be able to put together a national defense force if we failed at that level? [Modise] You must not forget that the Peacekeeping Force never had a chance. We had planned to put it together, train it for nine months. It was done in eight weeks. The training was completely inadequate. Time was too short, and what is more, the Peacekeeping Force was opposed long before its inception. The idea was opposed. It had a lot of enemies from within and from without. I've never seen a force that was criticized like the Peacekeeping Force. So, in other words, it was never given a chance. I don't think that attitude is going to prevail with the building of the new South African National Defense Force, and we are going to give ourselves time. We don't see integration as an overnight affair. We look at it as a process. We are going to start preparing our men now. We are going to put them through the necessary paces, until we feel that they are ready to be put together, because that's the only way in which we are going to have a legitimate force. The SADF cannot be transformed into the South African National Defense Force. It won't be accepted by the people. It will still remain an illegitimate force. To legitimize it we've got to bring in all these others, and we've got to empower them. They come from a deprived community. They never had the opportunities that their counterparts have. We've got to work hard and get them also to be on this, on par with the others, so that the integration also should be seen as being fair, and if the SADF has got black groups that were commanded, that fought wars in Angola and everywhere else, what would be wrong with these black troops that are coming into the new National Defense Force? [Mashokwe] Mr. Modise, as I listen to you talk, I remember that in days gone by you were almost regarded as chief terrorist. Now you are chief of the defense force. Tell me about that transformation in your heart, in your mind, in your being? [Modise] Well, I was asked this morning, this evening too, how do I feel? I said somewhat strange. It does. The surroundings are strange. Parliament, do you know that it was my first time to enter parliament yesterday? I've never seen it from inside. I've always seen it from outside as I'm passing here. One had that feeling, but let me say it's a challenge and I'm confident that we are going to succeed in building this new nation. I said to you earlier on, we are on the threshold of building a nation in this country. We are moving away from the old black, brown, white factions that we had here. We are building one solid nation, and like I said earlier on, that I am very confident. What I saw here today, over the past few days -- in fact from the elections -- I've always been confident; I've always been optimistic. [sentence as heard] But from the elections I became even more optimistic that we are going to build a prosperous country, and our people are going to be united. And, you ask me how do I feel? That's the feeling I have. I have the feeling of being part of a great nation, and let me say, from my side as minister, with my [word indistinct] I'm going to put it together. We will also do our best to do our small part to make sure that this country becomes prosperous and its people are well protected. [Mashokwe] In defense the important matter now when you could say the scenario, the political scenario, the cold war is over, we no more have enemies, we don't have the kind of situations that prevailed in the old days of apartheid when we had to be guarding all the borders -- should we be giving you more money than was the budget for the last year? Should we use that money elsewhere for instance? [Modise] You've got to look after your forces. There's no such thing as people not having enemies. Perhaps they don't appear now because we have a formidable force here. If this force disappears and we become defenseless, you'll be surprised how many enemies are going to mushroom. Look at Switzerland -- they've always been neutral, they've never fought a war, but I can remember, I mean from Western history, that they are armed to the teeth. You ask yourselves: Why are they spending so much money? They've just bought five Phantoms from the United States -- I mean, F-18's from the United States. You ask yourself why are they arming to the teeth when they are a neutral country? They've always been neutral. Even when people negotiate peace, we go to Geneva. Peaceful people. Why are they defending themselves? [Mashokwe] You are saying the defense budget must not be cut down. When I listen to other politicians from your organization they say: We'll cut on defense; we'll use that money for reconstruction and development. Is there not conflict of interests here? [Modise] No, no I don't think you must misunderstand me. Naturally, our priority as a nation is to better the lives of our people. The development program is a very important program. We've got to save where we can, even in defense. We are not going to modernize. It's true our country has been isolated for a very long time. It couldn't buy the type of equipment that they would want to buy. But we've got to maintain what we have. We can't take these aeroplanes now and throw them into the scrap yard. They need to be serviced. We need to buy spare parts for them, but of course the outlook will always toward saving a little bit from defense, saving from all over, enabling the government to continue with its development program. [Mashokwe] I'm trying to put myself in the boots of minister of defense. You have all these newcomers -- MK, APLA, and everybody else who would like to be now a member of the National Defense Force. You obviously need a bigger budget. But now the question is, what's more important? Those who are coming in to defend the country? Are you prepared to take a cut in the defense budget? What do you think is important? I know you might have a prejudiced answer, but it is important? [Modise] I think there will be a reduction in spending on new equipment. We can't take these men and throw them into the streets. They've got to come in, and naturally after preparing them, there will be rationalization, and after rationalization we need to find other alternatives for them. I was asked by the radio people as to what's going to happen to them? I've been highly impressed with the Taiwanese approach. They've got what they call a Veteran's Association. The men who went to Taiwan under Chiang Kai-shek when they got there, when they were now being rationalized with Chiang Kai-shek, when they were half a million men, and he ended up with 100,000 men -- the other 400,000 weren't in it -- and their conditions were worse than ours. Those men were assisted by the government, given training, started working with their hands, developed. Today, the biggest engineering companies today belong to the ex-service association. I don't say we'll equal the Taiwanese, but I think that as soon as these men -- and we are working in the direction of preparing, getting an organization which will absorb them -- and we'll then train them to acquire little skills and some will, those who have got the ability to go to universities will be given that opportunity, and the government will assist where it can. But eventually we are going to assist these people to begin to stand on their own feet, give them a little bit of money once they have acquired skills to start working on their own, and we will be preparing them to enter civilian life. We think this method of approaching this problem will also go a long way to assist us. [Mashokwe] If one who was a captain, or holding a rank within the MK faction is given some training, will it be equal to a rank of captain within the defense force? How are you going to integrate that [words indistinct]? [Modise] I said to you that we had irregular training, some of our men. Of course others had regular training. Those who did not have regular training, and they had irregular training, they will be given a chance, they will be trained, and if the man then was a captain, then we will train him as a captain, whether it takes a year or two years, three years to prepare him. This is a man who has commanded, a man who fought against formidable regular forces, so we will empower him to become a proper captain. [Mashokwe] When you look back with hindsight, Mr. Modise, many people who have lost their lives during the onslaught, the attacks that you were waging as commander out there, are you ever sorry that you did it? [Modise] If I found myself in a similar situation, I would do it all over again. I do regret the lives that have been lost. I think apartheid oppression in this country was wrong. It was unnecessary for this country to have lost so many dear ones. But if I was placed in the same position, I would repeat it all over again. [Mashokwe] Mr. Modise, on that note thanks for your time and thanks for talking to us. [Modise] You are welcome. [Mashokwe] Thank you.
