The aforementioned constitutional article reads as follows: Military service is obligatory for citizens 18-30 years old. A special law will regulate this. I am certain the legislators of my fatherland will approve this constitutional amendment, allowing my government to begin a new historic phase in the fulfillment of the fundamental civic duty of serving and defending the fatherland. Congressional approval of the constitutional amendment I am introducing will also constitute an important landmark in relations between civilian society and the military institution. The young men of Honduras and their parents can rest assured that with this amendment there will be no more forced recruitments, as has been done traditionally. We must all be aware that the elimination of obligatory military service in no way means the termination of an inescapable duty for all Hondurans -- the duty to serve and defend the fatherland. Honduras needs a quantitatively and qualitatively capable and competent Armed Forces. Our young men must regard the Armed Forces as an institution offering a great many opportunities for their overall development. A voluntary, educational, social, humanistic, and democratic military service reconciles the fulfillment of duty with legitimate aspirations that encourage every young man to do his part for his fatherland based on his aptitude, merits, and capabilities. By way of this constitutional amendment we are requesting, our Armed Forces will represent an affirmative manifestation of the immortal maxim of our greatest hero: Yes, battles are won with volunteer soldiers. My fellow countrymen: Implementing the constitutional bill on voluntary, educational, social, humanistic, and democratic military service is a true manifestation of the faith the Honduran people have in dialogue as an effective instrument to renew our republican institutions, strengthen the rights of human beings, and consolidate democracy. The constitutional amendment has the patriotic support of all sectors representative of society. I would like to present all of them with a testament of my recognition for their valuable contribution. It is proper to acknowledge the cooperation provided by the National Congress president and first vice president, the commander in chief and top officers of the Honduran Armed Forces, the members of the cabinet, and the presidential advisers who joined the commission that drafted this bill, which basically reads: Article 276 -- Citizens 18-30 years old will fulfill their military service in a voluntary manner during peacetime, under an educational, social, humanistic, and democratic system. The state has the power to call citizens into the military ranks in accordance with the law. In the case of a war between nations, all Hondurans capable of defending and serving the fatherland are soldiers. My fellow countrymen: By submitting the constitutional amendment bill which establishes a voluntary, educational, social, humanistic, and democratic military service, I am keeping one of the key promises of my presidential campaign. I said it as a candidate, and I am reiterating now as the constitutional president of the Republic. I am going to keep my promise. I am committed to doing so. I have the support of the government team, and, most of all, I have the support of the people and the protection of God. The president will not fail you. Thank you very much.
