FR941019-0-00009 FR941019-0-00003 d. Actions pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818(a) (§303.9(a)). This section continues to allow for the delegation of authority to various Division of Supervision personnel to initiate termination of insurance actions pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818(a). However, it replaces the obsolete term, ``order of correction'', with the current term, ``notification to primary regulator'', and provides that the delegates may act when the insured depository institution's Tier 1 capital is less than 2% of its total assets, which is essentially the current delegation updated to reflect changes in the capital regulations. Paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) modify the certification requirements to conform with the terminology currently found in 12 U.S.C. 1818(a). e. Actions pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818(b) and 12 U.S.C. 1818(c) (§§303.9 (b) and (c)). These sections have been changed to provide delegations of authority to both the Director of the Division of Supervision and the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs to initiate actions pursuant to sections 8 (b) and (c) of the Act as appropriate. The amendment also provides for the joint issuance of notices and orders by the Division of Supervision and the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs when both safety and soundness and consumer compliance matters will be addressed in the action. f. Actions pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818(e) (§303.9(d)). In this section, the term ``individual'' is replaced with the current terminology, ``institution-affiliated party.'' The section has also been revised to provide delegations of authority to both the Director of the Division of Supervision and the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs and, where confirmed in writing, to an associate director to issue notices of intent to remove from office pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818(e). The amendment also provides for the joint issuance of notices and orders by the Division of Supervision and the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs when both safety and soundness and consumer compliance matters will be addressed in the action. g. Actions pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818(g) (§303.9(e)). The delegations have been revised to provide delegated authority to the Director of the Division of Supervision and the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs to issue orders of suspension or prohibition pursuant to section 8(g) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act). The amendment also provides for the joint issuance of such orders by the Division of Supervision and the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs when both safety and soundness and consumer compliance matters will be addressed in the action. The language has also been revised to conform with the statute as it currently reads. Hence, the reference to ``indicted director, officer or person participating in the conduct of the affairs'' has been replaced with ``institution-affiliated party who is charged in any information, indictment, or complaint as set forth in section 8(g) of the Act.'' h. Civil money penalty actions (§303.9(g)). Current §303.9 delegates to the Director of the Division of Supervision and, where confirmed in writing, an associate director the authority to issue notices of assessment of civil money penalties. The amendment provides an additional delegation of authority to the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs and, where confirmed in writing, to an associate director of that division. The amendment also provides for the issuance of joint notices of assessment of civil money penalties by the Division of Supervision and the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs when both safety and soundness and consumer compliance matters will be addressed in the action. i. Investigations and examinations pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1820(c) (§303.9(i)). Current §303.9 provides a delegation to the Director of the Division of Supervision or the Director of the Division of Liquidation and, where confirmed in writing, to an associate director or the appropriate regional director or deputy regional director and the General Counsel or his designee to issue an order of investigation pursuant to section 10(c) of the Act. This section has been amended to include a delegation of authority to the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs and, where confirmed in writing, to the appropriate regional manager of that division. The amendment also provides for the joint issuance of an order of investigation by the Director of the Division of Supervision and the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs when both safety and soundness and consumer compliance matters will be a subject of the investigation. The reference to ``Division of Liquidation'' has been changed to ``Division of Depositor and Asset Services'' to reflect an earlier title change for that division. The reference to the relevant FDIC regulation is updated to specify the current citation, which is subpart K of part 308. j. Actions pursuant to the Truth in Lending Act (§303.9(j)). This section has been amended to provide delegations of authority to the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs and the appropriate regional manager in that division and to eliminate existing delegations to the Director and other personnel of the Division of Supervision. The scope of the delegation to regional managers has been broadened to allow regional managers to deny any request for relief from the requirements for reimbursement under the Truth in Lending Act up to $25,000 instead of $10,000. k. Unilateral settlement offers (§303.9(k)) and acceptance of written agreements (§303.9(l)). These sections have been amended to include delegations of authority to the Director and an associate director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs. Section 303.9(k) has also been amended to provide that, in cases where a proceeding was issued jointly by DOS and DCA, both Directors, or their designees, must agree to accept, deny or enter into any negotiations for unilateral settlement offers. Section 303.9(l) has also been amended to provide that in cases where both safety and soundness and consumer compliance matters are addressed, joint written agreements may be entered into. Section 303.9(l)(2) has further been amended to broaden the scope of authority delegated to both directors, and where confirmed in writing by either director, to an associate director, to accept or enter into written agreements pertaining to any safety and soundness or consumer compliance matter which may be addressed by section 8(b) of the FDI Act or any other provision of the FDI Act which addresses safety and soundness or consumer compliance matters. l. Modifications and terminations of enforcement actions (§303.9(m)). Section 303.9(m) has been amended to provide a delegation of authority to the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs and, where confirmed in writing, the appropriate associate director and regional manager to terminate actions initiated and orders issued under 12 U.S.C. 1818 (b) or (c) when the depository institution has failed or merged. The delegated authority to modify or terminate other actions not specifically addressed remains unchanged, but language is added to clarify that notifications and notices are included in the types of actions that may be acted upon under this section. The concurrent certification requirement for terminations and modifications remains substantially unchanged.
