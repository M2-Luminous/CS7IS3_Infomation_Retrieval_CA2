FBIS4-6830 "dreas079_d_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-079 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 South Korea Daily: U.S. Decides To Stop Buying Patriots Daily: U.S. Decides To Stop Buying Patriots SK2404060194 Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean 24 Apr 94 p 2 SK2404060194 Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN Korean BFN [Report by correspondent Chong Yon-chu from Washington] [Text] Almost at the same time that the United States deployed Patriot missiles to the ROK, the U.S. Defense Department made a final decision on 21 April to purchase the great-sphere interceptor missile system (Erint), rather than the Patriot missiles, as its missile weapon system for defense. This was notified to Congress. Since the U.S. Defense Department is the main customer for weapons, this decision implies that the Defense Department does not plan to purchase Patriot missiles. This is being considered as a true death sentence for the Patriot missiles. Raytheon, the company that produces Patriot missiles, is faced with a difficult situation because of such a decision. It is expected that this company will actively increase its activities to promote overseas sales of Patriot missiles. Before making a final decision on 21 April, the U.S. Defense Department had decided in February to purchase the (Erint) missile system rather than the Patriot missiles. However at that time, senators and congressmen from Massachusetts, where the Raytheon company is located, demanded an objective basis for the Defense Department's choice. Therefore, the Defense Department formed an independent team to continue to research on this matter. This research team concluded that the (Erint) missile is more effective and has a greater impact than the Patriot missiles in intercepting ballistic missiles loaded with chemical and nuclear weapons. John Deutch, under secretary of defense, revealed: "In accordance with the result of the analysis made by the research team and the operational demands, the Defense Department concluded that the (Erint) is the best choice." The Patriot missile which was treated like a "hero" during the Gulf war received various criticisms on its performance after the war. Thus, its myth was dispelled. Moshe Arens, Israeli defense minister during the Gulf war said: "The rate of hits was only 20 percent." The Massachusetts Institute of Technology research team harshly criticized the Patriots by saying: "The Patriot missile played almost no role at all during the Gulf war."
