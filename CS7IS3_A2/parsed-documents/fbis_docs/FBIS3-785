"I hope they are not overestimating themselves," he told a Kimberley breakfast meeting attended by about 20 businessmen. Mr Buthelezi said free and fair elections could not be held amid the kind of violence experienced in Natal. Violence could increase as the election date got closer. He reiterated the failure of the interim constitution to provide federalism or regional autonomy for South Africa, saying the prognosis for a genuinely democratic government emerging under this constitution "is not good at all". "The 1993 constitution is there to ensure the African National Congress' battle for a central dictatorship will be easily won." Although excluded from the April election, Mr Buthelezi said he still hoped "sanity could prevail" and a solution could be found so all parties could join the fold. While it was traumatic for white Inkatha members not to vote, this was not the case for black members "who have never voted anyway", he said.
