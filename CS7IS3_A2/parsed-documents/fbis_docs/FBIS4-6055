The representatives demanded particularly the "prompt announcement of the causes of the accidents." In response, the consul general showed a positive attitude, saying: "We will ask the U.S. military authorities to make such an announcement, and work toward making this announcement possible." The prefectural assembly delegation lodged the protest in accordance with a resolution adopted at the emergency session of the assembly. Christenson said during the meeting, "We take the prefectural assembly's protest seriously." Concerning the F-15 and helicopter accidents, he explained the U.S. base authorities' position, claiming "after the accidents, there was a ban on all flights. Flights were only resumed after all aircraft had been checked for safety." The consul general also said, "I can understand the Okinawans' negative feelings. We will implement safety measures strictly." However, he reiterated that U.S. military training "is part of our duties under the security pact." The prefectural assembly's delegation is also scheduled to petition the relevant government ministries and agencies later this month. The representatives reaffirmed on 13 April that "the approach of the Japanese Government is important in the solution of base issues. We give priority to our petition with the Foreign Ministry and other government offices."
