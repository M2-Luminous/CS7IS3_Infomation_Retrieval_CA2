Kochug, deputy minister of defense of the Republic of Moldova and chief of the Department of Civil Defense and Emergency Situations, by A. Verin; place and date not given: "A New Emergency Situation Service Created"] [Text] A new Emergency Situation Service was created in the republic in September of this year. What is this successor to Civil Defense like? That was the topic covered in a conversation with Colonel Anatoliy Kochug, deputy minister of defense and chief of the Department of Civil Defense and Emergency Situations. [Verin] Systems for the defense of the population and the economy have a rich history. Nevertheless in the most highly developed countries of the world they came into being and developed mainly after the Second World War. Actually that took place in the USSR as well as a system of nationwide measures conducted in peacetime and wartime to ensure protection of the population against the use of modern means of destruction. What is the Civil Defense like today? [Kochug] Civil Defense is constantly developing its field of activity and expanding, and presently its task consists not so much of the defense of the population under conditions created by the change in modern means of destruction, as conceived by most of our countrymen, associating it only with the shelter and gas mask. Under conditions of modern production with its concentration of vast amounts of energy and creation and utilization of a great number of materials, including some that are dangerous to man and his environment, there was a sharp increase in the probability of accidents and catastrophes. Natural disasters, which bring destruction of human life along with great economic losses, are constantly making themselves felt. The 1968 earthquakes in Moldova the Chernobyl catastrophe at the atomic electric power station that same year, the 1988 earthquake in Armenia, and the catastrophic flood in central regions of the Republic of Moldova serve as sad examples. There were 28 emergency situations caused by fires, leakage of poisonous substances, explosions in residences, food poisoning, railway accidents, and other events occurring in just 10 months of this year in the republic. As a result 11 people were killed, seven wounded, and seven more poisoned. [Verin] Consequently life itself is setting forth the tasks of ensuring the protection of the population together with physical assets of the republic against industrial accidents and catastrophes as well as ecological and natural disasters? [Kochug] Absolutely correct. We do need realistic help in the form of a legislative base and legal back-up of measures for prevention (and a decrease in the consequences) of emergency situations. Such activity itself, however, is conducted through the creation of new organizations within existing structures of state administration. We believe that the establishment of the Department of Civil Defense and Emergency Situations within the Ministry of Defense was a timely measure. This determined the role and place of Civil Defense in the overall scheme of state organs of power. Other questions of considerable importance are also being resolved at the same time. For instance, the presently existing non-military Civil Defense units are ineffective in handling consequences of accidents, catastrophes, and natural disasters. [Verin] Can we expect a time when the process involving adoption of the laws will be completed? [Kochug] Yes, the extraordinary events that are taking place both within the republic and beyond its borders, compel us to be vigilant. The interaction of society with the environment and preservation of the biosphere for the benefit of the people has now become one of the most pressing problems. Under conditions created by political instability, a sharp decline in the rates of production, the economic chaos, lack of necessary laws (the disregard of those that were adopted), as well as the irresponsibility of power structures and managers of a number of ministries, government departments, enterprises, organizations, establishments, and national economic facilities it is all the more important to assign primary importance to the problem of Civil Defense in our republic on the territory of which almost all types of emergency situations of industrial and natural kinds are possible. Moldova is in a seismically hazardous zone where the force of an earthquake could reach eight or nine points. In the republic there are eight atomic electric power stations at distances of 150--400 kilometers with different kinds of reactors, similar to those at Chernobyl which are destroyed easily in case of an accident while fuel is scattered over large areas. There are around 70 chemically dangerous facilities in operation in the republic which employ about 20,000 (with over half-a-million people living in their proximity). Thousands of tonnes of highly toxic and other explosive and flammable substances are transported by truck and rail in the republic. Hydraulic developments along Dniester and Prut rivers threaten around 170 populated points with flooding of more than 1,000 square kilometers with a population of more than 160,000. The indicated factors have repeatedly created situations that were close to being emergencies. [Verin] Last week your department conducted a check of the state of Civil Defense and training together with the Ministry of Transport of the republic. What was its purpose? [Kochug] Emergency situations should be regarded as phenomena conditioned by various factors because of which it is necessary to prepare ahead of time for their manifestation while working out and implementing measures aimed at their neutralization and lessening of harmful consequences. Therefore with consideration of the circumstances which might develop on the territory of the republic as a result of an emergency situation we tested the capability of the ministry to resolve these tasks on the engineering, radiation-chemical, and medical-biological level, along with other elements. At the same time we conducted a series of practical measures in the process of which management at various levels of the ministry and the personnel of the units obtained and consolidated required experience. I will note that railway workers demonstrated a good training level and the proper understanding of established tasks, even though the concept of the exercises required them to function in a practical manner. Naturally, the deficiencies revealed in the course of our joint work must be eliminated rapidly but on the whole this ministry has good workers devoted to their work and to duty. [Verin] Colonel, what practical steps are presently being taken by the Department to prepare for the consequences of emergency situations? [Kochug] In accordance with a government decision we are creating five emergency rescue units. At present we are faced with complex and important tasks involved in housing these units, establishing military order, the field regulations, supply of equipment and specialized gear for them, as well as creation of the necessary training-material and a methodological base making it possible to undertake fruitful training in order to be constantly prepared to resolve tasks confronting the fighters-rescuers. Adoption of the law on Civil Defense in the Republic of Moldova is on the agenda. The draft of that law has now been prepared and was submitted to a parliamentary committee together with a series of statutes and decrees, and other documents are also being prepared. [Verin] Thank you. Now we know who we must rely on in the most complex situations.
