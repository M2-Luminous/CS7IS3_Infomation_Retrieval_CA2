An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told this here today by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the conclusion of talks with Mikhail Popov, his Moldovan counterpart. From Moscow's point of view, the Russian minister added, as far as deciding this particular question was concerned, it might be a matter of days, or even hours, rather than weeks. Now, said Kozyrev, everything depends on how fast we receive a reply signal from Brussels to activate both the framework document and the Russia-NATO program, whose main principles were presented to the NATO leadership by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. According to Kozyrev, the program of cooperation with NATO is a very full of documents, which reflects Russia's importance in international affairs and the specific nature of its relations with the NATO, "without any mutual vetoes or surprises." The Moldovan minister told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that his country, which signed the framework document in March of this year, also plans to submit to NATO in the near future a program of individual cooperation. Talking about the advantages Moldova will gain from participating in the Partnership for Peace programme, Popov noted in particular that if the republic finds itself under threat from outside, it will be able to hold consultations with NATO the in the interest of strengthening stability and national security.
