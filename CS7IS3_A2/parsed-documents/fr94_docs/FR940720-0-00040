Licensees who qualify as small entities under the provisions of ยง171.16(c) and who submit a completed NRC Form 526 are not subject to the $170 additional charge. 11. Section 171.17 is revised to read as follows: ยง171.17 Proration. Annual fees will be prorated for NRC licensees as follows: (a) Reactors. The annual fee for reactors (power or nonpower) that are subject to fees under this part and are granted a license to operate on or after October 1 of a FY is prorated on the basis of the number of days remaining in the FY. Thereafter, the full fee is due and payable each subsequent FY. Licensees who have requested amendment to withdraw operating authority permanently during the FY will be prorated based on the number of days during the FY the license was in effect before the possession only license was issued or the license was terminated. (b) Materials licenses (including fuel cycle licenses). The annual fee for a materials license that is subject to fees under this part and issued on or after October 1 of the FY is prorated on the basis of when the NRC issues the new license. New licenses issued during the period October 1 through March 31 of the FY will be assessed one-half the annual fee for that FY. New licenses issued on or after April 1 of the FY will not be assessed an annual fee for that FY. Thereafter, the full fee is due and payable each subsequent FY. The annual fee will be prorated for licenses for which a termination request or a request for a POL has been received on or after October 1 of a FY on the basis of when the application for termination or POL is received by the NRC provided the licensee permanently ceased licensed activities during the specified period. Licenses for which applications for termination or POL are filed during the period October 1 through March 31 of the FY are assessed one-half the annual fee for the applicable category(ies) for that FY. Licenses for which applications for termination or POL are filed on or after April 1 of the FY are assessed the full annual fee for that FY. 12. In section 171.19, paragraphs (b) and (c) are revised to read as follows: ยง171.19 Payment. * * * * * (b) For FY 1994 through FY 1998, the Commission will adjust the fourth quarterly bill for operating power reactors and certain materials licensees to recover the full amount of the revised annual fee. If the amounts collected in the first three quarters exceed the amount of the revised annual fee, the overpayment will be refunded. All other licensees, or holders of a certificate, registration, or approval of a QA program will be sent a bill for the full amount of the annual fee upon publication of the final rule. Payment is due on the effective date of the final rule and interest accrues from the effective date of the final rule. However, interest will be waived if payment is received within 30 days from the effective date of the final rule. (c) For FYs 1994 through 1998, annual fees in the amount of $100,000 or more and described in the Federal Register notice pursuant to ยง171.13, must be paid in quarterly installments of 25 percent as billed by the NRC. The quarters begin on October 1, January 1, April 1, and July 1 of each fiscal year. Annual fees of less than $100,000 must be paid once a year as billed by the NRC. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 12th day of July, 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. James M. Taylor, Executive Director for Operations.
