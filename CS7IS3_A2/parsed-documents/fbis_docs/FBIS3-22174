In the recent past, various state institutions have made attempts to overcome this backwardness, but despite this we still have no national strategy backed up by legislation and no specialized organization for controlling radioactive waste. Meanwhile, the waste is accumulating at the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, and the amounts of low- and medium-level waste already exceed 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes. In recent years high-level waste nuclear fuel has been added to these deposits. Debates have been going on in the press as to whether this high- level waste should be stored at Kozloduy for 40-50 years or whether it should be sent abroad for reprocessing in return for payment. In either case, the high-level waste produced after the fuel has been treated will most likely be buried in Bulgaria, for which we will need a deep underground storage site. In 1991, the Council of Ministers asked the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences to develop a concept for a national radioactive waste storage depot. A large team of experts was formed from seven Academy of Sciences institutes, who were joined by specialists from Sofia University, the University of Mining and Geology, the Committee on Geology and Mineral Resources, the Committee for Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, and other departments. The end result of the study showed that sites do exist in Bulgaria that are suitable for constructing stores close to the surface for low- and medium-level waste with a comparatively short life, which, after treatment and packing in special containers, does not present any particular danger to the surrounding environment. As far as high-level waste is concerned, it is impossible to give a clearcut answer at this stage, because such waste takes tens of thousands of years to decay and the requirements relating to its storage deep underground are exceptionally stringent. The studies and investigations carried out by Bulgarian Academy of Sciences have produced 56 scientific papers, the main results of which were submitted in summary form to the interested government departments. We now face a far more demanding and difficult task that must be fulfilled without delay, namely to complete additional studies and investigations of the most promising prospective storage sites and then select a few of them for detailed investigation. Such detailed investigations are extremely expensive (in the United States, Switzerland, Italy, and other countries they cost tens of millions of dollars), and for this reason it is vitally important to select the fewest possible prospective sites. It takes over 10 years to investigate, design, and construct a storage depot for low- and medium-level waste, and 20 to 30 years to construct one for high-level radioactive waste. We therefore have no time to lose, and should immediately begin the next stage of completing the task on the basis of the Academy of Sciences report. Naturally, this cannot be achieved without active government intervention. In the United States, the commission on the problem of a national radioactive waste storage depot was chaired by the President himself. In Bulgaria too, the head of state should oversee the solving of this problem, in view of the negative reaction that may be expected from the local population and the risk of departmental interests exerting excessive influence. The responsible departments already display extreme secretiveness regarding information on contacts with prospective foreign partners, on the allocation of funds, and the conditions for their use, which is evidently connected with rivalry in controlling these funds. There is a real danger that the money that we will borrow from foreign creditors will be frittered away in the departmental budgets or appropriated in one form or another by foreign companies without any major work being completed. This is why we insist that the government should most actively address the problem of finding a storage site for the radioactive waste from our nuclear plant and adopt concrete decisions on a national strategy and legislation, on setting up an independent agency for controlling radioactive waste, and on pressing issues relating to further investigations and research into designing the storage depot. Bulgaria has indeed delayed far too long in resolving the radioactive waste problem. However, we still have at our disposal a considerable reserve of competent scientists and specialists, the geology of our land has been thoroughly surveyed, and all this forms a good basis for making speedy progress. In Western countries with advanced nuclear power industries, one basic principle in developing a national strategy is not to leave succeeding generations with any economic or ecological problems arising from the underground storage of radioactive waste. In Bulgaria, on the other hand, we have tacitly adopted a different ``strategy,'' according to which our generation will merely consume the nuclear energy, while the following generations will have to solve the problem of dealing with the radioactive waste from nuclear power production.
