Among them are the OAS general assembly in Belem in June, the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member countries conference to define its institutions during the second half of the year, the Rio Group presidential summit in October, and the meeting of South Atlantic countries. The events that occurred earlier this year include Mercosur and Rio Group meetings with EU foreign ministers; the visit of Douglas Hurd, British secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, and other British secretaries; and the visit of U.S. Vice President Al Gore and other U.S. officials. All this reveals the increasing involvement of Brazil in the world economy and the current global and regional characteristics of trade. Last week Brazilian diplomacy achieved a very important objective: Its proposal to create a South American free trade zone (SAFTA) was accepted in principle by Brazil's Mercosur partners (Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay). Events like this, and the recent opening of a general consulate in Nagoya, Japan, to assist the "deka-seguis" -- some 200,000 Brazilian citizens of Japanese descent who emigrated to Japan seeking jobs -- shows that Brazilian diplomacy is seeking to involve Brazil in the international economy and to change its profile from a country receiving immigrants to a country exporting workers. Brazilian foreign policy has been becoming more pragmatic and integrating more with the private universe of the economy. The Foreign Ministry recently organized two entrepreneurial missions -- one to Asia and South Africa and one to Mozambique. Brazilian ambassadors before the GATT and the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) increased their involvement with entrepreneurs, informing them of the evolution of global and regional trade negotiations. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has kept legislators fully briefed on Brazilian commitments with its partners. - Nuclear Policy: The Foreign Ministry persuaded Congress to approve all its agreements on nuclear policy during this semester. The only item still pending is a draft bill on controls on exports of sensitive materials and technologies, an essential step prior to Brazil joining the missile technology control regime (MTCR). Contrary to what was done by Mexico -- which withdrew this year from the Group of 77 (formed by 126 developing countries) after accepting a preferential option in North America through its participation in NAFTA with the United States and Canada -- Brazil is not considering withdrawing from any association. - International Order: Ronaldo Sardenberg, Brazilian ambassador to the United Nations recalls: "Participants have increased in the area of international order. We have the Group of 77, the Latin American and Caribbean group (33 countries, all of which participate in UN organizations), Mercosur, the South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone, the Group of 15 (most important developing countries), the Portuguese-speaking community of countries, just to mention some." He added: "From the diplomatic point of view, it is necessary to participate in all of these groups because they provide the bases for positions and give us better negotiating conditions." The ambassador observed that the Group of 77 "is a factor of international negotiation for Brazil. The reform of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) -- a global environment fund -- is being negotiated between the Group of 77 and developing countries. There is also an electoral aspect to all this: Brazil was elected to participate in different organs." He added: "Brazil does not have a Greta Garbo complex. We do not want to be alone. Our international style is that of a moderate country trying to find solutions to different problems. We have been on the UN Security Council more often than any other country (as a nonpermanent member). - UN Security Council: Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who recently met with his French, British, and German counterparts, usually tells his guests that "Brazilian credentials are either perceived immediately or never." The country is campaigning unostentatiously for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, a decision that could be made next year during the organization's 50th anniversary. Amorim notes: "We share borders with 10 countries. We have a large population, a large territory, and a presence in the international arena that is unsurpassed by any developing country. We help international organizations reach agreements. We have not been to war with any of our neighbors in the past 120 years. We have a history of peace that is matched by very few countries." He added: "If Brazil becomes a member of the UN Security Council it will be on its own merit, not to represent Latin America." - Drug Trafficking: Brazil will participate in UN international peace-keeping forces as it did in Suez (Gaza Strip) and in the Congo. Sardenberg believes Brazil will send a battalion, an organized force, to countries like Mozambique. In the military field, the idea that the Armed Forces should not participate in drug enforcement actions seems to have been consolidated. - Africa: Brazilian diplomats hail their position regarding South Africa. Two years ago Itamaraty upgraded the Brazilian presence in South Africa by sending an ambassador. Brazil thus anticipated the end of the "apartheid" and currently has good business perspectives with Nelson Mandela's government. Amorim recently asked Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero for $20 million to finance Brazilian company projects in Mozambique, the economic situation of which Itamaraty expects to improve with the democratization of South Africa. - Eastern Europe: Brazil has been less aggressive in this region. The Brazilian foreign minister said: "They are more active than us. We must react to this," adding, "I would like to send a business mission to Central Europe. Trade relations with those countries must be reestablished." Amorim said he will send the Itamaraty secretary general to Moscow at the end of the year because the situation in Russia "is stabilizing and this will open up trade opportunities." The Foreign Ministry is planning to open an embassy in Kiev (Ukraine) still during Itamar's administration. Franco has already authorized the new embassy, the only outstanding matter is the decree to create it. - Mercosur: Brazil is actively helping to intensify trade relations between Mercosur and the EU. Celso Amorim has said relations with France are intensifying. "I was the first Latin American personality to address the French Senate," said the minister who was also the first Brazilian Foreign Minister to visit the reunified Germany.
