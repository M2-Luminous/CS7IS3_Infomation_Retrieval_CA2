This CCD camera production line is a joint venture between the Huanan plant, a subsidiary of the Armaments Industry Corporation, and Hong Kong's Xianda [7359 6671] Science & Technology Ltd. Annual single-shift production capacity for this late-80s-level all-automatic SMT (surface mount technology) production line is 50,000. Since the line's initial operation on 28 March 1992, almost 6,000 B&W and color CCD cameras have been manufactured and sold at home and abroad; newly added value has totaled almost 10 million yuan and the 2,400-odd exported CCD cameras have earned US$430,000 in foreign exchange.
