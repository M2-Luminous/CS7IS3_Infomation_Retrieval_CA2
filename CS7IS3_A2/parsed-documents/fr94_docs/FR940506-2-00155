FR940506-2-00155 FR940506-2-00083 By order dated March 19, 1993 (HCAR No. 25762) (``March Order''), the Applicants were authorized to: (1) increase the amount of Construction Financing to $160 million (2) increase the maximum amount, excluding advances, as defined below, of the aggregate equity contributions to the Partnership by JV Sub and Energy Sub to $32 million, constituting a maximum equity contribution equal to 20% of the amount to be financed; and (3) make, directly or indirectly through Energy, loans, open account advances, or additional equity contributions to the Partnership in an aggregate amount not to exceed $85 million (``Advances''). By order dated January 31, 1994 (HCAR No. 25983), the Commission authorized a change in the description of the Project and the formation of CSW Mulberry. In addition, the Commission authorized the investment of a new limited partner (``New Limited Partner'') in the Partnership in lieu of the term loan financing for the Project and the issuance of corporate guaranties by the Applicants or stand-by letters of credit with the Applicants as account party in an amount not to exceed $50 million, such guaranties or letters of credit to support payment obligations of the Partnership required by the provider of third party financing for the Project or fuel suppliers, fuel transportation or other third parties under various project agreements. The Applicants now propose that Energy Sub form a special purpose wholly owned subsidiary to be known as CSW Mulberry II, Inc. (``Mulberry LP Sub''). Mulberry LP Sub would be incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with an authorized capital of up to 1,000 shares of common stock without par value. In exchange for an assignment from Energy Sub to Mulberry LP Sub of all of Energy Sub's right, title and interest in and to CSW Mulberry, Energy Sub would subscribe to all of Mulberry LP Sub's common stock. It is further proposed that the Joint Venture form a special purpose wholly owned subsidiary to be known as Polk Power GP II, Inc. (``Mulberry GP Sub''). Mulberry GP Sub would be incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with an authorized capital of up to 1,000 shares of common stock without par value. In exchange for an assignment from the Joint Venture to Mulberry GP Sub of all of the Joint Venture's right, title and interest in and to JV Sub, the Joint Venture would subscribe to all of Mulberry GP Sub's common stock. In the event that Mulberry LP Sub and Mulberry GP Sub are formed pursuant to the authority sought, the Applicants request authority to include Mulberry LP Sub and Mulberry GP Sub in the flow of funds for equity contributions, open account advances and intercompany loans on the terms and in the manner authorized by the prior orders of the Commission in this matter, above. The Applicants request the authority to form Mulberry LP Sub and Mulberry GP Sub in order to limit the liability of Energy Sub and the Joint Venture and aid in the procurement of the Term Financing. It is anticipated that a pledge of the stock of CSW Mulberry and JV Sub by their holders, Energy Sub and the Joint Venture, respectively, which was required in connection with the Construction Financing, will be required in connection with the Term Financing. The requested authority is desirable to limit the liability of Energy Sub and the Joint Venture, which have acquired interests in several other partnerships and corporations that are unaffiliated with the Project. If Energy Sub and the Joint Venture make such pledges and the Partnership defaults in its repayment obligations under the terms of such Construction Financing or Term Financing, interests of Energy Sub and the Joint Venture that are not associated with the Project could be adversely affected by the actions taken by the provider(s) of such Construction Financing or Term Financing.
