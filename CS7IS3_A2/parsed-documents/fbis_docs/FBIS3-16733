[Correspondent Dukesh Baimbetov] Today, after a meeting at the Republic's Ministry of Defense, the U.S. military delegation headed by William Perry was received by Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev. As is known, during the recent visit of Kazakhstan's leader to the United States the sides signed a number of documents between the two countries on economic, political, and military issues. President Clinton and Vice President Gore have charged me with paying particular attention to the practical implementation of these programs, Perry said. Today, in particular, issues were discussed regarding the United States in the conversion of defense industry enterprises in Kazakhstan, inspecting the territory of the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground, and the allocation of aid to its population. Incidentally, the first aid has already arrived. The Americans brought with them very valuable diagnostic equipment and medicines. They also spoke about tripartite space cooperation between Kazakhstan, the United States, and Russia. [Begin Nazarbayev recording] There is nothing to delay on the part of the Kazakh side. At the present time, we are holding talks with Russia. We hope that we will sign these agreements, in which all the issues will be agreed upon, this month. We have reached agreement both with the United States and with Russia that Kazakhstan will be compensated for the cost of the highly enriched uranium that is in the warheads.
