After the blanket assessments to the effect that the crisis of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia began in Kosovo with the conflict between Kosovo Albanians and the Yugoslav authorities and that it will also end there, the political prognosis according to which "Kosovo's turn is coming up" is becoming increasingly widespread. This latter notion is convincing, if for no other reason because of the passage of time and the weight and ripeness of the problem. The fact that the time to solve the problem of the southern Serbian province is coming up is indicated by the visit to Belgrade and Pristina arranged by Douglas Hogg, British secretary of state for foreign affairs, on 5 and 6 May. The British diplomat departed. Speculation by commentators, based primarily on his comment that Albanians must be given broad autonomy within the framework of Serbia, has already run full course. Hogg's visit also served as an agent for circulating "information" about how negotiating teams of the Serbian authorities and of the Kosovo Albanians have already been formed. This "information" is refuted by the very "composition" of the negotiating teams, which contain, for example, the deputy prime minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Zeljko Simic, and the chairman of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), Vojislav Kostunica, who cannot reconcile himself with the authorities. Reports on the negotiators presented by Radio Cologne and the Pristina Albanian-language weekly KOHA, which were also carried by Belgrade media, are classic "canards" from a journalistic viewpoint. Their motivation, however, is purely political in nature and contains the message that it is time to move beyond the deadlock once and for all. This is because after Hogg's visit, which provoked a bit of political agitation, Kosovo is returning to its prior state, which means that the unrecognized, self-proclaimed republic of Kosovo--recognized only by Albania--and the Republic of Serbia are functioning in parallel in the same territory. Moreover, both of them are trying to assert their rights and avoid obligations if they can. The Serbian state has imposed its police structure and left it up to the Albanians to organize autonomous education, culture and sports, social and administrative institutions, and even autonomous tax authorities, but without neglecting to collect the taxes owed to it. The Albanians, although they ignore Serbian administration wherever they can, do not refuse rights to health care and hospital treatment. In the area of national defense, it appears that a tacit agreement has been reached--the Albanians do not join the armed forces of the country that they do not regard as their own, while the Armed Forces of Yugoslavia (VJ) does not need disloyal guardians of territory. That is how two national communities live in parallel in Kosovo. Now and then, they meet only in the area of business interests. And thanks to those interests, at the "Businessmen's Club" in Pristina one can learn from the conversation of a pair of new businessmen, newly rich Serbs and Albanians, that they are fascinated with the flights of "various airplanes and DC 9's and DC 10's" and that in such airplanes "you do not even feel that you are being transported and you can comfortably have drinks on them." They were on the trail of material interest, and in so doing the Albanian is not bothered by the fact that the "Businessmen's Club" is a Serb bar, just as Serbs are not bothered by doing business in Albanian bars. They differ in that the Albanian pays taxes to two legal states, both the "Republic of Kosovo" and the Republic of Serbia. But the Albanian has more money and is generally a merchant or manufacturer, while the Serb, thanks to the absolute domination of Serbs in the bureaucratic structure, is most often an intermediary with the state, and if he holds a position, then he is an intermediary with himself and takes a commission, or a bribe. Adjustment in Process In other fields, Kosovo's Serb and Albanian worlds seem irreconcilable. In the Albanian pastry shop "Elida" and the Serb cafe "Donatelo," establishments in the "Boro i Ramiz" sports hall separated only by a corridor, these worlds, relaxing in almost the same atmosphere, regard each other with indifference. But that is a story that has already been told. The two worlds of Kosovo live their lives in the political cocoons of "the independent Republic of Kosovo" and "unified Serbia." Postponing the political conflict, albeit only conflict in the form of dialogue, gives rise to illusions, but also to tension. "This is the status quo, a balance of fear, a state of neither war nor peace, and it will continue as long as it suits both sides," says Skeljzen Malici, ex-politician and founder and former chairman of the Social Democratic Party. Malici, who is now a journalist, repeats the theory that the Kosovo war is being waged in Bosnia, that the Serbs in Bosnia, "in fighting for their own ethnic rights, are also fighting for the ethnic rights of Albanians. Because if they had enough territorial jurisdiction in Bosnia, perhaps Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic would agree to a formula of broad autonomy--territorial, political, cultural--and that in practice would lead to independence for Kosovo." The common platform of all significant parties who captured seats in the parliament of the "Republic of Kosovo," which has yet to constituted, is an independent Kosovo, but it appears that a consensus has also been reached on the view that such a thing is unrealistic for now. Such a position can also be heard in the leading party of Kosovo Albanians, the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo (DSK), which received 76 percent of the votes in the Albanian-only elections on 24 May 1991. However, mention of the broad autonomy guaranteed to Albanians under the 1974 SFRY Constitution is true heresy, and immediately after the visit by the British Foreign Office official with the leader of the Kosovo Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova, the DSK Information Center tried to relativize the clear suggestion by the high-ranking guest that the solution for Kosovo should be sought in autonomy on a wide scale and within the framework of Serbia. Dr. Fehmi Agani, the vice chairman of the DSK and Ibrahim Rugova's right-hand man, said in an interview with VREME that the British diplomat is still in the process of adjusting his views. However, there are still no results of that adjustment. Another Albanian ex-politician, Veton Suroi, the founder and former chairman of the Parliamentary Party and now publisher of the weekly KOHA, rejects the solution in the 1974 Constitution, but for entirely different reasons. "We have gone beyond 1974 and must be more creative than Kardelj," Suroi says succinctly. The definition of Kosovo under the Constitution of 20 years ago as a point of conflict, but also of encounter, between Serb and Albanian interests is an unpleasant framework for talks for the Serb side as well. The chairman of the provincial committee of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), Vojislav Zivkovic, elaborates on the part according to which the province is defined as an integral part of Serbia. "Kosovo is not an open question; rather, the problem is how to persuade the Albanians to sit down and talk. When Europe says, as Great Britain has done, that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia, I am convinced that the majority of Albanians will ultimately accept that," says Zivkovic. The problem with Serb politicians--as indeed with Albanian ones if they are in positions of power--is that their authorities are very minimal, so that the political discourse is reduced to the well-known approach of justifying the national strategies contained in political slogans. With the prefix "ex" they are authentic, but they exert no great amount of political influence. Momcilo Trajkovic, the former deputy prime minister of Kosovo and then the SPS deputy heading the departmental group on solving Kosovo's problems, and then a renegade from the party and founder of the Social Democratic Party, will say, not without cynicism, that he "cannot believe that Serbian President Milosevic declared that `there is no problem' with giving autonomy to the Albanians." "Milosevic has no right to say such a thing, and I really doubt that he could have said that publicly. That would have meant the beginning of the end of his authority, which is in fact based on Kosmet [Kosovo and Metohija]," says Trajkovic. He believes that the Albanians' contribution to solving the Kosovo problem is to publicly renounce pretensions to a Kosovo republic, while the Serbs should recognize that Albanians "are here in real numbers, in order to create the trust necessary to live together and permit talks on the organization of that life." Serb Differences In the last election campaign, Trajkovic ran under the slogan "Vote for the ones who have linked their destiny to Kosovo and Metohija" and lost. The former SPS figure and subsequent social democrat has now linked his destiny to the "Ratar" collective farm in Laplje Selo, where he is director, and it could be said that this latest role suits him. With pride he emphasizes that all 1,100 hectares of the farm have been planted, saying: "That is how to fight for Serb land in Kosovo." Reflecting on the times to come, Trajkovic says that Serbia has done nothing in this interregnum to keep the Serbs from being outvoted again. He regards the civic state as a solution; however, in order to achieve that, the national state model must be given "free rein." He concludes that this is a process. The political biography of the current director of the "Ratar" collective is somewhat characteristic of the present-day Serb divisions in Kosovo. Trajkovic, who began his political career in the 1980's by standing up against the "autonomist policy" of the (Serb) Kosovo government, is accused of being an autonomist. He responds in kind, reminding the current holders of power where they were and whom they supported 10 years ago. Thus, the Serb political scene in the province is divided into two types of autonomists, which leads us to the current Serb division into "newcomers" and "old-timers," whereby the "Trajkovic school of politics" corresponds to the old-timers. According to this terminology, the current okrug government is in the hands of the newcomers. Although it is impossible to strictly categorize the types of political thought, it is indeed possible to establish a fundamental difference. The group designated "old-timers" supports a practical policy that would integrate Albanians into the structures of provincial government. "They must be given something, because they make up 90 percent of the population here. They will participate in government sooner or later, and for that reason there must be a mechanism to keep the Serbs from being outvoted," is the private reflection of one Kosovo politician, a member of the ruling Serb party. His name remains "underground," as does the reflection through which he risks being labeled an "autonomist," i.e., "old-timer." In the Albanian political bloc there is discord not concerning goals, but rather concerning strategy. No one questions Dr. Ibrahim Rugova's authority, and the strength and influence of his DSK are not questioned either, but there is criticism of his monopoly on power, the attitude of some important Albanian intellectuals outside the party, and the politically passive approach. The most vocal critics are academician Redzep Cosja, an ideologist of the Albanian national question, and Adem Demaci, chairman of the Forum for Human Rights, political dissident and longtime political prisoner, and publisher of the journal FORUM. Demaci is known as a person ready to make political concessions, but also as a harsh critic of the DSK and its structures for their lack of resolve in defending the achieved Albanian institutions that the authorities have abolished: the Albanological Institute, the Kosovo Academy of Science and Art, and Albanian-language newspapers and journals. During Douglas Hogg's visit, Adem Demaci was in Italy, from where he sent word via Television Tirana that Kosovo is relying too much on the foreign element and that it is the duty of "those concerned with politics to seek out and search for various ways to solve the problem. It is not enough to say that our option is this and that, and thus to stand and watch.... I think we have had more than enough of Albanians talking among themselves. It is very necessary that Albanians in fact speak with Serbia, because like it or not, Serbia is a factor with which we must reckon, with which we must come to terms," Demaci said. "Honorable Solution" At the DSK congress that will almost certainly be held in late May or early June after several months of postponement, no spectacular changes in the party--and thus in Albanian policy as well--are expected. Almost no attention was given to the report from Tirana that Dr. Ibrahim Rugova and his host, Albanian President Sali Berisha, expressed their support for mediation of the Serbo-Albanian dispute by a third party. That report casts something of a shadow of legitimacy over the maximalist goal of a Kosovo republic. It also holds out the promise that the Albanian side has something to offer other than political maximalism, which "is not realistically feasible at this moment." In the trench warfare--fortunately, only of political options--between an independent Kosovo and a Serbia "that will be unified or will not exist at all," it seems that the real moment is raising an almost purely terminological problem: In what sort of lexical foil should concessions be wrapped while still emerging as virtuous before voters who have been promised the much-repeated slogans in this article. The chairman of the Kosovo Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, Dr. Gazmend Pulja, proposes a federal republic of Kosovo within Yugoslavia as an "honorable solution" that would not threaten the territorial integrity of the FRY and that would allow the Serbs to preserve their political and practical interests. "It is not natural to aspire to a lower level of constitutional structure. Kosovo was a constituent unit of the federation, and the international community cannot accept a curtailment of the rights of 2 million Albanians when 500,000 Montenegrins have a republic," Pulja explains. Naturally, the shadow of possible war always hangs over Kosovo, but nevertheless it is increasingly pallid. Partially because many, such as Skeljzen Malici, feel that the war option was used up in Croatia and then in Bosnia, partially because the prevalent opinion is that Serbia is not capable of waging war on several fronts, that its wartime ambitions have been exhausted, especially under strong surveillance by the international community, and, among other things, because no one is ready to risk a war that would inevitably spread to the entire Balkan peninsula. In this sense, the possibility of partitioning Kosovo is considered completely superficially to be, by necessity, a war option. Malici thinks that in that case there would clearly be war as an alibi for demarcation. "The Serbs and Albanians could not do that on their own, without international mediation." Skeljzen Malici illustrates the unconvincing nature of the war option by pointing to the military weakness of Albania, as well as the unwillingness of the United States of America to support its militarily weak ally. Besides the parallel system and parallel life, all in the same territory, the Serbs and Albanians are also demonstrating a common infirmity and inability to sit down at the negotiating table without international mediation. Naturally, this third party would also have to bear responsibility for the results of any concessions, because their political figures are not willing to do so. Nevertheless, something is changing in Kosovo. Fields left uncultivated for decades are now greener than they have ever been. The "ordinary" Albanians and Serbs regard this land that they are working as their own, and there are no problems whatsoever here; such problems invariably arise when the question of who land in Kosovo belongs to is shifted to the level of politics. Problems also emerge when the state raises an issue like land redistribution, which is already very delicate, because in Kosovo each normal issue has specific Kosovo deviations.
