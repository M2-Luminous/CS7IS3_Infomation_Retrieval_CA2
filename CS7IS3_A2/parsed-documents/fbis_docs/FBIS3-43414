Shots, volleys, and explosions continued almost uninterruptedly at 1900 GMT. No information has so far been obtained from any official source on the cause or exact location of the shooting. For security reasons, it has not been possible to go to the area. A soldier contacted by telephone at the RIT camp refused to comment and hung up immediately, shouting: "There is no one around." According to an informed source, there had been reports that Head of State General Gnassingbe Eyadema was at 1900 in the company of Prime Minister Joseph Koffigoh at his private Lome II residence, a few kilometers from the camp. His official residence where he normally spends the night is located within the RIT barracks. As soon as the first shots were heard, panic gripped inhabitants of the capital and the streets got deserted within a matter of minutes as the night began to fall. In March last year, Gen. Eyadema narrowly escaped an attack launched by a group of armed men against his RIT camp residence. The government then blamed that operation on the opposition in exile.
