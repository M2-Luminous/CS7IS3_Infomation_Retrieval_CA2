This is the first of the weekly batches to be forwarded to the mining regions during this month. A wave of miners' strikes first swept the country in the middle of last year - the colliers protested against delayed wage packets and lack of state support for the industry which was fighting for survival. The situation repeated itself in March of 1994, this time around it culminated in the picketing of the houses of government at the end of the month. The miners demanded an immediate repayment of the budget debt for the last quarter of 1993 and the first quarter of 1994, which by that time had amounted to 800 billion roubles. They also demanded that the customers pay off their accumulated debt of more than one trillion roubles. As a result of negotiations between the colliers' labour union and the government it was decided that Moscow would pay the industry 300 billion roubles a week beginning on April 13. "It will take a few days before the money reaches the miners," said Vitaliy Budko, chairman of the Rosugleprof Labour Union. This will add tension to the already grave situation in some mining areas. For example, forty miners refuse to come up from the Mayskaya mine in Chelyabinsk region, demanding that they be paid wages for work done in January, February and March.
