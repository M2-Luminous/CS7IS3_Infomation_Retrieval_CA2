All of these events have shocked the Mexican people, and this is why I want to talk to you so we can reflect on this together and so I can convey my feelings to you about these events -- events that have forced us to come together and decisively act in favor of the nation. I know the Mexican people are convinced that violence is not the way to resolve differences, remedy difficulties, or promote personal or group interests. The path we have embarked upon is one of dialogue and solidarity, and it is one that will not be interrupted. I am committed to complying with the laws and to fighting violence, specifically impunity, kidnapping, and drug trafficking. All of these forms of violence have caused great damage to other countries, and they seek to harm our nation as well. This is why this is the best time to reassert our commitment to Mexico. To combat the threats of criminals and organized gangs against public security, I have created a Coordinating Board that falls within the jurisdiction of the president of the republic. Through this new organization, we will redouble the efficiency of the Attorney General's Office to fight crime. As head of this organization, I have appointed -- by virtue of the powers bestowed on me by Article 89 of the Constitution -- a very prominent and experienced jurist with a clear determination to implement the law. In light of incidents that seek to generate fear and mistrust, the state's response is overwhelming. No one should question our firm resolve to enforce the law vis-a-vis criminals and gangs. The greatest problem, however, lies in existing divisions, baseless conjectures, and discouragement, which is precisely what the criminals want. Our response must be clear, firm, and committed or we will place peace and the de jure state at a disadvantage. In the face of rumors and uncertainty, we will brandish truth and information. The government is adapting and will continue to adapt to the de jure state as the primary mechanism for justice and peaceful coexistence. We will continue waging a battle against gangs and drug trafficking in all forms and against impunity with greater strength and efficiency. We will also continue waging a battle with all the rigor of the law and the strength of our national unity against these criminals who constitute Mexico's true enemies. We also will make the greatest efforts possible in seeking a peaceful solution to the Chiapas conflict. We will keep our promises, and we will continue giving all our support to the peace commissioner. The murder of Colosio will not go unpunished. The special assistant prosecutor has my complete support to conduct a thorough investigation to enable the judicial branch to find those who are responsible. We will continue legally and untiringly opposing those who stir up violence in Mexico. This campaign requires respect for decisions made by our courts, because only they can issue sentences and impose penalties on lawbreakers. Only our courts can punish those who violate our rights. Moreover, justice does not permit sentencing without due process or retaliation. Fellow Mexicans, In light of the recent violent events, we, the Mexican people, cannot and should not forget the many positive events, actions, and circumstances that, in recent years, have transformed Mexico into a nation characterized by greater opportunities, international respect, and, in particular, greater justice for the Mexican people. This will undoubtedly be the best legacy we will be leaving for future generations. As a result, we must persevere with the changes proposed and keep making progress in the areas of respect and dignity of individuals, Indian groups, communities, and citizens in general. In response to the question of what we will do, I believe all Mexicans are already doing something. For instance, we have intensified dialogue -- the one taking place between the government secretary and the political parties is a case in point -- and we will keep transforming our pluralism into strength and our differences into starting points for new democratic encounters. We will continue promoting closer ties between authorities and communities and work to reduce the pitfalls that those who oppose Mexico's progress want to exploit. We will consolidate our economic efforts to create more opportunities. We will continue implementing measures to accelerate the economic recovery and, in particular, we will continue investing, timely and efficiently, those resources earmarked for social expenditures. These expenditures are the highest they have ever been. They are expenditures that support the people, communities, and families -- the most valuable things in our nation. I know the economic situation worries families. I will increase the determination and the efforts to open more economic opportunities that you need. There will be more actions in favor of the people's economy [economia popular]. To stimulate the countryside, we will continue providing direct support to Procampo [Program of Direct Support to the Countryside], which helps more than 3 million peasants who work the majority of the country's cultivated land. With Procede [expansion unknown], we will continue to issue the title deeds that hundreds of thousands of ejido holders demand and have a right to in the country. To increase wellbeing, we will continue spending more -- more than ever before in our history -- on education. This year, we will invest more than 6 percent of the GNP, which is the highest proportion in the century, in favor of our children's education. We will continue to support our teachers with tangible measures. In the health sector, we are protecting more Mexicans, eliminating diseases that affect our children and vaccinating all of them. Above all, we are doing so with higher quality efforts and a sense of service. We will build nearly 340,000 houses, a number that has never before been built in a single year and which is more than one-fourth of all the houses built in the past 60 years. We have expanded credit facilities for small and medium-sized businesses which create countless jobs and which are so important to us. We are doubling the number of scholarships, to reach the level of 200,000, for the training of workers and those who are unemployed at this time. In this way, 200,000 Mexicans will obtain an income and improve their training and preparation to take advantage of the opportunities created by new jobs. We are strengthening the 130 regional solidarity funds to finance productive projects in approximately 4,000 Indian communities. Fellow Mexicans, We are going to continue working for Mexico, as is our duty, as is everyone's duty. We are mainly going to redouble public security, without limiting democracy or freedom. We will continue to oppose violence with the force of law and with the values that unite us and give us a future. In the face of attacks, we will employ unity, legality, and each individual's commitment to Mexico. In the face of injustice, we will employ the resolute action of the entire nation in favor of those who have less. In the face of insult, we will employ our essential unity as Mexicans. Who benefits from rumors? Who benefits from confusion? Certainly not the republic's institutions, not the country's democratic forces, not tolerance, and not those who peacefully struggle for justice. We do not accept the use of misinformation against Mexico. No action can change our determined resolve to respect freedom of speech or criticism. An excess of this freedom will always be better than placing limits on it. I reiterate that we promote unity not to silence dissenting voices but, rather, to unite resolve to strengthen institutions in a harmonious alliance of all Mexicans. Of course, this is not the first nor will it be the last difficult period we will face. Still, the ties among the Mexicans are great and strong. Our determination to move ahead and resolve our challenges one by one remains firm. Our desire remains firm to continue as a whole nation progressing in peace, with freedom, and more justice. We will close ranks and redouble our steps; this will be our response in the face of attempts to block Mexico's progress. That is what I have heard from the voices of many Mexicans, legislators, different sectors, the various political parties, and the population in general in my regular tours throughout the country. I have in me all of the enthusiasm and energy to fulfill my duty of serving Mexicans. Fellow countrymen, This is our most important and significant principle -- firm dignity and unalterable strength -- which make us proud as a people and defines us as a nation. Without a doubt, Mexico will come out stronger, with more freedom, democracy, justice, and reaffirmed sovereignty. This is what we will do because this is what we learned from the generations that preceded us, and because this is, without a doubt, the best lesson and example we can give our children and grandchildren. Fellow countrymen, Viva Mexico!
