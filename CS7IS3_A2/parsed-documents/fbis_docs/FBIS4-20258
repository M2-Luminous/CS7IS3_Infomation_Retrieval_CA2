Alberto Michelini, Stainano, Tremonti, Siciliani, and Pelanda announced their departure, a little after the ultimatum given to them by Mario Segni: "With me, or against me." According to the dissidents, Segni's prejudicial opposition is static, while they, on the other hand, are willing to enter into negotiation with the government. As far as the question of the government confidence motion is concerned, the dissidents may vote against, abstain, or, if they follow their manifesto, vote for the government.
