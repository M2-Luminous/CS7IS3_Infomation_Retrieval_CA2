Through the visit, I have opened a new historic horizon for ROK-Russian cooperation. Ending the era of conflict and dispute between them, the two countries have built a firm foundation for mutually complementary partnership relations. Russian President Yeltsin promised to suspend [chungdan] selling arms to North Korea and said that Russia will in fact scrap the mutual assistance treaty [sangho wonjo choyaktto sasilsang pegihagettago hangosun]. This will contribute to establishing a new basis for our security. Russia promised resolute measures, such as joining international sanctions, when necessary, to stop the North Korean nuclear program. Russia delivered to us data concerning the Korean War. This means that the Cold War past between the ROK and Russia has been completely liquidated. That I have visited the Russian Pacific fleet as ROK president symbolizes that the two countries are closely cooperating in security as well. These are epoch-making events that were hardly imaginable a few years ago. Our two countries have agreed to open a new era of common prosperity. Based on the agreements of cooperation of various types signed during my visit, the two countries can now carry on practical economic cooperation and technological cooperation. With my visit to Russia, I have completed the visits to four countries, namely, the United States, Japan, China, and Russia. I have completed the framework of the rectangular diplomacy to bring forth peace in Northeast Asia, to establish a new world order, and to promote our national interest. My dear fellow countrymen: That we have promoted friendship and cooperation with Uzbekistan during my visit also has a very important significance. Uzbekistan has been carrying out the most steady reform among the CIS countries. Uzbekistan not only has abundant natural resources, such as gold and cotton, but has a great potential for development. Uzbek President Karimov proposed active economic cooperation with our country. President Karimov assured me that a legal and systematic foundation will be laid so as to promote our businesses' advance into the Uzbek market. Large-scale joint investment has already been undertaken between the businesses of the two countries. I expect that Uzbekistan will in time play a role of our forward base for the Central Asian region. My dear fellow countrymen: I met our beloved brethren in Russia and Uzbekistan. They were pioneering life with vigorous power vitality. Despite the history of hardship they suffered, they preserved well the Korean tradition and culture. With diligence and sincerity characteristic of our nation, they were enjoying a high reputation. They were proud of their fatherland's development. I was deeply moved by their positive life. I was assured of ample consideration by the governments of the two countries so that our compatriots may not suffer disadvantages as a minority. I visited Vladivostok on my way home. Vladivostok is closely connected with us historically as a base for our independence movement. It is a region whose importance is highlighted for our economic advance into Siberia. I visited the Russian Pacific Fleet there, and had a historic opportunity to look over the Korean peninsula from there. It took no less than half a century to go there, Vladivostok, which is close to the Tumen River. I have returned home with a hope that I will be able to go there by a shorter way without a detour next time. My dear fellow countrymen: Through the rectangular diplomacy which began toward the end of last year, I vividly felt that our country is importantly appraised in the international community. We can play a leading role in the Asia-Pacific era. We can stand aloft in the center of the new sphere of civilization. Through the visits I have made, I renewed my resolve as well as my confidence. In the world ahead, competition will be even more keen among countries and regions. If we fail to keep up in competition, we will be a straggler and loser. The advanced countries were active in meeting this challenge. The countries that are catching up are also transforming themselves at a tremendous speed. The only way we must follow is to carry on a practical reform more vigorously. I will do my best as president to strengthen our security and promote the competitiveness of our country. Let us all advance forward vigorously united in one, overcoming the syndrome peculiar to a transitional period. Thank you.
