In addition to the program, the group prepared nearly 50 legislative acts, 30 of which are drafts of laws. Today, Volodymyr Pylypchuk discusses some provisions of the program. [Lavrenyuk] Volodymyr Mefodiyovych, a wise man once said that if a cripple knows the right route, he will reach his destination faster than a rider on horseback jumping around aimlessly. Applying this image to define how our economy has been managed for the last few years, one is unfortunately forced to assert that its progress has been that of a cripple wandering aimlessly. Let me therefore ask you: do you and the team with whom you drafted this program for overcoming the crisis think of yourselves as horsemen who know the way? [Pylypchuk] We are not proposing anything new, because all postcommunist states have chosen to make the transition to the market. How to go about making this transition, the various elements in this process, and the sequence in which the different steps are taken -- that is a different matter. For example, this transition would have been much easier in 1990, whereas the situation today requires the use of more complicated methods. On the other hand, there are many more people today than in 1990 who know how to go about making this transition. We have more than just a program. To make it work, it is necessary to make changes in our legislation, and we have worked these out. The only thing left to do is to refine the implementation mechanisms and the sanctions to be applied for failing to obey the laws. [Lavrenyuk] In your opinion, how soon will the Supreme Council get through its organizational phase and get around to the economy? [Pylypchuk] I expect the new Supreme Council to complete its internal organization in a week or two. [Lavrenyuk] Then let me put the question another way. Volodymyr Mefodiyovych, how soon will the Supreme Council begin to discuss the state budget? We all recall that at one time Finance Minister Pyatachenko vowed to eliminate the deficit. Naturally, no one believed that this would be done, but the deputies had to approve this budget because they had no way out. To be sure, a separate provision in the decree provided for a quarterly review. But we are approaching the middle of the second quarter, and there is no indication that anyone is planning to review the budget, just as everyone expected from the beginning. Meanwhile, experts predict that the deficit will reach 35-40 percent in the first half of 1994. [Pylypchuk] The thing is that the promises of this government are not serious, and so it is not worth getting fixated on them. Indeed, when the budget was being adopted, many deputies, including myself, asked the finance minister if, given the current program, the current budget, and the existing taxation system, the government could halt inflation. He answered that it could. And so we have a situation in which we collect only 200-250 billion of every trillion karbovantsi due in taxes. [Lavrenyuk] Apropos of taxes. Tell me, do you still support the idea of a sales tax? [Pylypchuk] We have modified this somewhat. This will be a tax on purchases (the person who buys will pay). [Lavrenyuk] In that case, what do you think of the decree that the Cabinet of Ministers has just passed, which stipulates that in a month's time drafts of decisions are to be drawn up regarding replacing the tax on income with a tax on profits, establishing a property tax, and lowering the value-added tax to 20 percent? [Pylypchuk] It is true that any reduction in taxes will eventually produce an increase in revenues into the budget, because the tax burden on the producer will be lessened. As to a tax on profits, we've already had that. I think, therefore, that in view of the inflation we have, it is absurd and senseless to view profit as a target of taxation, because with each upward spiral of inflation, profits are reduced to zero, which leads to price increases and a greater budget deficit. It is impossible to mend the budget if there is no solid compensatory tax base. Only those aspects that are connected with the price can serve as this base. All normal economists know this. Whereas it does not take a great deal of intelligence to insist on imposing a tax on profits, because this is a traditional tax in a stable economy. To impose a property tax at this time means to halt privatization, because only those who own property will pay it. (Just imagine a tax on a privatized apartment.) This, in turn, is linked to the problem of regional unemployment. We will be able to solve this problem without cost to the budget only if we have a full-fledged housing market. In other words, it is possible to introduce such a tax, but only when all citizens are private owners. This is but further proof that there are many dilettantes in the current government, who have heard something somewhere, but do not know when that "something" should be implemented. [Lavrenyuk] Now that you have mentioned privatization, can you describe the changes that you propose in your program for overcoming the crisis. [Pylypchuk] We are proposing to broaden the opportunities available to the public with respect to privatization. In addition, in the course of privatization, it is possible to solve the problem of paying back what the Ukrainian state owes its citizens (for the devaluation of their savings, bonds, special drawings). In conjunction with this, we propose indexing personal savings: up to 1,500 -- 10,000-fold, up to 10,000 -- 5,000-fold, from 10,000 to 20,000 -- 1,000-fold, and over 20,000 -- 500-fold. And to issue these funds to citizens in the form of privatization vouchers. We also think that it is important to step up privatization, which can be done by computerizing these processes, because we will gain more from accelerating privatization than from the fiscal function of privatization. In addition, we have worked out a simplified mechanism for making enterprises sound. This can be done in three stages: the first involves changing the management, the second -- reorganizing the enterprise, and the third -- changing the owner. If a monopoly enterprise shuts down, the management is changed, and, if the manufacturing process allows for this, production is broken up, new enterprises are created, which are immediately corporated and their stocks put on the market. If an enterprise with a debit balance shuts down, its management is changed and the enterprise is privatized without being corporated, for example. In other words, we propose harsh measures. [Lavrenyuk] Could we talk about the mechanism for overcoming inflation? [Pylypchuk] We have already mentioned the taxation system as one element in liquidating the budget deficit, but we propose another measure as well -- commercializing budget funds. On the whole, to put it briefly, this mechanism provides for eliminating the budget deficit, halting the decline in production, liquidating the foreign trade deficit, balancing the goods and money supplies, and liquidating the issuance of more credit than there are resources. The point also needs to be made when speaking of the drop in production, for example, that the policy of the National Bank of Ukraine [NBU] "contributed" to this in no small way. Of what use is simply prohibiting not to issue credit? [as published] One could conclude from this that the NBU's policy is based on a simplistic understanding of regulating the economy by monetary means: first they issued too much money, causing it to be devalued, then they suddenly "came to their senses" and swung to the other extreme. Too little money in circulation causes production volumes to drop. In this respect, the NBU's actions remind me of a drunk weaving from fence to fence as he makes his way home from the bar. [Lavrenyuk] Then what about currency regulation and the external trade activities of enterprises that are affected by this? [Pylypchuk] There are two points at which currency regulation has the same effect (I should state at the outset that currency regulation as such is a necessary thing) -- when either zero percent or one hundred percent of foreign currency has to be sold. The least effective situation is when fifty percent of the foreign currency has to be sold. Very harsh administrative measures are required to ensure that one hundred percent of foreign currency is sold. On the other hand, the second method (zero sales of foreign currency) means abandoning any attempt to manage and giving up the state's monopoly over exports. Enterprises will then be interested in hard currency earnings, but to ensure that these earnings benefit our state rather than some foreign country, we need to provide incentives not only for our own depositors but also foreigners by raising the interest rate on deposits to 25 percent. In these conditions, our own hard currency earnings will be recovered, and foreign investors will try to invest their money where they will earn larger profits. [Lavrenyuk] In connection with this, what do you think of the current round in the epic tale of the commodities bonds, which were blocked nearly a year ago thanks to your committee, and which have now been resurrected following some osmetic changes? [Pylypchuk] There is one thing I fail to understand in this situation: why are we so unwilling to do things in the normal way? Let me remind you of what happened: they issued commodities bonds and placed them somewhere in the West at seven percent per annum. But, first of all, there is no interest on commodities bonds anywhere in the orld, and, second, if we do not repay the money, in 10-20 years we have to settle the bill with property. But whose property? The property of state enterprises? But in ten years' time privatization should be completed. Will we then pay with property belonging to our citizens? If so, we have to ask our citizens if they are willing to be saddled with this debt. But let us imagine that there is still state property ten years from now. We hand it over, the investor introduces new technologies, and begins production. What is the sense of all this? Do we need investments right now? Yes! Then let us at least sell our unfinished construction projects for hard currency by international tender. We will have the money today and, moreover, we will not be burdened by the need to pay interest. And if an investor comes today, he will also set up the manufacturing process and begin production today rather than ten years from now. That is what we proposed doing originally, and that is what we are proposing again today. But we are witnessing another attempt to get around this, which compels me to think that behind this maneuver lie the personal economic interests of those organizing and pushing this through. [Lavrenyuk] In conclusion, Volodymyr Mefodiyovych, what would you like to wish the new Supreme Council? How do you envisage its work? [Pylypchuk] I believe that it will be more constructive than that of the former council. I say this because while working during the preparatory period with deputies who are economists by profession, I saw that the position of the representatives of the so-called left bloc is the same as that of the Polish leftists -- that is, they support reforms. I like them. I do not know whether all the leftists hold the same view, but we already share a common fulcrum. Naturally, I would like the deputies to the Supreme Council to take into account both the positive and negative experience of their predecessors. For our part, we worked out a new organizational structure for the Supreme Council -- we changed the basis on which commissions are to be formed. Previously, they were formed to correspond to the branches of the national economy, while we propose creating commissions that are based on the branches of the economy and the law. In other words, there will be separate commissions on budget issues, banking, property reforms, micro and macroeconomics, and others, because the previous Supreme Council had several economic commissions, but while ours drafted 160 laws, some of the others prepared only three or four each. This may have been enjoyable [for our commission], but it was also exhausting. The load has to be evenly distributed. As to the new Supreme Council, I wish it to complete organizing its working bodies as quickly as possible and get down to the real work that needs to be done. [Lavrenyuk] Thank you.
