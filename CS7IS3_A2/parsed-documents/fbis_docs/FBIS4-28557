Subcabinet-level auto trade talks between Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice international trade and industry minister for international affairs, and Jeffrey Garten, U.S. commerce undersecretary for international trade, were held in Tokyo "in an amicable atmosphere," the official told a press conference. The two-hour discussion tackled the thorniest issue under the bilateral "framework" talks of setting "objective criteria" as a tool to gauge progress in the opening of Japan's auto and auto parts markets, the official said. But both parties agreed to keep further details secret, he said. No U.S. officials could be reached for comment on Friday's auto trade talks. The latest meeting came after working-level auto trade talks in Washington last week, at which both parties agreed to suspend the issue of objective criteria. The two countries remain at odds over the definition of the criteria, with Tokyo unlikely to accept any U.S. requests seeking future auto trade performance. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor recently proposed some indicators relating to future Japanese commitment, such as expanding the number of Japanese auto dealers handling U.S. cars, a yardstick Tokyo thinks as tantamount to "numerical targets." The Japanese side has repeatedly said Tokyo is willing to respond only to indicators meant to measure past progress. The Japanese official said the U.S. is now "in a favorable economic position" for settlement of the auto trade talks, citing strong earnings results enjoyed by the "big three" automakers. The official said Okamatsu and Garten will informally meet again Saturday before the latter leaves Japan in the afternoon. Friday's subcabinet-level meeting will be followed by working-level talks set for Monday and Tuesday in Tokyo, the official said.
