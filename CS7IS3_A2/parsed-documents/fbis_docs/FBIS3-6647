We regard this visit as a good omen for the friendly relations between the peoples of Laos and Cambodia, especially between our two legislative institutions. At the same time, we are confident that the success of the talks between the two sides this afternoon in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual understanding will become an important milestone and process for bolstering and strengthening the time-honored fine traditional relations between Laos and Cambodia. Respected Samdech, ladies and gentlemen, and beloved honored guests, Laos and Cambodia are adjacent countries, maintaining a close relationship of intimacy and neighborliness. We have rendered assistance and maintained a sense of profound affection, intimacy, and understanding toward each other. Our two peoples have shared similar traditions, customs, and characteristics as well as the same fate of having been colonized by the imperialists and neocolonialists in the past. We stood shoulder to shoulder together to fight for a common victory, as well as for national independence and freedom for each country. The histories of our two countries have been recorded with the ties of everlasting relations of glorious friendship between our two peoples forever. The National Assembly and multiethnic people of Laos are sincerely overwhelmed with and have hailed the success of the elections held by the Cambodian National Assembly. We wholeheartedly congratulate Samdech Chea Sim for having been elected chairman of the National Assembly and appointed acting head of state of the Kingdom of Cambodia. To cement the relations between our two legislative organizations and all agreements signed by the two governments, let us mobilize the peoples of both countries to translate these feats into reality. As good neighbors, the National Assembly and multiethnic people of Laos always want to see Cambodia enjoy lasting independence, peace, stability, and prosperity and become a friend of all countries. On this auspicious occasion, on behalf of the National Assembly and multiethnic people of Laos, I wish that the Cambodian people attain greater achievements in carrying out the tasks of national reconstruction and making their beloved country prosperous forever. I would like to invite Samdech Chea Sim and all distinguished personalities to join me in toasting the health of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk of the Kingdom of Cambodia and Queen Monique; to the health of His Excellency Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and his wife; to the success, health, and happiness of Samdech Chea Sim and the delegation; to the health of all ladies and gentlemen and distinguished guests at this reception; and to the friendship, solidarity, and cooperation between the two states and peoples of Laos and Cambodia.
