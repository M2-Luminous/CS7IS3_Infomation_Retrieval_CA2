Russian Premier's Visit to United States Has Been a Success -- They Lent Us Money"] [Text] Russian Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is on an official visit to the United States, has held working meetings with Lewis Preston, president of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development [IBRD], and IMF Director Michel Camdessus. At the end of his meeting with L. Preston, the representatives of Russia and the IBRD signed four agreements granting the Russian Federation loans worth a total of $820 million. We are talking about credit of $300 million to develop the country's transportation infrastructure, $200 million to develop the financial and banking system, $240 million to reform agriculture, and a loan of $80 million to implement land reform. Replying to a question from an RIA correspondent, Viktor Chernomyrdin said that he had discussed with the IBRD directors not only current topics but also the prospects for the longer term. For example, an organization might be set up in Russia at the federal level which will concentrate all work with the bank in its hands. The premier also requested the bank's leadership to provide the Russian Federation with assistance in pursuing debts from countries which borrowed money from the former USSR. Commenting on his meeting with V. Chernomyrdin, IMF Director Michel Camdessus said that at this meeting they merely discussed the general state of affairs in the Russian economy. "We did not mention any loans," he said. M. Camdessus spoke highly of the measures being undertaken by the Russian Government in the economic sphere. "I am sure that Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet will be successful," he noted. It is expected that this summer representatives of Russia and the IMF will begin active work on an agreement for 1995. Russian Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin believes that the main result of the work done by the Russian-U.S. Commission headed by himself and U.S. Vice President Albert Gore is that it has managed to convince the U.S. Administration of the need to regard Russia as a country with a transitional economy. Speaking about this in a talk with journalists, the premier also announced that U.S. leaders support the lifting of unjustified trade restrictions against Russia. "Our entrepreneurs should face no obstacles in their work on the world market," V. Chernomyrdin stressed. He announced that the commission is broadening the scope of its activity. "We are complying with all the decisions we have made and on every occasion we are broadening the circle of problems under discussion," the premier said. Russian Federation Transport Minister Vitaliy Yefimov, for example, told an RIA correspondent that at the next session of the commission a committee for scientific and technical cooperation in the sphere of transportation could be added to the committees for business cooperation, conversion, the power industry, science and technology, space, and environmental protection. V. Chernomyrdin said that during the commission's work they had managed to reach agreement on U.S. participation in building storage facilities for weapons-grade plutonium on Russian territory; this plutonium will then be reprocessed into nuclear fuel. The United States has agreed to grant Russia compensation for the dual-purpose nuclear reactors which are being closed down and where weapons-grade plutonium is produced. In an interview with an RIA correspondent, Russian Federation Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov explained that we are talking about two reactors located in the Tomsk and Krasnodar areas. In the opinion of the Ministry of Atomic Energy, closing them down will cost approximately $1.1 billion.
