This has increased the cost of local governments in paying foreign debts and created a new burden. It is disclosed that according to a State Council decision, the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance will coordinate with the planning commissions of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government in jointly solving this issue. The Ministry of Finance will also undertake some of the local governments' foreign debts to help them repay part of their debts. In an interview with this reporter yesterday, Tao Liming, deputy director of the International Monetary and Financial Institute of the Bank of China, said: The central government has noticed that, in the years between the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-1990) and the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), some of the foreign debts contracted by the local governments were calculated at the official rate of less than 4 yuan or 5.9 yuan [figures as published] to the U.S. dollar. Now that the renminbi has been devalued following the unification of the two exchange rates, which means foreign debts should be calculated at the new rate of 8.7 yuan to the dollar, the cost and burden of the local governments will suddenly increase if they exchange renminbi for the dollar at a designated bank for the repayment of foreign debts. Some time ago, a considerable proportion of the foreign debts incurred by the local governments was invested in electricity, communications, and water conservation projects for agricultural use. When these projects are completed and go into operation, the country as a whole will benefit. Officials from Chengdu as well as Guizhou, Yunnan, and other provinces told this reporter: In the past dozen years or so, the localities have joined in many large construction projects, such as railways, power stations, and water conservation projects, and have borrowed money to finance these projects. Now that the exchange rates are unified, they are anxious to find ways to deal with the substantial increase in the cost of foreign debts. Tao said that by a decision of the State Council, the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance will coordinate with the planning commissions of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government in helping the local government solve this new issue. By the end of 1992, China's foreign debts came to $69.3 billion. At the National People's Congress meeting last March, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said China would borrow 26.9 billion yuan in new foreign debts (amounting to $4.56 billion at 5.9 yuan to the dollar). The servicing of foreign debts will hit a peak this year and the next. But a relevant department said that China has a good reputation in repaying foreign debts. He said: In a bid to stabilize the exchange rate of renminbi and further boost monetary reform, Chinese monetary authorities plan to open a renminbi futures business. Tao did not elaborate specific measures, such as when this will open. Tao also said yesterday that, following the unification of the exchange rates, the exchange rate of renminbi in mainland cities have been basically stable in the past few days. He added: The Chinese monetary and financial departments have made ample preparations for the unification of renminbi exchange rates on 1 January 1994. For example, starting in early 1993, the authorities intentionally liberalized business by calculating the settlement of foreign trade exchange according to the swap price. By the end of last year, some 80 percent of imports and exports by mainland enterprises, labor export, and exchange transactions between enterprises was calculated according to the swap price. When the basic conditions for monetary reform were ripe, China announced the unification of exchange rates on 1 January and the rate has been basically stable since then. According to Tao, foreign debts contracted by the central and local governments in the future will still be controlled by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Control.
