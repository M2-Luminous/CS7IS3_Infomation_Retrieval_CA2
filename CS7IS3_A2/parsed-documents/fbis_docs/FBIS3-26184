Speaking at the first meeting of the preparatory committee for the World Summit for Social Development, Li Zhaoxing, Chinese permanent representative to UN, said China will make full use of the good conditions created by the economic growth, pay attention to new problems and make the society more civilized, equatable, healthy and happy. The convocation of the world summit, in 1955 in Copenhagen, reflects not only the importance attached to the issue of development by the United Nations and its member states, but also the common aspiration of jointly facing the future by entire mankind, Li said. With the view of achieving more practical and desired results at the summit, he made five observations: -- Economic development cannot automatically promote social progress. In an ideal and healthy society, there should be a coordinated development in economic and social fields, and the economic achievements should be applied to social development in a timely and appropriate manner. -- The promotion and enhancement of social development is a fairly strong government action. The coordination between economic and social development, between departments within the field of social development, between regions and between government and non-governmental organizations all depend on the comprehensive coordination and management of the government. -- The declaration and program of action to be adopted by the summit should give special attention to the grave problems faced by the developing countries, and international cooperation should be conducted in a comprehensive, effective and fair manner and on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. -- The establishment and maintenance of a peaceful and stable international environment and the establishment of a new international economic order of justice, equality mutual benefit and cooperation, should be a precondition for the settlement of social problems in various countries. -- Since countries have different development level, social system and cultural tradition, their emphasis on questions in social development vies, specific policies, approaches and programs of action should be formulated in line with different national conditions. The Chinese ambassador also told the meeting that his government is planning to hold a national conference on social development, the first of its kind in China, in September to review the program for social development in China for the next few decades. China is also planning to hold in Beijing an international symposium on social development in June to discuss such issues as social development and social progress and role of the government in social development. China's preparatory committee for the summit, chaired by the head of the State Planning Commission and composes of 25 officials at the ministerial level from central departments and leaders of non-governmental organizations, was established last December.
