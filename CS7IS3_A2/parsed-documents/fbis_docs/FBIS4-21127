[Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Sintura, has the prosecutor general capitulated in favor of drug traffickers in Colombia? [Sintura] That is not true. A communique that we released clearly presents the Prosecutor General's Office position, which is this: As long as the existing law forbids drug trafficking in every stage, the Office will continue to fight drug traffickers and charge them in courts of law. [Reporter] Does the United States have the moral authority to censure us like this? [Sintura] Well, these are comments that one sovereign state makes to another. We have said a few things that we think are important, particularly because we understand that the generalizations made about the Colombian judicial system can be based on either incorrect interpretations of our legal system or insufficient reports.
