The ailing city of Detroit -- with its bare economic and social wounds -- offered an eloquent background for the frightening consequences that may result from neglecting social and employment problems. This conference should set a signal for the more than 30 million unemployed in the industrialized countries and the many millions employed who fear for their jobs day after day: Those who bear political responsibility for the first time want to make it clear at an international stage that they are aware of people's fears and of the dangerous effects high unemployment has on the social structure of our societies. Even politicians such as Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who had taken a skeptical view on the American idea of a G-7 jobs conference, finally said that including structural problems in the G-7 process did make sense; nobody can afford the political controversy between financial and social policy any longer. The American hosts even spoke euphorically of the most important turning point in the dialogue between the industrialized countries. So much for rhetorics. No tangible results were achieved. Still, it would probably be wrong to conclude from that that the conference was a failure. From the very beginning the American hosts' only intention was to learn from one another through an intensive exchange of opinions on the shared problem of unemployment and to take home new ideas or impulses. Even before the beginning of the meeting, all participants knew that microproblems such as unemployment cannot be overcome through international coordination but only through domestic reforms. All of them also knew that all possible solutions are not interchangeable at will but have to be tailored to the individual conditions in the national economies. Progress cannot be measured by joint promises for action but only by better understanding for the diversities and common features of employment problems in the seven countries. In this connection it is again and again surprising how little the individual responsible government officials are aware of the situation and particularities in the partner countries. Although the problem of unemployment was presented, analyzed, and compared with foreign conditions in all participating countries, there is still a great deal of ignorance and much reason for misunderstanding. Time and again, the politicians succumb to the temptation to measure the partner countries with their yardsticks and the very conditions in their countries. One example of the lack of differentiation is the nasty and trite controversy over German interests that are said to be the obstacle to global growth. The simple American formula that the Bundesbank only has to cut its short-term interest rates to promote growth in Germany and in Europe so that more American products can be sold there was wrapped in diplomatic language at this conference and cloaked with the concern for jobs. However, the fact that the special German situation is being ignored has not changed as far as the formulation of the demand for interest cuts and stimulating the demand in the name of creating more jobs are concerned. Yet it may be seen as success of the one and a half days of exchange of opinions that the American Administration now seems to understand that even the Germans would have absolutely nothing against higher growth rates, but that the incorporation of the eastern laender and the responsibility toward East Europe are constituting such a great burden for Germany that the current conditions do not permit an additional stimulation of demand. Moreover, the Clinton Administration now even accepts the German argument that the deep structural reasons of unemployment cannot be overcome by a substantial stimulation of the economy either. How long such insights will last will be seen at the earliest at the spring meeting of the G-7 finance minister in Washington in April. A different thing is how the better understanding of the individual problems of the partners' labor markets will translate into concrete steps to fight unemployment. The list of measures regarded as necessary is impressive: making labor markets more flexible, deregulation and privatization, life-long learning and permanent modernization of qualification, better preparation of those leaving school for integration into the labor market, greater innovative strength and more modern organizational structures of enterprises, innovative wage policy, compatibility between social benefits and labor market, and specific promotion of medium-sized enterprises as driving forces for employment. Even before the meeting, critical voices remarked that in all industrialized nations the reasons for unemployment had been sufficiently studied and the necessary measures were widely known. The problem is the implementation of the measures, because those who bear political responsibly lack the courage and the enterprises and trade unions were clinging to outdated patterns of thought. Should the conference of Detroit break up rigid behavioral patterns and political positions it would indeed have been something like a turning point. However, one should not expect any miracles even from cross-border political learning.
