Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a press conference that Japan maintains its three-point nonnuclear principle of not possessing, producing or allowing nuclear weapons into Japan so that developing nuclear weapons is "impossible." Saito said the ministry is investigating whether the British Ministry of Defense has compiled a report on the possibility of Japan's development of nuclear weapons, as was reported by the SUNDAY TIMES. The SUNDAY TIMES said the Ministry of Defense has warned Prime Minister John Major that North Korea's nuclear program may force Japan to abandon its nonnuclear stance. The paper said Japan has acquired all the parts needed to make a nuclear weapon and may have built a bomb which requires only plutonium to be completed and that the risks were detailed in a paper to the Joint Intelligence Committee, the government's main security adviser to the cabinet. Saito said the option to possess nuclear weapons would only contribute to the instability of the international environment surrounding Japan and that it runs counter to Japan's peace and prosperity. "So it is totally impossible that Japan will change the three-point nonnuclear principle," he said. He added that Japan is a member of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and that it also supports the indefinite extension of the treaty when it is reviewed in 1995. If such a British Government report exists, Japan will have to once again make clear that it is impossible that Japan will opt to possess nuclear weapons and seek understanding from Britain and the international community, he said.
