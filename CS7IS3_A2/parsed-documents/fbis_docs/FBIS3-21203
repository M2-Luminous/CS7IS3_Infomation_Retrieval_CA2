Currently, active R&D is being conducted into 256M DRAMs featuring a higher scale of integration. Manufacturing such ultra-large-scale integration silicon devices requires highly reliable manufacturing process technology with controlled surface, interface, and film quality. Oxidation, diffusion, and LP-CVD technologies are no exception and are being subjected to various requirements for improvement. Figure 1 shows the design rule, junction depth, gate-oxide film thickness, and capacitance insulation film thickness of each generation of DRAM. The design rule values of 0.25 �m, junction depth of 0.075 �m, and gate insulation film thickness of 80 angstroms almost satisfy the actual trend. On the other hand, the thickness reduction of capacitance insulation film has been made less demanding by combining it with a three-dimensional electrode with increased electrode surface area. It is now possible to use silicon nitride capacitance film with a film thickness (when converted to oxide film thickness) of about 40 angstroms as the capacitance insulation film of 256M DRAMs, provided that the film has a good coating characteristic. On the other hand, highly dielectric film appears to be a promising technology for reducing the number of manufacturing processes, hence its development is presently being studied. Figure 1. Trend of Microminiaturization of DRAMs The necessary conditions for equipment used in manufacturing 256M DRAMs are: First, high-reliability technology compatible with the fabrication of ultra-large-scale integrated devices should be established and mass-producible equipment should be developed to implement them. Second, equipment compatible with an increased wafer size accompanying the increase in chip size and cost reduction should be developed. Nevertheless, if the wafer size increase leads to a rise in equipment cost or a drop in throughput, the purpose of equipment development itself would be lost. Third, the equipment cost and failure rate should be decreased by simplifying the equipment and promoting standardization. Presently, manufacturing equipment is getting more complicated by an increased number of components. This is the result of the implementation of accumulated equipment experience. But, in the future, it is necessary to promote the simplification of equipment by identifying the essence of each process and emphasizing only the required functions. As well as reducing the number of components, it is also important to standardize equipment and components. By making such efforts it will be possible to reduce failure rate and the maintenance time even when the throughput is increased and clustering, which is effective in interface and surface control, is used. There are many problems to be solved in the development of equipment as seen above, and this report discusses the required measures to solve them by enumerating some of the concepts and topics related to the technology for the fabrication of thin films and shallow junctions required to manufacture 256M DRAMs. Annealing Equipment Following the reduction of device size, the formation of shallow junctions and the reduction of the redistribution of impurities are required more urgently than before. Presently, impurities are mainly introduced by ion implantation. However, because activation processing and damage recovery after ion implantation require highly accurate control of temperature, time, and atmosphere, resistance-heating-type electric furnaces currently used are approaching their technical limits. This is because the individual wafers have different thermal hysteresis if they are transported in batches to the electric furnace, and reduction of thermal hysteresis is difficult. RTP (rapid thermal processing) is utilized as the technology for compensating for this limitation of electric furnaces. RTP provides good throughput because it can activate impurities in a short period and it causes little diffusion of impurities as shown in Figure 2.[.sup]1[/] In addition, because of the advantages in its ability to handle wafers with increased size, this technology will be indispensable for manufacturing 256M DRAMs. However, its cold-wall design tends to radiate a great deal of heat from the wafer edges during heating, and uniformity in the wafer plane is difficult to achieve, sometimes causing crystal defects during heating. In addition, while the temperature is in general controlled by observing the infrared rays from the back of the wafer using a pyrometer, the infrared ray emission rate is often variable depending on the condition of the back of the wafer. Although RTP has already been put to practical use in some areas, there are many problems yet to be solved. Figure 2. Results of Experiments and Calculations on Depth RTP equipment has better properties than conventional electric furnaces as described above but, when considering throughput and other factors, the electric furnace is still superior in many processes and it is expected that the use of electric furnaces will continue in the fabrication of wells. The batch-type rapid thermal processing furnace which has been gathering interest[.sup]2[/] has the potential for providing the advantages of both RTP equipment and batch processing equipment and could be an effective method for fabricating 256M DRAMs in the future. LP-CVD Equipment Among the LP-CVD technologies to be used with 256M DRAMs, those which especially need improvements in the process equipment are the fabrication of ultrathin insulation film with excellent coating such as capacitance film, and the fabrication of silicon film used in wiring and electrode manufacture. The discussion that follows will focus on these technologies. 1. Capacitance Insulation Film Fabrication Equipment Devices such as 256M DRAMs require thin film with a thickness of less than 40 angstroms, which is close to the physical limit, even if three-dimensional electrodes are combined as was described earlier. Control of natural-oxide film on the electrode surfaces is critical for the fabrication of such thin films. Natural-oxide film is formed in the cleaning process, during exposure to the atmosphere between processes, and when the wafer is put into the nitride film deposition furnace. Active attempts have been made to reduce natural-oxide film growth during the furnace input operation through improvements in the equipment and pre-processing methods. Development of LP-CVD equipment with a load-lock mechanism has also been undertaken to prevent atmospheric penetration during the furnace input operation.[.sup]3[/] This method replaces the wafer atmosphere in the leak-tight load-lock chamber with a high vacuum or high-purity inert gas atmosphere before transporting the wafer into the furnace. From the viewpoint of process improvement, a method for reducing the natural-oxide film growth by applying RTN (rapid thermal nitridation) before input to the LP-CVD furnace has also been reported.[.sup]4[/] These measures have been very effective in reducing natural-oxide film growth in the furnace, but could not remove natural-oxide film completely. Complete removal requires an in-situ oxide film-removal process and atmospheric-control technology with the oxygen partial pressure reduced below 10[.sup]-6[/] Torr. To make this possible, equipment is being developed which provides high-vacuum modules and combines several process modules called cluster tools. Also under development is equipment performing several processes in a single-process module. With the general structure used by cluster tools, the natural-oxide film is removed in the pre-processing module installed inside the equipment and the wafers are transported into the film-fabrication module in a controlled atmosphere for deposition of the designed film. It has been reported that batch-type clustered equipment using fluoride vapor etching for post-processing can fabricate high-quality capacitance film with a thickness of around 40 angstroms.[.sup]5[/] Figure 3 shows the process flow when capacitance nitride film is fabricated by performing several processes continuously in the same module.[.sup]6[/] Figure 3. Flow of Continuous Multiple Processing in a Figure 4 shows the result of oxygen analysis in the capacitance film and interface in the depth direction (SIMS). The figure shows that a natural-oxide film layer is observed at the interface between nitride film and silicon in the case where a nitride film is fabricated by stand-alone equipment. Further, the use of continuous, multiple processing using hydrogen baking in pre-processing allows complete removal of the natural-oxide film. This has reduced the leakage current of nitride film-stacked capacitors, and produced a remarkable improvement in long-term reliability (Figure 5). Figure 4. Oxygen Profile on Nitride Film/Silicon Interface Figure 5. Long-Term Reliability of Nitride Film-Stacked As described above, continuous, multiple processing in cluster tools or in a single module is a very effective method for fabricating high-quality capacitance film, and an improvement in throughput can also be expected from continuous processing within the same equipment. Further, development of mass-production equipment is desirable as soon as possible. Moreover, since the quality of CVD film varies depending on the purity of the process gas, it is also important to develop gas purification technology along with the equipment improvements. LP-CVD technology using organic source gas for the deposition of tantalum-oxide film as a highly dielectric film to replace capacitance-insulation nitride film is being developed for 256M DRAMs. The importance of reducing natural-oxide film on the electrode surface of tantalum-oxide film is similar to the nitride film described above.[.sup]7[/] With SrTiO[.sup]3[/] and PZT, which are expected to be used as highly dielectric materials, techniques for film fabrication such as the sol-gel, sputtering, and CVD methods are being studied. Expectations are that development of manufacturing methods and equipment suitable for mass production will be available in the near future. 2. Silicon Film Fabrication Equipment It is expected that the applications of in-situ doped silicon films in devices will expand greatly in the mass-production stage of 256M DRAMs. This expectation is based on the following points: Since decreasing the temperature is a must in the 256M DRAM manufacturing process, the previous technology for thermal diffusion of impurities is of limited use. In addition, it is difficult for current technology to deal with contact poly-Si embedding with a large aspect ratio, and the fabrication of high-quality thin doped silicon film which are required by the progress of integration. In-situ doped silicon film fabrication is promising technology for solving this problem but there are still many technological problems to be overcome for the present. The most important problem is to develop a film with excellent coating which can be used for three-dimensional cylinder capacitor electrodes and microfine contacts. The problem of increased resistance in doped silicon film when fabricating it as thin film has also been pointed out.[.sup]8[/] Furthermore, since the control of natural-oxide film at the interface is necessary when embedding a contact in the same way as when fabricating a capacitance film, cluster tools or multiple processes in the same chamber will also be required. Recently, fabrication of a special silicon film containing hemispherical grains on the surface (HSG-Si: hemispherical grained Si) has been studied.[.sup]9[/] The HSG-Si film has about twice the surface area of ordinary silicon film and is expected to be applied in capacitor electrodes. Figure 6 [photo not reproduced] shows an example of the use of HSG-Si as an electrode. To form these hemispherical grains, a clean surface should be maintained so that silicon atoms can migrate freely on the amorphous silicon-film surface. If a natural-oxide film layer is formed on the amorphous silicon-film surface, the migration of silicon atoms would be reduced and HSG-Si would not be formed. Therefore, equipment with low-oxygen partial pressure is also required to prevent natural-oxide film in HSG-Si fabrication. Oxidation Technology It is theorized that 256M DRAMs may use gate-oxide films with a thickness of around 80 angstroms. Film thickness at this level is already being developed for use in the gate-oxide films of CMOS and the practical level has already been reached. However, it is still undoubtedly important to advance the improvement of gate-oxide film quality in the future. Consequently, the following discussion deals with the oxidation technology required to promote film quality improvement. At present, reduction of the interface level, development of oxide film containing nitrogen, reduction of particles, and reduction of metal contamination are being attempted to improve oxide film quality. For these technical subjects, it is necessary to study them from the process side, including cleaning, as well as from the equipment side. Problems related to the atmosphere when wafers are input to the oxidation furnace have been dealt with often in recent years. Figure 7 shows the difference in oxide-film reliabilities when the oxygen concentration in the nitrogen gas in the furnace is varied.[.sup]10[/] As shown in the figure, the oxide-film quality and reliability vary extensively depending on the oxygen concentration in the furnace. Figure 7. In-Furnace Atmospheric Dependence of Gate-Oxide On the other hand, it has also been reported that, if a wafer with its Si surface exposed experiences a temperature rise or furnace input operation in high-purity nitrogen gas or inert gas, the irregularities on the silicon surface increase and cause deterioration of the electric properties.[.sup]11[/] Such a problem will not occur if a thin-oxide film is formed by irradiating the silicon surface with UV-O[.sup]3[/] before the wafer is input to the furnace.[.sup]11[/] This indicates that the thin-oxide film protects the surface layer. As described above, the electrical properties of oxide film are largely variable depending on furnace input conditions. If core tube-type equipment is used in the mass production of 256M DRAMs, it would be advantageous to solve the problems in furnace input without making the equipment more complicated. It is highly probable that RTP equipment will be applied in the fabrication of gate-oxide film. This is because its cold wall-type structure is expected to be capable of solving the above problems and that problems in throughput may not occur thanks to the gate-oxide film becoming thinner. RTP may also be effective for use in nitrogen-oxide film fabrication because the process gas and temperature can be switched instantaneously. Conclusion In the above, the process technologies required for oxidation, diffusion, and LP-CVD equipment in the 256M DRAM generation, and the problems in the equipment have been described. The process technologies for this generation feature the following five points: 1) interface and surface control; 2) continuous processing; 3) lower temperatures; 4) cleaning technology; and 5) complete control of process parameters. To improve the accuracy of such process technologies, it is important to improve control technology based on the understanding of natural phenomena in the manufacturing equipment. Presently, improvement of process accuracy is being attempted by clustering the manufacturing equipment, as this can remove unstable factors originating from outside the equipment. Clustering of equipment is also expected to improve the throughput due to the omission of processes such as cleaning. Conversely, a major source of worry in clustering is a possible increase in equipment failures due to increased complexity. The need here is evident: simplify or standardize the equipment. In this generation, the selection between batch equipment using core tubes and wafer-level equipment using lamps may be important. Selection according to the processes used may be required. Regardless of the selection, all types of equipment are required to provide low price and high throughput, compatibility with large diameter wafers, and highly accurate control of the atmosphere inside each module.
