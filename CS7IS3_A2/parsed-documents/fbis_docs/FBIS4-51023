Zou Jiahua said: The development of transport and telecommunications will directly promote commodity circulation and the development of socialist market economy in our country. The present international environment is favorable to us, we ourselves have the necessary conditions for development, and there is an increasing demand for communications service in the society. So, it is a very good time for us to develop the postal and telecommunications services. With the concerted efforts made by the workers and cadres, the postal and telecommunications department last year invested 40 billion yuan in fixed assets, increased the capacity of telephone exchanges by 12.86 million lines, and put into operation eight optical cables. The achievements were tremendous and exceptional in the history of the world's telecommunications. On the 16-character principle, he explained: Overall planning means that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications should change its past practice, pay more attention to macroeconomic management of the nation's telecommunications, and shift its emphasis from microeconomic management to macroeconomic management of the telecommunications business in the country. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications should seriously formulate a strategic principle, a long-range development plan, and an annual development plan for the development of China's telecommunications. On regional and interdepartmental cooperation, he pointed out: It is necessary to foster the idea of joint efforts and cooperation; pool the scientific research forces and the production forces of all departments, provinces, and cities; and prevent duplicated construction projects. We should build well a nationwide public telecommunications network. At the same time, we should also make the special-purpose telecommunications network play its role. We should bring into full play the initiative of both the localities and various departments. He added: In order to accelerate the development of the postal and telecommunications services, we should rely on scientific and technological progresses. In the last few years, the postal and telecommunications services have taken a greater stride in using new technology. We have adopted many advanced telecommunications techniques of the world, such as program-controlled exchange, optical fiber communications, satellite communications, and mobile communications. The postal and telecommunications department should cooperate with other departments and pool resources in research and development. He pointed out: While developing itself, the postal and telecommunications department should improve service and turn the users' demand into a motive force for it to improve its work. Instead of treating telecommunications service as a power in our hands, we should establish the notion of serving the people and serving the national economy.
