By sending its 31 January statement to the IAEA saying that it will withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty unless the United States stops its scheme to crush the Pyongyang side, North Korea stated that the fact that the United States and the IAEA urge North Korea to receive full-scope inspections of its nuclear facilities violates the spirit of the North Korea-U.S. agreement, and revealed that it will not negotiate further with the IAEA unless the agreement mapped out in New York is kept. Responding to this, IAEA spokesman Meyer said the IAEA does not regard a protest document sent by North Korea as an official answer and that the IAEA is still waiting for North Korea's official response to its specification inquiring about the place and schedule for nuclear inspections.
