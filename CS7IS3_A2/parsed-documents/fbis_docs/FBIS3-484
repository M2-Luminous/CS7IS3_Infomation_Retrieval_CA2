ECOMOG field commander, Major General John Inienger, gave the warning yesterday when he summoned the dismissed leader of ULIMO, Alhaji Koromah, for consultations. A serious split developed within the ranks of ULIMO between Krahn elements loyal to ULIMO military chief, Roosevelt Johnson, and Mandingo elements of Alhaji Koromah following the failure of Dr. Mohamed Sheriff to obtain a position on the State Council. Dr. Sheriff was being supported by Alhaji Koromah, but lost the vice chairmanship of the council to Mr. Thomas Ziah of the same organization. Ziah is being supported by General Roosvelt Johnson and other Krahn elements within ULIMO. Following news of Mr. Ziah's election over Dr. Sheriff, ULIMO leader Koromah has announced the sacking of Ziah and replaced him (?by Dr. Sheriff). The dismissal of Mr. Ziah who challenged [words indistinct] the military wing of ULIMO subsequently announced the dismissal of Alhaji Koromah. Gen. Roosevelt Johnson announced that he had taken over the leadership of ULIMO, disbanded the political wing [words indistinct]. Reports say the infighting in ULIMO has led to serious gun battle among its soldiers at the Po River in Tubmanburg ULIMO headquarters. The fighting was sparked off after Alhaji Koromah ordered the disarming of Krahn elements of ULIMO loyal to Johnson. Johnson forces are reported to have resisted the order, which resulted in a serious gun battle. Alhaji Koromah is said to be confused as the situation is now reported to be beyond his control. Of late, Koromah has been attempting to commercialize ULIMO [word indistinct] $5 million as compensation to cooperate with the peace process.
