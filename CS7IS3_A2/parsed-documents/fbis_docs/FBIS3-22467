It reveals that as many children are dying now of asthma as they were a decade ago, despite the fact that figures for all other causes of childhood deaths have fallen. Half of all admissions of children to hospitals are caused by asthma, with the cost of childhood asthma to the NHS as much as Â£107 million a year. The Lifestyle Study looked at 773 children with asthma, aged between five and 17, and 248 parents. It is the first time the impact of asthma has been studied on such a scale. It found 2,482 children died from asthma in 1990, just 0.5 percent less than in 1980. Over the same time period, deaths among children for "all causes" fell by 24 percent. It is thought up to one million children aged between five and 14 suffer from wheezing, with diagnosed asthma sufferers accounting for one-third to a half of this total. It is still unclear whether the incidence is rising but more children are diagnosed with asthma every year. Some experts blame increased pollution or maternal smoking. Nick Wells, a pharmaceutical economist and one of the authors of the report to be published in the European Respiratory Review this week, said it was hoped that the findings would push the experts into doing something. Mr. Wells and Dr. Warren Lenney, of the Royal Alexander Hospital for Sick Children in Brighton, found 38 percent of the school children in the study lost an average of 10 days a year of education because of their asthma. More than half of the parents whose children had more than five days' absence from school felt their child's prospects were affected by the condition. Large numbers were also unable to take part in sport, play a musical instrument or go out with friends. Two-fifths were not allowed to take part in some trips or holidays. The effect of asthma on parents is also considerable, particularly on mothers. There may be additional housework to reduce dust and other irritants and the need to take time off work. "The emotional impact on parents can also be considerable," the report says. "Feelings of guilt, worry or frustration are often experienced." However, what also emerged was a sense of "coping" among the parents, with 70 percent developing a routine to deal with the illness. The authors suggested NHS costs could be cut if there was improved management of the disease in the community rather than relying on hospitals. They concluded: "No other paediatric problem has such far-reaching consequences. "It appears that both adults and children with asthma often suffer in silence and it is only now the full impact of the problem is beginning to be understood."
