[Word indistinct] Reza Amrollahi, official representative of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization [IAEO], speaking to an IRNA correspondent on Wednesday [12 January], said that a recent report in the U.S. magazine "U.S.A. TODAY" is sheer lies and (?part of a) U.S. plot against the world of Islam. Sergey Viktorov writes on this: We should recall that normally information by the special services of the United States form the basis of reports such as those that are being (?recently heard) in a number of Western countries. Taking into consideration the special characteristics of U.S.-Iranian relations, it is difficult to consider such information to be realistic and unbiased. Nevertheless, according to known facts, in their effort to portray the Islamic Republic as a country that has been (?rejected) by world society, the U.S. special services are willing to ignore conclusions that have been drawn by impartial international experts, something which Reza Amrollahi justly pointed out in his news conference. Last fall a group of experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspected all the nuclear installations on Iranian territory and did not find any proof that Iran is manufacturing nuclear weapons. It should be noted that all similar IAEA inspections have so far yielded the same conclusion. Moreover, it should be added that Tehran has never expressed its intention to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Pact and has also signed the agreement on (?banning) chemical weapons. Thus it appeared that the exploitation of this issue could be stopped. But this did not happen. The United States has succeeded in its efforts to convince its partners in the G-7 to join in boycotting the exports to Iran of so-called technology that can be used for dual purposes. Tehran, which was in a technoglically unfavorable position, requested assistance from Russia and China to complete the construction of incomplete nuclear energy installations, and specifically (?agreed) on the purchase of two Russian-built nuclear reactors and one Chinese nuclear reactor. However, this rekindled a more intense campaign in the West regarding Iran's ambitious nuclear programs. Russia's assurances were in vain. Russia pointed out that Russian-Iranian cooperation in the field of nuclear energy would be strictly within the framework of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Pact and under the constant supervision of the IAEA. Of course, the United States wants a more moderate government to come to power in Tehran. However, the traditional anti-U.S. remarks by the current Iranian leaders do not leave any chance for a positive change in the situation, and it seems that the West will thus continue to exploit the issue of Iran's imaginary nuclear threat. One can agree with Reza Amrollahi's remarks in his recent interview. However, Tehran's wish to (?link) itself with the world of Islam, which can recently be seen, is also reflected in these remarks. If one can [word indistinct] speak about a type of U.S. plot, it is highly possible that this plot is only against Iran. But this plot must be regarded as a confrontation between two unreconcilable ideologies.
