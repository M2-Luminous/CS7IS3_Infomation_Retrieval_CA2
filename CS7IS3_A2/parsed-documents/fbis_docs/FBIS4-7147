Having an ever-victorious and invincible mighty revolutionary Army is one of the fundamental difficulties in pioneering the nation's fate and future. The revolutionary Army is organized and led by the party and the leader. We cannot think about the revolutionary Army's existence and activities, and revolutionary armed force building and its strengthening and development, without the leadership of the party and the leader. Since the leader [yongdoja] plays a decisive role in the revolutionary armed force building, determining the might of an organized Army is dependent on the greatness of the leader [yongdoja] leading it. As history proves, an Army that fights by highly upholding an outstanding leader [suryong] and leader [yongdoja] has nothing to be afraid of, and it will always be ever-victorious possessed with an invincible might. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: The party's leadership toward the People's Army is a basic guarantee in all victories of the People's Army. It is the privilege of our People's Army today to highly uphold the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the top position of the country's national defense capacity and the revolutionary armed force, and it has become all the more strengthened and developed and an ever-victorious and invincible revolutionary armed force under his wise leadership. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is the supreme commander, developed and completed the chuche-oriented military ideology and theory, and strengthened and developed the People's Army into a revolutionary Army of one-a-match-for-one-hundred. He is a military commander of extraordinary caliber. Most of all, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il formulated the chuche-oriented military ideology and theory and war methods through the brilliant ideological and theoretical activities by linking it with the great leader's esteemed name. He also developed and completed it with new ideological and theoretical assets. Scientifically formulating and intensifying and developing the military theory put forth by the leader [suryong] is one of the fundamental problems in the cause of founding the Army of the working class and in developing the military ideology and theory. The military theory put forth by the leader [suryong] must be scientifically formulated, and its intrinsic content, structural system, and fundamental characteristics must be clarified. With this as a cornerstone, military building and military activities can be successfully realized in accordance with the leader's ideology and intention without the slightest deviation. The chuche-oriented military science, systemized and formulated by the dear comrade leader, is a perfected military science that consists of military theory and system of war methods elucidated by the man-centered military ideology and the dear comrade leader. What is especially important in the military ideology and theory newly put forth by the dear comrade leader is the ideology and theory of modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea. The ideology and theory of modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea is the highest program of military building in which the People's Army must be firmly adhered to in strengthening and developing the Army as the Army of the leader and Army of the party. Here, the ultimate goal and direction, struggle tasks, and methods of military building are wholly synthesized. The dear comrade leader also gave an overall scientific elucidation in all theoretical and practical problems arising in military building and activities, such as the ideology and theory on the essence of the revolutionary war and the inevitability of its victory; the characteristics of a modern war and the theory of building the country's national defense capacity; the method to deploy armed struggle and the chuche-oriented war method; and the chuche-oriented system and art of commanding the Army. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great leader [yongdoja] who strengthened and developed our People's Army into an Army of the party through extraordinary leadership. Endlessly strengthening and developing the Army of the working class into an Army of the leader and an Army of the party, is a fundamental problem in defending the revolutionary character of the Army and fulfill its historical mission and duty. When the revolutionary Army is made through and through into an Army of the party, the Army can become a peerless Army that defends and safeguards the party's cause with arms. What is most important in the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander's leadership in making the People's Army an Army of the party is to single-heartedly unite the whole Army based on loyalty toward the party and the leader. The respected and beloved comrade supreme commander elucidated loyalty toward the party and the leader as being of the utmost importance to the life of the army, and that we cannot fathom the army's single-hearted unity and existence. He made it so that the process of modeling the whole army after the chuche idea is to firmly establish a revolutionary view of the leader amid all the officers and men, and to bear in their hearts, loyalty toward the party and the leader as a revolutionary faith and integrity. In particular, the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander has brought forth a loyal slogan "Let Us Sacrifice Our Lives for the Great Leader!" within the People's Army and has led the People's Army to live and struggle in conformity with such a demand. Thus, he has impregnably strengthened the single-hearted unity of the entire army based on the loyalty toward the party and the leader [suryong]. Thanks to the leadership of the dear comrade leader, the single-hearted unity between the leader [suryong], the party, and the Army have become a community of one fate bound together with one life; a unified body of ideology and will held together by hearts bursting with loyalty and filial duty; and one in body and spirit upholding the comrade supreme commander with the force of arms. Firmly establishing the party's system of leadership within the army is a fundamental demand to develop and enrich the People's Army into the party's army. The respected and beloved comrade supreme commander has set up the powerful revolutionary discipline by which the entire army moves as one under the unitary leadership of the party center. Likewise, he has taken steps for commanders, party members, and the members of the League of Socialist Working Youths of Korea [LSWYK] to endlessly strengthen the organizational, ideological life with a high view of the organization. In doing so, the revolutionary work system and discipline that can firmly guarantee the uniformity of the party's leadership within the People's Army has been set up. The steel-like revolutionary military ethos in which all the officers and men move as one according to the party's order and direction was also established. In order to fully prepare our People's Army with the qualities befitting the leader's [suryong] army, the party's army, and the People's Army, the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander has paid much attention to the work to ensure officer-men unity, army-people unity, and party members-LSWYK members unity, and has wisely led the work. Thus, in our country, commanders and soldiers, the army and the people, and party members and LSWYK members are faithfully upholding the party's cause with one mind and will. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the supreme commander, has firmly brought up our People's Army as indomitable ranks possessed of the one-a-match-for-100 combat capacity. The army's combat capacity can be assessed by the superiority of its military technology and armed equipment, along with its political, ideological superiority. A war is confrontation not only of soldiers' political, ideological strength but also of fighting means and armed equipment. Such being the case, in order to prevail over the enemy, we need to endlessly promote the quality and quantity of the army's arms supply. With his insight into the role and importance of armed equipment in a war, the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander has wisely led the work to modernize the army with modern weapons and combat and technical equipment. Thus, our People's Army today has become brilliantly prepared with modern combat and technical equipment necessary for an attack and defense, and demonstrated its majestic appearance at the military parade marking the 60th anniversary of the foundation of the Korean People's Army. Important issues arising in the work to strengthen the combat capacity of the People's Army is that of firmly preparing the soldiers of the People's Army militarily and technically, and of strengthening military training strategically and tactically. Having set forth a revolutionary slogan "Training Is Also Combat" to the People's Army, the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander has led the work of strengthening training over all else. Thanks to the leadership of the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander, our People's Army has been brought as an invincible army of one-a-match-for-hundred firmly equipped with modern weapons and combat and technical equipment of our style, and possessed of high military technology and the chuche-motivated war method. With those means, the People's Army can resolutely smash any enemy and defend the chuche revolutionary cause with the force of arms. Truly, our People's Army has been all the more brought up as the invincible ranks and traversed the path to glorious victory by upholding the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the supreme commander. There is no enemy that can match the might of our People's Army that has been trained and tempered through arduous and difficult flames of struggle with the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the head of the revolutionary armed forces. Our people and People's Army, as in the past, will vigorously push ahead with the socialist construction and reliably defend the party's cause and the nation's security by firmly uniting around the party and the leader [suryong].
