PPI officials, seeking to regroup forces from the ex-Christian Democratic (DC) Party and outline a strategy and alliances for the upcoming March elections, left open the possibility of joining a right-wing alliance. Rosa Russo Jervolino and Mino Martinazzoli, respectively president and national secretary of the PPI, told a crammed constituent assembly in Rome's conference center that they would refuse to "forge alliances that would contradict the identity of the new party." Occhetto was wrong to invite the PPI to joining his progressive alliance and thus make the PPO "a satellite," Martinazzoli said to strong applause. "We are not looking for solitude, we are not against joining forces, but we have paid such a high price for our mistakes that we will never renounce our reason for existing," he said. Jervolino insisted the PPI would "maintain an identity as a party of Christian inspiration even if it should mean losing votes" and said she would set three conditions for any alliance -- solidarity, democracy and national unity. The PPI, which adopted its new name last Tuesday, has been troubled from its inception, as a break in DC ranks led to the creation of a parallel centre-right party, the Christian Democratic Centre, whose avowed aim is to form an alliance with the federalist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. Over the past few months, other former Christian Democrats have also left to join the conservative right or the progressive alliance of the left. According to a survey of 1,700 voters carried out by the CIRM polling institute for Telemontecarlo television, an alliance of the Popular Party and the "Pact for Italy" launched by ex-DC centrist Mario Segni would win 22 percent of the vote, the same as its main rival, the ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left (PDS). Segni, who is a candidate to head the future government after the March 27-28 elections, began consultations on Friday to determine who would rally to his movement which presents itself as a centre-right alliance with no ties to the neofascist Italian Socialist Movement (MSI). Segni's first meeting with Martinazzoli appeared Saturday to have led to agreement on a broad plan of action. The two men, considered in the moderate DC tradition, are seeking to enlarge their movement from its traditionally Catholic base to include lay forces. Most observers say, however, that an alliance between the Northern League and the moderate centre-right axis would stand the best chance of winning the upcoming elections. Also Saturday, neofascists and hardline communists were holding their respective congresses Saturday at a hotel close to the PPI congress. The congress of the "Refounded Communists" was in its third day at Rome's Ergife hotel, where the "National Alliance" of the neofascist MSI and other ultra-conservative leaders were also meeting. These two movements are trying to convince voters that they have become moderate enough to be able to join any future government alliance.
