The information of the press center stresses that the participants of the dialogue recognize that "the Black Sea Fleet should not become an apple of discord between the friendly states." "At the same time we should admit that the position of the Ukrainian party did not meet the spirit of constructiveness with which the Russian delegation has come to the negotiations." "There was an impression that representatives of Ukraine's Defense Ministry and Navy try to disavow the Moscow agreement dated 15 April 1994 another time," says the message. The press center believes that "the Ukrainian party admits dual interpretation of the provisions of the Moscow agreement on separate basing of two fleets and proportional division of the Black Sea Fleet. To this effect it refers to the fact that as before representatives of Ukraine's Defense Ministry "insist that Ukraine's Black Sea Fleet and Navy should be stationed in Sevastopol." The authors of this document assert that "this contradicts not only to the logic of the military theory but to the will of the Russian and Ukrainian presidents and to the last decisions of the Sevastopol city council of people's deputies." The document underlines that "the Russian delegation hopes that sound sense would prevail over political ambitions and the negotiations would continue." "The Russian party takes off the entire responsibility for the disruption of a constructive dialogue," declared the press center of the Black Sea Fleet.
