The conservative Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 1,000-word editorial entitled "Is the Government Making Proper Preparations To Cope With the Crisis Situation?" and notes the security-related ministers' meeting held in Chongwadae, presidential office, on 8 February to discuss North Korea's nuclear issue. The editorial summarizes the three main points of the meeting: One, if the United Nations impose sanctions against North Korea in the event no agreement is reached on nuclear inspections, our government will support the sanctions; two, our government will make constant efforts to hold dialogue with North Korea; and three, the current situation on the Korean peninsula is causing a degree of uneasiness among the people. The editorial notes: "What is clear at present is that there are more things we are not aware of than things we are aware of in connection with the security situation on the Korean peninsula. We are not aware of the degree of North Korea's nuclear weapon development and we do not know how it will use its nuclear card in the future." Noting the recent U.S. media reports about the tension on the Korean peninsula, the article stresses: "We should constantly review in a multilateral way our security situation and map out a policy to maintain security." The editorial notes the likelihood that because North Korea is aware of its limits in negotiations with the United States, it will participate in North-South dialogue. The editorial concludes that the government should take measures to prepare for the resumption of North-South dialogue. The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 1,000-word editorial entitled "Security Meeting and People's Attention," and notes the people's desire that "North Korea's nuclear development should be prevented without fail. However, the issue of preventing North Korea from developing nuclear weapons should be resolved peacefully and any unfortunate situation should be avoided." The editorial quotes President Kim Yong-sam as saying at the security-related ministers' meeting: "North Korea's nuclear issue is facing a grave crisis because of dissension between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, over inspection methods. Even though the situation on the Korean peninsula is not in a state of crisis situation at the moment, the cabinet should take multilateral measures against a sudden difficulty." Regarding Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit to the United States, the editorial reports: "He should persuade the U.S. Administration to understand our will to resolve peacefully North Korea's nuclear issue. He should negotiate a method with the U.S. Administration to get North Korea to accept nuclear inspections." The editorial notes the importance of the government's efforts to resolve diplomatically North Korea's nuclear issue even after North Korea's nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security Council. The editorial notes the people feel uneasy about the situation on the Korean peninsula because the government has remained silent about the spreading crisis situation on the Korean peninsula. The editorial concludes: "It is important to resolve peacefully North Korea's nuclear issue before it enters a grave stage and to implement a policy to cope with a worst case scenario. The government should not forget, however, that they should inform the people of the status of negotiations with the North, the trends in North Korea, and the situation on the Korean peninsula. By so doing, the government should seek the people's cooperation through consensus." The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3 a 1,000-word editorial entitled "The Government Should Make the People Feel Relieved" and notes recent foreign press reports that tensions have been heightened on the Korean peninsula. The editorial cites the security-related ministers' meeting held on 8 February as deciding: "The current situation on the Korean peninsula cannot be regarded as a crisis situation. Even though North Korea's defensive drills and strengthening of underground military facilities have been observed, there is no sign of an immediate military provocation." The editorial continues: "It is urgent that the government should dissipate the people's sense of uneasiness about our security situation on the Korean peninsula. The government should, above all, encourage the people to engage in their work without worrying about security because misunderstandings and rumors of a groundless crisis situation could result in considerable economic and social damage." The editorial urges the government to analyze closely North Korea's situation and inform the people of North Korea's trends. The editorial concludes: "It is necessary for the government to make efforts to strengthen the ROK-U.S. security cooperative system and to frequently inform the people and foreign enterprises of the government's policy toward the North. By so doing, the government will create an atmosphere for the people and foreign enterprises to work without uneasiness." The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article by Pak Chong-mun noting "the emergence of the pessimistic opinion that North Korea's nuclear issue is rushing toward a catastrophe regardless of one or two relevant authorities' desire to control the nuclear issue." The article summarizes "objective circumstantial factors about North Korea's nuclear issue as follows: It is highly likely that North Korea will not accept IAEA full-scale inspections in the future. If North Korea does not give a positive answer about nuclear inspections by 21 February when the regular meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors is expected to be held, the IAEA plans to report North Korea's noncompliance with obligatory inspections [uimusachal] to the UN Security Council; and the ROK and the United States will no longer be able to seek negotiations with North Korea." The article notes the IAEA and the United Nations, the ROK, the United States, Japan, and China are put into a difficult position because of objective circumstantial factors. After elaborating on the ROK-U.S. position on North Korea's nuclear issue, the article notes China's position: "China is facing a difficult position in that it can neither veto nor favor the U.S.-led resolution on sanctions against North Korea. To avoid the current circumstances, China seems to be making every effort to persuade North Korea." Regarding Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit to the United States, the article reports that "considering the fact that Minister Han has left for the United States approximately one week ahead of schedule, there seems to be reasons other than the Foreign Ministry's explanation."
