The issue was the immediate evacuation of the Jewish settlement of Hebron. The Meretz ministers and Ministers Bar'am, Namir, and Ben-Eli'ezer were in favor of the evacuation. The cabinet will not vote on the issue before next week. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, Minister Sarid is working on an alternative proposal to be raised if the evacuation idea falls through: Rabin and Peres will announce that the future of the centers of friction, such as the Jewish settlements in Hebron, Netzarim, and Kfar Darom, is to be decided within a few months, rather than after the interim period in five years. Sarid stressed that any decision on the settlements' future will be a purely Israeli decision completely unlinked to the negotiations with the Palestinians. Rabin and Peres did not announce their views on the matter, although they said last week that they were against such a move. Both Minister Tzur and Minister Shetrit were opposed. [passage omitted] Also this morning, the cabinet decided to somewhat ease the closure on the territories. According to the decision, 4,500 Arab men and women above the age of 40 will receive permits to work in Israel in the coming days. On another matter, Attorney General Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir advised the ministers that several persons, who had applauded the Hebron massacre, will be charged with agitation by the end of the week. Attorney General Ben-Ya'ir reported legal difficulties in outlawing Kakh and Kahana Hay.
