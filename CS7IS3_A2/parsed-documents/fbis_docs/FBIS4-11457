Sanchez said the agreement opens a new stage in the history of international economic relations and consolidates multilateralism. The ambassador talked at the UN Conference on Trade and Development, UNCTAD. He said the agreement "permitted us to progress in the process of reducing tariff obstacles in the industrial field, allowed us to improve the situation of agriculture and services, and facilitated the introduction of trade measures on investments at the multilateral level." The ambassador stressed the importance of adopting and improving the codes approved during the Tokyo Round of talks, which has consolidated a broad variety of norms directed at regulating aspects of international trade, providing clarity, and eliminating discretionary powers and unilateral decisions in imposing trade obstacles or applying sanctions. Another important decision was the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which will work on the liberalization process and will broaden the multilateral discipline. At the same time, the new mechanism to resolve conflicts will consolidate the legal bases of the complex system of norms, and will address problems and conflicts between trade and the environment. Sanchez Arnaud said that not all of the results of the Uruguay Round were up to expectations. The ambassador added that perhaps the greatest shortcoming was the lack of correlation between the contribution of developing countries to the process of trade liberalization and the new opportunities they will have through the proposals of the industrialized countries. The ambassador said that the second shortcoming was the limited scope of the agreement on agriculture. "My country and all other members of the `Cairns Group' of agricultural producers, which do not subsidize their production, wanted to have an agriculture agreement worked out to raise the area to the same level of conditions approved for the industrial area, particularly through internal and export subsidies and the reduction of import obstacles," the ambassador said. "The results are far from our aspirations, although we must stress that what has been achieved is the first step toward changing protectionist agricultural policies which, in the first place, affect developing countries, and secondly affect the consumers in countries encouraging such protectionist policies," Sanchez said. The lack of concrete results favoring less developed countries "is a shortcoming that concerns us all, because the solution to the grave problems affecting developing countries lies in an improvement in trade and the introduction of structural changes to increase production and improve infrastructure conditions."
