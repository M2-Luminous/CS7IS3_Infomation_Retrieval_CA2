FR940928-2-00055 FR940928-2-00047 Social Security Administration Supplemental Security Income Program; Notice of Title XVI Continuing Disability Reviews AGENCY: Social Security Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice of Title XVI Continuing Disability Reviews. SUMMARY: The Commissioner of Social Security announces that continuing disability reviews of persons receiving payments under title XVI because of disability or blindness will begin October 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anne Fulmer, Social Security Administration, 3&hyph;A&hyph;10 Operations Building, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21235, (410) 965&hyph;9053. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 221(i) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires that the eligibility of all persons with nonpermanent impairments receiving benefits because of disability must generally be reviewed at least once every three years. Section 221(i) also requires that the eligibility of persons having permanent impairments be reviewed at such times as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. In the preamble to the final regulations on ``Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled; Determining Disability and Blindness Frequency and Notice of Continuing Eligibility Reviews,'' published May 7, 1986 (51 FR 16818), we stated on page 16819 that, although section 221(i) of the Act does not mandate periodic eligibility review of persons receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments under title XVI because of disability or blindness, the final regulations extended the periodic continuing disability review procedures to title XVI blind and disabled recipients. This extension was within the Secretary's regulatory authority under title XVI of the Act, sections 1631(d)(1) and 1633, and was in accord with the legislative history of the 1980 Amendments to the Act which added section 221(i). Report No. 96&hyph;408 of the Senate Committee on Finance at page 61 states: The committee believes that such [periodic review] procedures should be applied on the same basis to the DI and SSI programs. We stated in the preamble to the final regulations published on May 7, 1986, that we would review the eligibility of persons receiving payments solely under title XVI because of disability or blindness with the same frequency as we review the eligibility of persons receiving disability benefits under title II. We also stated that this would establish consistency in the operation of the SSI and Social Security disability programs. We announced that when we began the periodic review of these cases would depend on such considerations as the backlog of pending reviews, the projected number of new applications, and the availability of resources needed to ensure careful and accurate reviews. We further stated on page 16820 of the preamble that before we began the periodic reviews of SSI cases, we would notify the public of the beginning date of the review program by publication of a notice in the Federal Register . In accordance with this statement, this notice is to inform the public that the periodic continuing disability reviews of persons receiving SSI payments under title XVI because of disability or blindness will begin October 1, 1994. These reviews will be conducted under regulations codified at 20 C.F.R. 416.989 et seq. When we begin a review of a recipient's continuing eligibility to SSI payments, we will notify the recipient of the review pursuant to these regulations.
