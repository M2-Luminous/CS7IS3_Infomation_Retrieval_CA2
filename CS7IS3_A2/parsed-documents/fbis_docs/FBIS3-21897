Citing drugs as the "single largest contributor to crime in the Cayman Islands," Chamber President Mr. Roy McTaggart announced Wednesday morning that the Chamber is going to assist the RCIP Drugs Squad in 1994 with a minimum of CI$15,000 in donations. The funds will be for payments to persons providing information leading to the arrest of drug offenders and as additional monies (outside of government funds) for the Drugs Squad to purchase equipment that will assist them in combating drug traffic and traffickers. Mr. McTaggart said the Chamber would be soliciting contributions from its members and the general public during 1994. To get the new programme started, Mr. McTaggart presented Drugs Squad Chief Superintendent Trevor Cutts with a cheque for CI$1,000 for additional equipment. Mr. McTaggart also announced the Chamber will be encouraging members to "establish firm drug policies for the workplace," in 1994. Results of similar programmes have shown anti-drug measures lower employee turnover, decrease absenteeism and result in fewer work-related accidents. He called upon Chamber members and the public to support police and the war on drugs. Drugs Squad Superintendent Trevor Cutts said he was not at liberty to discuss new types of equipment to be purchased because "I don't want to give comfort to drug dealers..." The equipment to be purchased with the extra funds will "help me and my men do the job," said the Superintendent. One piece of equipment not on the purchase list is an Ionscan machine. The machine is now in use by Customs and drugs squads at most major airports in North America as a means of detecting drugs, guns and dangerous chemicals in luggage or carried by passengers. Superintendent Cutts said while the machine is something he believes in, it's more suited to Customs operations than for drugs. But one item on his `wish list' is more officers. While many believe drugs is the number one crime problem in Cayman, the Drugs Squad operates with just 14 full-time personnel -- including the two superintendents -- and two uniformed officers on loan. That's 16 people working an average of 19 hours a day with no overtime pay. And those hours create a lot of stress on the handful of dedicated officers on the Squad, he said. But working hard against drugs "is the right thing to do," he added. The Superintendent has requested an additional 10 officers and he'll be happy with five. RCIP Commissioner Alan Ratcliffe, however, said there is "no chance in the immediate future," that more men will be assigned to the Squad. The Commissioner did note that the soon-to-be formed Special Task Force (STF) will be available for drugs squad operations if needed. Superintendent Cutts acknowledged the help of the Chamber is just a start. "I'm grateful to the Chamber but I need more help from people." By people help, he means more information from persons in the districts. He needs confidential information and he deals in confidential sources and anonymity on a full-time basis. "If we get help from the public, we can make a dent this year" on drugs and drug use. The number of drug dealers in Cayman is very small and "People know exactly who is dealing in drugs," he said. Commissioner Ratcliffe praised these latest efforts by the Chamber of Commerce in the fight against crime and drugs, saying "we appreciate what the Chamber is doing."
