Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian deputy defense minister, stated in this regard that the staff should be composed of some 250 people with 69 servicemen to be contributed from Russia's armed forces. After the cease-fire as of 1 March and the start of the withdrawal of troops and heavy equipment, the Russian part of the united staff will be immediately moved to the conflict area. The move envisions the creation of three small zonal staffs so as to enable full control over the entire area of military operations. In Georgiy Kondratyev's view, the implementation of the Moscow protocol will make it possible to pave the way for talks on a political settlement. [passage omitted] At any rate, the military situation that has taken shape allows for a somewhat greater optimism in hoping for reconciliation. During February, Karabakh's armed forces closed the gaps in their defense lines formed in the course of the New Year Azeri offensive. Azeri formations, too, are with time coming to resemble an army more and more, which unavoidably happens as combat experience builds up. This equilibrium signals the fact that there will be no territorial gains by military means. But Aliyev has been left a chance to receive "from the hands" of peacekeepers Azeri territories occupied by Karabakh's army, waiving the principle of Russian military nonpresence in the republic. This question will perhaps be postponed until the summit since it would signify a radical change in Azerbaijan's policy.
