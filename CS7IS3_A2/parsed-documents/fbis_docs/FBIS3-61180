Unfortunately, we have to register the fact that the production went unnoticed by the theater-going public--no playbills, and the tickets were distributed only among those who have proven in deed their loyalty to the idea of "national salvation" in the National Salvation Front [FNS] version. About 30 such persons have indeed been found. The congress was preceded by a thorough purge of the party, conducted after the Central Electoral Commission had disqualified a considerable number of signatures collected with the help of the Communist Party, Baburin's ROS [Russian All-People's Union], Nevzorov's Ours movement, and other kindred organizations. The first step was the unmasking of the "gang of four," headed by Dmitriy Rogozin, which consisted of members of the Constitutional Democratic Party (the Party of the People's Freedom) Central Committee, who were expelled from the organization "for losing touch with the party." A listless fight had been going on in the cadet [Constitutional Democratic Party] party for a year between the supporters of the National Salvation Front and its opponents, who considered cooperation with communists impossible in principle. The latter congregated in the Renewal Union and the Congress of Russian Communities. The events of September-October 1993 sharply changed the situation. Having agreed to consider Boris Yeltsin's actions unconstitutional, the "Astafyevites" and "Rogozinites" disagreed on a main point: The way out of the crisis. And while the former continued to follow the line of irreconcilable opposition, the latter, having encountered the inability of the Supreme Soviet's leadership to offer a constructive alternative, bet their chips on the Federation Council and the tough position of the regions. The military action at Ostankino and the White House drew the line on this discussion. At a hastily convened plenum, Mikhail Astafyev was asked to brief his colleagues on his activities in the FNS leadership and to pay the bills by giving up the position of Central Committee chairman. Mikhail Astafyev rejected the accusations directed at him, and characterized the activities of his opponents as "an attempt to split the party on the eve of the elections." After numerous violations of procedural matters and manipulation of the votes of the absent Central Committee members, delegations of regional party organizations left the meeting hall in protest. As is known, however, a sacred place is never empty, and at the next get-together, about 20 people who have never been cadet party members gathered in the hall. Among them were persons of certain renown--Artem Artemov and Nikolay Andrianov, members of the FNS executive committee. To the question when these gentlemen had managed to join the cadet party, Mikhail Astafyev answered without blinking an eye that it had happened between the two "conferences." That figures. After the suspension of FNS' activities, its membership began converging in droves under the Constitutional Democratic Party's banners. Will Mr. Astafyev continue to claim now successorship to the party of P. Milyukov, P. Struve, and V. Nabokov? According to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, it was the cadet party that expressed the interests of liberal intelligentsia, thus clearing the way for the Bolsheviks by its radicalism. Future generations do have something to blame them for. But not to this extent. A necessary afterword. In January 1994 the supporters of constitutional democracy are convening for their next congress.
