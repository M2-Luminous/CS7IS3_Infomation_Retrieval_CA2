At the start of the Fifth German Business Asia-Pacific Conference, the minister approved "political support" from the Federal Government. Speaking on behalf of over 200 participants, Siemens chief Heinrich von Pierer called for a "change of direction" in how German companies think about foreign countries and favored an "innovation partnership" with Asian economies. Rexrodt considers "company presence in the form of direct investment, cooperation agreements, and the exchange of technology and know-how" essential for Germany to meet the challenge of the Asian Pacific region of rapid economic growth. The Federal Government also wants to provide more support for German industry's foreign interests. Rexrodt rejected public export and investment subsidies, but promised "political support" from Bonn. "Business can expect politicians to seek to achieve equal opportunities, that they will help to remove political restrictions on entry to markets." In response to complaints from some conference participants that the Federal Government was doing relatively little for German business abroad, Rexrodt said: "We can only succeed in obtaining what we want if companies name specific obstacles." As far as Rexrodt is concerned, equal competitive opportunities particularly apply to finance. The minister announced that Hermes instruments would be reformed to meet new challenges before parliament's summer recess. Rexrodt rejected state-subsidized "soft loans," which governments use to assist companies in obtaining large contracts for the development of regional infrastructure. "We will not open the floodgates." On the other hand, the minister considers the protection of German foreign investment, including capital guarantees, to belong to the "core of foreign economic policy." "Advertising Germany" through fairs and technology shows is also in the state's interest and should be developed in the same way as foreign trade chambers' information and advisory networks. Medium-sized businesses should be the main beneficiary and be encouraged to view Asia as more than just a market for sales crises, but should nail their colors to the mast there permanently. Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, who welcomed the German managers who had gathered in Bangkok, also pointed to this dilemma in company strategy. He criticized "declining interest" in investment in his country and the one-sided concentration on selling finished products. Siemens President Heinrich von Pierer called for a "change of direction" in this sense. As the chairman of German business's Asia Pacific commission, von Pierer complained that the region accounted for 10 percent of German exports, but only 3 to 4 percent of German investment. Whereas Japan has invested 58 billion German marks [DM] in the southeast Asian ASEAN countries, Germany has only invested DM2 billion in this boom region with a growth rate of between 7 and 10 percent.
