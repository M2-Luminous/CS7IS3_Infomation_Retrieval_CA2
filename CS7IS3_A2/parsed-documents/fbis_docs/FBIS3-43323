I wish a prompt recovery to all the hospitalized and ill members of our families and eternal rest to those we are mourning. Dear compatriots, according to the tradition, it was on the night of 31 December 1993 that I should have expressed these wishes to you, but I opted to do it today, on the anniversary of our independence martyrs, for I want them to witness this. What was the purpose of all the sufferings they endured, even to the point of sacrificing their lives? Actually, it was to make independent Zaire a stable and prosperous country, where all citizens enjoy happiness. As one who was personally involved in their struggle, first as a participant in the January 1960 political roundtable meeting, and second as a member of the first government of the First Republic, and finally as one who continues their work, I cannot, in my capacity as head of state, remain indifferent to the disastrous situation prevailing in the country. Today's address gives me the opportunity to take stock of the state of the nation in order to draw a conclusion and the true consequences of almost four years of hesitation and confusion. Dear compatriots, in April, it will be four years since Zaire has been mired in an endless transition toward the Third Republic. Four years -- it is the duration of a presidential term of office and of a full legislature in certain countries. The year 1993 began with the (?28) January tragic lootings and ended in an unprecedented socioeconomic crisis which has become worse over the last months. I know the considerable sacrifices this crisis cost us, mainly as a result of the political instability prevailing in the country. I also know the humiliation suffered by our ambassadors and diplomats abroad as a result of many months of salary arrears. The new zaire currency on which we were supposed to found our most realistic hopes is already facing regrettably serious difficulties hardly two months after its creation. The four-figure inflation rate is an alarming sign of the situation of our national production and then there is the issue of the skyrocketing prices of essential commodities. As a consequence, your country Zaire has lost its good image while a look of general distress can be seen on the face of our compatriots. Dear fellow citizens, in all the years I have been leading the destiny of this country, I have never witnessed such an acute social crisis that does not spare any social class. Indeed, it is unacceptable that in this beautiful and rich country, cassava, rice, peanut, and sugar -- which are local products -- should go from 250 to 2500 new zaire in only a month. That is an increase of 500 percent. In the same vein, it is regrettable that the most elementary drugs should be out of the reach of modest families; that patients in possession of a medical prescription should be unable to get the prescribed drugs. Finally, what about the endless lines at the fuel stations, and the distressing spectacle of city dwellers walking from their homes to their place of work? Zaire is projecting the image of a country where poverty and confusion prevail to such an extent that prices change following mere circumstances. It can be in the morning, at noon, or in the evening. In a word, Zaire appears today as a country without a state, and its population as a completely disoriented group of people without leadership; outlaws without any central authority. My dear compatriots, if economy is vital for a country, the prevailing political climate remains the determining factor of its prosperity. In the face of the current situation of chaos and misery, only one word comes to our minds: Enough is enough. From now on, we should strive to make 1994 a year during which a genuine national policy of redress will be initiated. I will fully assume my responsibilities in order to make 1994 a year of stabilization for our institutions and rehabilitation of our country whose vocation remains to be a rich and powerful country as well as an important economic and sociocultural focal center in Africa and in the world. This policy of national reparation should be considered the duty of us all; a challenge each of us faces. It is a challenge for all socioprofessional categories -- politicians, financial backers, agricultural workers -- in a word, everybody; from the medical doctor to the medical auxilliary, from the engineer to the worker, from the managing director and general secretary to the bailiff, from the general to the soldier, from the university lecturer to the student, even from the pastor and the priest to the parishioner. All of us should come to our senses. Each of us should assume his responsibility in his own field of activity and resolutely engage on the path of national redress. Dear compatriots, now that we have conducted this in-depth analysis, I would like to particulary call on the military and the politicians. There was a time when the Zairian military was the object of our pride. I myself shared this legitimate pride for an army that I created from scratch. The army had at its disposal for its training, officers of great value, trained in the best military academies from all over the world: Belgium, China, Korea, Egypt, the United States of America, France, Israel, just to name a few. Our military operations in Chad, Togo and Rwanda, had forced admiration and respect for our Armed Forces. But our army has lost all this today because of a campaign of political disinformation that has dangerously threatened all spirit of discipline, civic-mindedness, patriotism, all qualities that make an army great. The sad lootings perpetrated in 1991 and those that followed, are a regrettable illustration of this situation. Since these unfortunate events, observers are attributing all the misfortunes of Zaire to the military. This is just too bad. The military should be aware of the fact that its contribution is essential to the policy of national reparation. Its role is to ensure order, peace as well as the security of the people and their possessions. This is essential to the survival of the nation itself. That is why, I hereby call on the military to be from now on wary of demagogic and corrupt politicians who are intent on sowing confusion and who, under the cover of the night, distribute subversive and seditious leaflets in barracks, inciting soldiers to rise against the authorities and the established order. The same politicians -- when the day comes -- are the ones who denigrate our Armed Forces and call on foreign troops. As for the politicians, I am convinced that only one logic thought should now prevail in our minds: The organization of elections. Elections that should be scheduled as soon as possible, elections before anything else. Indeed, I believe that the Zairian people need, more than ever, to be led by their own representatives, that is, men and women whom they trust. Dear fellow citizens, I hereby make an urgent call on the politicians, in particular on those who negotiated at the People's Palace, to meet again in order to draw up practical modalities for the signing of the agreements reached after their own consultations in order to enable the formation of a new government before 12 January, a deadline I consider as the only acceptable one that should not be exceeded. The political consultation that took place at the People's Palace and that lasted several weeks, resulted in several agreements. Everybody agrees in Zaire that this was an honorable compromise that can serve as an acceptable basis for a constructive, peaceful and a consensual transition. The documents on the negotiations have the great advantage of being in line with all the positive aspects of the previous documents, notably that of the Sovereign National Conference and the Kinshasa Political Conclave. Therefore, they constitute an asset for all of us. Each party has taken into account the concerns of the others; each party has made concessions and all this in the interest of Zaire and its people. The special emissary of the United Nations secretary general, Mr. Lakhdar Braimi, has said that these accords were positive. The French and Belgian ambassadors, as well as the charge d'affaires of the United States, who came to see me in Gbadolite on 10 December 1993, expressed on behalf of their governments their wish to see Zairian politicians sign these accords quickly. On this point, in order to guarantee a good conclusion to the implementation of these accords, Monsignor Monsengwo and the special emissary of the UN general secretary informed me that the two sides involved in the negotiations had expressed the wish that I should be more involved in these accords by signing them also. Without hesitation, I agreed in principle, but I am still waiting to be told where and when the signing ceremony will be held. This is why I am calling on politicians not to look in the the direction of the past that divided us, but to be involved, without afterthought or veto, in what unites us henceforth. On my part, I reconfirm once again and solemnly my determination to favor the pursuit and the conclusion of the democratization process which I personally initiated on 24 April 1990. It is for this reason that I declare my preparedness to sign immediately the accords that were concluded at the People's Palace. My dear compatriots, the implementation of the People's Palace accords should rapidly lead us, as I have just recalled, to the formation of a government that will rightfully reflect this new spirit of confidence and cooperation. It will be a representative government and sufficiently balanced in its composition where each side will be represented. During the negotiations, I carefully avoided intervening but I just said that I will accept unreservedly any prime minister that will bring back the consensus of the political class. I also said and reaffirmed more than once that I have no objection that the future prime minister should come from the opposition and that it was even my wish that it be so. The new government should be organized and should function in conformity with the letter and the spirit of the People's Palace accords, especially the special arrangement relating to the equal and balanced sharing of power. My dear compatriots, I have just defined to you the advanced stage of the degradation of our country's economic and social situation as well as the liquefaction of the authority of the state and the loss of Zaire's international prestige. This situation is due to the persistence of a confused political situation. This is why, without hesitating, I had to give precise guidelines to pull the country out of this impasse. To conclude this message, I remind everyone that: First, I have announced to the nation that henceforth Zaire is resolutely committed to the irreversible logic of elections. Everything will be done so that these elections are free, democratic, and fair all levels -- presidential, legislative, municipal, and local. These elections will be held before 31 December. Steps are also being taken to assure that international organizations as well as certain bodies that are specialized in elections can assist us. Second, I asked the negotiators at the People's Palace to sign without delay the accords that resulted from their own discussions. The deadline given to them to conclude this matter cannot go beyond eight days. Third, after this deadline, I will assume my responsibilities, all my responsibilities as head of state and guarantor of the nation. My dear compatriots, with a deep faith in the future of a great, prosperous, and worthy Zaire, I will like to express my wish that the new year brings hope for the happy conclusion of the democratic process to which we all are strongly committed. Happy New Year 1994!
