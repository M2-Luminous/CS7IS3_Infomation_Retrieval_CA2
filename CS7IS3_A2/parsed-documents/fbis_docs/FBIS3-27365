The so-called second boundary, which separates the booming zone from neighbouring rural counties, is 40 kilometres long and three metres high. "There have been more migrant workers here than ever before," Zhuhai Mayor Liang Guangda said yesterday. He said more than 75 per cent of the city's crime could be linked to such workers. Last year more than 240,000 migrant workers flooded into Zhuhai, straining the city's limited police department and social services, Mr Liang said. However, officials in Guangdong province have indicated the influx of workers into the Pearl River Estuary area has been brought under control. A cadre at the provincial Labour Bureau said yesterday "things are in order" in Guangzhou. The official refused to give an estimate of the size of the influx, but the director of the province's Communications and Transport Bureau, Li Peiwu, said this week the number of job seekers province-wide was about eight per cent less than last year's figure. Congestion on trains had decreased because an increasing number of migrant workers were using special coaches chartered by their employers, he said. Guangdong has reached arrangements with nine other provinces, including Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan and Henan, since last year to better control the flow of workers from these areas. Workers moving to Guangdong need to hold three types of identification before they can be employed. The semi-official China News Service reported yesterday that eight people were killed and six injured in a collision between a coach and a car on the busy highway between Guangzhou and the special economic zone of Shantou in southern Guangdong province.
