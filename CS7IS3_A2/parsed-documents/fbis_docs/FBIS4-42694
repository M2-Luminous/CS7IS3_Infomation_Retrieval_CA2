The Communication is to be presented by the Commission at the Heads of Government Summit in Corfu on 23, 24 June. It outlines what the Commission believes should be done "in order that the full potential of modern biotechnology for jobs, investment and growth can be realised." But environmental groups, such as Greenpeace International, are afraid the Communication might become part of EU policy before any proper examination of the risks of associated with the easing of controls over genetically-modified organisms (GMOs). The Commission's White Paper of Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment pinpointed biotechnology as one of the fields offering the greatest potential for innovation and growth in the EU. To help the industry, the white paper concluded there should be a review of the EU's biotechnology regulatory framework. That review concluded that the risks involved in the use of GMOs when the EU's regulations were developed are "substantially less than were once foreseen." For example, the potential for horizontal gene transfer resulting in novel and harmful properties being acquired by micro-organisms has not been shown to present hazards to human heath and the environment. "There is growing confidence that the GMOs used in research and in industrial production can be more precisely categorised, so that they are unable to survive except in the special environment of the experiment or process in which they are used," the Communication says. It adds that bearing in mind its findings during the review, the Commission had developed a twin-track approach to the future development of the biotechnological regulatory framework, covering: - The exploitation of existing possibilities for revising measures/procedures/degree of oversight/requirements, through use of a "light" procedure of adaptation to technical progress (via the regulatory Committee procedure); and - The bringing forward of amendments to existing legislation in order to incorporate changes which cannot be achieved by technical adaptation while leaving the basic structure of the framework intact. Put simply, the Commission wants to ease the current legislation. The particular Directives concerned are 90/219/EEC on the contained use of genetically-modified organisms and 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of GMOs to the environment. For Directive N 90/220 the Communication outlines the following objectives for further action: i) streamlining and easing of the administrative/notification/consent requirements where this does not compromise safety; ii) ensuring that the classification of the genetically-modified micro-organisms and of the activities in which they are used are appropriate to the risks involved; iii) ensuring that the conditions of use are appropriate to the risks involved; iv) extension of the flexibility of the Directive so it can be more easily adapted to technical progress by regulatory Committee procedure. In line with these objectives, this will mean that it will continue to make full use of the inherent flexibility of the Directive with the help of a regulatory committee, i.e. by: - Preparing a Decision redefining the risk categories of GMOs through the revision of Annex II; - Revising the guidelines for classification as established under Article 4.2 of the Directive as a result of the discussion undertaken for amending the criteria of Annex II; - Further exploiting the need to adapt safety assessment parameters, containment measures and required information for technical progress. The evidence and experience also indicate that the functioning of the Directive could be further improved, mainly by refocusing administrative procedures on activities presenting a risk to human health and the environment. This can only be achieved by proposing a number of amendments, since the Directive does not provide for such adaptations. Amendments will therefore be prepared, aimed at: - Replacing the consent requirements by record-keeping, or notification for information purposes, for certain low-risk activities; - Replacing the explicit consent requirements by implicit consent for certain higher-risk activities; - Reduction of time periods involved in implicit/explicit consent procedures; - Adapting the present risk classification system for GMOs, in accordance with new safety considerations; - Removal of the differentiation between activities in research laboratories and production plants. In order to increase flexibility, the Commission will propose the possibility of adapting the definitions contained within the scope of the Directive via a Committee procedure, as is, for example, at present foreseen in the case of pharmaceutical legislation. The Commission will make these proposals before the European Council to be held in Essen in December 1994, and will undertake broad consultation with Member State authorities and interest groups before doing so, the Communication says. As for Directive N 90/220, the Communication says the Commission has already made a number of technical changes reflecting the evidence acquired from the wide number of GMO releases in the plant area which were not shown to pose any specific risks. But on the "improvements" to the Directive which the Commission deems necessary, it has not drawn up its proposals because it says "further experience is necessary in order to determine the right balance between the need for safety, public reassurance, and the minimum restraint on industry and research work." The Communication also outlines other aspects of the Commission's programme to assist the growth of the biotechnology industry. These include strengthening the scientific advice available to the Commission; coordinating research and development programmes between Member States; undertaking Community initiatives and supporting small- and medium-sized businesses; improving the investment climate and raising public awareness of new technology.
