"The introduction of the dual citizenship is an element of the Russian national policy that all the leading Russian ideologists have been calling for. It would enable a hidden restoration of the former Soviet Union," Olesk warned. There are approximately 41,000 Russian citizens in Estonia, but it is difficult to establish, whether they have dual citizenship, since Russia is hiding the information, Olesk said. If the Estonian authorities do not know who the Russian citizens are, Russia can always consider any act directed against such persons as a provocation, the minister warned. These persons will be used as tools in case Russia needs to prove violations of human rights in Estonia, Olesk predicted.
