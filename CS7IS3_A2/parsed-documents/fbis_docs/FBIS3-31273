The F-16 crashed while the pilot was attempting to make an emergency landing in the former Yugoslav republic bordering Italy though it was not immediately known why. Planes at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization base in Aviano have been patrolling Bosnian skies for months and are among those that would be used should NATO go ahead with its threat to launch air strikes on Bosnian Serb forces besieging Sarajevo.
