This is what Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko thinks. In his words, Boris Yeltsin does not object to this step and also thinks it necessary to extend the period of stable work. But we remind you that in an interview to Radio Ekho Moskvy, Boris Yeltsin's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov said that Vladimir Shumeyko's initiative had only been heard of in the apparatus of the head of state today from a dispatch received there. Today the initiative of the Speaker of the Federation Council was also supported by State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin. In his opinion the idea could be implemented on three conditions, namely: If elements of stabilization emerge in the country in the next few months; if the country's legislative network is formed in the right way; and finally, if both the chambers of the Federal Assembly prove their competence. However, major factions of the State Duma were extremely skeptical regarding the initiative of the chairman of the upper chamber on extending the powers. Our correspondent reports on this: [Correspondent Ivan Tresilov] Although the factions and groups have not worked out united positions, individual representatives among them have already expressed their opinion on this. Aleksandr Savtsov, of Russia's Choice, expressed himself more accurately: I see nothing here but an attempt to buy deputies. Communist Viktor Zorkin called the proposals unethical and Yabloko member Viktor Sheynis called the move amoral. Boris Fedorov, leader of the 12 December Union, also called for holding elections at the normal time. Only leader of the Liberal Democrats [LDPR] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy immediately entered the fray and started vigorous bargaining. In his words, the LDPR will support the extension of powers if a new government is formed on the basis of his party. Ivan Tresilov, Ekho Moskvy, State Duma.
