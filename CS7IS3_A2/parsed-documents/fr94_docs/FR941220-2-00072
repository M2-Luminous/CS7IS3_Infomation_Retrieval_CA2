FR941220-2-00072 FR941220-2-00044 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [Docket No. 91&hyph;66; Notice 4] Chrysler Corporation; Grant of Application for Renewal of Temporary Exemption From Three Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards Chrysler Corporation of Highland Park, Michigan, applied for a renewal of NHTSA Temporary Exemption No. 92&hyph;1, expiring August 31, 1994 (57 FR 27507) which was granted covering three Federal motor vehicle safety standards, for electric-powered multipurpose passenger vehicles (``TEVan''). As of June 10, 1994, the company had produced 52 TEVans under the exemption. Its application for renewal was accompanied by a copy of its original petition, and NHTSA interpreted this action as an indication that the company intended to repeat its original requests and arguments. Notice of the application was published on August 3, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 39631). This notice grants a renewal of the exemption. The TEVan is an electrically driven version of the Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager multipurpose passenger vehicle. If the exemption is renewed, modifications will be made to production Dodge and Plymouth vans manufactured between September 1, 1994 and August 31, 1996. Although a successor to the current van will be introduced within this time frame, ``electric conversions of that new platform will not be ready for production initially'' and Chrysler is planning ``to produce the current TEVan versions until the new electric conversion units are ready for introduction.'' The TEVan was developed in cooperation with the Electric Power Research Institute, U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium, and the United States Department of Energy. The basis for the petition was that a temporary exemption would facilitate the development and field evaluation of a low-emission motor vehicle within the meaning of 49 CFR 555.6(c). The vehicles use electric motors powered by nickel-iron or other equivalent batteries that replace the internal combustion engine. According to Chrysler, the TEVans meet the California Air Resource Board zero emission requirements, and are low-emission vehicles as defined by section 123(g) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (now 49 U.S.C. 30113(a)). The TEVan differs from regular production vans as follows: The internal combustion engine, transmission, coolant system, power brakes, gasoline fuel system, and power steering system have been replaced by an electric drive motor, a nickel-iron or equivalent battery pack, a micro-processor based battery management system, a controller-converter-charger unit, a two-speed manual/automatic transmission, and electric-motor-driven pumps for the vacuum power brakes and the hydraulically assisted power steering. Finally, the hot water heater/defroster unit is replaced by an electric resistance type heating/defrosting system.
