"The government-proposed budget program is insufficient as a means of boosting the nation's economy," LDP President Yohei Kono said at a news conference after meeting with the premier in the Diet building. Citing the shortage of time for Diet deliberations, Hata refused to comply with the LDP's request for the extra money, Kono said. "The government should take more active economy-spurring steps," the LDP chief said, adding, "I am a little concerned as to whether (Hata) really understands the importance of pump-priming measures." The LDP, toppled from government last summer for the first time in 38 years, will submit to the Diet a motion calling for the additional 1.9 trillion yen in the government's 73.1 trillion yen draft budget for the current fiscal year, which started on April 1. The long-overdue budget is scheduled to clear the decisive House of Representatives on Wednesday evening. The LDP's modification plan will demand additional spending on public works projects, subsidies to private schools and financial assistance to small and medium-sized companies, among other things, LDP officials said. It will also call for 800 billion yen in additional outlays for public works and 900 billion yen to support small enterprises, the officials said. Under the proposal, the extra money should be financed through dipping into reserves, the issuance of public bonds and by cutting administrative costs, they said. Kono has repeatedly warned the LDP will file a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet once the budget wins Diet approval.
