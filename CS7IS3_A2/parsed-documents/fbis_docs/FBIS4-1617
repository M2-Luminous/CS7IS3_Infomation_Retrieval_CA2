People also have new ideas of how to participate in politics, such as holding assemblies and demonstrations. A survey shows that when asked about their attitude toward holding demonstrations, more than half of the interviewees said that they should be held if necessary. Thirty percent of the interviewees said that it is better not to adopt such means. Nearly 8 percent of the interviewees said under no circumstances should people take to the streets and hold demonstrations. However, results of the survey show that when common Chinese people wanted to criticize the government for certain policies or practices, their first option was to "report their views to party and government departments concerned," and holding assemblies or demonstrations was their last option. This research, directed by Zhang Mingshu, associate research fellow of politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, is one of a series of surveys on national conditions organized since 1988 by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. More than 2,000 people living in 13 large, medium-sized, and small cities were interviewed. The method of random sampling was used. Major results of the research are published in the new book entitled "`Political People' in China." Zhang Mingshu made a further explanation about the survey, saying that some people regarded politics as a field in which morals, sincerity, and conscience were totally lost, but most Chinese citizens held that politics were not something bad. During the survey, the latter expressed that the government was an organ for the administration of public affairs of the people and they hoped that the government could do more for them. Therefore, in their participation in politics, Chinese citizens always trusted and depended more on the governments and organizations concerned and showed relatively close cooperation with the ruling party and the government in the course of participation. Zhang Mingshu said that these features in selecting a means for the participation in politics of Chinese citizens were great "political resources" of the government. When they wanted to express their views on government policies and behaviors, nearly 26 percent of the interviewees optioned to report their views to government departments concerned, 15 percent of them favored reporting their views to the leadership of the respective units, only 1.3 favored holding demonstrations, and only 1.8 percent favored holding rallies. Nevertheless, more than half of the interviewees held that holding rallies and demonstrations can be a means to be adopted when necessary. Since 1954, all constitutions of China state that holding demonstrations is one of the basic political rights of the citizens. However, in 37 years from 1949 to 1986, basically no large-scale demonstration was held by citizens to criticize government policies in China. After the survey, Zhang Mingshu put forward suggestions concerning policies. To the portion of citizens with a relatively high political quality, such as intellectuals, personalities of the democratic parties, young students, and so on, it is necessary to adopt flexible methods, to provide them with more opportunities to participate in politics, and to eliminate intermediate obstacles so that their views and suggestions can reach the ruling party and government through normal channels, the situation at the lower levels can be made known to the higher levels, and the democratic channels are unimpeded.
