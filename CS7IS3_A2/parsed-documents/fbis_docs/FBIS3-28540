He watered down U.S. press reports and analyses of escalating tension on the Korean peninsula, disclaiming them as coming from outside the Washington government. "The South Korean and U.S. Governments hope to solve the problem through dialogue as much as possible," Han said in a press conference on the eve of departure to Washington. "We cannot but seek other measures if this (dialogue) fails. This has been our stance and still is," he said. Han did not believe North Korea was trying to get more carrots from the United States in exchange for accepting IAEA nuclear inspections. The North Korea-IAEA standoff probably has more to do with the change of mood at the negotiation table, Han analyzed. "It's not true that there was no progress in North Korea-IAEA talks. The two sides had significantly narrowed their gap," Han told reporters. The South Korean foreign minister will be in the U.S. capital Wednesday to Saturday, roughly 10 days before the Feb. 21 "deadline" when the IAEA Board of Governors is certain to discuss North Korea's non-compliance with the Agency's inspection demands. The Washington visit is tied with his trip to Canada and Mexico, the two other parties to North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Han is set to meet Secretary of State Warren Christopher, National Security Advisor Anthony Lake and Defense Secretary William Perry. "We will be reconfirming the basic principles, direction and methods, exchanging evaluation and analyses on recent developments on North Korean nuclear issue," said Han. "Depending on how the matter proceeds, we will talk about cooperation with the United Nations and other involved nations such as China and Japan." Whether diplomatic efforts end with North Korea rests with the IAEA, according to the foreign minister, who must decide when its safeguards activities on North Korea have ceased. The end of safeguards activities means the IAEA can no longer guarantee that North Korea is not diverting its nuclear materials and facilities to military use, he said. "Such declaration is entirely up to the IAEA. We will respect the IAEA decision and comply by it," said Han, "We will also respect, participate and cooperate with any decision the U.N. Security Council makes on the issue."
