But then again, the marasmus is gaining strength. Judging by everything, they have even managed to make a fool of the president himself, the supreme commander-in-chief. In his message to the Federal Assembly, Boris Yeltsin gave quite high marks to the course of Armed Forces reform which cheered up the highest Russian generals. One of the key ideologues of military reform, Assistant Minister of Defense for Military Policy Lieutenant-General Gennadiy Ivanov, officially stated at a press conference that Yeltsin's very positive response on the course of military reform attests to the "correctness of the path selected by us". But then it has not been excluded that the positive presidential response on reform was also prepared in the bowels of the Ministry of Defense, and that General Ivanov himself had far from the last participation in it. Let's pose the question this way: Does Yeltsin know about the state of military reform? As a General Staff officer who worked quite a bit in its structures, as an official who is often in the troops and who is well acquainted practically with all of the information that affects the assessments of the state of combat readiness of the Army, I dare to assure you with all responsibility that the supreme commander-in-chief knows exactly as much about the state of affairs in the Armed Forces as the minister of defense and his closest entourage want him to. General Pavel Grachev at one time admitted that he contacts Yeltsin on a daily basis at a strictly determined time and reports the most recent and the most important things which occurred in the Army. (Let it be on the minister of defense's conscience that he doesn't always manage to do that -- it has happened that he has been unable to reach the president for three-four days). And now imagine that Grachev day after day reports the same thing to Yeltsin: combat training of ground troops and naval forces is being disrupted everywhere. The moral-psychological state of personnel is declining. Theft of arms and ammunition is not ceasing. Money is not being issued to personnel in a timely manner, and because of that strikes are already beginning in units. Nearly 60 percent of the combat pilots have long ago forgotten what it is to fly systematically. Plans to introduce housing for homeless servicemen are not being carried out. New combat equipment is practically not entering the troops and the fleets. Scientific and experimental design work has been reduced to 10-15 percent. And so on and so forth. We would all need to be too naive, and the minister of defense too bold for us to be able to believe that. Grachev understands very well: if he day in and day out honestly confessed all of this to the president, the quick-tempered Boris Nikolayevich would take it up one day and would not mince words: if everything is falling apart in the Army, why does it need you in the role of minister? Only both of them know precisely how and in what form Pavel Sergeyevich reports to Boris Nikolayevich. But we already know for certain what the supreme commander-in-chief's opinion is on the state of combat readiness of his Army. In that same (already half-forgotten) message to the Federal Assembly, he suddenly arrived at the conclusion that the combat readiness of the Armed Forces is at a level that permits it to reliably ensure Russia's military security. It's easy to guess who led the president to a conclusion that is so dreadful in its unfairness. There's no doubt that it was first and foremost he who is directly responsible for the Army's combat readiness. On this score, I will say in passing that it would be good to have an article on false reporting of progress on an especially large scale (from 10 to 15) in our Criminal Code. In order to realistically judge the true state of combat readiness of the Army and Navy, it would be sufficient for the clerks from the presidential staff to request restricted analytical documents and report back materials from the Main Military Inspectorate in which they would discover, to their great horror, a conclusion that only 1-2 divisions in each military district and only 1-2 ships in each fleet are combat ready today! And that is the main and most honest conclusion on the primary result of military reform. And based upon it, now judge the "correctness of the path selected by us" which both the minister of defense and his court theoretician of military structural development so stubbornly attempt to convince their fellow countrymen. The combat readiness of the Army is a state category. And he who thoroughly deceives his own people with regard to its actual state is certainly committing a state crime. But who today could place an objective report on the actual state of the Armed Forces and on the results of reform on the desks of the president, the chairman of the Council of Ministers, and the chairmen of both houses of parliament? I can boldly dare to assure you -- no one. And this is why. Approximately two-three years ago "democratically minded" political figures and people's deputies aggressively spread the conclusion that the so-called Ministry of Defense Main Inspectorate was incapable of objectively assessing the level of combat readiness of ground troops and naval forces because it is organizationally part of the military department, and is directly subordinate to the minister of defense who, naturally, is to a considerable extent an interested party. And that was the absolute truth. I personally have repeatedly had the opportunity to participate in the work of teams of main inspectors in military districts and groups of forces, and to write report back and analytical documents. The results of the inspection depended to a very large extent, for example, on how we were received in the military district or group of forces, how the personal relations of the minister of defense and the commanding general or main inspector had developed, and what quantity of boxes, with all kinds of gifts from those being inspected, the inspectors transported back to Moscow. There are many "interesting" episodes in my memory. For example, at the beginning of the 1980's, a team of Ministry of Defense inspectors traveled to Germany with the undisguised mission of replacing Group of Soviet Forces in Germany Commander-in-Chief General of the Army Ivanovskiy. Few people knew at that time that on the eve of our trip Yevgeniy Filippovich had "poorly received" the marshal-inspector, his wife, and children for rest. Therefore, the inspection was excessively strict, and the result of it was that Ivanovskiy and Group Political Directorate Chief General Ivan Mednikov were removed at practically the same moment. It is an altogether different matter when the commanding general prepares beforehand, say, a collection of precious stones. In the Far East they sent entire teams of explosives experts into the mountains to extract them. After summing up the results of the inspection, each inspector received large amounts of red caviar and smoked fish. Once they surreptitiously handed the chairman of an inspection team an enormous unique coral for which the fleet's best scuba divers dove into the depths of the sea. As was customary, they carried an identical gift to Moscow for the minister of defense (an inspection gift for the minister was considered to be an unwritten law for many, many years). Of course, all of the primary combat readiness assessments of the inspected formations and units had to depend on the quantity and quality of the gifts, the generosity of the tables that were set three times a day, the content of the so-called cultural program (fishing, hunting, swimming in unique sources, baths, saunas, and visiting the families of the commanders being inspected where "by chance" there frequently turned out to be single women and also married garrison women, and, after a certain amount of contact with them, an inspector did not really want to write in the inspection report that not one of the company's tanks had hit the target...). An off-color Army anecdote even existed on this score. A not completely sober inspector says to the regimental commander in the morning: The battalion is satisfactory but the company is unsatisfactory! The regimental commander quickly determined what was wrong with the inspector and poured into a glass: And now the battalion is satisfactory and the company is outstanding! And when active conversations occurred that General of the Army Konstantin Kobets as the main military inspector would allegedly be directly subordinate to the president, it became clear that now the Ministry of Defense anticipates difficult times. But the music played for a short time. "Having hung around" for a period of time in an undetermined state, Kobets with the entire inspectorate was returned to the native bosom of the Ministry of Defense, and is directly subordinate to Grachev. Moreover, Yeltsin also assigned Kobets as deputy minister of defense. Well, judge for yourselves. Say Kobets traveled to inspect a military district. He brought back a grade of two from there. Naturally, Grachev is unhappy. How do you report that to the president? Naturally, they talked. Naturally, they agreed on the fact that "individual shortcomings" exist. And that is already easier -- where aren't there individual shortcomings now? Therefore, should we report them that way? Order. Let's also assure you that "we are at the guaranteed level". And if it isn't guaranteed, Boris Nikolayevich will remove them. Matters are being reduced to extraordinarily strange things. Today, it is being announced that the Northern Fleet is the best in the Russian Navy, but tomorrow practically all of the mass media report that the wives of military seamen have gone on strike and have blocked the runways: their husbands are not being paid on time, they are not being provided with apartments, the apartment buildings are cold, and there is nothing to buy in the stores. And the combatant commanders themselves say that recognition of the fleet as the best in the Navy -- is blasphemy. You only reflect: it was named the best, and, therefore, the most combat ready, not the vegetable store, but the entire fleet, the Russian strategic combat unit. And you would read what the reports from the fleet say about the state of combat ships and coastal facilities, about reserves and the availability of fuel-lubricants and other materials. It's no accident that one submarine commander bitterly joked: "It will soon reach the point if just one ship from our fleet leaves the quay -- they will then recognize the fleet as the best...". In the Ministry of Defense Main Military Inspectorate they know very well precisely what criteria are being utilized to determine the combat readiness of a military district or fleet. Minister of defense and chief of the general staff special orders or directives have long existed on this score. Naturally not only the main inspectorate, but also the commander-in-chief directorates of the services of the Armed Forces must be strictly guided by these criteria. But what actually happens? I visited the Pacific Fleet last year on an inspection trip with the deputy commander-in-chief. And, suddenly, soon after that we read in KRASNAYA ZVEZDA that the fleet's combat readiness will largely be assessed based upon the results of the live firing... of just one ship which the admiral visited. Well that's a fine how-do-you-do! For such a "criterion" to be more understandable for a civilian reader, I will say that this is practically the same as arriving at a conclusion about the normal state of both arms and legs based upon one finger. But that shouldn't happen. Whom are we deceiving? Ourselves. One general even contrived to use a word like "nedoboyegotovka" [not quite combat ready] while talking about the criteria of the state of combat readiness of a division in the troops subordinate to him. This is something like "nedoberemenna" [not quite pregnant] or "nedoubita" [not quite killed]. Today, as never before, an epidemic of gigantic false reporting of progress and lies has swept over the Army. The generals inspect themselves, they assign grades to themselves, they themselves develop the criteria of the state of the troops and fleets, and they themselves ignore them, if they see that the state of affairs does not reach even a primitive "three". General Konstantin Kobets' main military inspectorate has actually been transformed into a well trained and devoted dog of the minister of defense. It can vigilantly protect his peace or subordinates who are sympathetic to him can "bite" those being fined. Recently PVO [Air Defense] Commander-in-Chief, Colonel-General Viktor Prudnikov "had the gall" to notify the former Supreme Soviet that the air border defense system is dying due to the Ministry of Defense's inaction and its conciliatory position. The matter at times reached the point where foreign and Russian aircraft that were flying, say, from a Westerly direction had already nearly penetrated to the skies near Moscow. And what about the minister? Not only did he severely criticize the PVO commander-in-chief, he also appointed an investigation. It's clear -- that it was appointed to remove the garbage from the "Arbat Hut". Rumors are already circulating that Prudnikov will soon leave his post and will move to another, less visible post. And, of course, "according to his own desires". And in the background of this state of affairs in the Army, General Grachev and his team are furiously whispering into the president's ear that reforms in the Army are proceeding at full speed. And with each passing month this lie is being increasingly and more obviously transformed into a means of survival of the generals in their high posts. Of course, these are not the generals who courageously placed the barrel of their pistols to their temples when it became obvious that their troops are not combat ready or when they learned that they had been totally misled in the assessments of the state of affairs. In my opinion, they themselves are sooner ready to give the pistol to settle scores with the lives of those who suddenly detect that a gigantic deception is being created and whose conscience is beginning to torment them. Let's pose a simple and clear question: what are the specific results of military reform after its first stage? The father of military reform, General Ivanov, and the minister of defense always begin by saying: first of all the Ministry of Defense was created. Maybe they built a new building? Did they lay thousands of lines of communication? Did they select new staffs? Did they purchase furniture or electronic equipment? Of course not! They obtained all of this -- durable capital -- in enormous quantities from the old Soviet Ministry of Defense. So, where is the matter right now, just where is reform? And it turns out that reform is limited to replacing blank forms, stamps, and name plates from offices, redrawing the diagram of the organization of the military department, altering the names of certain directorates and departments, and rewriting functional duties. Perhaps that's all. But then again, how loudly it sounds -- "the Ministry of Defense was created". And later the most ordinary chaos began which both General Grachev himself and his closest subordinate today call reform. They all have repeatedly asserted that the Army will be reduced, and, therefore, the Ministry of Defense itself will be reduced. And at the same time the number of Grachev's assistants has increased to seven, and the authorized strength of the military department has increased by approximately a factor of 1.5. The number of generals on the ministry's floors has also increased. It has reached the point where general's ranks have even been awarded to those who were in colonel's positions. General's shoulder boards have even been donned on a man who is responsible for the electric light bulbs and carpeting, the decanters and toilet paper. Sometimes you get the impression that Grachev and his assistants are playing at reform of the Ministry of Defense staff. And how can you say otherwise if the names and functional duties of many directorates and departments have been changed from three to five times, their chiefs have been replaced, and the transfers of enormous masses of people from offices to offices have been carried out over the course of one and a half years. The missions of some structures have been transferred to others, then the missions have been returned, again "taken away", and later it suddenly turned out that two and sometimes three directorates or departments were involved with one and the same issues. And so on --without end. That leapfrogging has laid additional financial burdens on the military department, and, based upon the simplest calculations, has cost the taxpayers many millions of rubles. And, judging by everything, a new spiral of organizational-staff leapfrogging awaits the ministry already in the near future. The Ministry of Defense leadership, while attempting to pass off the desired as the actual, quite often resorts to primitive ruses that are calculated for simpletons. For example, the reduction of the Army is being passed off as one of the key directions of reform. Grachev and company also often place this process in the same rank with the so-called "results" of military reform. But why make fools of the people? The reduction of the Army is a process that goes without saying. Hundreds of thousands of officers and warrant officers are leaving the Army based upon years served, according to their own desires, or due to illness. And many, putting it mildly, "are leaving". So where is reform here? Here for some reason I'm reminded of the episode of a story where a bureaucrat, who didn't have anything to report back to the leadership on the work completed, wrote in the report: "Organized the onset of evening". Take any strategic direction of military reform and you will see that the state of affairs there is extremely insignificant. Yes, for instance, the lack of budget resources for manning of the troops with contract personnel which both the minister, his deputies and his assistants love to boast about. From the very beginning, it was clear that the introduction of contract service in the current situation of financial starvation was the purest folly. Initially, R6 billion (prices at the end of 1992) was allocated for 100,000 contract personnel. Already a year and a half later it has become clear that inflation is literally gobbling up this sum before our very eyes. It has been barely enough to pay the salaries of contract personnel. And it was contemplated that they would be provided separate housing or a dormitory with all of the comforts, that their work day would be standardized, and that they would have quite a few advantageous social benefits. It has turned out that all of this is once again a lie. People don't even have the opportunity to bathe with hot water. And they are writing many letters of complaint to the president and to the minister about how they were grossly misled. Deception has become an integral element of military reform because it sort of compensates for its absence. Today, the Army has barely enough money to pay the salaries of personnel. It's no accident that they say when Chief of the General Staff Colonel-General Kolesnikov, during his meeting with students of the General Staff Academy, was asked by the students which of the Army's missions does he consider to be most important under current conditions, he flabbergasted everyone with his brief answer: "To survive!". Not only that but also many other examples attest to the fact that military reform is becoming increasingly covered with the dirt of immorality. Many honest generals and officers of the Ministry of Defense and General Staff treat with great caution, for example, that "secret chemistry" which is being created in the issues of financing the troops. Ministry of Defense Main Directorate for the Military Budget and Financing Chief Colonel-General Vasiliy Vorobyev was recently compelled to frankly admit a number of devastating facts. Here is just one of them. R3 million that had left Moscow for the Northwestern Group of Forces has been lost no one knows where for approximately 1.5 years. Something similar was repeated several months later but with a much larger sum. Experts have calculated that during the time when the military money "traveled around the world" it could be circulated from three to six times and receive a profit that totals tens of millions of at that time "wooden rubles". General Vorobyev bemoans the fact and sighs. He said these are the procedures that we have! The main military financier tries to prove that he aggressively looked for the money and wrote dozens of letters. But that, in my personal view, was only a false imitation of concern. They didn't try too hard to find the money, allowing it to circulate even more. Because with the sincere desire to "find tails", both the minister and his treasurer could have put, as they say, the investigators on their ears and could have closed the case in a month maximum. But that did not occur. And in the ministry they are already openly talking about the fact that A CERTAIN FINANCIAL MAFIA EXISTS THAT CIRCULATES MILLIONS FROM THE MILITARY BUDGET AND FOR SOME REASON THOSE WHO SHOULD ARE NOT RUSHING TO SORT THAT OUT. No matter which sphere of military reform you poke with your finger, you see lies, hypocrisy, deception and the powerlessness of our highest military leadership everywhere which is attempting to put up a bold front. For example, the minister of defense quite recently announced to the entire world that the housing problem in the Army will be resolved already in 1996. Who convinced him of the possibility of doing that -- is unknown. The concept of military reform was publicized in 1992 and they divided it into three primary stages. But Military Structural Development and Reform Directorate Chief General Ivanov is already announcing some sort of new variants of structural development of the Russian Army after 1995. And where then do you hide the previously approved "general plan" of military structural development? You can't make heads or tails of it. Sometimes we in the General Staff get the impression that not staid generals are involved with military reform but children who do not know what they should do with the complex electronic toy. But it's no accident that one of the deputy ministers of defense was recently compelled to frankly call all of this the "the triviality of dilettantes".
