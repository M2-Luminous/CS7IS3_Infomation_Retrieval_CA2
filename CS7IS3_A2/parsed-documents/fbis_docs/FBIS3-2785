He probably thought that with the threat to rescind China's most-favored nation [MFN] trade status, China would make concessions to his human rights diplomacy, and thus he would be able to announce to the world that it was effective to use the human rights issue to engage in blackmail. He did not expect that his practice would never be effective with the Chinese people. Yesterday, the Chinese leaders bluntly told him that China would never accept the U.S. concept of human rights. The U.S. human rights diplomacy really has run into snags in China, a country with a population of 1.2 billion people. The Chinese leaders pointed out that China and the United States have no common ideology and values, so it is natural that they hold different points of view on human rights. China is a developing country, and the population of the developing countries in the world accounts for four-fifths of the world's total population. It is unfair to impose the human rights concept of the developed nations on the developing countries. Moreover, the U.S. accusations concerning China's human rights problem were aimed merely at encouraging a very small number of criminal offenders, and it is a matter of certainty that China could not accept them. In fact, apart from the human rights issue, there remain differences between China and the United States in many aspects. It is ridiculous to require China to accept the U.S. position on every issue. There are indeed differences between the two countries, and this can be solved only through consultations on an equal footing and in a spirit of mutual respect, through efforts to seeking common ground while reserving differences. At the same time, China is willing to maintain and develop relations with the United States. It holds that to do so is in the common interests of both countries and is beneficial to both nations. However, while pursuing its human rights diplomacy, the United States went so far to unreasonably link bilateral trade with the human rights issue in an attempt to force China to accept its human rights position. It threatened to rescind China's MFN trading status if China refused to do this. Indeed, they regard this as an effective "weapon," and have been wielding it again and again over the past few years. Some Americans wrongly thought that the MFN status was a great "favor" they gave to other nations. This practice of theirs was opposed, even by some of their allies. On 12 March, the head of the EU delegation in China reiterated: "The European Union does not agree with the practice of linking the human rights issue with trade." This time, the Chinese side frankly expressed its position to Christopher, and also put all its cards on the table. If the United States indeed rescinds China's MFN status, then it will only ruin the prospects for Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations. Thus, China will not be the only one to suffer losses, and the United States will suffer losses no less than those suffered by China. China's development will depend mainly on its domestic market, and China has strong capability for self-reliance. The United States, however, will lose a huge market. China has expressed its position very clearly, and it is the U.S. Government that should make the choice. It is believed that the Chinese Government has made good preparations against various possibilities and will not hold any unrealistic illusions. China has learned a good lesson from last year's "Yinhe" accident and the disgusting performance of some U.S. congressmen in opposing China's bid to host the Olympic Games. At last year's Seattle meeting, U.S. President Clinton repeatedly said that the United States supports a strong, stable, and prosperous China. Facts show that the words and deeds of many U.S. officials went against this promise. They just tried by every possible means to create trouble between the two countries, and their purpose was simply to obstruct the appearance of a strong, stable, and prosperous China. It is a pity that this is only their fond dream.
