In a statement at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, where he stopped over en route from Malaysia to his country, Izetbegovic said that the efforts of the UN Security Council and international organizations have so far failed to stop the Serbs. A NATO operation would bring peace, Izetbegovic reiterated, adding that the delay in such an operation has caused the deaths of 200,000 people and the occupation of 70 percent of his country's territory. In response to a question on the Turkish and Pakistani prime ministers' plans to go to Sarajevo, Izetbegovic said: Let them garner their courage and come. We are waiting for them. Commenting on his visit to Malaysia, Izetbegovic explained that he was very pleased with his brief visit and received significant support from the Malaysian Government. In his statement after seeing Izetbegovic off, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said that the recent developments concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina were assessed. Cetin remarked that during the meeting with Izetbegovic, views were also exchanged on the conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina to be held in Geneva on 10 February.
