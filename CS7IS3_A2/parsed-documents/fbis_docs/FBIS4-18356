The government has talked about an attempt to create artificial tension and the official opposition leader today called for lodging a demarche with Turkey. Our correspondent Roula Kambouryianni has the following report: [Begin recording] [Kambouryianni] Official opposition leader Miltiadhis Evert today said: Any new aggressive action against the patriarchate must be considered by Greece as casus belli, that is a cause for war. Mr. Evert called upon the government to lodge a demarche and seek action by the World Council of Churches. [Evert] On the verge of the 21st century, it is not possible that similar actions are taking place in any part of the world, no matter how backward it may be. [Kambouryianni] Commenting on Evert's statement, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos pointed out that the patriarchate knows very well how to conduct intrachurch relations. He added that the Greek Government's absolute support for the patriarchate is a given fact. Mr. Venizelos further noted that the initiative by Archbishop Iakovos [of North and South America] to brief U.S. President Clinton on the issue falls within the same framework. The government spokesman then recalled the historic presence and international status of the patriarchate and stressed that many circles in Turkey are trying to cultivate a climate of artificial tension between the two countries. Commenting on the Islamic provocations against the patriarchate, Public Order Minister Stilianos Papathemelis emphasized today that a firm answer is needed from our side. The Ecumenical Patriarchate and Patriarch Vartholomeos have become the target of the Islamist municipal authorities. Islamist Mayor of Istanbul [name indistinct] said: I will pass through the "gate of hatred." He meant the patriarchate gate that has been closed since 1821 when [Patriarch] Grigorios V was hanged there. The Istanbul mayor added that he will not allow the revival of the Byzantine state that the patriarch allegedly seeks. [end recording]
