But Bruguiere found there was no case to answer against a 45-year-old Iranian woman and an Iranian man, Saili Majid, who was sought under an international arrest warrant. Bakhtiar and his secretary were shot and killed in the Paris suburb of Suresnes on August 6, 1991. The next stage in the French judicial procedure is for the Paris appeal court to rule whether the case should be brought before an assize court. On January 24, the public prosector reached the conclusion that the Iranian secret service provided logistical aid to the killers. Bruguiere confirmed charges of murder and terrorist-related conspiracy against Iranian Ali Rad Vakili, who was arrested in Geneva and extradited to France. Complicity charges against Iranian businessman Masud Hendi, 45 and Zeynal Sarhadi, 26 were also confirmed. Hendi is alleged to have helped two of the three alleged killers to enter France and Sarhadi, a secretary at the Iranian embassy in Bern, to have aided one of them to escape. Sarhadi was also extradited from Switzerland, causing a crisis in Swiss-Iranian relations. Bruguiere confirmed six international arrest warrants in the case, two of them against the two other alleged killers, Mohamad Azadi and Farydoun Boyerahmadi. According to Hendi, the assassination was ordered by Hossein Sheikhattar, an advisory to the Iranian telecommunications minister, judicial sources said.
