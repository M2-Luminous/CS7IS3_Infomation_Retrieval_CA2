We discussed this issue--why, even at the cost of certain known risks or disadvantages of this method--with Milan Janicina, minister for the administration and privatization of national property. [Zvach] So, Mr. Minister, why? [Janicina] The main reason is that we do not have the domestic financial resources, including credits, which are very hard to get. Moreover, the influx of foreign capital is not as great as we would wish, for reasons I do not want to go into now. Set against this, there is the need to privatize a certain amount of property. And so, coupon privatization really seems to be the most viable starting point. In addition, this is, in fact, the most open and clear method of privatization, and many people are calling for openness. Quite simply, it is very difficult to "procure" property here for a "party" friend. This leads to one thing--to again place this method on a par with the others. [Zvach] But this will not solve the lack of capital.... [Janicina] It is necessary to realize here that the aim of coupon privatization is not to gain capital but to transform ownership. However, a certain percentage of the shares, which will be earmarked for sale, will bring capital to a specific interested party. [Zvach] There is still some anxiety that certain investment funds may, because of a lack of money, follow the path of foreign loans and so, in the end, a considerable proportion of our enterprises may end up uncontrollably in the hands of foreign owners. Has the government considered this risk? [Janicina] We know about this risk. Capital is, however, international, and every economy faces a similar risk. This is really a matter of the seriousness or lack of seriousness of the approach of the individual funds. It cannot be ruled out, but we must take this chance if we want to proceed. We cannot talk ad infinitum about how and why something will not work. We simply cannot turn Slovakia into a fortress that could survive on its own. [Zvach] Incidentally, the risk is the same with any influx of foreign capital, including direct capital. It is always possible to consider whether the foreign partner is, let us say, merely interested in gaining control of our markets and destroying domestic production. Is it ever possible to completely eliminate these risks? [Janicina] Absolutely completely not. This is always connected with the appropriate agreement and the competence of the people who conclude it. We must never view an agreement only through the promises or obligations a foreign partner takes upon himself. The most important thing is to specify precisely these obligations in the agreement and then discuss exactly the sanctions that will be imposed if these obligations are not adhered to. If we proceed in this fashion, and, moreover, if we verify the seriousness of our partner beforehand, the risk, if not ruled out, is at least minimized. [Zvach] In conclusion, something that perhaps interests the citizen most. Do you have any specific ideas yet about the price the citizen will pay for a coupon book and about the time frame for coupon privatization? [Janicina] All of this will be discussed at the next government session on Tuesday, 26 April. I am personally of the opinion that the price of a coupon book should not be higher than in the first round--that is, 1,000 korunas. In my view, there are even sufficient reasons for the price being lower. We will not itemize now. As far as the dates are concerned, according to our proposal, the registration of citizens should begin on 1 September 1994. The registration of investment privatization funds should also begin on the same date. The subsequent preliminary round--that is, ascribing the investment coupons to the funds--could begin on 3 October 1994, and the second round could begin on 2 January 1995. We are allowing for a total of five rounds; the last one should begin on 1 May 1995. So, in essence, we would like to complete the entire process within a year.
