FR940224-0-00075 FR940224-0-00017 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 642 [Docket No. 930791&hyph;3191; I.D. 021594A] Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Trip limit reduction. SUMMARY: NMFS reduces the commercial trip limit of Atlantic group Spanish mackerel in the southern zone to 500 pounds (227 kg) per day in or from the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). This trip limit reduction is necessary to protect the Atlantic Spanish mackerel resource. EFFECTIVE DATE: The 500-pound (227-kg) commercial trip limit is effective on February 18, 1994, at 12:01 a.m., and remains in effect through March 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark F. Godcharles, 813&hyph;893&hyph;3161. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The fishery for coastal migratory pelagic fish (king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, cero, cobia, little tunny, dolphin, and, in the Gulf of Mexico only, bluefish) is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils (Councils) and is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 642, under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. An adjusted allocation and commercial trip limits were recommended by the Councils and implemented by NMFS for Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel for the current fishing year April 1, 1993, through March 31, 1994 (58 FR 45847, August 31, 1993). As set forth at 50 CFR 642.27(b), the adjusted allocation is 4.25 million pounds (1.93 million kg). In accordance with 50 CFR 642.27(a)(2)(iv), after 100 percent of the adjusted allocation of Atlantic group Spanish mackerel is taken, Spanish mackerel in or from the EEZ in the southern zone may not be possessed aboard or landed from a vessel in amounts exceeding 500 pounds (227 kg) per day. NMFS has determined that 100 percent of the adjusted allocation for Atlantic group Spanish mackerel from the southern zone was taken by February 17, 1994. Accordingly, the 500-pound (227-kg) per day commercial trip limit applies to Spanish mackerel in or from the EEZ in the southern zone effective 12:01 a.m., local time, February 18, 1994. The southern zone extends from the Georgia/Florida boundary (30 ○42 ’45.6 ’ ’ N. latitude) southward to the Dade/Monroe County, Florida, boundary (25 ○20.4 ’ N. latitude). Classification This action is required by 50 CFR 642.27(a)(2)(iv) and (b). Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.
