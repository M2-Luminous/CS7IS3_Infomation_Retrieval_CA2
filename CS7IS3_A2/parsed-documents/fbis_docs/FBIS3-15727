According to "Gazprom," Ukraine continues to syphon off up to 25 percent of Russian gas which goes to West Europe through the Ukrainian territory. As a result, "Gazprom" has to pay big fines to foreign consumers of Russian gas. Russia's hard currency losses amount to half a million dollars a day, the ministry experts said. Well-informed sources in the same ministry told Interfax that Russia may demand Kiev pay the fines to foreign partners and reimburse its debt for Russian gas already delivered that experts estimate at 1.5 Tn rubles. In addition, Moscow intends to demand guarantees of free transit of its gas through the Ukrainian territory at the talks between the heads of the Russian and Ukrainian gas complexes scheduled for March 10.
