He recalled with indignation that he was put to all tortures and maltreatment by South Korean fascist hangmen while spending 34 years in prison after being taken prisoner by the enemy during the fatherland liberation war. "It is because I fought, regarding the great general as my mental support that I could win defending my revolutionary constancy, refusing to recant my belief in this period," he stressed. Saying the destiny of the Korean people and the future of the socialist homeland lie in trusting and following the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, he asked the chairmen to do their bit in rearing trade union members as loyal subjects with a strong faith.
