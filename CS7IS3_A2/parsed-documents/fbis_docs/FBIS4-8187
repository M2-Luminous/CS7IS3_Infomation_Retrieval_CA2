We are not ruling out fresh strikes, but if there are any, we will take certain political and military steps, Krajisnik said. However, we cannot abandon Gorazde because before the war 35 percent of its residents were Serbs. We cannot watch and do nothing while the Muslims are constantly mounting provocations from all three protected areas. This is what happened this time as well. The world should know that this area will never be calm unless the causes of the conflict are removed; and they lie in the Muslim violations of the agreement on protected areas. Answering a question by a Radio Obrenovac [in Serbia] journalist, of whether yesterday's events will influence diplomatic activity and postpone the negotiations, Krajisnik said: We cannot remain indifferent to what the Muslims are trying to do, but despite everything, we have not closed the door on negotiations and on establishing peace.
