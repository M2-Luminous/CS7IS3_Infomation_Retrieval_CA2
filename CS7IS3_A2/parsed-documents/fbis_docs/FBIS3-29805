The head of the delegation said Comrade Yi In-mo maintained his faith and will as a communist for scores of years behind bars in South Korea and this is an example to be followed not only by the Korean people but also by the world communists and revolutionaries. He stressed that any enemy can never bring the Korean people to their knees because they have the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] which produced such incarnation of faith and will as Yi In-mo and they are wisely guided by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. A member of the delegation Sandra Bains said it is an intolerable crime that the South Korean puppets had kept him behind bars for 34 years, putting him to all manner of inhuman persecution. Noting that it was possible in the socialist homeland that Comrade Yi In-mo recovered his health, she said that while in Korea, the delegation could see socialism of Korea advancing dynamically. Comrade Yi In-mo said he regained his life under the deep loving care of the great leader and the dear leader. "I could undauntedly struggle, maintaining my faith and will, because I deeply trusted only the WPK, the leader and the socialist homeland," he added.
