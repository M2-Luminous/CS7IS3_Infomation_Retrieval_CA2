"I will confirm again that I did not beat anyone and committed no illegal acts, either during or after 1956. I stand before the electorate with a clear conscience," he said. HSP Chairman Horn said he has established that the bulk of the blame for the mud-slinging campaign against himself and the HSP lies with the government that exercises control over Hungarian Television, and with the senior politicians and parties of the governing coalition. The document states that the Socialists do not wish to apply unworthy means to succeed; on the contrary, they seek national reconciliation. It goes on to say that should the electorate put their confidence in the Socialists, they will make every effort to ensure that the change in government takes place in keeping with European standards. HSP Acting Deputy President Imre Szekeres said that over the past few weeks Hungarian Television aired incredibly spiteful statements and that this practice must be brought to a halt. The party has resolutely protested even before this time, and now Horn has called for a greater deal of calm and fair-play, Szekeres said.
