FR940224-0-00017 FR940224-0-00002 Since adoption of the initial recordkeeping requirement, the annual survey has grown in size and complexity. Bank holding companies have become increasingly large and diversified, and commercial organizations have acquired credit card banks and limited purpose banks. Thus, for example, a small, grandfathered bank owned by a large diversified holding company may have hundreds of affiliates with thousands of officers and directors. Although the bank may have no contact with these officers and directors and companies controlled by them, it currently is required to collect information on all these parties. In another example, a CEBA credit card bank is prevented by law from making loans to anyone but individuals, 2 and is thus effectively prohibited from lending to insiders' related interests, but the current rule nonetheless requires the bank to conduct an annual survey of related interests. 2 See 12 U.S.C. 1841(c)(2). On September 9, 1993, the Board published notice of proposed rulemaking and requested comment concerning alternative recordkeeping procedures that banks may follow to monitor loans to insiders of the bank and its affiliates. See 58 FR 47400. The Board proposed to allow each bank to decide on its own how to gather information on related interests, so long as its method was effective. For example, in the case of a nonbank credit card bank or other bank that does not make commercial loans, the bank could decide not to keep records on related interests. For banks that make commercial loans, two acceptable recordkeeping methods were identified: (1) The ``survey'' method currently required, under which all insiders are asked annually to identify all their related interests; and (2) the ``borrower inquiry'' method, under which the bank would (a) ask each commercial borrower as part of the loan application process whether it is a related interest of an insider of the bank, and (b) maintain a record of each affirmative response. Finally, the proposed rule sought comment on whether any other recordkeeping methods would be effective in monitoring compliance with Regulation O. The draft GAO report, discussed above, urged the federal bank agencies to emphasize the importance of accurate and complete insider recordkeeping. Management recordkeeping failures, the GAO argued, were indicative of larger bank management problems, and management solutions in this area, the GAO reasoned, would contribute to the resolution of management's larger problems. The Board believes that the proposed recordkeeping amendments, which attempt to eliminate unnecessary recordkeeping and allow for alternative methods of recordkeeping, are consistent with the GAO's recommendations. Commenters supported the recordkeeping amendments as a means of decreasing unnecessary paperwork burden. Commenters uniformly supported no longer requiring credit card banks and other institutions that do not make commercial loans to keep records on the related interests of insiders. No commenter proposed any general recordkeeping methods in addition to those identified in the rule. A few commenters expressed concerns about the second recordkeeping option put forth in the proposed rule_the ``borrower inquiry'' method. Commenters noted that in some cases a corporate borrower might be unaware that it is a related interest of a bank insider and therefore might inadvertently misinform a bank's loan officer. For example, a corporate employee negotiating a loan may not know that one of his company's controlling shareholders is also a director of one of the lending bank's affiliates. Citing this possibility, several bank commenters supported the recordkeeping provision but requested that the Board specify that use of the borrower inquiry method would give a bank a ``safe harbor'' from criticism during an examination in the event that inaccurate certifications were accepted from borrowers. On a related point, two commenters sought assurance that internal controls consistent with the proposed recordkeeping alternatives would meet the compliance certification requirements of section 112 of FDICIA. The Board believes protections currently exist to prevent intentional misreporting by borrowers under the borrower inquiry method. Intentional misreporting could bring criminal or civil penalties. First, a borrower that knowingly misstates whether it is a related interest of the lending bank is criminally liable. 18 U.S.C. 1014. Second, a bank insider to whom the corporate borrower is related and who is aware of the loan violates Regulation O if the insider permits the related interest to receive any extension of credit not authorized under Regulation O. 12 CFR 215.6. The Board has also concluded that any unintentional misreporting should not be a matter of serious concern. While there could be cases in large multi-bank holding companies where a borrower and lender are genuinely ignorant of the relationship between them, there is no potential in those circumstances for an insider's status to improperly affect the credit decision. The Board has decided to adopt the recordkeeping provisions, as proposed, with three amendments. First, in order to address concerns about inaccurate reporting, the Board has adopted an additional safeguard to prevent the occurrence of those reporting errors, both intentional and unintentional, that are likely to occur most frequently and that raise the greatest concern. The final rule establishes a minimum requirement that every bank, regardless of the recordkeeping method it selects, must conduct an annual survey to identify its own insiders (that is, its own executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders and their related interests, but not those of its holding company affiliates). Every bank is expected to check this short list before extending credit, even if it is employing the borrower inquiry method of recordkeeping for affiliates in lieu of the survey method. In addition to addressing possible violations of Regulation O, the limited survey and the short list it produces will be available for monitoring compliance with section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
