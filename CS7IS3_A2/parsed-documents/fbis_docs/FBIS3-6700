"(The prime minister) should clear up the allegations and at the same time he should seek cooperation from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on policies," Watanabe said. If Hosokawa does not want to do so, he should dissolve the lower house and call for general elections, Watanabe added. Watanabe, who was both deputy premier and foreign minister under the cabinet of former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa from 1991 to 1993, made the comments in Kanazawa while stumping for an LDP candidate in the Ishikawa gubernatorial race. The lower house budget committee has been unable to begin deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget program for more than a week because of the controversy over Hosokawa's receipt of 100 million yen from now-defunct Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a scandal-ridden parcel delivery trucking company and part of the Sagawa Kyubin group. The LDP has refused to agree to budget debate unless Hosokawa produces additional documents concerning the scandal. Hosokawa has insisted he borrowed the money from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin in 1982 to repair his home in Kumamoto Prefecture and to buy a condominium in Tokyo. He said he fully repaid the money by January 31, 1991, using part of his retirement allowance as Kumamoto governor. Hosokawa served two four-year terms as governor from 1983 until February 1991. The LDP and other critics suspect that Hosokawa received the 100 million yen from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin to help finance his gubernatorial election campaign.
