Members of the rightist opposition voiced skepticism. Yesterday, 4 May, Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa Serrano confirmed the government's plan to sign a cooperation agreement with Cuba though he reiterated that an eventual resumption of diplomatic ties with Fidel Castro's government is not on the list of subjects that the Chilean Government will assess in the short term. Today, Socialist Party President Camilo Escalona said his party "enthusiastically supports" the tightening of friendship and cooperation ties with the Cuban people. Christian Democratic Party [PDC] President Gutenberg Martinez asserted his party is in favor of cooperating with Cuba "from a solidarity viewpoint in view of the difficulties the Cuban people are enduring," adding that cooperation "should be granted without imposing any conditions." Martinez also upheld the end of the U.S. economic embargo on the island because, in his opinion, this might encourage the Cuban authorities to implement a greater economic and political domestic opening. Martinez will preside over a PDC delegation that will travel to Cuba this month. Chilean Communist Party leader Carlos Toro asked Eduardo Frei's government for the immediate normalization of diplomatic relations with Cuba while Radical Party President Senator Anselmo Sule commented that there is a certain degree of cooperation with Cuba. Sule mentioned a $10 million credit the Chile State Bank recently granted the Cuban Government to finance the purchase of Chilean foodstuff and added that Chile can cooperate with Cuba "in several aspects." Sule said that among the incentives are the activities that some Chilean companies are developing in Cuba, the extension of export credits to that country, and the promotion of social development actions on the island. The rightist Democratic Independent Union (UDI), voiced its agreement with the establishment of a cooperation program "that does not encourage the perpetuation of the current Cuban regime." UDI Senator Beltran Urenda, member of the Senate's Foreign Commission, believes any aid for Cuba "should seek a change in the Cuba Government, a democratic opening." He said "any support" that may help Fidel Castro's regime to remain in power "is dangerous."
