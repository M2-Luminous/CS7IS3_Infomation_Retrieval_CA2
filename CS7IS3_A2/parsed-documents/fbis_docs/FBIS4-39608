Meeting journalists at the Russian embassy in Paris on Wednesday, Kozyrev said that no other country is ready to follow Russia's suit so far. The decision to send peace-keepers to the war zone has nothing to do with the imperial policy or irresponsibility, he added. This is a normal policy of a responsible country which closely cooperates with the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, he said.
