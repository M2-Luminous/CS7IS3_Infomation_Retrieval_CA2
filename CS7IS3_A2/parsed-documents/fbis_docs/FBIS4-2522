China has preliminarily brought in line with international practices its own legal system regarding copyright protection, thus showing that China has basically established a copyright system. Since last year, the State Copyright Administration and local copyright administrations have formulated and perfected a series of regulations and operating procedures governing copyright administration. At the same time, they have strictly enforced relevant laws on copyrights and have cracked down on all kinds of serious copyright infringement cases. Over the past year, while investigating and dealing with a batch of key copyright infringement cases concerning foreigners, the State Copyright Administration took disciplinary actions against 11 domestic units and individuals. Modern copyright protection systems such as the collective copyright administration system and the copyright agent system have been established and gradually perfected in China. The Chinese Association for Music Copyrights has gradually standardized its operations. The Chinese Transaction Center for the Payment of Copyright Use has scored preliminary results and has effectively protected the legitimate rights and interests of more than 300,000 authors. At present, 16 copyright agencies have been set up and authorized to serve as a bridge for introducing Chinese works to overseas markets and for bringing excellent foreign works into China. Since promulgating the Copyright Law in September 1990, China has signed major copyright conventions, including the Bern Convention, the World Copyright Convention, and the Phonographic Record Convention, and it has established ties with more than 100 countries to protect mutual copyrights.
