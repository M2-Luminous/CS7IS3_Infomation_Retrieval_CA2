The managers of 28 very big U.S. companies arrived together with him. On the list of Brown's audiences were several ministries (the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Ministry of Fuel and Energy, Ministry of Economics, and Ministry of Finance), Yuriy Petrov, the head of the Russian Investment Company, and the prime minister himself, Viktor Chernomyrdin. Along with the general situation in Russia, specific questions were also discussed--the participation of American firms in projects to develop the Sakhalin shelf, investments in Russia, and access for its commodities to U.S. markets. The secretary of commerce used the occasion to express concern over the increase in import tariffs in Russia. He reported that he does not share the opinion that is current here, particularly in the Ministry of Economics, that protectionism will attract investments (the argument of the Ministry of Economics is that in order to overcome the barrier to imports, foreigners will create production in Russia). Brown's mission, obviously, is to dot the "i's" with respect to other problems--the fate of the most expensive IBM project in Russia (at a cost of $130 million), which is being financed by the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] ($40 million), and the U.S. Export-Import Bank ($90 million). There is the question of replacing the long obsolete Sirena-2 computer system used in the sale of air tickets. Not long ago a competitor appeared for the IBM project: The Department of Air Transport of Russia has proposed phased modernization of Sirena-2 for a total of $40 million. However, this plan, other than its relative cheapness, is also different in that it is based on a sharp reduction in the volume of air traffic and threatens to turn into "patching up holes" (if it has a temporary character). Brown will try to convince Moscow that the popular idea of "supporting domestic producers" is not always justified from the standpoint of long-range interests. The secretary of commerce regards discussion of various forms of assistance to the development of small and medium-sized business in Russia as one of the leading themes of his negotiations in Moscow. As Ron Brown likes to say, the strength and power of the United States have always increased precisely owing to the "increase and expansion of small and medium-sized firms." Obviously, it is exactly in this connection that he planned a visit not only to the Russian capital: Questions of increasing the effectiveness of American assistance programs to the private sector will be a subject of discussion in St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg. In addition, in the opinion of the secretary expressed in an interview just before departing for Moscow, the aid given should be oriented on intensifying the export potential of the private sector. But, in the opinion of the U.S. secretary of commerce, it is also called on to be the main object for American export to Russia. Washington is pursuing quite reasonable economic interests: An increase in the volume of exports of $1 billion will lead to an increase in the number of jobs in the United States by 20,000. Moreover, the American administration does not conceal the fact that it is still early to view trade and business with Russia separately from politics. For, as he figuratively expressed it at yesterday's negotiations, "stability and predictability are the sisters of investment."
