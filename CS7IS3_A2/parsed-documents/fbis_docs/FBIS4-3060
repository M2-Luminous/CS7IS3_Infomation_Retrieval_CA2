Spokesman Major Dacre Holloway today. The spokesman said that under the agreement, a 350-strong U.N. force will go into Gorazde, home to 65,000 residents and refugees, in Southeastern Bosnia. Yasuhi Akashi, the chief U.N. representative for former Yugoslavia, had been informed today of the Serb decision in Pale, the stronghold of Bosnian Serbs, where Akashi and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had been meeting in a bid to break the deadlock over the enclave. the serbs, besieging Gorazde for nearly two years, have agreed to withdraw their weapons from within a three-kilometer zone around the city, to be followed by talks on a more permanent exclusion zone later, the U.N. spokesman said. Meanwhile, Akashi is negotiating with Bosnian Serb leaders on a truce for the Muslim enclave and the release of some 200 U.N. personnel. According to the latest news reports, 19 Canadians -- 16 U.N. soldiers and three military observers -- were released by Bosnian Serb forces outside Sarajevo on Sunday, three days after they were detained in retaliation for NATO air strikes. Two NATO air strikes in the past two weeks, provoked by the Serb siege of Gorazde, had heightened tension between the Serbs and the U.N. The agreement also provided for a multinational peacekeeping battalion of British, French, Ukrainian, Egyptian and a small Nordic medical unit to enforce the truce and restore calm in the area, Holloway said. It was unclear so far when the U.N. troops would move in.
