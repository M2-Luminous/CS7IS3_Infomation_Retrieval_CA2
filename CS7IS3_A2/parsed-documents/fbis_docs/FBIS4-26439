When drawing the outlines of the magnificent blueprint for striding forward toward the 21st century, Tianjin's people have vividly summarized the blueprint as the goals of "three, five, eight, and 10." That is, to quadruple the 1980 GNP in 1997, three years ahead of schedule; to basically complete the rebuilding of dangerous and shabby houses in urban areas in five to seven years; to readjust and renovate through grafting all large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in about eight years; and to basically complete the building of the new coastal area in about 10 years. At present, the implementation of these four fighting goals are being organized in a planned and step-by-step manner. The Demand of the Situation, and the Expectation of the People The raising of these four fighting goals is not the subjective assumption of a certain person or some persons, but is the objective demand of Tianjin's development and the expectation of Tianjin's people. The sixth municipal party congress and the first session of the 12th municipal people's congress, held last year, defined Tianjin's overall development target and set forth the demand of using 20 years' endeavor to make Tianjin one of the areas in China that basically realize modernization and to build Tianjin into the commercial, trading, and banking center of northern China, into a comprehensive industrial base that is advanced in technology, and into a modernized international big port city opened to all directions. To this end, we must turn goals and tasks into specific actions based on the analysis of Tianjin's situation and the overall situation, must map out plans and arrangements for several stages, and then carry out these plans and arrangements step by step. The goals of "three, five, eight, and 10" have been defined around the fulfillment of the overall target after many investigations and appraisals were conducted. These four goals are internally connected with one another and affect and supplement each other. In the overall plot of the acceleration of Tianjin's development, we have given prominence to appropriately handling the relations between existing enterprises and new enterprises. On the one hand, we have stressed the endeavor of invigorating existing enterprises and grasping the readjustment and renovation of old enterprises; and, on the other hand, we have stressed the necessity of cultivating new and major economic growing points. In the economic layout, we have stressed the development of new areas and the rebuilding of old areas. In the priorities of development, we have given prominence to invigorating large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and developing rural economy. In the relations between production and livelihood, we have defined the necessity of regarding the improvement of the people's living standards as the starting point and the ending point of all work on the basis of developing production. Being examined and approved by the municipal people's congress last March, these four goals have evoked strong repercussions among Tianjin's people, and the vast numbers of cadres and the masses have been inspired by these goals. Most people maintain that these four goals are not only realistic but also press the people to forge ahead; and these four goals are not only the demand of the situation but also the expectation and the voice of the vast numbers of the masses. Many people say that all localities in the country are now vying with one another in developing themselves, Tianjin, as a municipality, should be even more rapid in the pace of carrying out reform, opening up, and economic construction. We have the wish and the vigor to let our hometown develop at an even faster pace and become even more beautiful. These four goals have let us catch sight of hopes and have a bright prospect. In particular, the goal of rebuilding all dangerous and shabby houses in five to seven years has enjoyed popular support and become the central topic talked by the people at streets and lanes. As said by the common people, "there is no need to enter the 21st century by living in old and shabby houses built in the thirties and forties." Drawing the Concerted Efforts of All Fronts Realizing these four fighting goals is a grand, huge project all fronts should make concerted efforts to realize these goals. To this end, the municipal government has exerted great efforts and strengthened the organizational leadership over the realization of these goals. A leading group for realizing these four goals has been organized with Mayor Zhang Lichang as its head. This leading group has four subteams with responsible vice mayors as their heads and relevant commission, bureau, district, and county responsible persons as their members. Offices subordinate to the subteams have been established to take charge of day-to-day investigations, coordination, and supervisions. So far, four subteams have convened meetings on several occasions, defined overall plans and annual plans for implementing these four goals, also divided the tasks among each level, set up a system for assessment of targets, and done their best to firmly attend to the implementation of these goals. For instance, the subteam of the new coastal area emphatically studied the plan of the key coastal development area and defined the dividing lines of the new coastal area. The new coastal area covers five districts (including Tanggu, Hangu, Dagang, and parts of Dongli and Jinnan), and 20 townships. It occupies an area of 350.36 square kilometers. This area is a new rising area whose prospects for economic development are greater than any other areas in Tianjin as well as one with the highest degree of opening up, the widest coverage of policies, and the best infrastructural facilities. The new coastal area will develop 188 square kilometers in the next 10 years or by 2003. At that time, its gross domestic product and foreign export value will account for 40 percent, respectively, of the municipality's total. This year, its GNP will increase by over 20 percent and surpass the growth rate of the municipality. So far, the construction of some key projects is in full swing. The 140,000-ton ethylene, 200,000-ton polyester, Jinnan-Hangu highway, and Dagang-Tanggu highway projects are under full construction. The pre-phase preparatory work for the Beitang power plant, the project for diverting Luanhe water to Hangu, and the third coal gas plant is in full swing and these projects are being listed for examinations and approvals. Tianjin Harbor is accelerating its construction pace and is to obtain a capacity of annually transporting 500,000 standard containers to foreign countries and to possess 40 million tons of loading and unloading capacity. The development zone should continue to keep the leading positions in the whole country in terms of the fulfillment of its targets. In the first five months of this year, the development zone made new headway in inviting businessmen and bringing in capital. A total of 233 foreign-funded enterprises of three types have been approved. The investment in these enterprises totals $747 million. The investment scale of the projects averages at $3,056,400. The municipal economic, commercial, and communications committees conducted deep and thorough investigations on readjustment and transformation of old enterprises with foreign capital, worked out specific plans for transforming state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises step-by-step, and also prefulfilled the tasks for readjustment and transformation with foreign capital in the next five years. Of the municipality's 748 state-owned large and medium- sized enterprises, 214 should fulfill the tasks for readjustment and transformation with foreign capital this year and 143 should fill the tasks next year. That is, 48 percent of the large and medium-sized enterprises should be transformed in 1994 and 1995. The municipal economic committee urged that through grafting readjustment and transformation, 318 large and medium-sized enterprises should realize the quadrupling tasks three years ahead of schedule. In 1997, the total industrial output value should reach 74.59 billion yuan and the profits and taxes realized by the industrial enterprises should reach 10.27 billion yuan, respectively, increasing by more than 600 percent and 400 percent over 1980. The grafting readjustment and transformation of the commercial department's 80 large and medium-sized enterprises are under smooth progress. Ten joint ventures have made preliminary achievements in grafting transformation, 11 enterprises have made progress in readjustment and transformation, and the reconstruction and expansion of nine large-sized retail sales shopping centers are under full swing. Implement These Goals Step by Step To Achieve Initial Results The key to realizing the four goals is to do a good job in taking the first step and to have a high starting point. If we do a good job in the first year, we may enhance the spirit, boost morale, and lay a foundation for future development. To realize the goal of quadrupling the GNP three years ahead of schedule, from 1993 to 1997, we must increase the municipality's GNP at an annual progressive rate of over 11 percent, and this year we plan to increase the GNP by 12 percent. This requires our efforts to conscientiously grasp well all quarterly and monthly economic tasks. Judging from the operational situation of this year's first quarter, the development rate and efficiency were fairly good. The whole municipality's GNP reached 15.415 billion yuan, up 12.4 percent over the same period last year, thus attaining the required progress. Of this, 296 million yuan came from the primary industry, up 4.4 percent; 9.72 billion yuan came from the secondary industry, up 12.1 percent; and 5.399 billion yuan came from the tertiary industry, up 13.5 percent. From January to May, the total output value of industrial units at and above the township level across the municipality reached 37.669 billion yuan, up 16.6 percent over the same period last year. The project of renovating slum houses that draws the attention of the people across the municipality has been smoothly carried out. The municipal leading comrades have traveled to the construction sites to give work guidance and help solve problems on many occasions. Six districts in the municipality have taken quick actions, grasped this work firmly, done solid work, actively collected construction funds, expanded the strength to invite business and introduce capital, and unceasingly accelerated the progress of renovating slum houses. From January to May, the municipality as a whole demolished a large area of slum houses totalling 520,000 square meters, built houses covering an area of 4.29 million square meters, completed the construction of 438,000 square meters of houses, and enabled 10,019 residents to move into new houses. On the basis of sizing up the real situation, industrial enterprises have accelerated the pace in grafting, readjustment, and transformation of old enterprises. They signed 66 contracts on utilization of foreign capital from January to April. The total volume of contracted investments reached $448 million, and the volume of contracted foreign capital reached $251 million. Of this, 53 items were on grafting and transformation of old enterprises with foreign capital, the total volume of contracted investments reached $396 million, and the volume of contracted foreign capital reached $214 million. A good development trend has emerged in the construction of a new seaside area. At present, the whole line of the Tianjin Port-Tanggu highway has been initiated. Most of the earthwork of the Tianjin section of the Shanhaiguan-Guangzhou highway has been completed. The Xinhua Road overpass in Tanggu is expected to open to traffic by the end of June. Construction of a heat and power plant and a water plant in the development zone is in full swing. The Nanjiang bridge project at the port area is progressing smoothly. The intangible conditions for building the polluted water disposal center are being strengthened, and the pre-phase preparatory work for building the energy wharf has been comprehensively carried out. We will sow what we reap. This year's opening situation is quite good and the trend is excellent. We are convinced that as long as the higher and the lower levels across the municipality work with one heart and one mind, unite as one, and make indomitable and unremitting efforts, we will surely attain the "3.5.8.10" fighting goal on time or ahead of schedule, and Tianjin will surely have a more brilliant future.
