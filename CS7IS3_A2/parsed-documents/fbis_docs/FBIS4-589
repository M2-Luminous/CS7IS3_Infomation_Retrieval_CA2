Mr Dabengwa, who was responding to questions at a sub-regional seminar on human rights, said as far as he knew Mr Mugabe was "unaware of what was happening" and had ordered an inquiry into the leasing of land, ZIANA news agency reported. So far 98 farms have been given to mostly senior government officials and civil servants under the scheme. The inquiry comes at a time when the ruling ZANU (PF) [Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front] is reported as having called upon the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Water Development to cancel the farm lease agreements and distribute the land under the resettlement scheme. Party secretary Moven Mahachi was quoted as having told the party's official news organ, THE PEOPLE'S VOICE, that: "The position of the party is that the land belongs to the people and not to a few individuals"; and, "the Ministry of Lands should cancel all these leases and continue with the resettlement exercise. State farms should not be allocated to a few black elite. The party should make sure that position is maintained." Mr Mahachi was quoted as saying while the party was not against individuals acquiring their own farms, he did not subscribe to the idea of a few black elite benefiting from land bought by the state at the expense of the majority.
