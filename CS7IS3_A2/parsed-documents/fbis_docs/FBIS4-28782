The statement said the Zionists had created a false terrorist scenario. It added that Iran opposed and condemned all forms of terrorism against the life of innocent people and regarded them as inhumane and un- Islamic. Earlier, the Iranian Government through its Foreign Ministry protested against the Thai police's arrest of three Iranians on charges of colluding to bomb the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok to avenge the Hebron massacre. One of those arrested was suspected of being the driver of the bomb-laden truck which was involved in an accident near the Israeli Embassy and who had subsequently fled abroad. The Thai officials did not disclose how they had obtained information about the terrorists. By charging that the Zionists had created a false scenario, the Iranian Embassy was probably referring to any Jewish group or person. Zionist is the definition of a Jewish who seeks to create a Jewish nation. A Jew who believes in this doctrine works openly or secretly, and sometimes illegally, to achieve his goal without regard to the effect his action may have on others. Based on this characteristic of Zionism, Iran has charged that Thailand was being used by Zionists as a tool to create hatred toward it. As a member of the mass media not under government control, we wish to argue against the Iranian Government. Thailand is independent and neutral in its relations with other countries. It treats all countries equally. It does not engage in prejudice against any person. If a person is suspected of a crime, he will be arrested for questioning. It is inappropriate for the Iranian Government to use Thailand as an arena for international political conflict, particularly as Thailand has good relations with Israel as well. A religious dispute exists between Iran and Israel. It is inappropriate to make an accusation against Thailand over the arrest of Iranians suspected of a crime in Thailand. The Thai Government has the perfect right to investigate and try the suspects free from interference by any government. We do not want to see Thailand used by any country as an arena for waging a cold war or any kind of war. Regarding the Iranian Government's reminder to Thai officials to promptly process the case for the sake of clarity, Thai officials are already doing so with due care. A reminder from any government is not necessary because the case affects Thailand's security. The Thai people earnestly desire the case to be solved so that Thailand will not be viewed suspiciously by other countries, which would affect foreign investment and trade. If the suspects did not commit any wrong doing or if there is insufficient evidence, we are confident that the Thai court will dismiss the case. Therefore, we urge the Iranian Government to treat Thailand fairly. It should not feel that Thai officials might be so gullible as to use information from the Zionists to convict the suspects. The Iranian Government's action is regarded as interference in Thailand's internal affairs. If it persists, obstacles will result in its diplomatic relations with Thailand, despite the fact that trade and political relations between the countries have been proceeding smoothly with very few problems. Please cease your interference in an internal affair that affects only Thailand's security and public safety.
