On the last day of his visit in Uzbekistan, Chinese Premier Li Peng, accompanied by Uzbek President Islam Karimov, visited this plant. At 0930, the state guest motorcade drove in the aircraft plant surrounded by green trees. When Premier Li Peng got out of the limousine, he was welcomed by Uzbek girls wearing ethnic dresses. Carrying trays with both hands, the girls offered the guests bread and salt according to local custom. Young boys played drums and trumpets to express their warmest welcome to the distinguished Chinese guests. In the assembling workshop full of thundering machines, (Kuchelov), chief engineer of this plant, briefed Premier Li Peng in detail on the situation and production technological process in the 62-year-old aircraft production corporation. As he listened to the briefing, Premier Li Peng watched various equipment and components with keen interest. He frequently went near working tables, shaking hands and exchanging greetings in Russian with workers. (Kuchelov) said: The Chkalov Aircraft Production Corporation mainly manufactures cargo planes and assembles passenger planes for civilian use. The plant is named after Chkalov, a test-flight pilot serving in the early days of the plant. After completing several arduous tasks, he died in a test-flight mission. This plant is named after him and his statue stands in the central part of the plant yard. Stopping in front of a large plane soon to be completed, Li Peng inquired in detail about the plane's functions. (Kuchelov) said: It is the latest IL-76MF cargo plane with a carrying capacity of 210-tonnes; it will be tested this year. It is expected to leave the plant in 1996. He added: "I hope we will manufacture this kind of plane for China in the near future." After they walked out of the workshop, Li Peng and Karimov mounted a just-completed IL-76TD cargo plane with a carrying capacity of 40-tonnes. The host said happily: Last year, this plant produced 7 planes of this kind and delivered them to China this February. Li Peng walked into the specious cargo bay and closely watched the technical demonstration of the opening of the cabin doors. Assembling workshop director (Lafemov), who has worked as a technician in China for two years, told reporters: After its independence, Uzbekistan established direct ties with China; now the prospects for cooperation between the two countries in producing aircraft are even brighter. Afterwards, Li Peng briskly mounted an IL-114 small passenger plane next to the IL-76TD. According to the briefing, this is a comfortable passenger plane with a capacity of 54 persons. It can fly non-stop for 1,000 km, a perfect plane for domestic flights. Beside this passenger plane, (Kuchelov), on behalf of all employees of the plant, presented two plane models to Premier Li Peng. One was a model of the IL-76TD heavy airfreighter with Chinese characters "China Lienhe Airline" on it, and the other one is a model of the IL-114 passenger plane. As the nearly one-hour visit drew to an end, Li Peng told reporters what he thought of this tour. He said that what impressed him most was the plant's broad scale, long history, and variety of products. He was glad that China has begun cooperation with this plant. At the end of the visit, President Islam Karimov said: "Premier Li Peng's visit is not only of political but also of great economic significance. Today's tour manifests promising prospects for cooperation between Uzbekistan and China."
