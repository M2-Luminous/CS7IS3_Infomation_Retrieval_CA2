Here, President Jiang Zemin presided over a ceremony to solemnly welcome Casam Uteem, president of Mauritius from Africa. This marks the sixth time this month that People's Liberation Army's Honor Guard was reviewed by a foreign head of state. In the first half of this year, they were reviewed by 26 foreign heads of state including a South Korean President, French Premier, Egytian President, and Russian Premier. The high frequency of the military honor guard's appearance in front of the Great Hall of the People is indeed rare in history. Seen from another perspective, this reflects the bustling scene on the Beijing diplomatic stage. At the same time, Chinese leaders make frequent foreign visits; their footprints can be found in every corner of the world. Starting from 29 June, Premier Li Peng will make official visits to Austria, Germany, and Romania, thus marking the sixth foreign visit of the Chinese high-level leaders this year. A peaceful international environment is an important external condition for China which is now engaged in the modernization construction. And one of the important programs of China's opening up to the outside world is to attract foreign funds, technologies, and advanced management experience via cooperation with foreign countries. Developing diplomatic, economic, scientific, technological, and cultural relationship with countries in the world on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence is in line with China's intermediate and long-term interests. For that end, China vigorously explores room for diplomatic maneuver and develops an omnidirectional diplomacy. Obviously, China has always given top priority to its diplomacy on consolidating and expanding the good-neighborly relationship with neighboring countries. At present, it has succeeded in developing a harmonious and peaceful environment with neiggboring countries. Its relations with peripheral countries have entered the best period in history. Since the beginning of this year, Beijing has received Azerbaijani President Aliyev, who made his first trip to China, and Russian Premier Chernomyrdin. Premier Li Peng visited four central Asian countries and Mongolia and signed the Sino-Kazakh border agreement and the Sino-Mongolian friendship and cooperation treaty which are of historical significance. Constant exchange of high-level visits has been the salient feature this year in the development of relations between China and European countries. Presidents of Romania and Estonia and premiers of Slovakia, Finland, France, and Portugal visited China one after another. Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, and Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, visited eight European nations. An excellent political relationship creates a favorable condition for both sides in developing mutually beneficial economic, trading, scientific, and technological cooperation. China maintains a strong development momentum with Western Europe in the area of economic and trade cooperation. After experiencing a certain period of sluggish growth, the economic and trade relationship with countries in Eastern Europe has been restored and enhanced. Also, in the first few months of this year, China achieved new progress in its relations with Latin American countries. A CPC Central Committee delegation headed by Hu Jintao, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee, visited Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil. Presidents of Ecuador, Suriname, and Peru visited China. Canadian Governor's visit to China marked the full normalization of relations between the two countries. The Canadian prime minister is expected to visit Beijing this year. Sino-U.S. relations have lately maintained the momentum of improvement and development. U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen and Secretary of State Christopher, senior U.S. Government officials, and congressmen visited China. China's Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, State Councillor Song Jian, Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi were invited to visit the United States. The Sino-U.S. Economic Joint Commission, the Sino-U.S. Commerce and Trade Joint Commission, and the Sino-U.S. Science and Technology Joint Commission resumed their work. At end of May, President Clinton announced the extension of the most-favored-nation [MFN] status to China and said that in the future the United States would delink the human rights issue from the MFN status when making annual review of the extension of the MFN. This decision has created a favorable condition for further enhancing and expanding economic and trade cooperation and promoting the improvement and development of relations between the two countries. Lately, China's solidarity and cooperation with African countries has been further consolidated. At the beginning of this year, China restored diplomatic relations with Lesotho. The end of the apartheid system in South Africa and the birth of a new South Africa have created an excellent condition for China to establish and develop friendly and cooperative relations with South Africa. In addition, China also vigororously pursues a multilateral diplomacy and strives to increase cooperation with other countries at the United Nations and at other international organizations. At the United Nations Human Rights Committee's 50th annual session held last March, China, together with countries which stand for justice and which support China, again thwarted a small minority of Western countries' attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs on the pretext of human rights issue. This showed China's solidarity and cooperation with a vast number of devleoping countries. At present, Beijing is busy preparing for the successful hosting of the Fourth World Women's Congress. Following the signing of a package agreement of the Uruguay Round, China is making unremitting efforts to attain the goal of becoming the founding member country of the World Trade Organization.
