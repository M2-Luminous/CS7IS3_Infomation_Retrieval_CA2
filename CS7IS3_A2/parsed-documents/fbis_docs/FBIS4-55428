FBIS4-55428 "dreeu094_k_94007" FBIS-EEU-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 CROATIA Oil Deliveries to Slovenia Suspended Oil Deliveries to Slovenia Suspended LD1305140094 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1222 GMT 13 May 94 LD1305140094 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Ljubljana, May 13 (TANJUG) -- Croatia's Adriatic oil company has impounded 15,000 tons of oil the Slovenian firm Petrol of Ljubljana has bought in Russia until the Slovenian oil refinery in Lendava settles its outstanding debt of 1.4 million Deutsche marks with the Adriatic oil. Croatia has also suspended all light oil deliveries to Slovenia's only refinery in Lendava until it has paid back the 8.5 million dollars it owes to Naftaplin in Zagreb for light oil deliveries made so far. The Slovenia-Croatia silent oil war threatens to seriously undermine the already tense relations between the two neighbouring countries which seceded from the former Yugoslav federation in 1991. Relations between the two sides are especially burdened by the unresolved border and property issues, over 600 million dollars in unsettled claims of private depositors with the Ljubljanska Banka and deterioration in economic relations.
