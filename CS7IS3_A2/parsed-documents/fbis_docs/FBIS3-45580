The Thursday [20 January] announcement, made by visiting U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen, comes four months before the U.S. must decide whether China has made enough progress in human rights to warrant a renewal of their most favored nation (MFN) trading status. "Our governments have agreed on measures to ensure more effective prevention of the export of goods made with prison labor," Bentsen told an audience of Chinese social scientists. "China has also agreed to permit inspections of five prisons alleged to be producing goods for exports."
