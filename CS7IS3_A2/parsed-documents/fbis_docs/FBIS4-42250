The government wants to bring forward and expand its reorganization of state finances. This time it is proposing specific savings: a cutback in partial pensions. Next year's budget -- for 1995-96 -- will strengthen the budget by 25 billion kronor. In all, the reorganization program will be expanded from 80 billion to 100 billion kronor and extended through 1999. But the government is getting criticism from both the right and the left for stating specifically how it plans to produce those savings. "We are unusually specific," Minister of Finance Wibble objected when SVENSKA DAGBLADET met her for an interview. "The custom usually is not to say anything about what one is going to do in the future." From Pension System The government specifies the areas where money is to be saved. Much of the 25 billion kronor to be saved in 1995-96 will be taken from the pension system. The government had previously been thinking of saving nearly 6 billion kronor by raising the retirement age from 65 to 66 years. It dropped that proposal as a concession to the Social Democrats during the pension negotiations. Instead, the money will be found somewhere outside the pension system. Wibble mentioned the early retirement pension plan as one important area where proposed measures "will gradually appear." According to the reorganization program, another 5 billion kronor are to be saved in the ATP [general supplementary pension] system. In this case the government is even thinking of increasing the employee contribution by 1 percent. Cannot Increase Contribution Further savings yielding about 3 billion kronor are planned in the unemployment insurance system. The minister of finance declined to say whether these savings would also involve a higher employee contribution. "It is not possible to tack on just any amount of employee contribution," she says. "I think that continuing to increase employee contributions by another 1 percent every year is overdoing it." One item in the reorganization plan as presented earlier will not be moved up: the 2 billion kronor in reduced housing subsidies. "We are holding off on that because of the situation in the housing market," Wibble says. In addition to implementing the reorganization program more quickly, the government wants to increase its amount by 20 billion kronor, a sum that will be saved in 1997-99. Here again, the pension system will contribute a large amount, but the minister of finance declined to say whether that would mean more increases in employee contributions or anything else. She pointed out that negotiations on the future pension system are still under way with the Social Democrats. Says Nothing About the Rest Savings in the pension system, combined with "unchanged public consumption in real terms in 1999," account for 11 billion of those 20 billion kronor. For the time being, the minister of finance is not saying anything about what the rest of it will consist of. We asked: "Is it because this is an election year that the government does not want to say anything specific about future savings?" "No," the minister of finance answered firmly. "This is specific enough for people to realize that the government is not going into the elections on the basis of some kind of pie in the sky. We are going into the election on the basis of the two most important tasks concerning distribution policy. One is not to shove the bill for the national debt off onto those who are young today -- those of us who did the spending will also pay. And the other is to pursue a policy on business that will create jobs." Wants To Stop Increase The government's goal is to stop the national debt from increasing by the end of the 1990's. To do that, the reorganization program must be carried out, and economic growth must be at least 3 percent per year from 1996 to 1999. "But it is clear that if Sweden votes no on membership in the European Union [EU], we will have to reexamine a lot of things," Wibble said. According to the minister of finance, any tax reductions next year will have to be financed separately from the reorganization program. And the tax reductions that may be considered will be concerned primarily with further improving conditions for business. "Any tax reductions may well be financed within the tax system. Or we may come up with some brilliant idea for savings, but that seems much less likely, of course." The fact that economic forecasts are now beginning to point in the right direction is due partly to the devaluation. The minister of finance admits this straight out. "But it is due to a lot of other things as well: low pay increases in the collective bargaining agreement, lower employer social security taxes, lower energy taxes for industry, more competition, and productivity gains by the firms themselves. ``Without all the measures adopted by the government, the outlook for the future would be very gloomy.'' Yesterday the Social Democrats presented a study of distribution policy showing that since the nonsocialists came to power, conditions have grown worse for all households without large fortunes and access to stock ownership. But Wibble is putting more faith in the Ministry of Finance's own calculations. They show that the gaps between the various income groups have grown smaller.
