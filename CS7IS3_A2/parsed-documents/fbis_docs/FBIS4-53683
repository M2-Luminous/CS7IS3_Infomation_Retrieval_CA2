The government said Wednesday it will freeze until the end of the year proposed hikes in public service charges, including power and gas rates, public transportation fares and telephone rates. But Hiroshi Watanabe, chairman of the Japan Gas Association, told reporters Thursday that member companies plan to end the rate cut after October.
