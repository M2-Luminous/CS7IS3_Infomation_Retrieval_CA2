FR940328-0-00037 FR940328-0-00012 Fire immediately threatens 2 of the 11 plant taxa (See Table 1) and poses a possible threat to 8 other taxa. Because Hawaii's native plants have evolved with only infrequent, naturally occurring episodes of fire (lava flows, infrequent lightning strikes), most species are not adapted to fire and are unable to recover well after recurring human-set fires. Alien plants are often more fire-adapted than native taxa and will quickly exploit suitable habitat after a fire (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Species that grow in dry and mesic vegetation communities (including all of the 11 plant taxa except the wet forest and shrubland species, Lobelia oahuensis ) may be susceptible to accidentally or maliciously set fires, especially near areas of habitation from which fires could easily spread. In the past 14 or 15 years, approximately 8 to 10 fires occurred in conservation districts under the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Division of Forestry and Wildlife in the low elevation slopes of the Koolau Mountains (Earl Pawn, State Division of Forestry and Wildlife, pers. comm., 1991). Although the fires were contained within small areas, the possibility remains for such fires to spread upslope into habitat occupied by the endangered species, especially during the dry summer months. Fires have been reported from dry and mesic regions in the Koolau Mountains, threatening Hesperomannia arborescens and Chamaesyce deppeana (HHP 1991a, 1991f1). A fire in the vicinity of the population spread fueled by alien and naturalized grasses and brisk updrafts typical of the area, although the extent of the fire on Nuuanu Pali is not known. Although the northern Koolau Mountains are mostly State or privately owned, large parcels are leased to the U.S. Army (Wagner et al . 1985). Military training exercises and ground maneuvers are occasionally conducted in those areas, especially along the summit ridges and in various locations above Kahuku. Because of the steep terrain, training areas are restricted to foot travel; tanks and other off-road vehicles are not utilized. Vehicles are only used on roads or trails (Alton Kanno, Environmental Management Office, U.S. Army Support Command, Hawaii, pers. comm., 1991), but the potential for affecting one population of Hesperomannia arborescens that grows along a jeep trail exists (HHP 1991f10). Trampling by ground troops associated with training activities could also affect other endangered species, including populations of Eugenia koolauensis , Hesperomannia arborescens , Lobelia oahuensis , Lycopodium nutans , Melicope lydgatei , and Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa that occur on land leased or owned by the Army (HHP 1991e3, 1991e8, 1991f1, 1991f10, 1991f17, 1991f20, 1991f21, 1991h4, 1991i9, 1991k4, 1991k6, 1991k9).
