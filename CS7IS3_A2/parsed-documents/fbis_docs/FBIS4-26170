The Chinese premier also expressed the hope that the people and soldiers in the flood-hit area would, under the leadership of the local party committees and governments, carry forward the spirit of continuous fighting to safeguard the dykes of the rivers and the cities such as Guangzhou, Changsha and Nanchang, and finally overcome the flood disaster.
