He explained that "in contrast to Ukraine, Belarus does not claim for low enriched uranium which is used as fuel for atomic power stations. We have no nuclear reactors and power plants. Belarus pretends for monetary compensation for this uranium -- he underlined -- the American party has given its backing to this approach and President Clinton will fix it legally." In Kravchenko's words, the draft of a corresponding agreement which is expected to be signed on Saturday in Minsk stipulates that "Russia will not be able to sell low enriched uranium to the United States without preliminary coordination with Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan," said Kravchenko. According to the minister, the visit of the American president to Minsk is a historic event. "The visit has broken Belarus' obscurity in the world once and for ever. From now on Belarus has a chance to be represented in the world as a small democratic civilized state with its deep national traditions," he said. Kravchenko believes that the Belarusian-American summit "helps to correct the disbalance which has been in our bilateral relations." "Earlier cooperation between two countries was restricted to military strategic problems and problems of refugees," he said. The minister stressed the importance of the treaty on security of American investments in the Belarusian economy which is to be signed in the course of Clinton's visit to Minsk. According to the republican Foreign Ministry, in 1993 the volume of turnover between Belarus and United States was $125 Mn. "In 1994 this number will increase by 10 times after signing of the treaty," believes the minister. He reminded that in February 1993 Belarus was granted the most favored nation regime in trade with the United States. "It means that tariffs higher than common ones will not be imposed on deliveries of Belarusian goods to the United States. In addition, in some cases Belarusian goods will be entirely relieved of any customs tariffs," indicated Kravchenko. In his words, Belarus hopes to receive an assistance from the United States totalling "several tens of million dollars in addition to those $76 [figure as received] as it has already received according to the Nunn-Lugar law." "This funds will be channelled to prevent transportation of contraband uranium from Russia to the Western Europe by transit via Belarus and to solve export problems and to re-train retired officers," he said.
