FR940314-2-00149 FR940314-2-00079 Tax on Certain Imported Substances; Notice of Determination; Perchloroethylene AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service, Treasury. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces a determination, under Notice 89&hyph;61, that the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code will be modified to include perchloroethylene. EFFECTIVE DATE: This modification is effective July 1, 1990. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tyrone J. Montague, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), (202) 622&hyph;3130 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under section 4672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an importer or exporter of any substance may request that the Secretary determine whether such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The Secretary shall add such substance to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines that taxable chemicals constitute more than 50 percent of the weight, or more than 50 percent of the value, of the materials used to produce such substance. This determination is to be made on the basis of the predominant method of production. Notice 89&hyph;61, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 717, sets forth the rules relating to the determination process. Determination On March 5, 1990, the Secretary determined that perchloroethylene should be added to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, effective July 1, 1990. The rate of tax prescribed for perchloroethylene under section 4671(b)(3), is $5.44 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for ethylene of 0.17 and a conversion factor for chlorine of 1.71. The petitioner is Vulcan Chemicals, a manufacturer and exporter of this substance. No material comments were received on this petition. The following information is the basis for the determination. Perchloroethylene HTS number: 2903.23.00.00 CAS number: 127&hyph;18&hyph;4 Perchloroethylene is derived from the taxable chemicals ethylene and chlorine. Perchloroethylene is a liquid produced predominantly by the high temperature chlorination of ethylene. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for perchloroethylene is: C 2 H 4 (ethylene)+4 Cl 2 (chlorine) __&hyph;> C 2 Cl 4 (perchloroethylene)+4 HCl (hydrogen chloride) Perchloroethylene has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 100 percent by weight of the materials used in its production.
