FBIS4-28762 "dreas114__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-114-A Daily Report 14 June 1994 ANNEX Japan Further Reportage on Reaction to DPRK Issues Further Reportage on Reaction to DPRK Issues Chongnyon Official Interviewed OW1306195094 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1306195094 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Newstar Television Network in Japanese at 1150 GMT on 11 June, in its "Sunday Project" program, carries a 20-minute recorded interview with Kim Myong-su, Study Department director under the Institute on Korean Affairs, a think tank affiliated with the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), by moderator Soichiro Tahara. Asked whether the DPRK is working on developing nuclear weapons, Kim says: "That is completely absurd. The DPRK is not engaged in developing nuclear weapons." As to why the DPRK has failed to grant thorough inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], Kim says North Korea has actually let the IAEA conduct inspections, but notes that there have been some misunderstandings between the DPRK and the IAEA, pointing out that during negotiations between DPRK and IAEA officials, IAEA officials have not listened to what the DPRK had to say about how to conduct the inspections. Kim criticizes the double standards the United States and the IAEA adopts, noting that inspections are lenient toward pro-U.S. countries that have already developed nuclear weapons such as Israel and South Africa, while they are strict against anti-U.S. countries. At 1154 GMT, Tahara asks why the DPRK continues to refuse thorough inspections if the country is not actually developing nuclear weapons and thus, has nothing to hide. Kim argues that the DPRK has refused inspections at the two undeclared facilities at Yongbyong because they are military installations which must be kept secret. He says the United States would not allow nuclear inspections at its military facilities if it were asked to do so. Tahara, however, retorts that the United States does not have to allow inspections of nuclear weapons since they are already recognized as nuclear weapons; he says the point of issue here is that the DPRK should prove it has nothing to hide. The program resumes at 1205 GMT after a two minute commercial break. Kim says normal relations existed between the DPRK and the IAEA up until the Gulf war, but since then, the DPRK has become a scapegoat, a subsequent target of U.S. strategy following the attack against Iraq. Asked if the DPRK would wage war if UN sanctions are imposed, Kim says the DPRK has only said that it would "respond to dialogue with dialogue and war with war." However, he adds that the DPRK would not be first to start a war. At 1207 GMT, Tahara says the DPRK should be more open to foreign journalists to reduce misunderstanding and prevent incorrect information from circulating. He points out that international political commentator Yoichi Masuzoe, who is one of the regular guests on the program, has waited for two years since submitting a request to Chongnyon to visit the DPRK. Kim says the DPRK is concerned about DPRK bashing by foreign journalists and that may be one reason for its cautious stance. He says the actual situation in Pyongyang is calm and much different from how it is being described by the Japanese news media. The interview ends at 1210 GMT.
