In a predeparture statement, he said he will participate in the PLO Executive Committee meetings to discuss the repercussions of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which he described as extremely serious. We cannot imagine that the situation in the occupied territories will remain as it was before, he said. Sha'th added: When we said that the real obstacle to peace is the settlements and the settlers, the Israelis insisted that Palestinian extremists, so they claim, are trying to abort the peace process. The massacre has shown who in fact is the aggressor and who is the victim. The settlement activity is a flagrant and continuing act of aggression; it is an illegitimate usurpation of the occupied territories and a Judaization of the land. Sha'th stressed that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is a major blow to the peace process and an attempt to foil it. We will discuss how to protect the Palestinian people in light of the international developments, and we will ask the world to ensure international protection for the Palestinian people through use of UN forces and observers, Sha'th said. He said the PLO will ask the world to force Israel to disarm the settlers. For the peace process to move ahead, Sha'th said, protection and security for the Palestinian people must be provided until the Palestinian forces take over full responsibility for the usurped land. On transferring the negotiations to Washington, Sha'th said this is not a magical solution following the massacre. He added: The Cairo negotiations were not the reason for the massacre; on the contrary, the Egyptian leadership hosted and greatly supported the talks, and we were close to signing an agreement and starting the Israeli withdrawal. I believe that a transfer of the talks will waste some time. Sha'th said that the United States must pressure Israel to achieve a just peace with the Palestinians.
