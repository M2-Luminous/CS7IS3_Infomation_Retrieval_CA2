Our reporter Mario Espinoza has some information: [Begin recording] [Espinoza] The executive branch believes the negative U.S. Government report on drug enforcement in Bolivia focuses on the first part of 1993. Social Communications Minister Ernesto Machicado has said the report contains positive aspects. He added that during its 1993 electoral campaign, Bolivia indisputably failed to fulfill its commitments to the U.S. Government. [Machicado] I would like to underscore three aspects. First, the United States will continue to cooperate with Bolivia--be it in drug enforcement or in any other area where cooperation exists. Everything will remain the same, there will be no change. Second, the U.S. Embassy in Bolivia states that coca eradication was delayed entirely due to the administration of former President Jaime Paz Zamora, especially during the electoral campaign. Prior to the 1993 elections, the former Patriotic Accord administration decided to stop coca eradication efforts in the Chapare region basically for political and electoral reasons. The third aspect is that the U.S. report clearly acknowledges the efforts of the current administration which has led to the arrest of several drug bosses and the breaking up of large drug rings.
