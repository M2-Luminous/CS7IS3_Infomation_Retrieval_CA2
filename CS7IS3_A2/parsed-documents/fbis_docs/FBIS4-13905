The talks are chaired by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat, and General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff. The talks were scheduled to begin this morning but were delayed several hours because the Israeli delegation arrived in Cairo late. Informed Palestinian sources told MENA that the current round takes on special importance because it will be the last round if the two sides agree on the outstanding issues. The sources said the most important issues that will be discussed in the context of the Security and Legal Affairs Committee is the legal jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho and the release of Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails, estimated at approximately 10,000 according to International Red Cross statistics.
