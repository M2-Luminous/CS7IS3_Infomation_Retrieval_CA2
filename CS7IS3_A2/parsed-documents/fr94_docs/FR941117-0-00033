FR941117-0-00033 FR941117-0-00008 Thus, under the definition included in the final rule, other changes affecting eligibility and occurring in conjunction with a change in the amount of the support collection would not negate the family's entitlement to extended Medicaid, as long as the support collection contributes to ineligibility for AFDC. Comment: One State questioned the discussion of payments made by absent parents directly to the AFDC recipient. The State asserted that if these payments are turned in as required , the money flows through the child support mechanism as would money collected by the State directly from the absent parent. As such it represents a ``collection'' under title IV&hyph;D. If the money is not forwarded to the State agency, it is budgeted accordingly (as income to the family), and penalties (for non-cooperation) are imposed as appropriate. The regulations are silent on the issue of monies not forwarded so the State assumes there is no intent to provide the extension when the support causes ineligibility when budgeted, since to provide such an extension in this case would be contrary to the statute. Response: There is no intent to provide the extension in such situations. The State is correct that monies not forwarded to the State agency would not constitute a ``collection'' under title IV&hyph;D, as required by the statute. Such monies would be budgeted as income to the family in a IV&hyph;A income State, with sanctions for non-cooperation imposed as appropriate. In a IV&hyph;D recovery State, the IV&hyph;D agency must recover all such payments. The IV&hyph;D agency would enter into a repayment agreement with the custodial parent in accordance with 45 CFR 303.80. We have revised the regulation in several places in order to make it clear that support collections must be child or spousal support collected under title IV&hyph;D. Comment: One State agency commented that, given the erratic nature of child support payments, the proposed policy could result in disparate treatment for clients with equal amounts of child support. Another State agency expressed concern that the application of the proposed regulations may provide an incentive for an absent parent not to pay child support when a child is approaching the age of majority or some other income change is expected to occur. Response: Because of the sporadic nature of the receipt of support payments and other changes in family circumstances, it would be difficult to determine when such a situation might occur. Nevertheless, it is true that, in some cases, an increase in support collection would coincide with other circumstances affecting AFDC eligibility. The statute places no special requirements on the circumstances which resulted in the increased support collection which, in turn, triggered the four-month period. If a family receives a change in support payments which in some way causes that family to lose AFDC, regardless of the circumstances, then that family is entitled to four extra months of Medicaid coverage. The statute places no relevance on the regularity or timing of payments. Comment: Two commenters suggested that extended Medicaid should be continued when a family or individual moves out of the State and is no longer a resident of the State. One commenter suggested that the State where the individual was originally eligible for extended Medicaid should be responsible for providing any remaining months of extended Medicaid, particularly where the individual was enrolled in a managed care organization. The other commenter suggested that the new State should be automatically responsible for paying for the remaining months of the extended period. Response: In the preamble to the notice of proposed rulemaking, HCFA took the position that ``[c]ontinued Medicaid under this provision ends for any individual who moves to another State.'' The preamble further provided, however, that eligibility could be reinstated if the individual returns to the State and the individual would be entitled to any remaining months of extended benefits. We believe that it is reasonable to allow States to terminate families who become residents of other States during the extended Medicaid period. Nothing in section 406(h) explicitly requires a State to continue extended benefits for an individual who has moved to another State. In addition, our interpretation of this provision conforms with the longstanding policy that States are only required to provide Medicaid to their own residents. The Medicaid statute establishes a framework of cooperative federalism in which each state develops a plan for providing medical assistance for its residents. The statute establishes a general framework for the State's Medicaid program; however, States have some flexibility to tailor the program to meet the particular needs of their residents. As a result, each State plan is different. From the outset of the Medicaid program, State residency has been an important aspect of Medicaid eligibility. Section 1902(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. section 1396a(b)(2), prohibits the Secretary from approving a plan which imposes any residency requirement which excludes individuals who reside in the State, regardless of whether or not the residence is maintained permanently or at a fixed address. On the other hand, there has never been any general statutory requirement that a State cover individuals who are not its residents or continue to cover those who are no longer its residents. Indeed, section 1902(b)(2) implicitly recognizes that States may limit Medicaid coverage to their own residents.
