[Romaszewski] A cabinet-cum-parliament system, with the president discharging a control function and elected by general vote. The president will have supervision over all control and monitoring institutions--for example, the Supreme Chamber of Control and the National Labor Inspectorate. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Will the president's range of competence will be narrower than in the Small Constitution? [Romaszewski] The current division of the executive power generates conflict between the president and the government. In our view, we cannot have a situation where the three most important government departments are outside parliamentary control. Moreover, this division also causes tensions within the government and results in a decisions blockade. We have a choice between two political systems. In the first, which is in practice in the United States, the president is responsible for the entire executive administration, but even there parliament has a very wide range of powers relative to control of the executive administration, including the power to recall the president. In the second system, the prime minister is responsible for the whole executive sector. It is very difficult to achieve a cross between these two systems, so we decided to entrust the executive powers to the prime minister, who answers to parliament. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] In this situation, is there any point in electing the president in a general ballot? [Romaszewski] That has, in its way, become a tradition now. Moreover, it is important that the president's authority is reinforced by the system whereby he is elected in a general ballot. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Will it be a constitution according to the model put forward by the Solidarity trade union? [Romaszewski] No. It will be a constitution focused broadly on the questions of human rights, civil rights, and civil freedoms, in which emphasis will be placed on employees' rights. It will contain a provision introducing a novel institution--that is, a Tripartite Commission--which will include representatives of employers, employees, and the government. The commission will be responsible for such matters as, for example, the setting of the minimum wage. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] The project accords an important position to the Senate, does it not? [Romaszewski] There are only two options here: Either the Senate goes or it stays. In its present shape, the Senate is superfluous because all it does is repeat the Sejm's work. Because we decided to retain the institution of the Senate, we recommend that an unambiguous formula be found for its function. The Senate should provide a representation for local administration. Its members should be elected according to the electoral law currently in force, which gives equal rights to such voivodships as Suwalki, Slupsk, and Chelm, each of which elects two senators. This is most important because this gives the so-called Poland-B [undeveloped, rural, poorer regions] an equal chance to be represented. The Sejm, which is elected according to the proportional representation principle, is dominated by the large urban centers. We believe that Polish parliamentary life suffers from the disease of politicizing and partisanship. Accordingly, we suggest that the Senate be placed outside political games and strategies. That is why we want to make senators' seats independent of their party allegiance. It will mean that all senatorial candidates belonging to a particular party should, once elected, suspend their party allegiance. Thus, political party caucuses should cease to operate within the Senate. There would be no direct equivalent in the Senate of the parliamentary party clubs that operate in the Sejm. The Senate as a parliamentary chamber would gather together genuine political authorities rather than representatives of political parties. The legislative initiative would rest with individual senators rather than with the Senate as a whole. At the moment, the Senate's legislative initiative is practically nonoperative. The Senate would also appoint special commissions to investigate individual cases. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Are you thinking here of special investigative commissions appointed to examine malpractice allegations against the government? [Romaszewski] Yes. If such a commission is set up within the Sejm, in which the government has the majority of votes, its work will always be illusory. If we place such structures within the Senate, we stand a better chance of obtaining positive results. We are very much interested in separating the Senate from the executive apparatus and from personal competition over ministerial posts. The Senate should occupy itself mainly with legislative work and with discharging a special kind of control function. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] You want to write a range of citizens' social welfare entitlements into the future constitution, but we know that, for example, the right to free medical treatment is in practice largely fictitious. [Romaszewski] We have been very careful in this respect and tried to formulate these provisions so that they would not lend themselves to becoming empty phrases, to ensure that the constitution is indeed the fundamental legal act. We have included no unrealistic provisions with which people would be at a loss as to how to apply them. We tried to follow the line of making certain regulations more precise--especially those concerning health and family protection laws. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Certain critics of your model of the constitution accuse it of excessive right-wing orientation. [Romaszewski] This does not mean a thing. After all, it would be hard to find right-wing leanings in a document that provides so extensively for union rights. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] But the preamble is formulated in a most grandiloquent style. [Romaszewski] It is modeled on the preamble to the 3 May [1791] Constitution. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] And it does mention Christian values. [Romaszewski] I believe that our proposed solutions in the sphere of state-church relations are not controversial. We assume autonomy for all religious denominations. Moreover, relations between the state and the Catholic Church are regulated by the Concordat. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Why do you insist on suggesting in the constitution that two-thirds of the parliament's composition be elected by a majority vote? Do you want to get rid of parliamentary party caucuses? [Romaszewski] It is most important to include the declaration on electoral law in the constitution because parliament will never do that itself. Our political parties are rather small, and their members move in their exclusive circles. Unless we introduce the majority-rule electoral law, they will never gain strength and will not broaden their membership to include wide reaches of people not immediately interested in gaining positions in the power apparatus. The leaders will always formulate the type of electoral law that will seem to bring the most advantages to the parties themselves and to no one else. We are in favor of keeping political parties going, but we also suggest that deputies be selected according to a mixed-type electoral law, weighted in favor of offering a larger proportion to the majority vote. Sejm deputies and senators would then be elected in their wards according to the majority-vote electoral law. In other words, those who gain the largest number of votes will win the seat. There would also be an additional, national candidates' list. Seats won on that list would be shared proportionately by the political parties, depending on the number of seats won in individual election wards. In this way, the political parties would be forced to put up their best candidates in their wards, even if the candidates themselves came from outside the wards, because the number of seats to be won by them from the national list would depend on the number of votes obtained by these candidates. This type of electoral law would create a genuine social representation in parliament instead of bringing into parliament people interested only in acquiring and wielding power. The current proportional electoral Sejm law in force, which gives priority to political parties, only discourages people from taking part in parliamentary elections. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Why is it to our advantage to endorse and support the draft constitution proposed by Solidarity? [Romaszewski] Because it offers a comprehensive project of the fundamental law, reinforces unequivocally democratic values, and arises from Solidarity and post-Solidarity circles. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Let us assume that some 500,000 people sign a petition in favor of the proposed draft constitution. Will the present parliament consider it then? [Romaszewski] If the parliamentary commission fails to consider a draft proposal that has obtained 500,000 or more signatures, it should consider the possibility that any serious departures from the version proposed in that draft may cause a rejection of its own draft constitution in a national referendum. On the other hand, if it chooses to be directed by political realism, it will accept our proposal as the basic material for the formulation of the constitution. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] So your proposal of your alternative draft constitution is not a kind of "art for art's sake" move? [Romaszewski] No, it is not. The draft constitution proposed by post-Solidarity circles is most important for the country in a situation where parliament is dominated by postcommunist forces. [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Thank you for talking with us.
