FBIS TRENDS-DPRK-U.S.-IAEA Pyongyang Claims U.S. Bad Faith, Hardens Nuclear Stance Pyongyang Claims U.S. Bad Faith, Hardens Nuclear Stance SUMMARY Accusing Washington of bad faith, Pyongyang has hardened its stance on the nuclear issue and is heightening the crisis over its refusal to stop removing spent fuel rods from its 5-megawatt nuclear reactor. With the possibility of UN sanctions looming larger, Pyongyang may be wavering on the issue of convening a multinational conference to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue as proposed by Moscow. END SUMMARY Pyongyang is moving to deter renewed demands for special inspections of two suspected nuclear waste sites as a way of shedding light on possible diversion of nuclear materials. To this end, a 7 June Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement attempted to refute U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci's recent "allegation" that Pyongyang has destroyed the possibility of the future measurement of the fuel rods in defiance of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (Pyongyang radio, 8 June). Calling Assistant Secretary Gallucci's comments an "alarming assertion," the statement contended that the United States hopes to "invent a pretext" for a special inspection of the two waste sites--sites that the statement, as usual, depicted as "military." It declared provocatively that Washington should not "even dream" of having "our military sites" inspected. Purporting to demonstrate Washington's bad faith, the spokesman's statement reported that there had been a series of "contacts" between North Korea and the United States over the question of the reactor refueling, during which, it said, a document explaining the North Korean method of preserving the "technical feasibility" of future measurement of fuel rods had been passed to the United States. The U.S. side, the statement claimed, promised a response after "sincerely studying" the document, and even allegedly stated that high-level bilateral talks could be resumed, provided that the technical feasibility of future measurement is preserved. However, the statement went on to say that without giving the promised response, Washington "unilaterally declared" that the technical feasibility of measurement had been lost--a declaration, according to the statement, that was timed to coincide with an IAEA report to the UN Security Council. Indicating that Pyongyang has dropped any pretense that it might take a more accommodating stance, the statement claimed that this "surprise" move by the United States has destroyed "the last chance for seeking a compromise." Again threatening to pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), it pointedly drew a parallel between the current crisis and the situation in March 1993, when North Korea announced that it was pulling out of the NPT. The statement added a militant tone to the threat, claiming that while Pyongyang still supports resolution of the issue through "dialogue and negotiation," the "entire people and the entire army" will "counter" any attempt to force "special inspections" or "sanctions" on North Korea. Letter to IAEA In a parallel move, Pak Yong-nam, head of North Korea's General Department of Atomic Energy, has rebuffed an IAEA call for special inspection of the two suspected waste sites. In a 6 June letter to the IAEA, Pak alleged that the agency is claiming that, with the loss of the technical feasibility of measuring fuel rods, it is "indispensable" that "two ordinary military sites" be subjected to IAEA special inspection to verify nondiversion of nuclear material (KCNA, 7 June). This, Pak contended, shows that the IAEA "continues to join the United States" in "hostile" attempts to open "ordinary" military sites to outside inspection. Pak went on to reiterate Pyongyang's earlier, thinly-veiled threat to resume nuclear fuel reprocessing activities if the IAEA refers the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. War Talk These amplifications of the DPRK's uncompromising position have been accompanied by a heightening of Pyongyang's war rhetoric. Clearly seeking to unsettle Seoul, Pyongyang radio on 6 June carried a belligerent statement by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, a quasi-official organ the North often uses to map out its position on inter- Korean issues. Warning against South Kdrean support for UN sanctions, the statement declared, "Sanctions are war, period, and there is no mercy in a war." This phrase seemed to raise by a notch the harshness of Pyongyang's now standard statement equating sanctions to "a declaration of war," a formulation that first surfaced in March 1993 as part of Pyongyang's original declaration of its intention to withdraw from the NPT (Pyongyang radio, 12 March 1993). Russian Proposal With the specter of UN sanctions looming larger, tentative signs have been emerging that Pyongyang may be reconsidering its opposition to a Russian proposal for an international conference on the nuclear issue, possibly as a fallback position to avoid sanctions. In a 1 April Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement (KCNA), Pyongyang had politely, but firmly, rejected Moscow's proposal for an eight-party conference (with both Koreas, the United States, Japan, China, Russia, the United Nations, and the IAEA). That statement had reiterated Pyongyang's assertion that the North Korean nuclear issue should be resolved bilaterally between Pyongyang and Washington and suggested that Moscow could exert its influence on Washington to be more forthcoming. However, following North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Yi In-kyu's recent visit to Moscow, a Foreign Ministry spokesman noted, without comment, that during the visit, the Russians, while "expressing understanding" of Pyongyang's preference of DPRK-U.S. talks, had again proposed "multi-party talks" on the nuclear issue (KCNA, 5, 30 May). The Russians were more upbeat in describing North Korean reaction to their plan, claiming that Pyongyang had "expressed a positive attitude" on the Russian proposal (Moscow Interfax, 19 May). Indicating that Moscow still considers its proposal alive, the Russians reportedly pushed their proposal again during ROK President Kim Yong-sam's recent visit to Moscow (ITAR-Tass, 8 June.) Implications Pyongyang is clearly trying to place the blame for the latest escalation of the crisis on Washington's alleged decision to go public with its position on the fuel rod issue before communicating the new position to North Korea through private channels. Pyongyang's apparent wavering on the Russian proposal, despite its consistent preference for bilateral negotiations with Washington, suggests that the North Korean leadership may realize that a UN Security Council sanctions resolution is a real possibility.
