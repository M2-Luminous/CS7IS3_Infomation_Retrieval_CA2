The submarine sank on April 7, 1989. It carried two torpedoes with nuclear warheads and four conventional torpedoes. Komsomolets was the third Soviet submarine that sank as a result of a technical failure. Borisov said that raising the submarine was out of the question because its titanium hull, torpedo compartment hatch rods and bodies of the torpedoes, notably carrying nuclear warheads, were damaged. Even though the nuclear reactor of the submarine was damaged, it was said to be safe with the radiation leak level being about 10 Ci per liter but the possible disintegration of torpedo nuclear warheads might result in leakage of plutonium and environmental damage. Borisov said that plans were about to be finalized to seal the torpedo compartment of Komsomolets. The works, he said, will be carried out next summer at a cost of one to two billion rubles. The Russian government was said to have made a decision to appropriate the funds. Once the sealing is done, Borisov said, a program of extracting nuclear warheads from the submarine will have to be devised.
