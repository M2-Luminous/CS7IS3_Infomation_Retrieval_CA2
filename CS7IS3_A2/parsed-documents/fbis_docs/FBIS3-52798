As the papal envoy visits the occupied Arab territories in Palestine, the Israeli Army continues to kill innocent people with live ammunition and continues to throw more detainees in its prisons which now have 11,000 prisoners, some of them children. We find it difficult to understand the Vatican's haste in normalizing relations with Israel and signing an agreement with it condoning its occupation of Arab territories and Judaiazation of Jerusalem. The Vatican, which refrained from taking such a step for 2,000 years, could have waited a few more years to see the outcome of the current peace efforts in the region. We do not believe that the Christian spiritual leadership accepts the injustice, the occupation, the coercion, the confiscation of land, the building of settlement, and the prevention of family reunions. That is why we are surprised by this eagerness to establish full diplomatic relations with an entity that commits all these excesses and violations of human rights and international laws and charters. We could understand a Third World state establishing relations with Israel because it needed so-called aid and expertise or because it believed that Israel was the most effective channel for reaching the heart of the White House and its financial and economic aid, but we cannot understand the Vatican taking such a step. It is not a state and it does not need a mediator to reach Washington. Quite the contrary, Washington is the one that needs the pope's blessing and satisfaction. Furthermore, the Vatican is not a state seeking to expand its commercial relations and seek new markets for its products and exports. The Vatican would not have taken such a step had the Arab situation not been at its worst and had the Palestinian people, Muslims and Christians, not been besieged by brothers before being besieged by enemies. It is regrettable that the current state of Arab division does not encourage anyone to respect the Arabs and their causes or to take them and their interests into consideration. The picture was different when the Arabs were strong and united and when there was Arab solidarity. Others would have had to think a thousand times before taking a step that would anger any Arab state. We hope that this fatal Vatican blow will serve as a lesson to those who are placing obstacles in the way of Arab reconciliation and restoration of Arab solidarity, because the danger of these divisions which have weakened the Arabs and shaken their world image is getting closer to their own doorsteps. The coming days will prove that they are not safe no matter how much money, arms, and Western support they have. If the loss of Jerusalem, its Judaiaization, and the building of a belt of settlements around it to obliterate its Arab identity has not moved them, we do not believe that their state of health is sound nor that their political situation is normal to enable them to face any danger that threatens them. The Vatican's recognition of Israel on Israeli terms is an insult to all the Arabs and Muslims without exception because the consequences of that recognition will be a catastrophe for all, without exception. The Zionist movement, after Arab failure caused the label of racism to be lifted from it at the United Nations, is, after this major recognition of the state of Israel and its occupation of Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied territories, now ready to surge forward, expand, gain new legitimacy for its ideology, and build even larger and more dangerous alliances in the region at the expense of Arabism and all the human, cultural, and civilized values and ethics it represents.
