To date, any businessman with a general enterprise license could offer arms and military technology for sale. Bretislav Gregr, director of the License Administration at the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said that the tightening of the conditions was caused by instances that unnecessarily damaged the reputation of the republic. He gave an example of a citizen who had nothing to do with arms dealing advertising the sale of handguns and submachine guns in a foreign journal. Some people even offered tanks and airplanes abroad. "We have begun to receive notes through diplomatic channels asking how it is possible that these individuals can offer arms without any restrictions," Gregr said.
