Finance Minister Cardoso has not been able to give an objective answer to questions about his future -- as a minister or a candidate -- since the rules to control inflation were released 48 hours ago. He chose to remain ambiguous. "You are talking as if I were irreplaceable," Cardoso said ironically early yesterday morning. Then he rambled: "If I wanted to run I would have done what was easiest: freeze prices, increase salaries..." Pressure on the minister from inside and outside the government to run is growing. The pressure is directly proportional to the belief that, with the plan, the election will coincide with a process of a substantial drop in the inflation rate. In the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] -- the minister's party and the government's main supporter in Congress -- the consensus is that there are no alternatives to Cardoso's candidacy and that right now, when the plan has just been released, is the right time to begin organizing the campaign in the streets. The beginning of a movement within the party to put Tasso Jereissati -- PSDB president, former Ceara governor, and one of Cardoso's strongest allies -- at the head of the Finance Ministry is already noticeable. Jereissati is a former almost-minister. He was announced as the finance minister during the Jose Sarney administration, replacing Dilson Funaro, who had resigned. Funaro was the creator of the Cruzado Plan and is a participant in the current plan's genesis. His nomination, however, was vetoed by the most important PMDB leader of the time, the late Ulysses Guimaraes. Cardoso has a seductive scenario in front of him. The ingredients are the real prospect of an improvement of his public image in conjunction with an anticipated drop in the inflation rate. He has also been receiving signs of a genuine possibility of mounting a broad multiparty alliance to support his candidacy. It would be a renovated version of the extinct Democratic Alliance. In it, the minister-candidate's PSDB would join forces with the PFL [Liberal Front Party] of Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes [ACM], the anti-[Orestes] Quercia PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] faction, important factions of the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] of Paulo Maluf, the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], and the PP [Popular Party]. The main target would be candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the PT [Workers Party], who has been the favorite in all surveys on presidential succession for more than a year. The Bahia governor -- the main PFL leader -- has been talking about the issue with influential PSDB leaders such as Ceara Governor Ciro Gomez. On 1 March in Congress, ACM allies tried to include on today's voting agenda a constitutional amendment that not only would have extended the deadline for the incompatibility of governors and mayors, but also would have included ministers. Lula's PT already has perceived such behind-the-scenes maneuvers and started discussing how to prevent the economic plan from becoming an electoral jumping board for Cardoso by facilitating an alliance of the PSDB with center-right factions. The alliance Lula wants and needs most is precisely one including the minister's party. The finance minister, in turn, decided to make time (days). He needs another Cardoso at the Finance Ministry and also a minimum period to make sure that the URV and the real will leave the drafting board the way it was planned.
