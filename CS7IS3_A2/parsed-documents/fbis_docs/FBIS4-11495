A police report released today in Huancayo, 415 km southeast of Lima, states that the MRTA, which is inspired by Ernesto "Che" Guevara, has called an "armed strike" for 28 and 29 April according to announcements painted on walls, circulated in bulletins, and written on flags. The three Peruvian central jungle provinces where the "armed strike," which is a strike under threat of death, is being promoted are Chanchamayo and Satipo in Junin Department, the capital of which is Huancayo, and Oxapampa in Pasco Department. An official Defense Ministry communique issued on 21 April states that the MRTA attacked a truck carrying soldiers and civilians on the Villarrica highway to Oxapampa. They murdered three soldiers and 12 civilians and wounded 30 people. Another 13 people are missing. The communique adds that the Army is intensifying operations "to capture the members of the narcoterrorist gangs" that operate in the region. [passage omitted] Until now the Shining Path was the only organization to have called "armed strikes" in different parts of Peru, especially in Ayacucho in the South Andean region where this organization was born in 1980 and in Lima where the measure always failed despite the fact that the transportation sector almost always obeyed the strike call. Some analysts believe this action may indicate the union of the two subversives organizations, at least in the central jungle region. [passage omitted]
