Sea-Based Missiles Also Are Launchable From Aircraft"] [Text] All modern Russian ballistic missiles (SLBMs) with which navy submarines have been outfitted have been constructed at the state missile center Design Bureau imeni V. P. Makeyev (Miass). With the reduction of strategic arms good possibilities are being afforded for the transformation of military into commercial carriers. The bureau has proposed two fields for use of naval submarines for putting peaceful research or technological satellites into space or into the upper layers of the atmosphere. The Priboy project (BMN N 39) was oriented on the launching of missiles from the sea surface. The Aerokosmos project proposes that heavy aircraft, especially the An-124 "Ruslan," and in the future, the An-225 "Mriya," be used as launch pads. The rocket engine (it is proposed that reoutfitted SS-N-23 and SS-N-20 engines be used) is fired only after the launch pad, together with a parachute system, descends from the aircraft to an altitude of about 12 km. The launches can be made at a distance up to 4000 km from airfields (superclass or first class). Despite such different launch methods the Priboy and Aerokosmos projects combine a high operability, mobility and total autonomy. They do not require a cosmodrome and these means that there is no need for alienating extensive areas beneath the zone of falling of spent stages. An extremely important circumstance is that an object can be attached to a rocket on vessels or aircraft directly at the bases of the client (in some cases this will help in avoiding COCOM restrictions). As reported by Rem Kanin, head of the KBM laboratory, the commercial operation of the Aerokosmos system will presumably begin in 1996-1997. The Shtil-3A (SS-N-23) rocket can be put into an equatorial orbit with an altitude from 200 to 700 km with a payload 730-950 kg. BMN: The AO Aerokosmos (founders -- State Rocket Center Design Bureau imeni V. P. Makeyev and the Chelyabinsk association Tekhnopolis) was established for realization of the project. The association RAM-KON, AO Volga-Dnepr and a number of design bureaus and scientific research institutes participating in the reoutfitting of SLBM intend to take part in the project.
