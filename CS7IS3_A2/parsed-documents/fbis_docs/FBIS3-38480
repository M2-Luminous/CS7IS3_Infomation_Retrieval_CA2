There has been less talk about how costs will decrease almost in the same proportion. The result of this may be that net farm incomes do not decrease very much. The Central Federation of Industry and Employers (CFIE) has commissioned a study of how Finnish membership in the EU would impact farm costs in Finland. The results of the study, which are available now, are quite surprising. When lower incomes and lower costs are juxtaposed, net farm incomes will only be less than 100 million markkas lower than the official figures for 1993. The study has been based on agricultural gross revenue and cost, according to calculations prepared in February of last year, by the National Farm Price Advisory Committee. The resulting difference between these two values is called agricultural income. Included in agricultural gross revenue are almost all subsidies. Excluded are some agricultural sale revenues, such as quality and seasonal surcharges. In addition, proceeds from timber sales are not included in the sales revenue figures . Producer Prices Decreasing The sales revenues, and simultaneously the agricultural gross revenue, decrease due to the fact that the farmers in the EU countries receive lower prices for their products than the farmers in Finland. On the other hand, the difference between producer prices has significantly shrunk, as the markka has weakened. The study commissioned by the CFIE estimates the difference to be 25-30 percent. The study has been conducted on the assumption that farm subsidies will remain the same, as the government has made the commitment in the EU negotiations to keep the support level for farmers from decreasing. Prohibited subsidies such as price supports (3.9 billion markkas and 50 million markkas in crop failure support) can be supplanted by other forms of support. The Finnish state and/or the EU will pay. Lower Prices of Fertilizers The agricultural sector's share of surplus exports amounted to 1.5 billion markkas. Membership in the EC would eliminate this obligation. Currently, when farmers buy supplies and equipment such as machinery, fertilizers and feed, they pay hidden sales taxes, as they have no right to deduct these. The amount of these hidden sales taxes is estimated at 1.5 billion markkas. The transfer to a system of value-added taxes means that the above-mentioned costs will be removed from the agricultural sector. The industry sector that manufactures farming supplies and equipment, operates, in part, on closed markets. According to the study, the prices of, among other things, fertilizers and animal feed on the common markets will come down. Animal feed is mainly manufactured from grain, and the decrease in grain prices will lead to lower animal feed prices. According to the study, fertilizer concentrate prices may decrease by 10-20 percent and the price of feed by 25-35 percent. Smaller Depreciation In 1993, the depreciation value included in the producer prices amounted to 3.4 billion markkas for machinery and equipment and 640 million markkas for buildings. It was noted in the study that, as farm sizes increase, the capital invested in agriculture will decrease, which leads to lower depreciation. The assumption made in the study is that depreciation will decrease by a third. Lower costs will result in a corresponding decrease in producer prices, without any changes in agricultural income. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Effect of EU Membership on the Agricultural Sector | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Income From Agriculture |As Member of EU, million | | |in 1993, million markkas |markkas | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sales income |20,740 |14,518 (- 30 percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Subsidies |3,985 |3,985 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other income |1,006 |1,006 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total Income |25,731 |19,509 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fertilizer concentrates |1,230 |1,045 (- 15 percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Seed purchases |308 |216 (- 30 percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Animal feed purchases |2,548 |1,783 (- 30 percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Machinery and equipment | | | |expenditures | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Depreciation |3,406 |2,282 (- 33 percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Maintenance |1,055 |739 (- 30 percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Interest |2,026 |1,418 (- 30 percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other costs |6,367 |6,367 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total Costs |16,940 |13,850 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hidden sales tax burden | |- 1,553 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Removal of obligation fo-| |- 1,500 | |r surplus exports | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Corrected Total Costs |16,940 |10,797 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Income from agriculture |8,790 |8,712 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Under the heading "Income From Agriculture," specific mention is made only of those major cost items that are expected to significantly change when Finland becomes a member of the EU. The designation "Other Items" includes agricultural lime, herbicides, animal feed preservatives, fuels and lubricants, electricity, wood heating, commercial timber, tools, trade with animals, general expenditures, construction costs, leasing cost for machinery and buildings, payroll costs, and social fees.
