FR940405-1-00113 FR940405-1-00013 (2) Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The proposed IAQ standard will affect numerous small establishments and a portion of these establishments may have difficulty financing the compliance actions needed to comply depending on which alternative they choose. This section examines the potential for exceptional impacts among small establishments. The nature of compliance action limits the potential for exceptionally large compliance burdens on small businesses because most costs will be incurred on a per employee or per square foot basis. The number of buildings occupied with establishments with fewer than 20 employees is estimated at 3.7 million or 82 percent of all buildings. Of these, 76 percent have floor space less than 10,000 square feet. Thus, small firms will incur low costs because they have small floorspace and few employees. To this point of the analysis, OSHA has not distributed the number of buildings across establishments since there are no data on which to describe the establishments in multi-tenant buildings. Therefore, OSHA developed establishment specific compliance costs based on the estimates presented in section E of this report. The economic impact by firm size is estimated with the assumption that all establishments will require HVAC maintenance. It was assumed that each establishment has a floor space of 10,000 square feet. To examine the potential regulatory burden that would be experienced by small establishments, OSHA calculated the ratio of their annual compliance cost to their sales and pre-tax profit for two scenarios for dealing with ETS: (1) provide designated smoking areas, or (2) totally ban smoking in the workplace. As shown in Table VI&hyph;14, for both scenarios, the average ratio of compliance costs to sales ranges from 0.44 percent to 0.52 percent. The highest impact (2.79 percent) for establishments not banning smoking would be in Personal Services (SIC&hyph;72). Estimates of compliance cost as a percentage of pre-tax profits were less than 7.05 percent for most sectors; Social Services establishments (SIC&hyph;83) would experience the largest reduction in profit (31 percent), if they allow smoking in designated rooms. These estimates apply to the average firm in each sector. The degree to which affected firms will either incur or shift compliance costs depends largely on the competitive environment in which the establishments operate and on the elasticity of demand for the establishment's services and commodities. OSHA requests information regarding compliance costs against indicators of the demand for and the costs of the types of services and commodities provided by establishments which would be affected by the proposed standard. OSHA specifically requests comments, including empirical data regarding the demand elasticity of such establishments' patrons who will not be permitted to smoke in the presence of employees at such establishments. If economic feasibility is shown to be an issue for establishments such as bars and restaurants, what methods of compliance would adequately protect workers in a feasible manner? (3) Environmental Impact The provisions of the standard have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 432, et seq.], the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations [40 CFR Part 1500], and OSHA's DOL NEPA Procedures [29 CFR Part 11]. As a result of this review, OSHA concluded that this rule will have no significant environmental impact. BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;26&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSEP05AP94.002 BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;26&hyph;C VII. Summary and Explanation The requirements set forth in this notice are those which, based on currently available data, OSHA believes are necessary and appropriate to control conditions which may degrade indoor air and pose a significant risk of material impairment to employees in their work environments. The Agency considers that a broad approach to the control of IAQ problems, as proposed in this notice, will most effectively lead to a reduction in associated risk to employees [Exs. 3&hyph;2, 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;37, 3&hyph;41, 3&hyph;239, 3&hyph;287, 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;502]. OSHA has considered all data submitted in response to the Request for Information, as well as other scientific data which has been made a part of the record in this proceeding in arriving at these proposed provisions regarding regulation of indoor air quality. The following sections provide a summary of each provision of the proposal and a statement of their intent and purpose. Exhibit numbers included in this Summary and Explanation are citations to supporting comments and data submitted to the record in response to the RFI. The Agency solicits data, views, and comments on all provisions proposed in this notice. OSHA is interested in whether or not the proposed provisions are necessary, appropriate, and adequate to achieve the goals of the standard and why. Interested persons should also comment on whether or not the proposed provisions are technologically and economically feasible and why, and whether additional or alternative provisions addressing indoor air quality should be included in the standard and why.
