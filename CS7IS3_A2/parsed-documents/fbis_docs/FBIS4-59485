FBIS4-59485 "drnes094dd_94011" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Difficulty in Forming Administration Reported Difficulty in Forming Administration Reported LD1305134194 Stockholm Radio Sweden in Swedish 1030 GMT 13 May 94 LD1305134194 Stockholm Radio Sweden Swedish BFN [Excerpts] Our Middle East correspondent, Cecilia Udden, reports that cheering Palestinians gathered in the streets of Jericho when Israel handed over power after 27 years of occupation. It is not yet quite clear, however, which Palestinians the Israelis have handed over power to, she reports: [Udden] [passage omitted] Many people are skeptical of self-rule and skeptical of Yasir 'Arafat's way of exercising democracy. Since December, many leading persons, including spokeswoman Hanan 'Ashrawi, have relinquished official responsibility. But yesterday the PLO announced at a news conference in Cairo that 15 people have been nominated, including Hanan 'Ashrawi, which came as a surprise to herself, according to reports received by this program. [passage omitted] But one important name is conspicuous by its absence from the list of 15 candidates for the so-called Palestinian government: Dr. Haydar Abd-al-Shafi, the popular and respected doctor from Gaza, who led the Palestinian delegation when the peace talks started. People in Gaza say about Dr. Haydar that he is kind-hearted. I asked him whether he does not feel any pity for Yasir 'Arafat now that it seems difficult to put together a government. But Dr. Haydar is unrelenting. [Begin 'Abd-al-Shafi recording, in English] I said that I am ready to participate if 'Arafat yields to democratic principles. It is his self-made problem. We didn't make the problem for him. [end recording] [Udden] [passage omitted] The moment of truth will only come when elections are held in the West Bank and Gaza. The election, planned for July, can be held in the fall at the earliest. Dr. Haydar, who refuses to be a member of a PLO-nominated administration, can, however, envision running as a candidate in elections. I do not rule out the possibility, he says diplomatically. [Begin 'Abd-al-Shafi recording, in English] Well, I don't rule that out. I only say it like this: I want to, but it is too early to say. I say I don't rule out my participation. [end recording]
