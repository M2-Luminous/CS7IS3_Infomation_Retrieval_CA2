FBIS4-45009 "jpnea031___94017" JPRS-NEA-94-031 JPRS Near East & South Asia 27 May 1994 NEAR EAST SUDAN Al-Mahdi on His Detention Al-Mahdi on His Detention 94LD0063A London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Arabic 27 May 94 p 5 94LD0063A London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Arabic CSO [Interview With al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, Leader of Sudan's al-Ummah Party, by Muhammad Sa'id Muhammad al-Hasan, in Khartoum; date not given] [Excerpts] Khartoum--[Passage omitted] What About the Interrogation? [Al-Hasan] When the guests departed, we asked when and why Sadiq al-Mahdi was summoned [by the security agency]? [Al-Mahdi] Three weeks after the holiday sermon in the third week of last Shawwal (March), an officer came to me and said that they wanted me at the Security Agency premises in Khartoum at 1100 on Tuesday, 29 March. I went there and stayed with them from 1100 until 0700 the next morning. Four different security teams interrogated me. The conversation focused on articles written, statements made, interviews published, and the holiday sermon. They had no specific purpose, no charge and no particular thing to which to refer. I concluded that they wanted to express their resentment. I was released the next morning, and I went home. But I was summoned again, unexpectedly. (Al-Mahdi added:) The second time, I was summoned to the Security Agency premises on a Thursday morning in the same month and at the same time, and I stayed there until 1900. I was interrogated by two teams. Finally, two teams of security officers said to me: We think that you have committed violations in your activities and we consider these violations detrimental to security. Because there are security violations, we are interrogating you. I told them that I concluded from the nature of the questions that "your purpose is to exhaust and offend me. But if there are violations; if you plan to take steps and deal with us as a security figure, whereas we are in fact a political figure to you; and as long as there is no basis for legitimacy in the country, we will continue to demand this basis, namely the restoration of legitimacy. As long as you fail to respond and as long as legitimacy is imposed unilaterally, there will continue to be a conflict between us and you. The answer is to seek an acceptable solution for legitimacy so the conflict will be governed by this legitimacy. In the absence of legitimacy, the basis of legitimacy will continue to be envisioned subjectively and from a partisan perspective. We will continue to demand legitimacy, regardless of what steps will be taken. We must be dealt with as a political figure, not a security figure." Strange Incidents [Al-Hasan] What about the recent political conditions? [Al-Mahdi] The most outstanding manifestation in the recent period is the emergence of some sort of solidarity among all Islamic forces in Sudan, which have defined their position toward the regime. This reflects a new and clear phenomenon. The second point is the emergence of an almost united position among the southern political forces on the demand for self-determination. This, too, is a new phenomenon. It is my opinion that there is a recurrence of interestingly strange incidents in Sudan, such as fires in banks, including the Khartoum Bank and the Bank of Sudan. There has also been an armed attack on a mosque in Omdurman and there have been armed robberies in the capital in broad daylight. These phenomena or strange incidents recur every two or three weeks, and with increasing severity. They are truly strange phenomena, and they all fall within the context of violation of the laws and of public order. Splits Within the Regime (Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi added:) There are evident splits within the regime, and they are documented and discussed. It hasn't been customary, not even within the bounds of democracy, for conflicts and mutual accusations to reach this degree. For example, Ibrahim Idam, a former Revolution Command Council member and the minister of communication, condemns the privatization of telecommunications and makes the charge that this would be a betrayal of trust and a waste of public money. Professor Ma'mun Hamidah, a former president of Khartoum University, condemns the higher education phenomenon explicitly; calls the new universities "slogans;" and accuses the regime of abandoning the resolutions adopted by the higher education conference and of deviating fundamentally from the educational policies. 'Abd-al-Rahim Hamdi, a former finance minister, has issued a statement denouncing the new fiscal policies and saying that they are in conflict with the three-year program. He has also said that he resigned because of deviation from the three-year program policies. AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI Then there is AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI, a paper that has come to crown this domestic situation with an endeavor to provide a critical podium. It is true that some people believe that this idea has been concocted by the regime and that it is a maneuver on the regime's part. I personally don't believe so. Mahjub 'Urwah is from the Front (meaning the National Islamic Front). But he has a different opinion. 'Urwah believes that the Front has burned its bridges with the political forces and that these bridges must be rebuilt. The proof of this is that he invited me two years ago to talk to me about an issue that could be discussed by Sudan's intellectual political forces under the title of a "vision of the future under the canopy of the new world order." Shaykh Rached Ghannouchi, [Tunisia's] al-Nahdah Movement chairman, then visited me in my house, accompanied by a young al-Nahdah member called Omar Hamed. We embarked on a dialogue about the tendencies of the current regime in Sudan. It was my opinion that this regime is a foe of Islam. Shaykh Ghannouchi's opinion was that, regardless of its faults, the regime is correctable. At that meeting, Hamed mentioned that there was in the Islamic Front a tendency stressing that the Front had to overcome its isolation by establishing bridges with the other political forces. He cited Mahjub 'Urwah as an example. In my opinion, all this shows that Mahjub 'Urwah has been trying to establish some sort of dialogue with the opposing opinion. It has been evident to me that he has been trying to establish an independent newspaper, believing that this would serve the interest of the Sudanese regime and that it would improve this regime's image in the eyes of the world. It has been 'Urwah's opinion that this should be done by establishing a degree of freedom of the press. Therefore, the policies expressed by AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI have been totally logical. (Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi added:) This is why I don't see that the paper is biased. It believes that others have erred and it wants to help, or help them. It is sufficient to say that in two months, AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI has, want it or not, been able to do the following: 1. Document the corruption existing at present, and from inside sources. 2. Form a public opinion that wants an opposing opinion. 3. It has, in contrast, exposed the failure of the official media in a way that has annoyed this media greatly. It is my opinion that the steps taken against 'Urwah actually reflect the regime's resentment of these facts. Al-Mahdi went on to add in his interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: It has become impossible to lie about the extremely evident phenomenon of economic failure. Prices of food supplies have gone out of control, and so has the dollar price. The negative impact of the taxes and of the harsh means employed to collect them has surfaced. People have turned in their licenses so they will not be pursued by taxes. This phenomenon of turning in licenses reflects economic deterioration. But on the other hand, it has made people who are actively engaged in illicit economic activity proceed to embark on all kinds of illegal commercial enterprises. Smuggling has increased. The regime has focused on violations connected with its security. But it has been surprised to find itself unprepared for the violations that come from these parties. [passage omitted]
