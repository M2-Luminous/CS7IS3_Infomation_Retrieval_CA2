Interviewed by RIA, he noted that there is no means to pay AES personnel for their work properly or to buy fuel, equipment, and spares. In this situation highly qualified specialists are defecting en masse to Russia's nuclear facilities. All this, (Bronnikov) stressed, puts Ukrainian nuclear power engineers in extreme conditions, which is impermissible if atomic power stations are to function normally.
