TITLE: Gas Transportation and Processing Allowances OMB approval number: 1010&hyph;0075. ABSTRACT: When a company enters into a contract to develop, produce, and dispose of gas and associated products from Federal or Indian lands, that company agrees to pay the United States or Indian Tribe or allottee a share (royalty) of the full value of production from the leased lands. In order to determine whether the amount of royalty tendered represents the proper royalty due, it is necessary to establish the value of allowances being deducted from royalty payments. Allowances are taken for the cost of processing the gas stream to extract associated products, and for the cost of transporting the gas to the processing plant and to the point of sale. The information collected is necessary to evaluate the reasonableness of allowances taken and to ensure that proper royalty payments are made. Bureau Form Numbers: MMS&hyph;4109, MMS&hyph;4295. Frequency: Annually, or when contracts are changed or terminated. Description of Respondents: Gas product companies. Estimated Completion Time: Average_3 hours. Annual Responses: 5,535.
