Jiang made the remark during a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen this afternoon in Zhongnanhai. Bentsen is the first U.S. cabinet member to visit China since the presidents of the two countries met in Seattle last November. Jiang, welcoming Bentsen, said that he hoped that the treasury secretary's visit would increase bilateral mutual-understanding. Bentsen noted that both the United States and China are big countries and they share a huge trade volume. The United States hopes to promote its economic and trade cooperation with China, said Bentsen. He told Jiang that President Clinton was much impressed with his meeting with Jiang in Seattle and the U.S. President "appreciated the wise counsel you offered during the meeting." Jiang said that he had a very successful talk with U.S. President Bill Clinton during the Seattle meeting and they had reached a common understanding, which is that the relationship between China and the United States is very important. He said that the Seattle meeting created a new start for the development of bilateral relations and he hoped that such a momentum would be maintained. The Chinese president said that both China and the United States should seize the current opportunity and create more contacts and exchanges at different levels, build up mutual trust, and make joint efforts to push Sino-U.S. relations gradually onto the normal track of development. Sino-U.S. trade and economic ties are a very important part of bilateral relations, Jiang said, and China is focusing on the construction of modernization while the United States is also facing a task of vitalizing its economy, and the two economies are strongly complementary. Therefore, he said, expanding exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the fields of economy, trade, science and technology are in line with the practical interests of the two peoples. China will quicken its pace in reform, opening-up and the establishment of the socialist market economy in 1994, Jiang said, and this has created new opportunities for further development of trade and economic ties between China and the United States. Jiang expressed the hope that the treasury secretary would gain a better knowledge of China's economic development and its potential through the current visit. Earlier this afternoon, Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji met with Bentsen and his party and hosted a luncheon in their honor in the Great Hall of the People. In a candid and friendly [tan shuai you hao 0982 3764 0646 1170] atmosphere, they exchanged views on development of bilateral economic relations and trade.
