The two presidents will meet at the end of the month. Most subjects to be discussed at the meeting have already been carefully prepared. In Kazakhstan itself, votes in the republic's first parliamentary elections are still being counted. According to provisional figures, about 75 percent of the electorate took part in the elections, which were for the Supreme Kenges and local councils. The organizers of the polls had certain worries about the northern part of the republic, where the Russian-speaking community predominates. However, there was no boycott, although foreign observers are saying that the elections were not completely free and fair. According to Radio France Internationale, Andranik Migranyan, an adviser to the Russian president, who went to Almaty to monitor the elections, said that an attempt was made to ensure that the new parliament is dominated by Kazakh deputies rather than by representatives of other ethnic groups. Kazakhstan's Central Electoral Commission naturally rejects the allegations that there have been numerous contraventions of voting procedures. The commission's chairman, Karatay Turysov, described them as being clearly exaggerated. The complaints which have already been received are being painstakingly checked, Turysov said, and the necessary conclusions will be drawn from each of them.
