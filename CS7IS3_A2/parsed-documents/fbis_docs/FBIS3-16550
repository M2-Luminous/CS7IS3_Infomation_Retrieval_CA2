He explained that munitions factories now remained without stiff centralised administration and are subdivided into three self-organised systems. According to Shaposhnikov, one of them is engaged in filling orders from the Defence Ministry and "keeps afloat with paltry budgetary injections." The second, numerically bigger and more important, is called upon "to develop new types of weaponry and operate with an eye to the future." It is financed with budgetary leftovers and is dragging out beggarly existence, the marshal noted. The third, the smallest in talent and technical potential, sells weaponry abroad. It lives a lavish living. "Therefore, aspirants for foreign business trips are besieging this system." The marshal expressed opinion that the three systems should be pooled into a powerful scientific and production complex to work on three or four conversion programmes instead of the present 11. A specially appointed vice-premier should supervise the complex. "The restoration of the vertical of production subordination will immediately tell on labour productivity," Shaposhnikov claimed. Consumer goods now account for 80 per cent of munitions factories' output. But these goods overstock their warehouses due to high prices and mutual non-payments. On the other hand, Russia lost its place on the world arms market by cutting the production of combat materiel. The marshal suggests that Russia use the experience of advanced arms-manufacturing countries. For instance, the United States is not afraid of selling new types of weapons. It channels earned revenues to research and introduces advanced technologies. Business-like Americans offer Russia surpluses of revenues from their arms business for its conversion programmes, removing thereby a potentially powerful competitor. "The military-industrial complex does not need subsidies. It can earn huge revenues for the Russian treasury. It is only necessary to help it to brace for the implementation of a long-term programme suggested by specialists," Shaposhnikov concluded.
