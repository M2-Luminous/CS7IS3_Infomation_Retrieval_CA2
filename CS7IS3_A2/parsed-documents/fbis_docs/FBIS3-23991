A governmental delegation of managers of ministries that visited Magnitogorsk has returned to Moscow. The objective of their trip was to prepare a presidential draft edict concerning the completion of the modernization of the Magnitogorsk metallurgical combine. The sum of necessary investments for Magnitka's transformation into a modern world-standard plant is estimated to be 1.03 trillion rubles.[R] The Magnitogorsk metallurgical combine is one of the largest plants in Russia. Its maximum annual volume of steel smelting has totaled 16 million tonnes--this record was achieved in 1989. A large-scale program to modernize the combine was started in 1985. This program was supposed to be financed by the state, and it was only partially implemented because of a shortage of budgetary resources. Only the first object of modernization--the oxygen-converter shop--was built--it was put into operation in 1991. The next object in the comprehensive program of modernization of Magnitka was the hot-rolling "mill 2000," whose start-up is planned for the first to second quarter of this year. The mill has its own interesting history: At first, it was sold to Poland, and, subsequently, the Poles changed their mind, and "mill 2000" returned to Russia. All of these operations were conducted under the aegis of interstate agreements. Magnitka had to assemble it, which is also a rather expensive measure. The third measure of the modernization program is the start-up of the largest cold-rolling mill of "mill 2000"--one of the main measures of the federal program for the development of metallurgy. Up until now, similar mills existed only in three Russian metallurgical plants--in Cherepovets, Volgograd, and Lipetsk. Of course, they represent much older modifications. The Magnitogorsk metallurgical combine has concluded a contract with the German firm Schleman-Siman for a total sum of $590 million. The general contractor for this project will be the Magnitostroy trust. The Rosmontazhspetsstroy organization will participate in the assembly work, and the Uralmash organization--one of the contenders for implementing the entire project--will take part in the production of equipment. The introduction of all three objects will transform Magnitka into a modern metallurgical plant that conforms to Western standards. It is expected that this will take four years and that the volume of necessary financing will be R1.03 trillion. Naturally, without state support that is manifested in both favorable investment credits and in exemption from customs duties for this period, the combine will not be able to implement its plans. Although, as was declared by Mr. Sarychev, the technical director of the combine, in order to attract resources for the modernization with the help of issues, it is possible that a scheme will be employed for a separate conversion of the new plant to a joint-stock company, conditionally called Steel-2.
