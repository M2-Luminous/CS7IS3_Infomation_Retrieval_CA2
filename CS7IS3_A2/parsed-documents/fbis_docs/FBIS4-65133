The latest effort is taking place just a few days before the UN secretary general submits his report to the Security Council. The negotiations will continue tomorrow. Two representatives of Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas are also participating in the meeting. It is felt that there is no chance for the talks to succeed because the Turkish side insists on maintaining its intransigent position. The Security Council is committed to studying alternate ways of promoting the Cyprus issue if it is ascertained that the UN secretary general's current effort has failed. The Cypriot Government has said it does not expect anything from this meeting, because it does not believe that Turkish intransigence will bend. In Athens, the Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman said the meeting shows that the international community recognizes the need for making efforts toward the Turkish side. The spokesman stressed that the Greek Government hopes the UN secretary general's report will condemn Turkish intransigence.
