In his letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, he said the United States is not ready to do anything more to stop the bloodshed in Bosnia; hence, he is resigning his post. In Bosnia, Serbian and Croat forces are committing brutal atrocities against the innocent Muslims there. Muslims are rapidly being deprived of all the basic necessities, and Bosnia is not allowed to buy arms from any country. The situation has reached such an extent that even some UN observers and soldiers have committed excesses against Muslim women in Bosnia. Serbian and Croat forces are being provided with arms by Yugoslavia and other Western countries. In Bosnia, Russian soldiers are fighting along with the Serbs. But the doors to all sorts of assistance have been closed to Bosnian Muslims. When Iran tried to supply the Bosnian Muslims with arms, the Egyptian authorities seized them at the Suez Canal. Of course, during Nawaz Sharif's tenure, Pakistan provided Bosnia with 250 million rupees in assistance and a large loan. Recently, during his visit to Bosnia, Mohammad Nawaz Sharif set up an aid fund worth 20 million rupees. According to the Bosnian president, if the 150,000 Muslim soldiers had arms, they could turn the tide of the war within a few days. The United States and other Western countries are a major obstacle to this; they are not ready to tolerate the existence of a Muslim state in Europe. The Western countries that champion the cause of human rights and human values keep silent about the repeated Serb violations of cease-fire accords. It is a dismal fact that even the Muslim countries, except for Pakistan and Iran, have not raised an effective voice in support of Bosnia. Recently, mass Muslim graves have been discovered in Croatia. The Muslim world's silence regarding these atrocities is tantamount to insensitivity of the first order. If the Muslim countries were to unite and exert pressure on the United Nations, and if there was a shift in the policy of the United States and other Western countries, the Bosnian Muslims could be saved from the Serb atrocities, and have their freedom protected as well.
