FR940304-2-00060 FR940304-2-00035 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration [Docket No. 93D&hyph;0441] Medical Devices; Reclassification of the Daily Wear Soft and Daily Wear Nonhydrophilic Plastic Contact Lenses; Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact Lenses; Availability AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order reclassifying daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses from class III (premarket approval) into class II (special controls). This reclassification is required by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (the SMDA). This reclassification only applies to daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic contact lenses. Lenses intended for extended wear will remain in class III, as will contact lens accessories. The SMDA also requires FDA to put into place any regulatory safeguards that are necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the reclassified lenses. Thus, FDA is announcing the availability of a guidance document entitled ``Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact Lenses.'' The guidance sets forth the evidence that should be submitted to FDA to demonstrate the substantial equivalence of new daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses to lenses already marketed. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register , FDA is publishing a final rule to codify the reclassification of the daily wear contact lens from class III (premarket approval) into class II (special controls). DATES: The reclassification is effective March 4, 1994. Written comments on the guidance document may be submitted at any time. ADDRESSES: Submit all amendments to pending premarket approval applications (PMA's), including the PMA or PMA supplement number, to the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, PMA Document Mail Center (HFZ&hyph;401), 1390 Piccard Dr., Rockville, MD 20850.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David M. Whipple, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ&hyph;460), Food and Drug Administration, 1390 Piccard Dr., Rockville, MD 20850, 301&hyph;594&hyph;2205. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. The Statutory Requirements The SMDA (Pub. L. 101&hyph;629), which amended the medical device provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321&hyph;394) contained specific provisions on transitional devices (i.e., those devices regulated as drugs before the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (Pub. L. 94&hyph;295) became law) (see section 520(l) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360j(l))). In 1976, Congress classified all transitional products, including daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses, into class III (premarket approval). Essentially the SMDA, reflecting congressional concern that many transitional devices were being over regulated in class III, directed FDA to collect certain safety and effectiveness information from the manufacturers of transitional devices and review the classifications of those transitional devices that still remained in class III to determine if the devices could be down classified to class II (special controls) or class I (general controls). Under section 520(l)(5)(B) of the act, FDA was to publish regulations by December 1, 1992, either leaving the transitional class III devices in class III or revising their classifications down to class I or class II. However, as permitted by section 520(l)(5)(c) of the act, the agency, in the Federal Register of November 30, 1992 (57 FR 56586), published a notice extending the period for issuing such regulations until December 1, 1993. With respect to the reclassification of daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses, however, the SMDA makes further provision. Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the SMDA provides that notwithstanding the provisions for reclassification of other transitional devices, FDA shall not retain daily wear soft or daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses in class III unless the agency determines that the devices meet the statutory criteria for a class III device. Moreover, if FDA has not determined that these contact lenses must remain in class III and published its finding by November 28, 1993, in the Federal Register , then under section 4(b)(3)(D) of the SMDA, FDA ``shall issue an order placing the lenses in class II.'' Both the language and legislative history of the SMDA make it clear that the reclassification of daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic contact lenses shall occur as a matter of law unless FDA published a finding that the devices should remain in class III. FDA has not made such a finding: FDA believes that the safety and effectiveness of daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses can be ensured through specified ``special controls'' as authorized by the SMDA. Therefore, the agency has not made and published any finding that daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic contact lenses must remain in class III. II. Order Therefore, as required by section 4(b)(3)(D) of the SMDA, FDA is issuing this order to all manufacturers of daily wear soft and daily wear nonhydrophilic contact lenses reclassifying their devices from class III (premarket approval) into class II (special controls). The devices being reclassified are contact lenses intended for daily wear that meet the following descriptions: Rigid Gas Permeable Contact Lens . A rigid gas permeable contact lens is a device intended to be worn directly against the cornea of the eye to correct vision conditions. The device is made of various materials, such as cellulose acetate butyrate, polyacrylate-silicone, or silicone elastomers, whose main polymer molecules generally do not absorb or attract water. Soft (Hydrophilic) Contact Lens . A soft (hydrophilic) contact lens is a device intended to be worn directly against the cornea and adjacent limbal and scleral areas of the eye to correct vision conditions or to act as a therapeutic bandage. The device is made of various polymer materials, the main polymer molecules of which absorb or attract a certain volume (percentage) of water. III. Guidance In addition to issuing this order as required by the SMDA, FDA is issuing a guidance document for premarket notifications for the reclassified contact lenses entitled, ``Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact Lenses.'' This guidance sets forth the special controls that FDA has determined are needed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of daily wear plastic contact lenses. It also provides comprehensive directions to enable a manufacturer of a daily wear soft or daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lens to submit a 510(k) premarket notification demonstrating substantial equivalence of the device to a legally marketed daily wear plastic contact lens (predicate device). Information on the battery of preclinical testing necessary to demonstrate substantial equivalence is included in the guidance. If the results of preclinical testing demonstrate the device to have new characteristics, clinical performance data may be needed to establish substantial equivalence. If clinical performance data are needed, the guidance document provides suggested methodologies (e.g., size and scope of the study) to be included in an investigational protocol. The preclinical portion of the guidance document consists of manufacturing and chemistry, toxicology and microbiology sections outlining the type of testing that should be completed. Each section includes a summary of the basic requirements and suggested methods for meeting these requirements. Other elements of the guidance document include: (1) General information on the regulations and requirements for labeling contact lenses; (2) requirements that must be met prior to modifying a marketed contact lens; (3) suggested methodologies for meeting color additive requirements; (4) procedures for adding lens finishing laboratories for manufacturing and marketing of class II rigid gas permeable contact lenses; and (5) the procedure for implementing changes in packaging materials. In the event that clinical trials are necessary, FDA emphasizes that manufacturers must conduct the trials in accordance with the Investigational Device Exemption regulations in 21 CFR part 812. At this time, FDA considers clinical studies of daily wear soft or daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses to be nonsignificant risk investigations. FDA considers clinical studies of extended wear contact lenses to be significant risk investigations. Thus, for daily wear soft or daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses, an institutional review board (IRB) approval is always necessary before initiating a clinical study, and an investigational plan and informed consent document must be presented to an IRB for review and approval. For extended wear contact lenses, the manufacturer must obtain both IRB and FDA approvals in accordance with 21 CFR part 812 before clinical testing can be initiated. This guidance document will be discussed at the next meeting of the Ophthalmic Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee. The date, time, and place of this meeting will be announced in a future issue of the Federal Register . IV. Transition Phase for Pending PMA's for Daily Wear Contact Lenses Below, FDA discusses how it will deal with the pending original and supplemental PMA's involving daily wear soft or daily wear nonhydrophilic plastic contact lenses currently filed with the agency. As of today's date, all pending PMA applications will need to be examined to identify: (1) Those that are no longer subject to PMA review and can be converted to 510(k)'s or withdrawn and resubmitted to FDA by the applicant to be evaluated through the 510(k) process; and (2) those which can be withdrawn by the applicant and are required to be resubmitted and evaluated as a 510(k) prior to implementing the request. FDA will make all final decisions on converted PMA's based on 510(k) regulatory requirements as elaborated in the ``Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact Lenses.'' To ensure expeditious conversions, sponsors should review their pending PMA's and advise the agency as to what administrative action the sponsor believes needs to be taken regarding their pending applications affected by the automatic reclassification. FDA is suspending the review of each pending original and supplemental PMA affected in whole or in part by this reclassification order until the respective sponsor amends its application setting forth the status of the devices and the administrative actions requested to be taken regarding its application. These administrative actions can include the following: (1) For a pending PMA that involves only contact lenses covered by this reclassification, the sponsor may ask that its PMA application be converted, in total, to a 510(k) application. The amendment to the PMA should include all of the necessary content requirements for a 510(k), thus making the application as complete as possible when it is converted to a 510(k). For example, if an applicant has a pending PMA supplement for a modification to a previously approved daily wear contact lens, and if this modification has been identified in the ``Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact Lenses'' as a change requiring submission of a 510(k), the applicant can amend this PMA with a request to convert it into a 510(k). PMA's converted to 510(k)'s under this order will retain their position in the review queue (if they are complete), and the review process will continue without further delay. (2) For a pending PMA that involves both lenses that are covered by this reclassification and those that are not, the applicant should withdraw the portion of the application that addresses the reclassified lenses and resubmit it as a 510(k) application. For example, if a pending PMA contains a request for a new or modified lens material for both a daily and extended wear contact lens, the applicant should withdraw the request for the daily wear lens and ask the agency to proceed with the review of that portion of the PMA involving the extended wear contact lens only. Pending PMA's that must, in part, be resubmitted as a 510(k) application will retain their position in the review queue if the applicant responds with the appropriate amendment and clearly states in the amendment that the daily wear contact lens portion of the PMA will be resubmitted as a 510(k) application. Whichever option applies, the applicant should determine whether the previous request involving the daily wear contact lens must be resubmitted and evaluated through the 510(k) process or be implemented without the need for submission of a 510(k). To make this determination, the applicant should consult the 510(k) procedures (21 CFR part 807) and the ``Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact Lenses.'' If the applicant determines that a 510(k) application is required, the sponsor should resubmit the application following the content and format requirements for 510(k) applications. The agency notes that preclinical and clinical data formerly required in the PMA may still be necessary to support a substantial equivalence determination. Preclinical and clinical data which is also contained in a pending PMA may be incorporated by reference in a 510(k) application. The applicant should include in the amendment the claim of substantial equivalence to their previously approved daily wear contact lens and a summary of the safety and effectiveness information or a statement that the applicant will make the safety and effectiveness information available to interested persons upon request. In addition, sponsors should determine if there is information in the pending PMA that would not be needed when resubmitted as a 510(k) application. In making this determination, FDA cautions sponsors to review the regulations pertaining to releasability of information in PMA's and 510(k) applications before simply converting PMA's to 510(k) applications since the disclosure regulations may treat information in the applications differently. For this reason, a manufacturer may choose not to have the pending PMA converted to a 510(k) application, but instead choose to withdraw the pending application, purge it of unnecessary information that the sponsor might not want released, and resubmit the relevant data in a new 510(k) application. If an applicant fails to submit an amendment as outlined above within 180 days, FDA will consider the pending PMA or PMA supplement to be voluntarily withdrawn. In such cases, the agency will notify the applicant by letter of the withdrawal. All amendments to pending PMA's shall include the PMA or PMA supplement number and shall be addressed to the PMA Document Mail Center (address above). Additional questions regarding the administrative procedures resulting from this reclassification order should be directed to the PMA Staff (Kathy Lundsten, 301&hyph;594&hyph;2186), or to the Division of Ophthalmic Devices, Contact Lens Branch (David M. Whipple, 301&hyph;594&hyph;2205, or James F. Saviola, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1744). Dated: February 24, 1994. Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Commissioner for Policy.
