Japanese-U.S. trade frictions have lasted for 30 years. In this period, the two countries continued to hold talks and continued to work out new programs in an attempt to solve or mitigate frictions. The latest round of such talks began after the G-7 summit meeting in Tokyo last July. An interesting fact was that the breakdown of the talks this time did not cause the host and the guest to leave each other unhappily. At the news conference, the two leaders made rather frank speeches which were benign on their overall relations. After admitting that the talks had broken down, Clinton said that it was better to have reached no agreement than to have reached an empty agreement. Hosokawa said that frankly admitting things that could not be done was a demonstration of the maturity of bilateral relations. The two leaders both agreed that the breakdown of their economic talks would not affect the cooperative Japanese-U.S. relationship in global affairs. Public opinion here pointed out that all the previous economic talks between the Japan and the United States ended with Japanese concessions. This time, Japan explicitly said "no," and this was also the first time Japan had done this. After the breakdown of the talks, both sides frankly admitted the fact of the breakdown and said that this would not affect bilateral relations. This was also an unprecedented event. Therefore, public opinion in Japan was rather elated at this result. Japanese commentators said that although the talks did not succeed, a new relationship of "being able to speak frankly" between Japan and the United States had been established beyond expectations. This was of great significance to Japan. The dissolution of the Cold War-oriented world pattern has weakened the binding force among Western countries, which have attached greater importance to their respective national interests in approaching their mutual relations. Among the three major pillars of their relations, namely, political, security, and economic pillars, the first two have become less and less important, while the economic factor has become the main factor deciding relations between the Western countries. While major changes have occurred in the international situation, the status of the United States is also becoming much weaker than before, and Japan is adopting a much stronger sense of being a big power. Such an objective situation has forced the United States to attach importance to the principle of "reaching agreement through consultations" in approaching its relations with other Western countries. Eventually, Japan dared to say "no" in the talks, and this could only appear in a book rather than in reality a few years ago. After the recent talks, will Japan really be able to stand on an equal footing with the United States? While expressing its happiness, Japanese public opinion also paid attention to the fact that after the breakdown of the talks, the hawk faction on the U.S. side demanded that "Super 301" should be applied to impose sanctions against Japan; they also noted that the U.S. side this time was unconcerned mainly because it had confidence derived from the beginning of its economic recovery. Therefore, Japanese commentators said that while saying "no," Japan should still take some initiatives in the economic field. Under the current changeable and complicated international situation, the development of Japanese-U.S. relations after the recent summit meeting will become more significant.
