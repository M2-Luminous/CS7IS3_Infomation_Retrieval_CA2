All sectors must boost farming because it has a direct impact on the people's lives and social stability, said Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). He told the opening session of the seventh meeting of the CPPCC Standing Committee that the Party and the State Council want solid agricultural growth this year. "As the country's top advisory body, the CPPCC should pay close attention to the development of agriculture and offer good suggestions to solving problems in this sector," said Li. State Councillor Chen Junsheng, who is now in charge of China's agriculture, yesterday reported that the rural economy is generally good -- there have been several successful harvests, the economy has made consistent and comprehensive achievements, and the living standards of farmers have also been improved. However, he warned that some problems still haunt the agriculture sector, which cannot be ignored if the nation is to continue economic development and to readjust the economic system. The problems include the imbalance in supply and demand of grain, uneven agricultural production among areas, gaps between cotton supply and demand, slow increases of farmers' income, rural unemployment, and disappearing cultivated land. Farming has also been hindered by shortages of scientists and technicians, the decline of agriculture production in the coastal areas, and price hikes of farm production materials. Chen said the government will push for more high yield, quality, and efficient agriculture. Meanwhile, the government will give a specialized loan of 10 billion yuan ($1.15 billion) to support the development of rural enterprises, boosting the agricultural modernization drive. "Cooperation between rural enterprises in eastern and western areas must be expanded," he added. The CPPCC has organized three inspection teams for three grain-producing provinces, including Anhui, Henan, and Shanxi, to investigate the agriculture situation there. More than 200 CPPCC Standing Committee members will spend the five-day meeting in Beijing voicing their suggestions and opinions on the country's agriculture development.
