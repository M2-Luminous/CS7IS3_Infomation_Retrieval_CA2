It seems, however, that an appetite for secrets comes in the eating. Now, according to KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI, (citing an interview with V. Nazarenko, deputy chief of the Ukraine Security Service Division in Zaporozhskaya Oblast), foreign knights of the cloak and dagger are not content with the "enhanced interest in secrets concentrated in the region." Recently the Ukraine Security Service caught red-handed several residents of Zaporozhskaya Oblast who in exchange for "greenbacks" transferred valuable information abroad. Without a second's hesitation, special services are openly encouraging "cooperation" not only among the recruited Ukrainian citizens but also their relatives and friends. True, special services display initiative in all directions. The FBI, in particular, via the RUSSKOYE SLOVO newspaper, has called on the "Russian-speaking public of the United States and the newly arriving emigrants" to help their new country.... "Throughout many years," the FBI recalls, "emigrants from the USSR have rendered assistance to the FBI.... We request those who possess any information to come to the local FBI office."
