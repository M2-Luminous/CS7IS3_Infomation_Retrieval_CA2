FBIS4-54717 "dreeu086__a94010" FBIS-EEU-94-086-A Daily Report 4 May 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Opposition Parties To Cease Publishing Ventures Opposition Parties To Cease Publishing Ventures AU0405085594 Prague CTK in English 0833 GMT 4 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0405085594 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague May 4 (CTK) -- Two Czech opposition parties, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) and the Liberal National Social Party (LSNS), will have to leave the publishing ventures in which they are shareholders, the Czech agricultural daily ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY writes today. On April 29, parliament approved a bill forbidding political parties and movements from raising money other than through membership fees, gifts, loans and credits, and lease of property. The KSCM owns a majority stake in Futura, a company which publishes HALO NOVINY, and the LSNS owns 93 percent of shares of Melantrich, a company publishing the daily SVOBODNE SLOVO. KSCM spokeswoman Vera Zezulkova says that the KSCM will respect the law and is already taking steps to comply with it but may still appeal against it at the Constitutional Court, the paper writes. The law on political parties gives them until June 1, 1995, to comply. "The KSCM considers the law to be discriminatory against the opposition parties," Zezulkova says, adding that another point the party is taking to courts is the redistribution of state subsidies to political parties, which she says "has altered election results and ignored the voters." "The situation is ripe for early elections," Zezulkova says in ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY. The future of the LSNS' stake in Melantrich will only be decided at an LSNS conference to be held in April or May 1995, the paper quotes LSNS Political Secretary Jaroslav Jurkovic as saying. One of the ways out might be to distribute the 42,000 shares among the party members, Jurkovic says, recalling a similar move by the Czechoslovak Socialist Party after the Second World War, when the party gave out Melantrich shares to "reliable members." The LSNS will not lose its grip on the orientation of SVOBODNE SLOVO, Jurkovic says in ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY.
