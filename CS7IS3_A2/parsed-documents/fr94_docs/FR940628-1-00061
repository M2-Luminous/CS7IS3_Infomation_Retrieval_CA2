List of Subjects in 43 CFR Part 426 Administrative practice and procedure, Irrigation, Reclamation, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. For the reasons stated in the preamble, it is proposed to amend 43 CFR Part 426 as follows: Dated: May 16, 1994. Elizabeth Ann Rieke, Assistant Secretary_Water and Science. PART 426_RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR PROJECTS GOVERNED BY FEDERAL RECLAMATION LAW 1. The authority citation for Part 426 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 43 U.S.C. 371&hyph;383; 43 U.S.C. 390aa-390zz-1; 31 U.S.C. 9701. 2. Section 426.24 is redesignated as §426.25, and new section 426.24 is added to read as follows: §426.24 Assessments of administrative costs. (a) Forms submittal. A district will be assessed for the administrative costs described in paragraph (e) of this section when irrigation water has been delivered to landholders that did not submit certification or reporting forms prior to the receipt of irrigation water in accordance with §426.10(e). The assessment will be applied on a yearly basis in each district for each direct and indirect landholder that received irrigation water but failed to comply with §426.10(e). (b) Forms corrections. Where corrections are needed on certification or reporting forms, the requirements of §426.10(a) will be deemed to have been met so long as the district provides corrected forms to the Bureau of Reclamation within 45 days of the date of the Bureau's written request for corrections. A district will be assessed for the administrative costs described in paragraph (e) of this section when corrected forms are not provided within this 45-day time period. The assessment will be applied on a yearly basis in each district for each direct and indirect landholder for whom corrected forms are not provided within the applicable 45-day time period. (c) Parties responsible for paying assessments. Districts shall be responsible for payment of the assessments described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. (d) Disposition of assessments. The administrative costs assessed and collected pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be deposited to the general fund of the United States Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. (e) Assessment for administrative costs. The assessment for administrative costs shall initially be set at $260. This is based on an average of the direct and indirect costs the Bureau of Reclamation incurs performing activities to obtain certification or reporting forms from landholders that failed to submit such forms prior to receipt of irrigation water and form corrections that are not submitted by the designated due date. This initial $260 assessment for administrative costs will be reviewed at least once every 5 years and adjusted, if needed, to reflect new cost data based upon the Bureau's costs for communicating with district representatives and landholders to obtain missing or corrected forms; assisting landholders in completing certification or reporting forms for the period of time they were not in compliance with the form requirements; performing onsite visits to determine if irrigation water deliveries have been terminated to landholders that failed to submit the required forms; and performing other activities necessary to address form violations. Notice of the revised assessment for administrative costs will be published in the Federal Register in December of the year the data are reviewed.
