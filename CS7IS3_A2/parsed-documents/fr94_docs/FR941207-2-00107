FR941207-2-00107 FR941207-2-00072 (c) Timing of grant awards_HUD will, consistent with the approvability of the Section 108 guarantee applications submitted, strive to obligate EDI grants contemporaneously with HUD approval of the related Section 108 loan guarantee commitment. However, the EDI grant may be awarded prior to HUD approval of the Section 108 commitment, if approvable Section 108 guarantee applications have not been submitted by the applicant at the time of EDI awards. In addition, EDI funds shall not be disbursed to the public entity before the issuance of the related Section 108 guaranteed obligations; (d) Activities proposed and approved to be carried out with EDI funds under this NOFA must be located in or serve an area qualifying for designation as an urban Empowerment Zone under the notice inviting applications, published on January 18, 1994 at 59 FR 2711. (e) Applicants subsequently designated as Federal Empowerment Zones are not eligible to receive funds under this NOFA. III. Other Matters Environmental Impact A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, implementing section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying between 7:30 am and 5:30 pm weekdays at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410. Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism , has determined that this NOFA will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their relationship with the Federal Government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between them and other levels of government. While the NOFA offers financial assistance to units of general local government, none of its provisions will have an effect on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or the States' political subdivisions. Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official for Executive Order 12606, The Family , has determined that the policies announced in this NOFA would not have the potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance and general well-being within the meaning of the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies and programs will result from issuance of this NOFA, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319 of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. HUD's regulation implementing section 13 is codified at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule. Appendix A of this rule contains examples of activities covered by this rule. Any questions concerning the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, Room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD Office. Dated: December 2, 1994. Mark D. Fabiani Deputy Assistant Secretary for Operations. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30115 Filed 12&hyph;02&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4210&hyph;29&hyph;P
