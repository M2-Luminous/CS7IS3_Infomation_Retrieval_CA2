Sierakowska said: "The government is taking steps, wants to negotiate, and does negotiate, and I think that a typical political struggle is now taking place. Any blow against the power sector, the linchpin of the economy, amounts to a real tragedy. We are already importing electricity, and a situation may arise whereby some power-generating sets will never work again, and what will happen to the people working there? "The wages in the power sector are very high, and extremely good social benefits, to which any other professional group is not entitled, are envisaged for people who may be sacked from this sector," Sierakowska said. She added that she is concerned about Mr. Krzaklewski's personal involvement and the fact that he keeps repeating: You must talk to me separately. "As it happens, Solidarity is just a trade union, like any other union," she said.
