Starting in 1998 the Schweinfurt company Fichtel & Sachs will produce the "Sachs Electric Superdrive" in bulk. This is a production-line hybrid vehicle which dispenses with the usual electric motors and their components, unlike vehicles with parallel drive train, because Sachs believes that they are too heavy and take up too much room. In the "superdrive" the clutch, gears, camshaft, and differential are replaced by a generator, a tandem gear motor and its attendant power electronics. During a long-distance trip a normal combustion engine supplies the wheel drive with current via the generator and charges the battery. For exhaust-free city driving the system switches over to battery power, which can take the car about 50 kilometers. Fichtel & Sachs promises power figures suitable for automobile travel, high efficiency, low weight and a small construction volume. They say that a tandem motor combines two electric motors, of which each will drive a wheel on one axle. So far an Audi 100 2.3 E Quattro has served as a test automobile; it has a 100-kilowatt generator which provides a tandem motor with a current of 50 kilowatts on each axle. Now tandem motors with integrated drives are being developed in cooperation with the drive manufacturers Lohmann & Stolterfoth, who also belong to the Mannesmann group. This should make the drive assembly for future hybrid vehicles even more compact.
