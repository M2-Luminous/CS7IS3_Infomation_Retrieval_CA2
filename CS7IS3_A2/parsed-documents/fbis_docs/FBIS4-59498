FBIS4-59498 "drnes094_n_94002" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 9 May 1994 LEBANON Differences Among Leadership Detailed Differences Among Leadership Detailed NC1305184194 Beirut AL-ANWAR in Arabic 9 May 94 p 3 NC1305184194 Beirut AL-ANWAR Arabic BFN ["Weekly Events" review by Fu'ad Da'bul] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] As peace knocks on Lebanese and Arab doors, the country's top three leaders [president, speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, and prime minister] are in disagreement. The only area of agreement left among the top three officials is a common, but passive, desire to keep their differences at a manageable level. At last week's Lebanese-Syrian summit the three leaders discussed the government situation and the need to maintain a united front in the peace process. Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad said that this issue is up to them and that they should do what they deem necessary and useful. It seems that President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Speaker Nabih Birri are in cahoots against Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. The president and speaker believe that the cabinet needs to be reshuffled to achieve political equilibrium in the country. They base their judgment on the country's current needs, not those of a time when a then-popular prime minister formed the cabinet amid public support and hopes for change. As soon as a reshuffle was proposed, President al-Hirawi insisted that he should have a say in the new cabinet. Speaker Birri requested that the Finance Ministry return to the Shiite sect from al-Hariri's control. The prime minister, who kept the finance portfolio for himself, is letting Minister of State Fu'ad Sinyurah run the ministry. Meanwhile, Prime Minister al-Hariri wants to address the issue of Christian representation in the government. He seeks a reshuffle that would satisfy Patriarch Sfayr and ensure the participation of the National Bloc Party [led by Paris-based politician Raymond Iddah]. A government blessed by Bkirki and containing ministers hand picked by Raymond Iddah, al-Hariri reasons, will end "dissatisfaction" among Christians. This view contradicts President al-Hirawi's view. The latter sees himself as the only person entitled to name Christian ministers. Irked by a constant barrage of criticism from his own ministers and a stream of leaks concerning a cabinet reshuffle, Prime Minister al-Hariri went into "seclusion" [unofficial discontinuation of public duties], leaving a question on all lips: Where is the country heading? Will President al-Hirawi, aided by Speaker Birri, gain the upper hand, or will al-Hariri continue to fight for "survival?" The answer is anybody's guess. However, according to available information, al-Hariri is determined to go on fighting for his government and own political future. The prime minister has a moral weight to reckon with and is determined not to leave an office he once walked into triumphantly without a fight. But he is faced with a president who also has a strong hand to play. According to our information, with al-Hariri facing a government crisis with no end in sight, he may have to stick to the "seclusion" tactic first invented by the late Prime Minister Rashid Karami in 1969. Sources close to al-Hariri say that the prime minister is determined to continue his seclusion until the ministers who attacked him back off. Al-Hariri plans to go on a hunting trip to Zimbabwe on 18 May. He is intent to brandish the sword of seclusion in the face of opponents who thought it would be easy to run him out of office. These opponents recently claimed that al-Hariri's star is waning and that his days in office are numbered. According to our information, al-Hariri has told his visitors that he refuses to be defeated by a "knockout," declaring that he will take the blows and pay them back with interest. President al-Hirawi, meanwhile, told B'abda's visitors that he has a constitutional responsibility to bear and that he is above petty calculations and is determined to uphold the Constitution and promote a spirit of reconciliation. Lebanon deserves to have durable reconciliation and lasting unity and the president is determined to cement both as the country buckles down for the task of making peace, al-Hirawi's visitors say. President al-Hirawi wants to keep his differences with prime minister al-Hariri secret. His public position is that he is above internal disputes and cares only for the country's unity and safety. Unity and understanding among the three top officials are needed for domestic as well as external peace, al-Hirawi was cited as saying. Knowledgeable observers say that Syria will not allow the Lebanese temple to come tumbling down on its allies. It keeps a bottle of "medicine" and a spoon at hand to treat the "second republic" at the first sign of ailment.
