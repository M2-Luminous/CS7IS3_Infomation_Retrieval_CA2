The Tekhnologiya NPO was the developer and the sole producer of such material in the former USSR. After the actual shutdown of the Buran program there was no call for the unique technology and numerous attempts of the directors of the NPO Tekhnologiya and NPO Energiya to offer the Obninsk thermal shielding material for use in civilian projects (including construction) for the time being have fallen through. At the International Aerospace Show MAKS-93, which was held in Moscow during the period 31 August through 5 September, the NPO Technologiya exhibit with representative ceramic material attracted the interest of specialists. However, the Obninsk ceramics also attracted interest at last year's Moscow Air Show '92, but this never led to the signing of real contracts.
