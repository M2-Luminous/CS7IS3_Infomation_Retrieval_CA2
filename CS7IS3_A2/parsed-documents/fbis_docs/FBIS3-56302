The United States accounts for only about two per cent in Russia's foreign trade. Thus, the trade turnover with the U.S. totalled 2,426 mln dollars in the period from January-November 1993, including 1,007,200 thousand dollars in export and 1.418,800 thousand in import. The structure of the bilateral trade turnover inherited by Russia from the former Soviet Union is based on raw materials, Davydov noted. The bulk of Russia's export to the United States is made up by precious metals and articles made of them, rare earth and non-ferrous metals, oil products, chemicals and agricultural produce. The U.S. import to Russia is largely represented by foodstuffs and agricultural produce (wheat, maize, oats, butter, soy-beans), machinery, equipment and transport vehicles. The Russian minister believes the legal and agreement framework for U.S.-Russian trade and economic relations set up in 1992-1993, the most-favoured-nation trade regime, the extension to Russia of the U.S. general system of preferences, as well as the new programmes for economic assistance to Russia create real preconditions for a greater volume and a broader range of U.S.- Russian trade. However, despite of the recent progress in trade and economic relations between the two countries, they still bear the stamp of the Cold War, Davydov stressed. Thus, the development of U.S.-Russian trade is hampered by the Jackson-Vanick Amendment and Cocom lists, barriers on U.S. export of hi-tech products, tough quantitative restrictions on imports. Furthermore, the solution of some commercial and financial problems is linked with various political conditions and the progress of market reforms. Recently, the United States has considerably limited the possibilities of Russian uranium products and imposed an anti-dumping duty on ferrosilicium. According to the minister, anti-dumping investigation is likely to be launched with respect to Russian supplies of potassium chloride, aluminium and steel, which may undermine the positions of Russian exporters on the American market. With all this in view, Davydov thinks it necessary to work out a mechanism of bilateral consultations to prevent possible conflicts over the trade regime. According to the minister, Russia should also press for lifting the existing non-tariff restrictions on Russian exports to the United States and for using partnership relations with the U.S. to ensure Russia's full-fledged participation in GATT and the international export control system. Large-scale cooperation in the investment sphere is to promote U.S.- Russian trade and economic relations as well, the Russian minister pointed out.
