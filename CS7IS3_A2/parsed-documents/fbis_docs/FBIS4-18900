The regions are slated to meet here on Wednesday [13 April] in an effort to play a more active role in the federalist debate, which until now has been dominated by the Northern League, and to stress the need to reconcile federalism with national unity, the basis of which they claim would be the creation of a House of Regions. The president of the Region of Tuscany, Vannino Chiti, explained here on Saturday how "The federalism we envision as Italian regions and promoters of this initiative foresees a new balance of powers and responsibilities between the central state and the regions." "The problem of the so-called macro-regions," he added, "arises when the debate on federalism is shifted to questions of sovereignty. But, in this case, the issue becomes confederalism and not federalism. The responsibilities of the regions cannot be expanded from the center nor can they put national unity into question." Given these considerations, Chiti went on to argue how, for Italy, the best federalist model would be Germany, "also because it would be better adapt to the European Union. Those of the League are wrong to point to the example of the United States, which is too different for tradition, culture and size." In Chiti's view, the blueprint mapped out between Northern League leader Umberto Bossi and Giancarlo Fini of the National Alliance "would violate important rules of democratic behavior." "In all democratic nations" he observed, "the rules governing democratic life are the result of a consensus between the majority and the opposition. One cannot conceive of making institutional reforms over the heads of almost half of parliament and of the regions which are supposed to be part of the reform of the state." The regions' federalist initiative, on the other hand, "is of an institutional type" Chiti said, and added "We cannot tolerate that one force, which presents itself to be more contradictory than one could imagine, can impose on or discriminate against an important economic reality for the nation." The federalist debate now moves to next week's conference of the presidents of all Italian regions from which a proposal is expected to be agreed on which can then be brought to the attention of the head of state. (The argument that constitutional reform cannot be forced on by a parliamentary majority was also underscored in Rome today by Raffaele Costa, head of the Centrist Union which was part of the winning Freedom Alliance. Constitutions, he said, cannot be changed through the will of a simple majority, but must also be the result of a consensus with the opposition).
