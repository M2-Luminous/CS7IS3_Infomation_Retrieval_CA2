We accept the highest standard achieved, consisting in the right of the individual to submit a complaint against his own state for the violation of a right laid down in a contractual document (Optional Protocol to the Pact of Political and Civic Rights). The most significant event of the year 1993 was the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, which was attended by a delegation of the Slovak Republic headed by President Michal Kovac. The conference confirmed the principles of the universality and indivisibility of human rights. The Slovak Republic, like other democratic states, endorsed the idea of establishing the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights under the UN. The range of duties entrusted to the newly formed UN office will be highly important. The Slovak Republic will participate in the formulation of documents associated with this office. The activity of the Slovak Republic in UN bodies rested in its participation in codifying work. The draft Optional Protocol to the Convention on Torture Prevention is being prepared at present. The participation of the Slovak Republic in the work of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva and of the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly also plays an irreplaceable role. It is important from the viewpoint of making the Slovak Republic more visible on UN premises that the aforesaid Third Committee is chaired by a representative of the Slovak Republic. Improved cooperation with the UN and promotion of human rights are also expected from the [UN] Center for Human Rights [to be opened] in Bratislava. In the course of the World Conference on Human Rights, a seminar was organized in Bratislava on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic, in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic, on the role and tasks of national centers for human rights. The seminar was attended by delegates to the World Conference on Human Rights. Of exceptional importance for the young Slovak Republic was its admission to the Council of Europe, the basic criterion of which is respect for human rights. A prerequisite for acquiring Council of Europe membership is the signing of the European Human Rights Convention, which, owing to its control mechanism, represents today the most progressive system of human rights protection. The Slovak Republic at the same time accepted the authority of the European Commission for Human Rights to receive complaints from individuals and the jurisdiction of the European Court for Human Rights. In connection with our Council of Europe membership, a number of new tasks has arisen -- the harmonization of the legal system of the Slovak Republic with the European Human Rights Convention and supplementary protocols, the gradual accession to conventions concluded on Council of Europe premises (of which there are about 150), and participation in codifying work (work is currently being wound up on the 11th supplementary protocol, which deals with the reform of the control mechanism). Another important task is to establish the office of the Slovak Republic's legal representative (agent) in proceedings before the European Commission and the European Court for Human Rights. In connection with these new tasks, the Slovak Republic adopted a specific timetable of work, which is being adhered to. The Slovak Republic also has its representatives in the European Commission and the European Court for Human Rights. Another important international forum that is devoted to human rights and where the Slovak Republic presents its positions is the CSCE. Within the framework of CSCE seminars on the human dimension, the Slovak Republic took an active part in discussions and exchanges of views with the aim of providing an accurate picture of the state of human rights observance in the Slovak Republic. Continuation in this active participation should forestall in the future the dissemination of evaluations, based on unverified facts, such as the report prepared by the U.S. Congress Helsinki Commission. The Slovak Republic supports a coordinated and cooperative course of action by the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and the United Nations with a view to preventing duplicity and negative rivalry in the sphere of the human dimension. It welcomes recent activities by the highest representatives of the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and the United Nations aimed at the institutionalization and formalization of this cooperation. It is also possible to assess as positive the Slovak Republic's cooperation with the CSCE High Commissioner for Ethnic Minorities. The issue of protecting the rights of ethnic minorities, which has recently moved into the foreground of attention of the international community in the United Nations, the CSCE, and the Council of Europe, is a chapter in itself. This manifested itself fully during the admission of the Slovak Republic into the Council of Europe when the attention of Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly reporters focused on the Slovak Republic's minority policy, which resulted in clearly formulated recommendations. These recommendations are being gradually met by the Slovak Republic. Another important task was participation by Slovak Republic experts in the preparation of legally binding documents dealing with the protection of rights of members of ethnic minorities. In view of the newly adopted procedure for monitoring new Council of Europe member states' compliance with their commitments, a mission by Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly reporters took place toward the end of 1993. It will be necessary to evaluate the results of this mission and to adopt the appropriate measures if necessary. A serious problem of our foreign policy that has become clearly crystallized in the first year of the Slovak Republic's existence [as an independent state] lies in the Hungarian Republic's approach to the minority issue. With varied success, the Hungarian Republic casts doubt on the minority policy of the Slovak Republic. This is also contributed to by the Slovak Republic's frequently uncoordinated course of action and the inability to present to the international public the fact that minorities in the Slovak Republic have had, and continue to have, rights going beyond the framework of the relevant international documents, such as the CSCE document of Copenhagen. As a result, our position last year was rather defensive and, instead of launching our own activities, we more often reacted to external prodding. At the beginning of the year, negotiations started on the premises of the Central European Initiative on a document on the protection of ethnic minority rights. From both the formal viewpoint and from the viewpoint of its contents, the text of the aforementioned document was from the beginning unacceptable to the Slovak Republic. Representatives of the Slovak Republic had to spend much effort to achieve that, by means of negotiations, the document gradually assumed a shape that was acceptable to the Slovak Republic. In the period under review, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cooperated also with other government departments. This cooperation was assisted also by the formation of a new independent section dealing exclusively with the issue of human and minority rights. 4.4 Sphere of Migration and the Refugee Problem From the very start of its independent existence, the Slovak Republic has been paying great attention to the migration issue, which has come to the foreground recently throughout Europe. This arises from the geographic location of the Slovak Republic as a country of transit. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic participated in the implementation of many projects in this area, in cooperation with other Slovak Government ministries. In November 1993 the Slovak Government approved the "Principles of Migration Policy of the Slovak Republic," which are binding also for the newly established Migration Office operating under the Slovak Ministry of Interior. A total of 2,483 persons, most of them from ex-Yugoslavia, are currently in the care of this office. In 1993 247 ethnic Slovaks from the Chernobyl area were resettled to Slovakia. The Slovak Republic obtained the status of observer in the International Organization for Migration (IOM), retroactively from 1 January 1993. The Slovak side has demonstrated its interest in involvement in the project of monitoring migration in Central and Eastern Europe (MIU) [expansion unknown]. In October 1993 the Migration Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic organized a visit by an IOM mission to the Slovak Republic. Working negotiations aimed at evaluating the migration situation on the territory of the Slovak Republic were held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic and at the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic and an agreement on specific cooperation within the framework of the Migration Information Program and in the area of training and educational programs and seminars was reached. The Slovak Republic expressed its interest in becoming an IOM member state. The draft of an agreement on cooperation between the IOM and the Slovak Government was presented to the Slovak side, which comprises the agreed areas of cooperation and assistance to the Slovak Republic, as well as the opening of an IOM branch in the Slovak Republic. Within the framework of activities carried out in the Council of Europe with regard to migration, the Slovak Republic participated in several meetings of working groups set up on the basis of the so-called Vienna process, which is at present the only discussion forum for countries most severely affected by the migration problem in the East-West context. Cooperation with the leadership of the CDMG -- the Council of Europe's European Committee for Migration -- also started to successfully develop in 1993. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic participates in the implementation of many projects, in cooperation with other Slovak Government departments. A delegation of the Slovak Republic also took part in a meeting of CAHAR -- the ad hoc committee of experts on the legal aspects of territorial asylum, refugees, and stateless persons. Within the framework of activity of the Central European Initiative, a meeting of the Central European Initiative Working Group for Migration took place in June 1993, in which the Slovak Republic participated. The activity of Slovak humanitarian and charity organizations (Slovak Red Cross, SHR [Slovak Humanitarian Council], Slovak Catholic Charity) in the period under review can be assessed as highly positive. Most shipments were sent to the republics of former Yugoslavia, Romania, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The Slovak Republic also arranged the recreational stay of children from Chernobyl on its territory. With regard to the refugee problem, the Slovak Republic secured its succession to international contractual documents pertaining to the status of refugees (Geneva Convention of 1951 and New York Protocol of 1967). Right at the beginning of the year 1993 the Slovak Republic established close contacts with the Geneva headquarters of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a result of which was the opening of an UNHCR branch in Bratislava in April 1993. The founding of this branch helped to deal with the problems of refugees on the territory of the Slovak Republic, especially by organizing training courses and seminars based on international experience in this area, including a solution to the problem of the refugees' legal protection. The UNHCR has presented to the Slovak Republic the draft of an agreement on cooperation between the UNHCR and the Government of the Slovak Republic, which will be assessed at a government meeting. The most important activity with regard to the refugee problem was the Slovak Republic's participation in the 44th session of the UNHCR Executive Committee Program in Geneva (October 1993). Within the framework of this session, a working meeting took place with Mr. J. Horekens, the new director of the UNHCR European Office and an agreement was reached on cooperation in drafting projects of assistance to the Slovak Republic and in accessing the UNHCR data bases. The offer was also extended to us to receive Slovak trainees in the UNHCR headquarters. At this session the Slovak Republic acquired the status of observer, which will allow it to participate in meetings of subcommittees and in other informal sessions of the UNHCR Executive Committee. Overall, it is possible to state that the Slovak Republic's cooperation with international organizations dealing with the migration and refugee issues brought satisfactory results in 1993 and has achieved a high standard. 5. Presentation of the Slovak Republic Abroad Even though the situation with regard to the presentation of the Slovak Republic abroad improved in 1993, it needs to be said that a relatively low level of information on the Slovak Republic persists among foreign professional, political, and economic circles as well as among media workers and the general public. The interest of foreign mass media, political representatives, and experts is focused predominantly on expediently [ucelove] selected ranges of issues -- the situation regarding the protection of ethnic minority rights, freedom of the press, the problem of conversion of arms production, the status of the Romany ethnic community, and the like. The main orientation in the activity of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was therefore focused on preventive measures. The point of gravity of efforts lay in the compilation and distribution of basic information about Slovakia. A number of documents and books were issued (History of Slovakia and Slovaks) in the course of the year, or their re-issue is being prepared (Slovakia's Five Shapes, and others). Among the major publishing feats, it is necessary to mention the representative encyclopedia "Slovakia in the World -- World in Slovakia," being prepared for the first anniversary of the founding of the Slovak Republic. Some justified reservations notwithstanding, the start of the publication of the English-language monthly SLOVAKIA can be considered a positive step. In 1993 we launched cooperation with the Babylon agency aimed at publishing a quarterly in Arabic, called SLOVAKIA TODAY. In cooperation with the Slovak Government Office and other state administration bodies, foremost attention was devoted to the sphere of trade and economic cooperation. Emphasis was laid on our interest, and the Slovak Government's systematic activity, in establishing conditions for the influx of foreign capital and investments. From the territorial viewpoint, the activities centered primarily on the neighboring countries, chiefly Hungary and Austria. Despite maximum efforts, with regard to the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric power project we did not succeed in eliminating to the full extent the consequences of the Hungarian mass media activities directed against the Slovak Republic. The activities of the Slovak side were confined almost exclusively to standard methods (news conferences, publications, and the like) and very little or no use was made of offensive forms of mass media activities (appropriate cooperation with selected mass media prior to the adoption, or publication, of the Slovak side's relevant decisions). In spite of an endeavor to do so, we did not succeed to the full extent in securing the publication of ad hoc materials on key foreign policy steps and activities of the Slovak Republic and on important domestic political events (such as statements by constitutional officials of the Slovak Republic). An important role was played in 1993 by cooperation with foreign companies involved in shaping and influencing public opinion, particularly in the United States and the most important countries of Western Europe. Experience with the firm MWW/SC [expansion unknown] confirmed that it is essential to thoroughly prepare agreements on cooperation and to set aside a sufficient number of staffers assigned these public relations tasks. In view of the financial costs, it was not possible to make use of the aforementioned form of activity in the period under review. This type of cooperation clearly requires a coordinated course of action at the highest level and an adequate pooling of resources of all interested government departments. 6. Building the Diplomatic Service As of 31 November 1993, 415 employees worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bratislava, 189 of them in diplomatic posts and 226 as desk officers in administrative and technical jobs. In the course of 1993, 120 university graduates and 87 people with secondary and basic education took up work with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Slovak Republic maintains abroad 54 embassies, 6 standing missions, and 3 general consulates, at which operate 219 diplomatic staffers (60 of which, those working at trade and economic sections, are under the methodological guidance of the Ministry of Economy, 1, working at the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, under the methodological guidance of the Ministry of Agriculture, and 1, working at the standing mission at Brussels, under the methodological guidance of the Ministry of Finance) and 200 administrative and technical staff. In the course of 1993, 42 diplomats and 53 administrative and technical staffers were dispatched into foreign service. A total of 10 diplomats and 2 administrative and technical staffers are currently undergoing preparation prior to being sent abroad. A total of 26 diplomats operate in the rank of ambassador; another three diplomats have been approved as ambassadors by the government and the president of the Slovak Republic and are ready to depart for their post; two have been approved as ambassadors by the Government of the Slovak Republic and their nomination has been submitted to the president of the Slovak Republic for approval; and four proposals for ambassadorial appointments have been submitted to the Government of the Slovak Republic for approval. Building the diplomatic service of the Slovak Republic in 1994 made it necessary not only to supplement the apparatus of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with new personnel, but also to adapt its organizational structures and to draw up internal guidelines for the activity of both the Bratislava headquarters and representative missions abroad. Attention was also devoted to the problems of information flow, communications, and other technical and organizational problems of building the Slovak Republic's diplomatic service. Emphasis was placed, in particular, on the establishment of a basic technical platform for the Foreign Affairs Ministry's information system, on the drafting of a concept for the development of the telecommunications network, and on an effective substitution and completion of communications devices, including means of special communications. The set tasks have been fulfilled without any serious shortcomings, in defiance of complicated conditions caused, in particular, by the state of the installations inherited from the division [of federal property].
