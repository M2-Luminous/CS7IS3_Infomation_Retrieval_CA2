This was stated at a news conference today by the acting finance minister. Sergey Dubinin noted that deputies' criticisms will be taken into account in the finalization of the budget. Therefore, he did not rule out the possibility of a future reduction in the state's administrative apparatus in favor of increased expenditures on science. Dubinin said that the government will endeavor to submit the 1995 budget to parliament as early as September. Moreover, it will be drawn up while taking into account a reform of taxation policy. The supervision of all the accounts of enterprises, including their hard currency, will be more strict. Dwelling on privatization, Dubinin said that it has not brought the budget any real revenue, since the ideology behind it was based from the outset on a free handout of state property. Forecasting the level of inflation, Dubinin noted that it would be under 10 percent. By the end of the year, a level of between 5 and 7 percent is quite realistic. In his view, the exchange rate for the dollar will not rise above 3,000 rubles.
