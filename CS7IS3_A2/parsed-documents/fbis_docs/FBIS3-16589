Bakyt Abdrisayev told INTERFAX on Wednesday that Kyrgyzstan was giving the matter careful consideration, since the Central Asian republic had commitments under CIS collective security agreements. Kyrgyz Defense Ministry spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Akzhal Isayev told Interfax the same day that the ministry was still unfamiliar with NATO's program and therefore had no position on it.
