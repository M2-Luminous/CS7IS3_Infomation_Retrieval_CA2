As the most likely candidate for foreign minister, he set out for L'INDIPENDENTE the broad outlines of Italy's future foreign policy, Second Republic style. Silvio Berlusconi has made up his mind: If the National Alliance also is present in the country's government, it must be clearly understood that Italy's image abroad will be sharply defined: His choice of Martino is intended to show that the "Italian revolution" must not be misunderstood. It is liberal, democratic, and western. This implies an open alliance with the United States, friendship with Israel, Italy's release from its role as "the Cinderella of Europe," antiprotectionism in economics, and human rights in philosophy. Here is Martino's thinking, as he prepares to leave for the United States, on the very eve of Clinton's visit (June) and the G-7 summit in Naples (July) and as battles rage in Rome for the Interior and other ministries. [Negri] One-third Beirut, one-third Finland, and one-third Vatican: Is half a century of foreign policy as defined by Andreotti finished? [Martino] Yes, times have changed. Both since when my father laid the first foundations of the European Union and since the fall of the Berlin Wall. [Negri] But you are an economist. Why the Foreign Ministry? [Martino] I could say that it is a very important economic ministry, that at the international level economics is of supreme importance. But I want to be clearer than that. There is some truth in the words "new international order" -- woe betide us if we permit an explosion of protectionism and national egoism. Economic war between great giants such as NAFTA, the European Union, and the Far East would be fatal. We are independent, the challenges are posed at the global level, and regression and isolation must be strongly discouraged. [Negri] Leaving philosophy aside, what will you tell Clinton? [Martino] I know the United States well. It will be a good relationship, irrespective of what color the administration is. Also the time is past when visits were mere photo opportunities, emblematic of a foreign policy which had sunk into decline. [Negri] You are stubbornly nonconfessional. What is the future of Italian-Vatican relations? [Martino] Precisely because I am nonconfessional, I do not have to prove myself. We will have even better, and clearer, relations with the Vatican. [Negri] Is it true that you are pro-Israeli? [Martino] The utmost encouragement must be given to the peace process in the Middle East. This is why friendship with all the sides involved is necessary. [Negri] I understand diplomatic language, but Andreotti was pro-Arab. [Martino] The problem is how to gain peace through negotiation. With this objective, we will never adopt a preconceived alignment with either side. [Negri] At the Foreign Ministry you will inherit the image of an Italy relegated to the second league, at least in Europe. [Martino] More important than image is identity -- that is, conduct consistent with our Europeanist conviction and with the pledges demanded. We say that we must set our own house in order. There must be an end to slovenliness and the failure to honor deadlines. Then we will enjoy greater credibility in what we have to say. [Negri] Let us move onto the current situation. The main priority is the former Yugoslavia. [Martino] We will be in the forefront of defending human rights. But it is irresponsible to set the cart before the horse: I will simply say that this is the first point on which I am concentrating. [Negri] Elections are taking place in South Africa. [Martino] Let us hope that the elections take place peacefully. But we must be aware that in that kind of situation there are often internal conflicts, such as the present ones between the ANC and Buthelezi's Inkatha movement, which are even fiercer than the conflict between blacks and whites. [Negri] What about China, of which Andreotti and De Michelis were so fond? [Martino] There is a gigantic experiment in the liberalization of the economy, for the present without a transition to democracy. But can economic development spread while leaving a centralized government unchanged? [Negri] There has been corruption within the context of international cooperation. Will there be changes in the Foreign Ministry? [Martino] If cooperation is what it has been hitherto, that is, transfers between governments, then I am against that. You cannot benefit a country by sending money to authoritarian, corrupt, and dictatorial bureaucracies. The direct transfer of aid and know-how to the people and involvement by private concerns are another matter. [Negri] But without development in the Third and Fourth Worlds, there will be a growth in the already enormous emigration toward the wealthy countries. [Martino] We must not make mistaken assumptions. We are well aware of what prevents development (protectionism, restrictions, and inefficient public action), but we know much less about what makes it possible from area to area. There are no magic wands that can be waved. As for emigration, ours are a people who have exported workers to the four corners of the world; in fact in South America there is virtually another Italy to be kept in mind. So we must be more open with those who come here to work, and stricter with those who mistakenly believe they can find an illusory El Dorado here. [Negri] In conclusion, why did Berlusconi choose you for the Foreign Ministry? [Martino] Without embarrassment, I believe that he respects me and realizes how necessary it is to strengthen our foreign policy.
