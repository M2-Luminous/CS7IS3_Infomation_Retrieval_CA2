The affair with the energetic Mr. Rucs, who in moving naivete, with the assistance of the municipal police, latched onto the withdrawal of the Russian army, which could have become the final toll for the Latvia's independence, but which in its essence is only evident in the consequences of the poverty of the state security system. "We have a lot of spying, and enough information, but analysis and systematization are limping along, and therefore it is not clear what each security service may and may not do," is the way one Saeima deputy characterized the situation. Right now Latvia has been taken over by a spy mania and not without cause. A broad spectrum of security organizations have been established, which actively participate in intelligence. We can divide them into three large, "strongest" groups, of which only one would include state institutions. First of all, espionage is a criminal method for gathering information and includes with it qualitative analytical and systematization work. Secondly, growing and powerful businesses are particularly concerned for their security, for any firm often feels threatened by both organized crime and by the power of the state. That has caused the establishment of their own private security systems, whose job quality is sufficiently high. Many KGB information gathering specialists have gone to firms engaged in such activities. Professionals from the former KGB have their own agency, their own information gathering channels, possibly even connections with the former Soviet, now the Russian intelligence service residence in Latvia, with their "end" in Moscow. The outflow of professionals encourages an overload of work, incomparably low salaries and uncertainty for the future. Businesses can pay adequately for this work, which requires a near-exhausting intellectual and physical regimen. At the same time, large sums of money are being offered to those who are potentially dangerous to state security agencies. From various sources it is known that for leaving one's job (that is, resigning one's current position) sums are being offered equal to five times one's annual salary; and this is only the beginning offer, which can be haggled over. Business can afford (similar to the "informals") to give tremendous technical assurances, which the lean state budget purse is unable to provide for its security organizations. Right now many prominent persons, who require the most exhaustive information, obtain it from these unofficial sources. The More Agencies, the More Security Is Needed Responsible officials continue to receive operational reports from the seven security organizations, but it is not normally possible to analyze these "seven volumes." The many agencies that were established actually reflect the mutual distrust among the various political currents which are more or less fancied by one or another security institution. This mutual distrust has created two intelligence organizations, the Security Agency and the State Economic Sovereignty Department (VESAD), functioning in parallel. The former has been incriminated as the "pocket agency" of the President (or sometimes even of the "national radicals"), but the latter is dogged by a reputation as a "den of Chekhists," which is illustrated by the seemingly professional picketers at the Interior Ministry entrances. While VESAD, according to many, is professionally more powerful, the Security Agency has always claimed to have a reputation for political reliability. It is not known whether one or the other conclusion is closer to reality, but this kind of parallelism causes dangerous instability which can be exploited by powers which are hostile to Latvia's independence. The new espionage rules anticipate the establishment of four security organizations, which will have espionage powers: the Constitutional Defense bureau, the Interior Ministry's Security Police, the Defense Ministry's Intelligence Service, and the Home Guard Headquarter's Information Service. I will not dwell particularly on the last two. The Home Guard's Information Service's functions are specific and completely narrow: tactical intelligence in time of operational activities and control over their personnel selection and activities (former or current connections with the Mafia, convictions and examination of other facts). It must be said that in this sense Latvia is a completely exotic land, for analogous intelligence agencies in volunteer people's militias, which the Home Guard actually is, are a completely unique occurence in the world. The Defense Ministry's Intelligence Service is an institution of the Defense Ministry which carries out military intelligence. This service, too, has a unique sphere of work, in which, it seems, there could be no overt competition, even if the paths of the security organizations crossed. Relations between the Constitutional Defense Bureau and the Interior Ministry's Security Police hold the promise of interesting developments. Both of these services are the only ones of the four with investigative authority; thus they distinguish themselves from the others (a unifying moment--all four have operational work functions). VESAD Professionals Are Offended The State Economic Sovereignty Defense Department (VESAD), which currently is subordinated to the Interior Ministry, is the base on which the Security Police will be built, and this base already has a certain basis, different from the Constitutional Defense Bureau (SAB), which we will be forced to prop up in a naked place. Establishment of the SAB (which is hoped to become an agency subordinated to the National Security Council), is, of course, a wholly painful fact to VESAD. That is connected to the particular authority of SAB, because this agency will be the one which is offered the authority to control all the others and to implement intelligence activities internally. In addition, SAB officials authorized by the bureau director will have special rights to familiarize themselves fully with the internal documents of the intelligence service (regardless of level of classification), but the director himself will be permitted to examine the identities of information sources of other services, or, speaking simply, to learn the true name of an agent. This sort of authority "sends a shiver down the spine" of those who have attended the KGB school. To someone who has been raised in a holy relationship toward protection of information, the fact that someone will be able to rummage around in their safe causes fear. Here everyone decides for themselves between a liberal and totalitarian direction, stopping at their own individual point between two poles. Latvia has no historical analogy to follow in these events. After the 1934 coup, when the power of the President was made absolute, the Political Administration (or political police), which was found in the Interior Ministry, was the only security agency and which was reviewed and controlled only by the President himself. In the Soviet era the KGB operated successfully, which was a state within a state and with outstanding information collection methods and unlimited authority gave rise to professional arrogance and a sense of power among those who worked there. The Security Police may perceive the SAB (which does still exist per Cabinet of Ministers decree no. 28) as a potentially dangerous service, for it will be a service which they will not be able to examine, thus it is logical that professionals will not trust them, for among them there is no characteristic viewpoint that selling out to Western intelligence agencies is less reprehensible than a link with the KGB. Actually, this antipathy could be labeled with the inspired phrase that is your problem, if only talk were not of the more thorough dissemination of information to "their own" people in the government or Saeima. SAB: The Great Unknown The proposed rules governing intelligence submitted by the Interior Ministry were coordinated by the Interior Ministry's parliamentary secretary Linards Mucins. His view is that SAB subordination makes for unreliability. SAB, the "umbrella organization" for the intelligence community, will be subordinated to the National Security Council (the President, Prime Minister, National Security Commission leader, etc.), not to the Cabinet of Ministers, which as the executive branch would always be forced to function only within the constraints of law, thereby not permitting the SAB "to break out" in terms of its authority, in the sahdow of a rather unclear organization (there is still no law on the National Security Council). "The time of liberalization is over," says Mr. Mucins. "The time has come to honor laws." "It seems to me that the idea of preventing the SAB from listing one way or the other has been successfully accomplished," says Andrejs Pantalejevs, Saeima National Security Commission chairman. "In the beginning there was an attempt led by Vectirans to convert the Security Agency to the Constitutional Protection Bureau. There were other tendencies. We of course thought that that would degrade the essence of the SAB. Right now, it seems, we have succeeded in maintaining the concept of a new organization, in whose service there will not be anyone from among the current security organization workers. That is my viewpoint." The painful question about the SAB shows only the tendency toward distrust between the executive and legislative branches, between the government and the Saeima. The chief ones, it seems, are mutual fears of the opposing sides gaining overly great authority and potential. President or Prime Minister? If the SAB cadres will really come from the current Security Agency, then in conditions of antagonism a [link/union] between the SAB and the Security Police will be completely problematic. That is why the aforementioned viewpoint about "fresh" cadres may be a step toward resolution. To repeat this viewpoint in greater detail (how realistic it is can be decided by the experts): Professionalism should not be turned into a fetish; unhurriedly, slowly, this service can be established one person at a time, accentuting the analytical, tidying functions, keeping the internal intelligence of other services in the second plan. Regardless, it will be interesting and meaningful to see who is nominated to be the bureau's director and what will be his political sympathies. The SAB is the child of the era of distrust. It could just as well be called the child of the era of consolidation, some might argue. Time will tell who will win; distrust or consolidation. I completely acknowledge that this article will not satisfy any of the sides that are working with development of intelligence rules, but neutrality is like innocence: it can be lost only once. Let that be my wish to the still unborn child: the SAB.
