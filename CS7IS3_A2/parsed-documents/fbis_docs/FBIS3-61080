The most diverse political forces both at the helm of the country and struggling for it are having their say on what this policy should constitute. In the aftermath of programs pertaining to the long-suffering domestic policy, concepts of the modernization of foreign policy activity have appeared, as a rule. Current Foreign Policy Concepts The first attempt to formulate a foreign policy concept for the new Russia was made shortly after the disintegration of the USSR and the declaration of the sovereignty of the Russian Federation. The speech of President of Russia Boris Yeltsin at a special session of the UN Security Council on 31 January 1992, as also Boris Yeltsin's special message to Butrus-Ghali, secretary general of the United Nations, contained not only an exposition of the main directions of Russian policy in the sphere of arms reduction and disarmament but also ideas pertaining to Russia's role in maintaining and strengthening international peace and security, within the confines of the former USSR included. The speeches of the Russian president at the UN Security Council and two weeks later in the parliament of Russia prompted, it seems to me, other leaders of the country also to speak out on foreign policy topics. I am talking primarily about Ruslan Khasbulatov, former chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Russia. At the end of February 1992 even he spoke at the Moscow State International Relations Institute at the "Transformed Russia in a New World" workshop. Although much of what the speaker of parliament had to say either concurred with or reiterated what had been maintained by other leading figures of the country, his speech contained particular points also. They consist primarily of an accentuation of the directions of Russia's foreign policy which were in the past traditional for the diplomacy of the USSR. These are the direction of Central and Southeast Europe or the countries that were formerly a part of CEMA and the Warsaw Pact and also the direction of the Arab East, Asia, and Africa. In all other respects the foreign policy concept proposed by Ruslan Khasbulatov was highly consonant with the Foreign Ministry concept. For both proceeded from the foreign policy of Russia's renunciation of ideologized bipolarity, that is, the customary division of the world into two opposite systems, of predominant reliance on military power as a means of foreign policy, and also of the a priori perception of any initiative of ours as epoch-making. In March 1992 in the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, as also the Foreign Ministry, politicians saw as a central task of foreign policy furtherance of the "formation in Russia of an efficient, dynamically developing economy" and also "help to national industry and national enterprise as a whole in reaching foreign markets" (see ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA of 6 March 1992). In Khasbulatov's opinion, this aspect was traditionally a weak point in the foreign policy of the USSR inasmuch as it did not outline precisely a system of foreign policy priorities. "Priority in our relations with the outside world," the Russian speaker said, "should be given to states, the development of relations with which enables us to optimally create, in accordance with long-term social and state interests, real state power." A comparison of this proposition with that which is championed in the present Government of Russia and the Foreign Ministry shows that there is no fundamental difference between the first and the second. No one has questioned the importance of relations with the United States, the European Community countries, Japan, China, India, Turkey, and a whole number of other states. But granted all the importance of this direction of foreign policy, the former speaker said, it should not "screen from us relations with states on the territory of the former USSR and the states of Central and Southeast Europe." Geopolitical considerations and economic interests demand also close ties to the Arab East, Asia, and Africa. Under the conditions of the radical lowering of the thresholds of the USSR-United States military confrontation, relations with the members of the CIS and also with the countries bordering the CIS are becoming preferable and more of a priority. This approach coincides to a certain extent with the approach of Andrey Kozyrev and his arguments concerning horizontal directions of Russia's foreign policy. The above-mentioned and other directions of the foreign policy of the new Russia were reflected in the document "Basic Propositions of the Concept of Foreign Policy of the Russian Federation" approved by order of the president of the country in the last 10 days of April 1993. A group of highly qualified experts from the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, the Defense Ministry, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Russian Federation Security Council staff, and two committees of the Supreme Soviet--International Affairs and Foreign Economic Relations and also Defense and Security--took part in the preparation of this document. This work was led by Yuriy Skokov. The document went through the entire procedure of confirmation within the framework of the new mechanism of the preparation and adoption of foreign policy decisions. It was approved by the Interdepartmental Foreign Policy Commission and confirmed at a meeting of the Security Council of the Russian Federation. For this reason, obviously, of all those that have been made public it is the most developed and full. The concept set forth in the document is oriented, as V. Chernov, deputy chief of the Office of Strategic Security of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, maintained, not toward ideological precepts or the predilections of this force or the other in Russian society but toward the "vitally important interests of the country and its citizens." These interests include "support for the processes of formation of the statehood of the Russian Federation and defense of its territorial integrity; creation of the conditions ensuring the stability and irreversibility of political and economic reforms; Russia's active and full participation in the building of a new system of international relations, in which it is ensured a worthy place." I shall not further trouble the reader with a paraphrase of the content of Chernov's article, especially since it was published in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of 29 April of this year. In my view, neither the concept of the Security Council of the Russian Federation nor the others dealt with above take account to a sufficient extent of the salient features of Russia and its people, which jeopardizes its effective realization. It is this and also the fact that questions of foreign policy are essentially being skirted by the election blocs that prompted me to share my thoughts on the relationship between the particular features of Russia and the character of its people and the country's foreign policy. The success of our foreign policy actions will depend on the strength of this relationship to a considerable extent, it seems to me. And the other way about: A disregard for and insufficient consideration of the particular features of the country would ultimately bring about negative consequences. This is true, in my view, in regard to both the domestic and foreign policy of any country. Salient Features of Russia and Its People as Factors of Influence on Foreign Policy There are a good many factors of influence on Russia's foreign policy. Both internal and external. Among the internal, in my view, pertain not only the political and economic systems, the break with and change of which are occurring so dramatically in Russia at this time, but also the particular features of the country and the character of the people. It is on the latter that I would like to dwell in more detail, accentuating attention merely on what most influences the foreign policy sphere. I would point among the salient features primarily to Russia's unique geopolitical and geocultural position. It is truly unique from various viewpoints. Particularly from the viewpoint of the link of Europe and Asia. Merely by virtue of this fact Russia could successfully perform the role of connecting link or linking bridge between the developed West and the rapidly developing (already no less developed than the Western countries in some respects) East. An insufficiently developed Russia is preventing this bridge being dependable and firm, which is currently extraordinarily important for both the West and the East. Besides the fact that Russia lags behind the foremost countries economically, it represents for the countries on both sides of the bridge, as a nuclear power with an unstable political situation, a great danger. Even greater, perhaps, than, formerly, the USSR. These two main factors, that is, the economic and military factors, are prompting both West and East to pull Russia into their orbit. Not in the distant future but today. For the sooner this happens, the more quickly these countries' economies will gain not only additional oxygen but, essentially, their second wind. Not to mention the fact that this would sharply enhance the security of both, with a considerable reduction in spending on military purposes, which also is of considerable importance for the economies of these countries. This has to be seen. Not to derive benefits from this for itself would be an unforgivable mistake for Russia. I would note in this connection that a most important task of Russian diplomacy currently is to facilitate the erection of the bridge between West and East. This on the one hand. On the other, Russia should contribute to a lowering of the level of military confrontation on both sides of the bridge. I would add to what I have said that Russia's position on the world map prompts it also to be an arbiter and mediator in the solution of many problems arising in the Eurasian space. Standing next door to and at the same time detached from this question is that of Russia's relations with the CIS countries. There is not at this time on the Eurasian land mass, it seems to me, a more urgent or more large-scale problem than the establishment of good-neighbor relations within the CIS countries. This task confronts Russia first and foremost. Unless friendly relations take shape among the CIS states, its interests will suffer primarily, then those of Europe, Asia, and the world. It is for this reason that in relations with CIS countries Russia cannot confine itself merely to being a mediator and arbiter but should involve itself in patronage and messianism, although it is extraordinarily difficult to do so in the present situation. But as the experience of the past two years has shown, even in this situation Russia has been attempting to find financial and other resources and forces to perform its preordained role. In 1992 alone Russia's financial assistance to the CIS countries was estimated at $17.6 billion or many hundreds of billions of rubles, not to mention any other assistance. And this given the present virtually catastrophic situation in Russia's economy. The Russian Foreign Ministry, by all accounts, has already understood full well that the preservation of good relations and peace, within the CIS included, is less costly than war. If only Andrey Kozyrev's article published in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of 22 September of this year attests to this. I will adduce just two short, but very expressive quotations from this publication concerning the CIS. The first: "Russia, on account of profound historical, political, cultural, and other relations with neighboring states, could not and did not have the moral right to remain indifferent to their requests for help in securing peace." And the second: "It is time to surmount both our 'internal' slowness and the indecisiveness of the world community in respect to Russia's peacemaking efforts in the space of the former USSR. This is not a 'neoimperial' but, for all that, a unique geopolitical space, the only one of its kind, where 'no one will make peace for Russia.'" The ideas expressed in the Russian minister's article concerning Russia's peacemaking role on the territory of the CIS were developed in his speech at the UN General Assembly session on 27 September of this year in New York (see NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of 30 September 1993). Thus the experience of recent years (recent months particularly) shows that Russia is having one way or another to return to great-power (not imperial but great-power) politics in relations with its immediate neighbors, although not that long ago it was manifestly mistakenly attempting to renounce this. As distinct from the immediate neighboring countries, performance of its messianic role in respect to distant foreign countries would seem to me an extremely difficult business both now and in the immediate future. To what I have said about Russia's patronage and messianism in respect to the republics of the CIS I would add one stage direction. I personally would prefer relations within this Commonwealth of Independent States to be built such as they should be built between sovereign subjects: on the basis of equality and mutual advantage. But there are realities that have taken shape over decades and centuries and there are, finally, particular roles that this country or the other performs, and it is impossible to ignore all this. The problem of the conversion of Russia into a firm bridge between Europe and Asia and the tantalizing prospects which could be afforded the developed countries in the event of the enlistment of the Russian giant in their economic orbit on the one hand, and the danger emanating from the boiling overheated cauldron on the territory of the CIS stuffed with nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction on the other, puts the liberal-democratic world in a very difficult position. It will, willy-nilly, be necessary to help us, accommodate us, agree to compromises.... This world will altogether have to do what it would never do in another situation. But Russia also currently is in a no less easy [as published] (if not more difficult) position than the West. With the natural resources and human potential such as it has it is humiliating and shameful to act the part of suppliant for aid and support. But the main thing is not even this but the fact that it will be necessary to change its distinctiveness and adapt itself to the more developed countries. Russia is resisting this in every possible way and seeking ways to preserve its essence and at the same time to join the civilized world. It is now impossible to say how this struggle will end. It would seem to me that Russia will, for all that, have to change considerably. But it still has a chance to preserve its distinctiveness. As far as the military-defense factor is concerned, it is conditioned by the fact that from century to century Russia has had to keep its powder dry and defend itself against interventionists in all directions. Avid for Russia's land, water, and forest resources, foreigners have forced the country to waste enormous funds, resources, and forces on defense. Whence the military-defense complex in Russians' mentality. Fortunately, it has not killed off in Russians' souls an openness to peace, sincere benevolence, and hospitality. Nonetheless, Russia cannot fail to reckon with this foreign policy complex. It is no accident that a most acute struggle is under way in our society around the question of disarmament, arms reduction, and the sale of weapons on foreign markets. Speaking of the military-defense complex, it cannot be forgotten either that there has in recent decades been a fundamental change in the situation with the appearance of weapons of mass destruction (particularly nuclear). Wars and interventions have become an extraordinarily dangerous business not only for those against whom they are directed but for the aggressors also. We should have spotted this particular feature of the contemporary world order back in the 1950's and have radically restructured our views of the outside world, military doctrine, and so forth. Approximately three decades behind the times, many of us are even now still clinging to the habitual dogmas. Yet the main danger now threatens us from an entirely different direction. The rapid development of the productive forces in the foremost countries and of their foreign economic relations is enabling them to expand by nonmilitary means and to achieve in this way to a certain extent what was previously achieved by war. In a sense this expansion is a boon not only to the expansionists but to those who are being subjected to it also inasmuch as it enables the latter to accustom themselves to progress more rapidly. But it could be a danger for them also if they forget their national and state interests. This should be remembered. By present-day Russia particularly. And we should on the one hand have a modern army guided by the doctrine of defensive sufficiency and, on the other, formulate and implement laws that safeguard security and national interests in all spheres. But in defending state and national interests it should be remembered that, as distinct from previous years, there has been a pronounced growth of the need for defense of the interests of private individuals. Nonetheless, the defense of state interests proper will for a long time to come prevail over other aspects of Russia's foreign policy activity. The said factors are, it may be considered, of a fundamental nature, for they have either a natural origin or such long historical roots that they are imprinted on the nation's genetic code. But there are also other factors which, although lacking such long historical roots, are still quite powerful and influential, as their effect has been manifested in recent decades and persists to some extent. I refer, of course, to the effect of the theory and practice of the Soviet foreign policy doctrine in all its components (a confrontational approach and antagonism with the world of capitalism, proletarian internationalism and unity with the fraternal countries of the socialist community, solidarity with the peoples of the developing states fighting against imperialism, and so forth), which served the system of totalitarian socialism and which still has not yet fully disappeared. It would be naive to think that the former doctrine will disappear from diplomatic and other departments dealing with foreign policy without resistance. Nonetheless, Soviet doctrine was officially abandoned even before the demolition of the USSR, and at that same time the search for a new paradigm began. It persists to this day, and the situation is further complicated by the fact that Russia has yet to determine its position as regards its domestic ideological reference points. Under the conditions of the extreme intellectual ferment and ideological confusion various political forces and individual politicians have been seeking their own answers to the urgent questions of internal and external life. For this reason the subjective and, particularly, personality factor (the capacity of the president or the foreign minister to generate and pursue a foreign policy appropriate to the times, for example) is also performing a big role in the transitional period. Finally, there is one further extraordinarily important factor of influence on the foreign policy of any country, Russia included. These are changes in the international situation and the behavior of partner countries, which frequently dictate a certain line of behavior. To collate briefly what has been said about the factors of influence, it should be mentioned that they consist of six blocks: natural; historically conditioned and subdivided into long-term and relatively short-term; systemic or connected with the change of systems; factors of the transitional period; subjective; and international. The importance and priority of each of the said blocks may be argued, but their influence is obvious. The comprehensive simultaneous effect of these blocks frequently leads to complex specific foreign policy situations and steps.
