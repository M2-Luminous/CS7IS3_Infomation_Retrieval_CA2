FR940902-0-00038 FR940902-0-00010 The final rule is revised to clarify this requirement by removing the confusing language regarding the analysis of the reasonableness of costs and by reflecting the minimum criteria that will be necessary to make the reasonableness analysis. Several commenters thought that the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) that the OJT agreement provide information on the training by skill area or task was too prescriptive. These requirements have been removed in the final rule. In addition, in response to a comment seeking clarification of the meaning of ``types'' of OJT, this language is removed in the final rule to eliminate confusion. The idea behind this language was simply to capture other kinds of training, such as classroom training, that will be provided in the course of the OJT training period. The more specific language in the final rule will capture the same information. Finally, this discussion does not affect the requirements for broker contracts in which there is to be an adequate reflection of the work performed by the broker. Section 627.240(f) of the final rule provides that JTPA participants must be assessed and that OJT must be determined in the ISS to be a suitable training vehicle. This provision is also applicable if the participant is referred to JTPA by an employer. If the participant is determined not to be suitable for OJT or for the OJT slot available from the specific employer, the participant is not eligible for OJT with that employer. A commenter sought clarification of ยง627.240(f)(3) regarding OJT with a participant's previous employer, particularly in connection with ``upgrading''. This paragraph is intended to address a perceived abuse of the OJT activity in which the JTPA program provides OJT assistance to an employer to ``train'' a previous employee who had been laid off or separated when the proposed participant already has the skills required for the job. The training is in the same occupation for virtually or nearly the same work. In view of the limited availability of JTPA funds and services, individuals previously employed by or recently hired by the employer prior to referral to JTPA should not normally be enrolled in JTPA-funded OJT. In order to conduct skill ``upgrading'', which is allowable under section 204(b)(1)(L) of the Act, and retraining, conditions for eligibility and participation must be met and there must be a demonstrable difference between the job and skill requirements of the upgraded job into which the participant is being trained and those of the current or prior job. The prohibition against using OJT for ``upgrading'' with the participant's employer is maintained in the final rule because the Department believes that the JTPA program should not unnecessarily subsidize an employer's normal workforce training expenses. Paragraph (f)(3) is revised to eliminate confusion about whether the rule was intended to address the participant's previous employer or the participant's current employer. The final rule makes it clear that the prohibition applies to both and that it applies only to OJT. Many commenters questioned the specific provisions of ยง627.240(g)(1) of the interim final regulations which require that an OJT ``employer who had two or more previous OJT contracts'' and exhibited a pattern of failing to provide long term employment would be ineligible for other OJT contracts. They pointed out that it is not possible to establish a ``pattern'' with two cases. In response to these comments, the final rule is revised to reflect Congress' intent that employers who fail to offer continued employment, unless there is an acceptable reason, should not receive additional OJT contracts and that the State must issue procedures to implement this requirement. The JTPA program should not be used to underwrite an employer's labor turnover. The Department points out that the provision in the interim final rule specified two contracts because, by definition, to have a pattern there must be more than one. The Department accepts that there may be instances in which a policy may use as few as two contracts, or more than two, to establish a pattern and will accept reasonable interpretations of what constitutes a pattern. The Department chooses not to specify what constitutes a pattern and leaves that decision to the State. In the final rule, ยง627.240(g) is redesignated ยง627.240(h). A number of commenters objected to the provisions in the interim final rule that required on-site monitoring of each OJT contract and on-site monitoring by an OJT brokering contractor before making payments. The Department acknowledges these concerns and revises these monitoring requirements. The final rule removes the prescriptive requirements for monitoring each contract and specifies that recipients and subrecipients are required to conduct periodic on-site monitoring of OJT employers. The requirements pertaining to the areas to be verified through monitoring remain the same. In addition, the monitoring requirements for brokering OJT contractors remain the same since they are requirements of the Act. In response to several comments which argued in favor of providing OJT through employment agencies, the final rule also provides a clarification of the conditions under which employment agencies and employee leasing agencies may be eligible for OJT agreements. The purpose of OJT is to provide training through an employer, not to subsidize wages or reduce agency costs. Thus, the final rule indicates that OJT agreements with employment and employee leasing agencies are to specify the employer that provides the training and the entity to be reimbursed the costs of training. Note that the word ``temporary'' is deleted from the rule since the term ``employment agency'' includes agencies that may arrange employment on less than a full-time basis.
