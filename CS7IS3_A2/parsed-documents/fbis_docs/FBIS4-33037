What will we do with so much money? [Camet] Aside from the money, these meetings are very positive because very high-level experts of the Support Group member countries and organization participate in them. They assess us and voice their concern over Peru. We listen and learn from their suggestions but we also inform them about what we are doing and what is happening in Peru. Last year we obtained $900 million... [EXPRESO] What did you do with that $900 million? [Camet] Some $450 million of it was loans from multilateral enterprises and the CAF [Andean Development Corporation]. This includes $200 million from the World Bank and the IDB [International Development Bank] for the Foncodes [National Compensation and Social Development Fund]. There is $98 million from the IDB for the health sector. Then there is between $50 and $100 million from the PNUD [UN Development Program] and some $400 million in condoned debts. A total $300 million of condoned debts has materialized. Switzerland, for example, condoned $130 million. [EXPRESO] What about this year? [Camet] We are waiting for the World Bank, which arranges the Support Group meetings, to itemize the $1.1 billion. Some $250 million is earmarked for donations and technical assistance. The remaining $850 million are soft and normal loans from multilateral enterprises and countries represented at the meeting. [EXPRESO] Does it include all the loans from the multilateral organizations? [Camet] Not all of them. Only those for the sectors for which we have asked the Support Group for help. Last year we asked for financial aid for Foncodes, for the health and education fields. This year we have asked for assistance to solve the poverty problem and for a very ambitious long-term program to eradicate poverty. The World Bank, for example, has financed the construction of rural neighborhood roads in the poorest zones. That sort of thing. [EXPRESO] As for the letter of intent, we were surprised to see that the government intends to implement additional taxes if it does not attain the 12.1 percent goal. [Camet] Some interpretations are incorrect. There are rumors, for example, that there will be no more stability contracts [contratos de estabilidad] or that they will be eliminated. This is not true. There might be a translation problem. We have agreed that the government will respect the stability contracts. We will not generate new stability contracts with special clauses compared to other stability contracts already approved. Nobody will get more than others, or more than what is established by law. This is the agreement we have reached. We have also agreed to allow enterprises on the border or in jungle areas -- with which we have signed stability contracts -- to cancel them, but by negotiation. If an enterprise in a given zone enjoys certain privileges, then no other enterprise can settle in the same zone and compete. That would not be right. [EXPRESO] Well, what about additional taxes? [Camet] We agreed to a 12.1 percent tax revenue and we want Sunat [National Tax Administration Superintendency] to attain this goal. The entire program is based on the 12.1 percent tax revenue, and it must be attained. [EXPRESO] Do you think the 12.1 percent tax revenue is feasible? [Camet] Of course. Last year we concentrated on curbing inflation. This year we will concentrate on increasing our tax revenue. The money obtained through the privatization program cannot be used because we do not have a primary tax revenue surplus. The Sunat has done a good supervision job within the organization, cross-checking computer data, but now greater supervision outside the institution is necessary. The internal IGV [General Sales Tax] must grow. A few months ago we hired two foreign experts: a Chilean expert supervisor and another expert in pinpointing sectors where the tax evasion is worse. He will determine where we must start work. Internal IGV evasion amounts to 7 percent of the GDP. With these efforts and determination, and with some psychological actions like jailing some people, we will reduce tax evasion by at least one point this year. We will thus be able to use idle money obtained from privatizations without affecting the program. [EXPRESO] We thought the IGV revenue amounted to around 4 percent of the GDP. If it should have amounted to 9 percent (half of the tax), how can evasion amount to 7 percent? [Camet] Yes, but from that 4 percent you must subtract what is collected at the customs (external IGV) and you have the internal IGV. The level of taxes collected by customs is good but they have a ceiling which is established by the importations. It is very close to this ceiling. The internal IGV has great potential but it does not increase enough. [EXPRESO] But 18 percent is very high. [Camet] We are talking about increasing our tax revenue by one point this year. That is all. Late last year -- by forcing taxpayers -- we reached 11.4 percent of the GDP. This means we could reach 12.1 percent. This year we must make a great effort in two critical areas: tax revenue and generating job opportunities. [EXPRESO] What do you mean by generating job opportunities? Are you talking about Foncodes? [Camet] No, not only Foncodes. Foncodes is a temporary and urgent relief at this moment for the extreme poverty problem. It is a matter of generating job opportunities. [EXPRESO] The exchange rate does not seem to be a matter of concern in the letter of intent. [Camet] It is a matter of concern. Experts are exhaustively studying this problem. [EXPRESO] At the Economy Ministry or at the BCR [Central Reserve Bank]? [Camet] Foreign experts are studying the problem at the Economy Ministry. They are also studying the problem at the BCR, of course. Right now there are plenty of dollars and we are investigating, and that is the reason why there are so many dollars because the deposits in the banks have ceased to increase and drug traffickers could not have increased the amount of dollars in the past few months. [EXPRESO] Has the government being using Treasury funds to maintain the exchange rate... [Camet] We have been helping. We purchased dollars to make an early payment on the foreign debt, for example. Somehow or another we have to help the BCR with Treasury funds, cautiously, because the emission capacity is limited. We cannot go issuing a great quantity of money for this purpose. [EXPRESO] Another issue is the monetization or emission level. In March we issued money above the target we had established. It is also true that there is a greater demand for soles, which would justify a somewhat greater emission. [Camet] This is another issue we are assessing: How long can we continue monetizing. The more substantial emission in March (3.5 percent instead of 1.9 percent) was not significant in absolute terms: it only amounted to 40 million soles, which is not very much. That amount will by no means generate inflation. It is true that the demand for soles is increasing. I once told [Foreign Relations Committee member] Manuel Moreyra that dedollarization is a mental process. It will take years for Peruvians to regain confidence in our currency. This is beginning to happen gradually. We have already surpassed inflationary expectations. The greater the demand for soles, the more currency we can issue without causing inflation. [EXPRESO] The letter of intent talks of about 20 percent emission for the entire year. [Camet] That is what we believe. We will see if a little more can be issued without affecting our anti-inflationary goal. The letter of intent is not inflexible. If someone comes up with a survey showing it is technically feasible to issue -- let us say -- 25 percent instead of 20 percent, we can do so. The IMF is an auditor. The letter of intent describes what the government intends to do. We draft the letter and discuss it with the IMF, but we are the ones who draft it.
