He said that -- instead of a central committee of the party -- a War Presidency was appointed at the first war convention of the party held last year. That decision was interpreted in different ways, making it necessary to call another convention. The decision to do this was completely legal and in accordance with the party's statute. The dilemmas about whether the Party Presidency had the right to call this convention had caused a political rift in the party. Adil Zulfikarpasic stated that I betrayed the party, Filipovic stressed, adding: Those who believe that my involvement in the state delegation and my acceptance of the ambassadorial post in Switzerland are acts of betrayal, they are opposed to the independence and integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. After all, Filipovic added, the public is aware that my involvement in the state delegation prevented the signing of the partition of Bosnia. Therefore, to attack such a man means to be committed to a policy opposed to this. The reporters reminded Filipovic that he had stated at the party convention that Zulfikarpasic in no way financed the LBO during the war, and that he had called in April 1992 on the members of the party to overthrow Alija Izetbegovic. The reporters were interested in why those facts were not made public before. Filipovic said that he did not want [words indistinct] Zulfikarpasic to give up on Bosnia, since he was still hoping that the latter would be able to offer some kind of help. Filipovic also said that it was not true that Zulfikarpasic had been trying to obtain weapons for the defense of the country, as he had been telling foreign and some domestic media. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and Government are acquainted with this fact. Finally, in confirmation of Filipovic's statements, Salih Foco, newly elected deputy chairman of the LBO, added that the LBO committees in Tuzla and Zenica had been disbanded because of inconsistencies concerning the implementation of party policy and at the insistence of some members of the regional committees.
