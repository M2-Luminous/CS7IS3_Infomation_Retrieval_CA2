FR940819-0-00089 FR940819-0-00019 In response to AMR Combs, this final rule applies to operations, both scheduled and unscheduled, that require flight attendants. Therefore, operators are not required to meet duty period limitations and rest requirements of this final rule for operations that do not require a flight attendant. Duty Period Following Reduced Rest Sections 121.466(i) and 135.273(i) of the NPRM proposed that an operator be permitted to reduce a 12-hour rest period to 10 hours following a duty period of more than 14 hours. In conjunction with this proposed provision, the FAA also proposed §§121.466(j) and 135.273(j), which would limit the scheduled duty period following a 10-hour reduced rest period to less than 14 hours. ATA, Delta Air Lines, and NACA submitted comments on limiting duty periods following reduced rest. The commenters recommended that the FAA permit an operator to schedule a 16-hour duty period following a reduced rest period of 10 hours. ATA noted that this flexibility is needed for international operations. Delta Air Lines also recommended that the phrase ``14 or more hours'' appearing in proposed §§121.466(j) and 135.273(j) be replaced with ``no more than 14 hours.'' Delta noted that the proposal would limit the duty period following reduced rest to 13 hours 59 minutes. FAA Response Sections 121.467(b)(9) and 135.273(b)(9) of the final rule adopt the provisions as proposed in §§121.466(j) and 135.273(j) of the NPRM, except that the provisions are revised, in response to Delta Airlines' comment, so that an operator may not schedule a flight attendant for a duty period of more than 14 hours following reduced rest. This revision permits an operator to assign a flight attendant to a duty period of up to and including 14 hours following a reduced rest period of 10 hours. The FAA does not agree with those commenters that state that an operator should be allowed to schedule a 16-hour duty period following a reduced rest period of 10 hours. This was not proposed in the notice as it might promote problems of cumulative fatigue. Duty Time That Exceeds Scheduled Duty Time When Beyond the Certificate Holder's Control Sections 121.466(o) and 135.273(o) proposed that a flight attendant would not be considered scheduled for duty in excess of duty time limitations if the flights to which the flight attendant is assigned are scheduled and normally terminate within the limitations but, because of circumstances beyond the control of the domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator (such as adverse weather conditions), are not at the time of departure expected to reach their destination within the scheduled time. ALPA, APA, the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, Southwest Airlines, and TWU Local 556 commented on this provision. ALPA and APA stated that the maximum duty period limit should not be exceeded by more than 2 additional hours regardless of circumstances beyond the control of the operator. The Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions stated that this provision is unacceptable. The Coalition further stated that operators consider all delays outside their control.
