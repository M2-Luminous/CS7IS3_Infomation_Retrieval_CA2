FR940722-1-00058 FR940722-1-00012 Section 23.1431␣Electronic Equipment This proposal would add three new paragraphs to §23.1431. Proposed new paragraph (c) would require that airplanes required to be operated by more than one flightcrew member must be evaluated to determine if the flightcrew members can converse without difficulty when they are seated at their duty stations. If the required evaluation shows that the noise level does not impair conversation, no further action would be required. If the evaluation shows that conversation would be difficult, however, an intercommunication system would be required. The FAA estimates that an evaluation of cockpit noise could be conducted in conjunction with other certification testing, therefore, no incremental costs are associated with the evaluation. An aerospace engineer could design an intercom system in 20 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, for a total of $1,200 per affected certification. The FAA estimates that the addition of an intercom system would cost approximately $500 per airplane. A mechanic could install the system in approximately 20 hours at a burdened rate or $55 per hour. The total incremental production cost for an affected airplane, therefore, would be $1,600 ($500 + 20 hours × $55 per hour)). Proposed new paragraph (d) would require that if the communication equipment that is installed includes any means of switching from the receive mode to the transmit mode, the equipment must use ``off-on'' transmitter switching that turns the transmitter off when it is not being used. The cost of this feature is included in the $500 cost of the intercom, described above. NTSB investigation of at least two commuter accidents determined that excessive cockpit noise levels probably adversely affected the ability of the flight crews to communicate (Bar Harbor Airlines, Flight 1808, August 25, 1985, 8 fatalities; and Henson Airlines, Flight 1517, September 23, 1985, 14 fatalities.) As a result, the Board recommended (A&hyph;86&hyph;113) that the FAA require the installation and use of crew interphone systems in the cockpit of airplanes operating under part 135. The benefit of the proposed requirement would derive from the increased likelihood that flightcrew members would be able to converse without difficulty and that the safety hazard of miscommunication would be reduced. Section 23.1447␣Equipment Standards for Oxygen Dispensing Units Proposed new §23.1447(a)(4) would require that if radio equipment is installed in an airplane, flightcrew oxygen dispensing units must be designed to allow use of the communication equipment when oxygen is being used. Industry sources estimate that an oxygen mask with an integral microphone costs $1,000 more than an oxygen mask without a microphone. The costs per affected airplane, therefore, would be $2,000 for two masks. The benefit of the proposed requirement is that it would allow flightcrew communication under all operating conditions, including operations when oxygen is required. Section 23.1453␣Protection of Oxygen Equipment From Rupture This proposed new section would clarify the rupture protection needed for oxygen system installation. Rupture protection for oxygen systems is currently required by the application of the structures load requirements of part 23. The addition of §23.1453(a) would clarify the application of these load requirements and would identify the need to consider maximum temperatures and pressures that may be present. Section 23.1453(b) would identify the protection to be provided for high pressure oxygen sources and the high pressure lines that connect these sources to the oxygen system shutoff valves. Industry sources estimate that an aerospace engineer could analyze and document the loads on each element of the oxygen system in 16 hours at a burdened rate of $60 per hour, for a total cost of $960. The routing of oxygen pressure sources and lines to protect them from unsafe temperatures and crash landings would be part of an airplane's basic design and would not impose incremental costs. Section 91.209␣Aircraft Lights Proposed new §91.209(b) would require airplanes equipped with an anticollision light system to operate those lights during all operations, including daytime VFR. The incremental cost of this provision would be incurred for light bulb replacement. The FAA estimates that a light bulb for an anticollision light system costs approximately $50 and that this provision would necessitate an incremental bulb replacement every two years. Accordingly, the cost is projected to equal $25 per year, per affected operating airplane. In summary, the FAA holds that the benefits of the proposed rule, though not directly quantifiable, would exceed the expected costs. Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulator Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily or disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if a proposed rule would have a significant economic impact, either detrimental or beneficial, on a substantial number of small entities. FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, establishes threshold cost values and small entity size standards for complying with RFA review requirements in FAA rulemaking actions. The proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Trade Impact Assessment The proposed rule would not constitute a barrier to international trade, including the export of American goods and services to foreign countries and the import of foreign goods and services into the United States. Instead, the proposed systems airworthiness standards would be harmonized with those of foreign aviation authorities and would lessen the restraints on trade. Federalism Implications The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion The FAA proposes to revise the airworthiness standards to provide systems and equipment standards for normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter airplanes that are the same as the standards that will be proposed for the same category airplanes by the Joint Aviation Authorities in Europe. If adopted, the proposed revision would reduce the regulatory burden on the United States and European airplane manufacturers by relieving them on the need to show compliance with different standards each time they seek certification approval of an airplane in a different country. For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Evaluation, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not significant under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is not considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). An initial regulatory evaluation of the proposal has been placed in the docket.
