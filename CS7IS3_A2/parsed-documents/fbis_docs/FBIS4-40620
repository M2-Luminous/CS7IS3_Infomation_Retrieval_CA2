Following the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] and the "12 December" group, at the 17 June plenary session the Communists' faction resorted to this form of protest. The faction's spokesman, G. Selezneyev, said at the start of the session that the reason for the action was the "Pressa" publishing house's decision to halt the publication of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA 16 June because of nonpayments. In the deputy's opinion, the newspaper's debts arose with its temporary closure after the events last October. The representatives of the Communists' faction demanded that members of the government be called to the session to give the relevant explanations. As a result it was decided to instruct Duma Deputy Speaker G. Chilingarov to investigate the matter. The boycott by the Communists' faction and also the generally small number of deputies present at the session led to the point where it proved very difficult to make any decisions. In particular the Duma refused to include on the agenda the question of acting General Prosecutor A. Ilyushenko's appeal on the deprivation of V. Zhirinovskiy's rights as a deputy. In the deputies' opinion, the acting prosecutor, in accordance with the Constitution, does not have the right to send such documents to the Duma. Only the general prosecutor has this right. The day before the Duma council adopted the decision to send a representation to the mandate commission for study. But some deputies, representing mainly the "Russian path" group, saw in this an element of compromise and attacked the Duma council, demanding a vote of no confidence. The proposal from Deputy Loginov to examine the question of protecting MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent Zhilin who, the deputy says, has been threatened with reprisal since the publication of his article "Generals' Business" on abuses in the Western Group of Forces did not get through either. On the other hand, the deputies decided to examine once again how their decisions on the creation of a parliamentary television and radio company are being fulfilled. The rejected motions also included the idea, put forward by LDPR faction speaker V. Marychev, of sending an urgent telegram to summon I. Rybkin, who is on an official visit in Germany, to the session. Yet in the absence of the speaker on 17 June the Duma set a kind of record. Debates around the agenda, which did not lead to any serious changes to it, lasted exactly one hour 40 minutes.
