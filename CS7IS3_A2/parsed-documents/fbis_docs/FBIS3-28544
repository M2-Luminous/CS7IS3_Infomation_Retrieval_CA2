The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 2 a 900-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Chin-sok analyzing the background of the order to prepare for the Team Spirit exercise. The article interprets the order to prepare for the Team Spirit exercise as a realization that "the negotiations on the North Korean nuclear issue have actually ruptured" and explains that the order serves as an ultimatum to North Korea. The article reports "the United States is most concerned about the possibility that North Korea may declare itself a nuclear possessing country because this would automatically exempt North Korea from the obligation to accept nuclear inspections, and as a result, sanctions by the UN Security Council would not be as easy." The article quotes Dr. (Spector) of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: "There is no clue that could prove North Korea is a nonnuclear country." The article forecasts that the U.S. Government will look to "a final settlement at the edge of the cliff" by not announcing the detailed schedule of the Team Spirit exercise for the time being. The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 an 800- word editorial criticizing the use of the Team Spirit exercise as a negotiating card. The editorial asserts that the "purely defensive" Team Spirit exercise is "inevitable" and "natural" under the current defense system of the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces and that it was not appropriate to use the exercise in the negotiations in the first place. The editorial asserts that if the exercise had not been used as a negotiating card so easily, we might not have been blamed for evoking the tension first by resuming the preparations for the joint military exercise after saying it was possible to suspend the exercise. The editorial also points out that there is no guarantee North Korea will abandon nuclear development even if all its conditions are met because in the past North Korea has always added new conditions after concessions have been made. The editorial continues that in dealing with such a sensitive issue, it should be made clear what concessions we are able to make, and the advantages and disadvantages of giving up or insisting on nuclear development. The editorial reports that while continuing dialogue efforts, we should make full preparations for the people's safety and the right of existence and urge the government to show, thorough its security posture, its clear position toward the North Korean nuclear issue. The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 1,000-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chin Chang-uk. The article notes that even though the hard-line moves of the United States -- including U.S. Defense Secretary Perry's remarks regarding the use of sticks after carrots, the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise, deployment of Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters, and disclosure of the five-step operation plan -- may lead to a crisis scenario, analysts of Korean affairs in Washington are optimistic. The article reports that the analysts assert that North Korea will eventually accept all the inspection conditions of the International Atomic Energy Agency and that North Korea is dreaming if it thinks a war is inevitable under its current military preparedness. The article reports that the analysts think North Korea is not at all prepared for a large-scale war based on the fact that "there is a serious food shortage in North Korea, there has been no signs that it has made any efforts to secure more military provisions, and that North Korea has only a two-month energy reserve with its existing energy storage facilities." The article cites another assertion that because North Korea is more afraid of the counterattack by ROK-U.S. Combined Forces, war will not breakout on the Korean peninsula as long as North Korea does not lose its reason. The article concludes with concern by pessimistic analysts about the possibility that the United States might lose its reason after the humiliating results of the negotiations with North Korea.
