KOREA'S CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA) reported that Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam had sent a notice to Warren Christopher, secretary of state of the United States, which is the depository state of the IAEA statute, on the same day as Pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the world's nuclear watchdog body. This move, which is in accordance with the related principle of the IAEA statute, means that the DPRK Government has completed all the legal procedures necessary for the withdrawal, according to KCNA. The statement came on the second day after the IAEA said that the DPRK has failed to formally inform the agency of its decision as well as not presenting a written notice to the United States. The actual state of the withdrawal will be decided by the agency's secretariat after it gives an official reply to the DPRK's written notice to the United States, which should be submitted in advance, said the IAEA. Pyongyang Monday announced its withdrawal and said it will permit no more IAEA inspections for the continuity of nuclear safeguards in the country after the IAEA decided on June 10 to impose sanctions against it. In the notice to Christopher, Kim described the IAEA decision as "another unjust resolution" despite DPRK's "strong opposition and warnings" and said: "The secretariat has pursued the dishonest political purposes of stifling the DPRK under the pretext of its inspections rather than seeking a fair resolution of the nuclear issue."
