The delegation which delivered a special message from President Paul Biya to Abacha Thursday in Abuja, is believed to have discussed current border difference between the two countries with the Nigerian authorities, said the source. Since the beginning of this year when Nigeria sent 500 troops to its border with Cameroon, currently under dispute, the West African nation, has maintained a low profile, bordering on complete silence on the issue. Press reports Friday here quoted the Nigerian defence headquarters as warning journalists against focusing on the issue as such information might likely jeopardise current peace efforts to resolve the conflict. A Lagos-based independent newspaper Thursday reported the deployment of about 1,000 additional Nigerian troops to the affected border area on Wednesday.
