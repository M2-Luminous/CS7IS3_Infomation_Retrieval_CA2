FR940314-1-00036 FR940314-1-00009 The petitioners cite the work of Crawford (1981) and Veni (1992) as evidence that the caves where the karst invertebrates occur are not isolated ``islands'' of special habitat and that the invertebrates likely occur and move throughout the karst in the interstitial spaces. In this interpretation, the petitioners misunderstand the Service's use of the ``island'' analogy in the final rule. The final rule listing the karst invertebrates stated that the caves containing the karst invertebrates ``occur in isolated `islands' '' of the Edwards limestone formation that were separated from one another when stream channels cut through overlying limestone to lower rock layers'' (53 FR 36029). The Service applied the island analogy to the distinct, geologically isolated karst areas (referred to in the Draft Recovery Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993) and hereinafter as ``regions'') within which the caves containing the karst invertebrates have formed, not to the individual cave systems. Veni's work (1992) delineates these karst regions and identifies areas ``having a high probability of suitable habitat for endangered or other endemic invertebrate cave fauna.'' A letter from Veni in response to the petition clarifies that he did not intend that his work be interpreted to mean that there are thousands of acres of habitat suitable for the karst invertebrates (George Veni, Veni and Associates, in litt. , 1993). While the Service believes that the karst invertebrates are likely to use interstitial spaces in the karst, particularly in areas with some surface nutrient input to the karst system, the Service does not believe that this suitable habitat exists uniformly within the larger karst regions (as delineated by Veni (1992) and described by the Service in the final rule as ``islands''). Finally, Crawford (1981) focuses on aquatic karst species. In the aquatic karst ecosystems upon which Crawford based his ideas, continuously flowing water through caves and the interstitium may provide more continuous habitat for aquatic subterranean species and thus provide more opportunity for aquatic invertebrates to inhabit interstitial spaces. Given that the Travis and Williamson County karst invertebrates are exclusively terrestrial and that habitat for terrestrial species is more patchy and distributed according to the occurrence of food, cover, and moisture, Crawford's ideas may not apply to these invertebrates. The petitioners cite the work of Curl (1966), Juberthei and Delay (1981), and Culver (1986) as evidence that most caves have no entrance, that caves are rare even in karst areas, and that caves may be less favorable environments for karst invertebrates than interstitial spaces. They cite these papers as evidence that habitat for terrestrial troglobites (obligate cave-dwelling species) is ubiquitous in karst areas and that the Texas karst invertebrates exist throughout the karst even where there are no caves or openings to the surface. Culver (1986) says that ``the number of caves (defined as cavities large enough for human access) more or less corresponds to the number of habitable patches for terrestrial troglobites.'' Reddell ( in litt. , 1993) and Peck (1976) believe that cave entrances provide an important avenue of nutrient input for cave fauna. Reddell ( in litt. , 1993) also cites several examples in which sub-surface voids having no natural entrance were encountered during construction activities and found not to contain karst invertebrates. Similarly, clay-filled sinkholes with no openings to the surface rarely contain karst invertebrates, whereas caves and sinkholes that are sealed to human access by soil or rock fill or with openings to the surface that allow access by cave crickets or small mammals (and associated nutrients) more often contain karst fauna (Reddell, in litt. , 1993).
