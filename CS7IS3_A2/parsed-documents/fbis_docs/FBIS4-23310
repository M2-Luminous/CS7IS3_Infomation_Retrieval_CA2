It is a (?major robbery). According to the list released today, about 21,000 rounds of ammunition of various caliber, 120 rockets, 475 offensive and defensive grenades, 72 AK-rifles, 47 meters of explosive cord, 256 safety fuses, one box of TNT, one box of dynamite, 19 compasses, five aiming devices for RPG-7's, 13 TNT (?chains), 10 antitank rocket launchers, and 18 rifles, were stolen. The large quantity of stolen weaponry gives rise to a myriad of questions. [passage omitted] One wonders whether the robbers did not benefit from complicity within the school.
