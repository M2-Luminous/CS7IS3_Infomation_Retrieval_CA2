He knows the procedures of protocol and the details regarding a meeting with ambassadors. If there is one thing of which Fernando Naranjo, the incoming foreign minister, is sure, it is that the world has changed and the country needs a foreign minister with qualities of leadership in all areas of foreign policy. "That is my mission," he said flatly. The former executive president of the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (CCSS) and treasury minister has spoken with LA REPUBLICA in his office at the State University for Nontraditional Studies (UNED) in Sabanilla de Montes de Oca. With a characteristic of calm, he began our conversation. He first explained the main reason why the president selected an economist as foreign minister. During the Cold War, he said, diplomacy and politics were the main part of foreign policy, adding "today's world is very different than the past. The future brings us very significant challenges." "In addition to maintaining a firm position in defense of democracy, civil coexistence, and human rights, there is a new trend to follow," he said. "The mission of foreign policy now must better respond to the needs of national development." He announced the Foreign Ministry will become a support agency, coordinating the work in foreign trade and with international financial institutions. According to Naranjo, the exciting thing about his work lies in the fact he will be a part of the new type of international diplomacy. "Organizations and agencies are becoming more flexible. The 1980's were a decade of structural adjustments, with a highly economized perspective. The 1990's leave these structures behind to explore with more global ties," he said. The job will not only be to aid the process of transformation in the financial world but also the changes that will arise from the creation of economic blocs and commercial opening. To restore the diplomatic corps' role of prominence, Naranjo said a team of specialists, whose names he did not disclose, was examining closely the applicants who have been presented so far. A second group of experts is examining the names of businessmen, people involved in cultural activities, education, labor unions, and professional associations who want to occupy the various foreign mission posts abroad. The sole purpose of this assignment is to "send only the best." These efforts are not limited to the area of personnel selection alone. "I am worried our diplomatic installations abroad are poorly equipped," he said. "Many do not have a facsimile machine or a computer, and communications systems are outdated." The second grand mission will be to procure the elements the corps will need to do the job properly. The initial expense for these purchases and the salary improvements that must be made will come from the cuts to be made in the payroll. Each mission will have no more than four members. The ministry will create the post of "shuttle ambassador" for Central Europe and Africa who will visit each country three times a year. Regarding payroll distribution, Naranjo said he will make every effort to ensure if the ambassador is a politician, the second in command will be a specialist in the economic and trade fields. For the Leadership To reach the goals he has set, Naranjo announced the creation of several new institutions. First he will establish the Human Development Agency. This agency, he explains, will coordinate more efficiently the international cooperation Costa Rica receives and will introduce the country as a model to promote regional democracy and human rights. The need for the agency emerged because the cooperation currently received "is very fragmented, as many countries help us in a variety of sectors. We are going to ask them for more cooperation but will attempt to concentrate our efforts to specific geographical areas and to channel the cooperation to the most depressed places," Naranjo said. Furthermore, it will help open a front of cooperation with the remainder of the Central American and Caribbean countries in areas where the country has advantages, such as in the fields of education, health, environmental protection regulations, and telecommunications. "And, of course, in fields where Costa Rica, due to its tradition, can help other nations, such as any situation related to the democratic system," Naranjo said. Concurrently, a documentary center will be established in San Jose to gather updated information on Costa Rica's actions in the international sphere. The Figueres Olsen administration will also establish a diplomatic department to evaluate the work done and to help diplomatic missions carry out their assigned tasks. Without Protocol The foreign minister-designate is not ashamed to say he will be a "sui generis" foreign minister. "Look at the shirt and pants I am wearing now. They are not very elegant," he said and smiled when he protested, because he had not been informed a photographer would be present at the interview. "Surely, [former congressional president] Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto would disown me in these clothes," he said. This Pennsylvania University Ph.D. in economics tells us unabashedly he will not be a formal foreign minister, rather, a functional one who will relate foreign policy to the country's internal needs. He admits, however, this is a new activity for him, because he has never been in the diplomatic world before. "This is not the first time I accept the challenge of working in a field different to my speciality. In 1976 President Daniel Oduber appointed me executive president of the CCSS [Costa Rican Social Security Institute], the country's biggest and most complicated institution, because it renders health services," he said. Naranjo was graduated with honors from the University of Costa Rica and has taught there for 30 years. He said he has traveled extensively and one thing that particularly caught his attention was the fact that countries poorer than Costa Rica have a more professional, better-equipped diplomatic service, and their foreign policy is more defined. His observations caused him to think much could be done to further this sector.
