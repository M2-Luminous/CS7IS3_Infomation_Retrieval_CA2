The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies issued a statement in Geneva saying up to half a million people were believed to be heading for Tanzania. The federation said 300,000 refugees had already arrived in northwestern Tanzania. It described the exodus as the largest single movement of refugees in the federation's 75-year history. The Red Cross said it was sending an emergency aid team from Kenya to Tanzania, adding that massive amounts of relief supplies, including blankets and medicines, were needed urgently. The continuing flood of refugees comes after the UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali appealed for a large military force to be sent to Rwanda to end the tribal carnage.
