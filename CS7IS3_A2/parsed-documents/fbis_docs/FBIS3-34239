If we overlook a known fact -- namely, that the Palestinian-Israeli interim agreement was reached in the absence of that partnership and that the rounds of negotiations between the various Arab negotiating parties and Israel, held in the U.S. capital, have ended in deadlock on all or most of the tracks -- then one is more than justified in questioning the role and effectiveness of the U.S. partnership. The United States' silence in the face of Israeli practices that were and are still being carried out in the occupied Arab territories, including the pursuit of fugitives, settlement activity, and detentions, as well as its silence in the face of the ongoing stalemate in the Palestinian-Israeli talks and Israel's evasion of its commitments and its disregard for the timetable on implementing the agreement under the pretext that the dates are "not sacred," makes an observer feel that the U.S. partnership in the peace process is neither effective nor adequate. The most elementary interpretation of U.S. partnership means adopting the resolutions of international legitimacy and their obvious meaning and calling what is self-evident by its real name. The occupied territories are, in fact, occupied and not disputed, because this term, adopted lately by Washington, creates the impression that those who champion Arab rights are on an equal footing with the Israeli party. During recent rounds of negotiations in Washington, the United States tended to dilute the concepts and terms approved by the international community in describing the situation in the occupied territories. To a large extent, this endangers the provisions of the terms of reference on which the peace process is based. The Palestinians and the Arabs are interested in an active U.S. partnership that will manifest itself in difficult times and lead the Israeli side back to the reality and spirit of the peace concepts as adopted by the international community. Such a partnership will certainly boost the peace process in the long run, because it will contribute to the establishment of a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace acceptable to coming generations, who alone will decide whether to preserve that peace.
