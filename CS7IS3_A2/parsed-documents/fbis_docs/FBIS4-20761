As if someone gave the order to display violent rage on the line of the western Galilee, Nazareth, Wadi 'Ara, Tayybe, Yaffo (!), Ramle (a failed attempt), and, of course: the region of Be'er-Sheva. The known and recognized map of November 1947, and, to tell the absolute truth: it is also derived with not inconsiderable logic from the slogan "two states for two peoples in western Eretz-Yisra'el--if the reference is to complete equality after the completion of Stage 1, within the 1949 borders. "We are an inseparable part of the Muslim people and of the Palestinian people," said the mayor of Um-al-Faham, Ri'ad Salah, in eulogizing the "holy martyr" Abu-Gum'ah, who was killed in the rioting near Be'er-Sheva, and his bed was decorated with a Palestinian flag and the participants in the funeral (like all of the demonstrators in the disturbances throughout Israel) shouted: "With blood and fire we will liberate Palestine, with spirit and blood we will redeem the holy martyr." There is no doubt that the rage and the pain of the Arabs of Israel over the slaughter of the members of their religion and their people in Hebron are authentic and independent of rebellious political motives, but the nature of "the popular uprising," which features demonstrations like this more and more (like several of those that preceded them), indicates in this manner that the event of Hebron was not the reason but the pretext, and that there is a guiding hand and that there are organized cells in the field, that are activating the masses. This is not yet an intifadah in the full sense of the word, only early rehearsals for what those who are staging it know to be careful not to do prematurely--but the time will yet come. The spearhead of the liberation of Palestine is now located, from the political viewpoint and in accordance with reality, in "the West Bank." There is an early and a late stage in "process." But the seed of the Palestinian intifadah in Israel has already sprouted and is poking up from the ground, and who knows how many and which Israelis will yet participate in it, for 'Aziz and Haziz from "My Michael" of 'Amos 'Oz and "The Guardian of the Forests" of A.B. Yehoshu'a were created before the Six-Day War (and Hirbet Hiz'ah of S. Yizhar was born with the War of Independence). And the "new historians" are only recently publishing their researches and Mittelpunkt has only reached Gorodish, and "Second View" of the television has not yet finished with Jerusalem, and the demographers have not even begun yet to warn about the demographic weight that awaits the people of Israel, and "Peace Now" is only beginning to demonstrate for the evacuation now of the settlements. So why should we complain about the organizers of the disturbances in Israel who satisfy themselves with urinating on the 1947 borders and go back to their lairs?
