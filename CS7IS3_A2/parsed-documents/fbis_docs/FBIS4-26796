Wu said that China is keen on developing trade and economic relations with Libya, and recent years had seen a smooth growth of these relations. "We hope to further the relations considering the strong complementary nature of the two economies." Bin-Shatwan said Libyan-Chinese economic and trade relations had developed quickly with great potential since the mixed committee was formed in 1982. He hoped that China would get to know the Libyan market better and get further involved in Libya's economic development.
