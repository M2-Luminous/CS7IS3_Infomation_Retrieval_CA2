He pointed out: When we study theories, we should pay attention to linking them with practice. We must make use of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to conscientiously sum up new experiences in strengthening the building of democratic parties themselves, persisting in and improving multiparty cooperation under the leadership of the CPC, and promoting the political consultative system, so that democratic parties can play their role in a still better way by participating in and discussing government and political affairs in China's political life and democratic supervision. In his speech, Zhang Boxing also said: Now we are living in an age of great transformation, and it is more urgent and necessary for us to study theory. Establishing a socialist market economic system is precisely a great and creative undertaking. It is a strenuous and heavy task. In facing the new situation and new task, there are a lot of things which we are not familiar with or aware of. On the road of progress, we will encounter many complicated things which we never experienced in the past. Only by studying well the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics can we fully grasp the dialectical relations of reform, development and stability, and can we properly handle various kinds of social contradictions to ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening up and modernization. While dwelling on the issue of developing our province's economy and taking the road of common prosperity, Zhang Boxing stressed: The key to narrowing the gaps between our province and the advanced areas and taking the road of common prosperity lies in persisting in developing the productive forces. To develop the productive forces, we must emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, and seize the favorable opportunity. We must work with perseverance and overcome difficulties to resolutely push reform forward. He continued: To narrow the gaps, we must also continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work and self-reliance. In the course of developing the state-owned economy, we must make great efforts to develop our new publicly-owned economy and township and town enterprises and must firmly grasp the nongovernmental economy. Only thus can we constantly enhance our province's economic strength and have sufficient financial, material and manpower resources to support the impoverished areas. Only thus will our people boost their confidence in construction and improve their livelihood. Zhang Boxing also expressed the hope that participating comrades would work in close cooperation, unite as one, and suggest ways and means to promote our province's economy.
