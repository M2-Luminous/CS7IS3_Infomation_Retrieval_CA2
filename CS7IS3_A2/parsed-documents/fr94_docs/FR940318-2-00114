For competing continuation applications, evaluation will also be made of program outcomes and the degree to which stated goals and objectives were achieved. Other Grant Information The CSP is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, as implemented by 45 CFR part 100, which allows States the option of setting up a system for reviewing applications from within their States for assistance under certain Federal programs. The application package for this program will include a list of States with review systems and the single point of contact (SPOC) in each State for the review. Applicants (other than federally-recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact their State SPOCs as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC of each affected State. The due date for State process recommendations is 60 days after the application deadline. The BPHC does not guarantee that it will accommodate or explain its response to State process recommendations received after that date. Grants will be administered in accordance with HHS regulations in 45 CFR part 92. The OMB Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number for this program is 93.931. Dated: January 12, 1994. William A.
