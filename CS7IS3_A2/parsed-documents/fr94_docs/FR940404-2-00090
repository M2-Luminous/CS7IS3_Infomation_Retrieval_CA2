FR940404-2-00090 FR940404-2-00059 Under the provisions of the Consent Order, TCH and GEI are also required to provide to the Commission a report of their compliance with the divestiture provisions of the Order within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and every sixty (60) days thereafter until TCH and GEI have completely divested their interest in assets related to the retail sale of prescription drugs in the relevant geographic areas. The proposed Order will also prohibit TCH and GEI, for a period of ten (10) years, from acquiring, without Federal Trade Commission approval, any stock in any concern engaged in the business of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas. However, if GEI sells Thrifty/PayLess and no longer owns any pharmacy businesses, it will not need to seek the Commission's prior approval of the acquisition of any businesses that have pharmacies in the relevant geographic areas. In addition, GEI may, without prior Commission approval, acquire up to five (5) percent of any companies' stock for investment purposes even if such a company may own pharmacies in the relevant geographic areas. One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, TCH and GEI will be required to provide to the Commission a report of their compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires TCH or GEI to notify the Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to any change in the structure of TCH resulting in the emergence of a successor. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms. Donald S. Clark, Secretary.
