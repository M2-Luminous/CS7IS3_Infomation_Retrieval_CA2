The statement responds to Tuesday's [22 March] statement by the Hungarian Government, saying the Slovak Government bears responsibility for the blockage of the Danube at the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydro-electric power station for unilaterally redirecting part of the Danube along a derivation canal on Slovak territory in November 1992. The Hungarian Government called upon countries supporting free passage on the Danube to urge Slovakia to "stop its illegal activities and revive without delay the conditions for traffic." Ship transport was interrupted due to accidents at the Gabcikovo dam in southern Slovakia on March 21. The Slovak statement says there are no international dimensions of the danger to the power station. By contrast, the one-year operation of at Gabcikovo confirmed that conditions for accelerated ship transport along a 42-kilometers route had improved. The Foreign Ministry says that Slovak authorities would take all necessary steps in order to revive international traffic.
