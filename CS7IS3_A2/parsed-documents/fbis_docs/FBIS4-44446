This is a question which has people very concerned. With the rapid economic growth of 1992 and 1993, the level of prices has steadily risen as well. In 1993, the retail sales price index rose about 13 percent, wile the cost of living index for urban and rural residents rose about 14.5 percent (of which 12 percent were new price inflation factors). The economy is maintaining its rapid growth trend in 1994, and with the average economic growth estimated to be slightly over 10 percent, it will be difficult to hold down inflation. I believe that not only will it be hard to accomplish the goal of keeping inflation within the 10 percent that was set at last year's National Economic Work Conference, we should consider ourselves well off if we can keep the 1994 inflation rate to not much more than the 13 percent of 1993. The price situation in 1994 will be quite serious, and urgently needs close monitoring. There are at least several factors supporting the above estimate. First, with so strong a trend to fixed asset investment, there is not too much release of inflationary pressures. Because there was very widespread 1993's fixed asset investment, with a large increase in projects being built on too wide a scale, the amount of investment required is very large. In addition, each region and department is grasping all opportunities to seed rapid development. They are full of drive to set projects and expanding their construction scale, and this means that fixed asset investment in 1994 will continue to be hot, and this will be hard to control efficiently. This inevitably will sharpen an already tight supply of capital, further expand the scale of borrowing, put in more currency, and accelerate the pace at which currency supply continuously exceeds the economic growth rate. This is a situation usually unfavorable to easing inflationary pressures. The lack of tight controls could also possibly increase them. The inflationary pressures of the last year have not been fully released, or are still in the process of release, with the rate of inflation remaining high and not going down. Therefore, the constant expansion trend of investment in 1994 will make it very hard to control the inflation rate efficiently. Second, the rise in the cost of goods caused by merging the exchange rate for Foreign Exchange Certificates (FEC) with that of the Renminbi (RMB) will be a powerful impetus to inflation. The merger of the FEC with the RMB at the beginning of 1994 caused a tremendous drop in the rate of exchange between the RMB and the FEC which was originally set by the government. It dropped from $1=5.8 yuan RMB to $1=8.7 yuan RMB, and inevitably will cause at least some imported raw materials and consumer products to rise in price, rapidly increase the power of costs to push price increases. The adjustment in State officials' wages began in October, 1993 and the adjustment of enterprise and institutional wages it brought with it will also increase the cost of goods, which will push prices up further. In addition, adjustments in employees' wages will naturally increase consumers' demand for them. This is another inflationary factor which cannot be ignored. Third, reform of the tax system reform will also affect inflation. The tax system reform this time especially implements a comprehensive value added tax. An important measure for pushing China's tax system toward regularization, it fits the requirements of developing the socialist market economy. We can believe that implementing a value added tax won't add to enterprises' general burden. But to conclude from this that it won't push prices up is not very convincing. This is because after the value added tax is implemented, although in general it will not add to the burden on enterprises, different enterprises have differing situations. Most enterprises will not have an added tax burden, and some may even lose some, but a few enterprises (about 28 percent of the state-owned enterprises) really will have an added tax burden. The former category of enterprises will not in general try to shift the burden, so there will not be the phenomenon of prices declining due to their losing some tax burden; the latter category of enterprises will try everything they can to shift the added tax burden, and it is easier to do this in a situation where there is a strong consumption demand. International experience has proven that it is best to choose a relatively stable economic environment for comprehensively implementing a value added tax, for in this situation it will be favorable to attack the causes of inflation. Fourth, the new adjustment and releasing of prices will push them up further. In 1994, the state will raise its grain and cotton purchase prices, and the rising of these two basic agricultural products will inevitably push the whole price level upward. In 1994, the controlled price will be released on 200 million tons of coal allocations, and the price will go up on planned medium price crude oil (about 40 million tons of planned price oil will rise from over 200 yuan per ton to 700 yuan, and in addition, 60 million tons of planned high price oil will rise from 550 yuan per ton to 700 yuan, a price still lower than the international market price). The price of electricity will also go up, grain purchasing and sales price will also open up, etc. These moves will no doubt push price levels up continuously. In addition, in the second half of 1993 the level of general retail sale prices rose obviously higher than in the first half year (up to about 15 percent). Overconfidence is the only factor which can affect 1994 prices rising two to three percentage points, especially as the price index for the cost of living in 35 large and medium size cities rose 2.8 percent in November, 1993 over October, and then rose 3.2 percent in December from November. Therefore, overconfidence is the only factor which can affect 1994's prices rising about 5 percent. Fifth, there are forecasts of inflation and a growing inflationary psychology. Due to the lasting overheated economy and a premature increase in the supply of currency, the pressure caused by inflation will gradually increase, causing these forecasts and the psychology of inflation. This is a factor worth noting. Since these inflation forecasts have been occurring, the slightest sign can send residents into panic purchasing. It is easy for some people to take this opportunity to raise prices, thereby disturbing market and reaping staggering profits. Many places rushed to purchase grain in November and December, 1993, and in some places the rush to purchase imported home electrical appliances and gold jewelry, etc. at the end of 1993 was explained by this. Residents' predictions of inflation and the inflationary psychology will form a fake consumer demand, causing some places sometimes to twist the relationship between supply and demand. For inflation, this is like pouring oil on the fire, so it deserve our attention. The year 1994 will be one of great strides forward in the reform of China's economic system. The birth of five big reforms involving revenue, finance, investment, foreign trade and foreign currency and administration of state-owned assets will cause greater adjustments in the original profit pattern, which can easily cause social shock. In order to let reform go smoothly, reducing the risks, we must create a very stable economic environment for the birth of these five reforms. On this aspect, I think, the state's macroeconomic policy is particularly important. If the state adopts a relatively safe macroeconomic policy, it will strengthen and improve macroeconomic adjustment and control, appropriately suppress the tendency of each place to battle for investments and projects, restrain inflationary trends, and control too-rapid rises in the general price level. It can create a better and relatively light environment for reform, as well as keep the economy stable when there is faster reform. What is worth worrying about is that the state's macroeconomic policy often suffers pressures from some departments, localities and enterprises, which demand release of credit, loans and money. This not only guarantees increases but also relaxes alertness to inflation and higher prices, as well as taking various ways to oppose or resist the state's macroadjustment and control of cutbacks in activities. This situation now exists. Quite a few localities and enterprises, in order to pursue faster profits, ease financial difficulties or employment pressures, attain greater achievements in administration or career, are seeking more investment, higher speed, and not admitting that their own departments, localities and work units are operating at an excessively hot speed. This makes it more difficult for the state to implement a safe and healthy macroeconomic policy, and easily gives the impression that the situation is out of control. Once control of investment is lost, the economy will again get hot or even get hotter than before, sharpening inflation, maintain more that 15 percent in continuous inflation, and break through the median inflation line, which will critically destroy economic stability. At that time, it will be hard to achieve a soft economic landing by means of small adjustments; rather, we will need to carry out a hard landing by means of big adjustments, and losses will be bigger. The development of inflation and price increases will to a great degree critically affect how smoothly economic reform goes, and make it increasingly risky, as well as being unfavorable to the healthy operation of the socialist market economy. Excessive rises in prices will first of all be unfavorable to further price reforms: many measures to adjust prices and ease them, things which should be done now, will have to be postponed or canceled. This was the situation in both 1986 and 1988; it could also bring back unreasonable price relationships. Second, it inevitably will propel the development of opportunistic activities, disrupting the market and damaging our building and fostering of a market system. Third, it will inevitably widen the income gap, with a few people suddenly getting rich by seizing every opportunity to do so, hoarding, cornering markets, and driving up prices, while others who are on salary or retirees' fixed income will probably find their living standard falling, producing a mood of discontent. Finally, it will also be hard to bring about government macroadjustment and control, industrial policy will be difficult to implement, and this will affect enterprises' normal production and operations. Generally, in order to permit the several major topics of reform function smoothly, in order to have health development of the domestic economy, we must pay close attention to the trend of inflation and rising prices, implement appropriate macroeconomic policy, and restrain inflation. These actions will control rising prices over a wide scale, and keep the economy stable.
