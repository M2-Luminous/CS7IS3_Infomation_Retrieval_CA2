In a very short statement on national television following the visit of Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, President Biya expressed his "desire to seek a final, lasting, and peaceful solution," the television quoted him as saying. "My brother and friend Eyadema and I had similar views on the development and promotion of peace on the continent," Mr. Biya added. President Biya, who was publicly mentioning this conflict for the first time, did not comment on the latest declarations by Nigerian External Relations Minister Babagana Kingibe. The Nigerian minister said yesterday that the situation at the border "could explode if nothing is done quickly to return to dialogue." President Eyadema, who has been asked to mediate in the dispute between the two countries, called on African leaders "to do everything to find an African solution to the conflict," according to national television. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry said today that Cameroon has requested intervention by the OAU in the dispute. Egypt is the current chairman of the OAU. This request will be examined at an emergency meeting of the OAU, which was created in June 1993 for the prevention and settlement of inter-African conflicts. At the end of his discussions with his Cameroonian counterpart, President Eyadema went to Nigeria where he met the head of state, General Sani Abacha, sources close to the Nigerian presidency in Abuja pointed out.
