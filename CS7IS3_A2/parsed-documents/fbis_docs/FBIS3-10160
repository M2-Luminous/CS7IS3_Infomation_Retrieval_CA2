In fact, "an error" by the Ramon J. Velasquez administration led to a miscalculation in the interest payments on the foreign debt. In the 1994 budget, the previous administration estimated a payment of 300 billion bolivares when the figure truly is 370 billion. In addition, Vivas Teran explained that 340 billion bolivares worth of expenses were not included in the budget. President Velasquez approved these funds for universities and for an increase in salaries for public employees. However, the funds basically had no source of income backing them. Consequently, they will be cut by nearly 50 percent. This situation prompted Vivas Teran to say that the fiscal deficit for the public sector ranges between 8 and 10 percent of the GNP instead of 4 percent as the Finance Ministry reported. This means that the fiscal deficit is between 560 and 700 billion bolivares, taking into account that each point of the GNP is equivalent to 70 billion bolivares. The FIV president agrees with Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez who said the fiscal gap will be reduced to 2 percent of the GNP by year's end. However, the sources for financing the budget are limited. Vivas Teran said he is aware that an estimated 70 billion bolivares were included in the 1994 budget as an adjustment in the price of fuel. However, the Caldera government has already rejected this measure. Furthermore, the crisis in the oil market will prevent the country from receiving 200-250 billion bolivares in revenues to the point that the Venezuelan export package is estimated at $11.50 [as published]. In addition, revenues for 70 billion bolivares were estimated through an issuance of Treasury bonds; however, according to general budget regulations, such a measure can only be applied when there are no indirect taxes. Privatization cannot be used as a way to obtain revenues because funds obtained from the sale of state assets in 1994 can only be used in 1995, but not to cover regular expenses. In the face of this, Sosa Rogriguez maintained that the plan named after him will only generate 150 billion bolivares. The government will decide on the feasibility of applying a tax on bank debits within 10 days. It must be stressed that if bank transactions are taxed, the government could collect approximately 70 billion bolivares, which is exactly the amount that was not included in the budget due to a miscalculation in the foreign debt service for 1994. Vivas Teran reiterated that the government will continue to reduce budgeted expenditures by as much as 15 percent. This represents 210 billion bolivares if it is considered that the balance between revenues and expenses for this year amounts to 1.435 trillion bolivares. Nevertheless, Sosa Rodriguez admitted on Wednesday at the Council of Ministers meeting that his ministry was barely able to make 110 billion bolivares in cuts, less than 10 percent of the budgeted expenses. In sum, this is "what we have been able to do after assessing the country's finances. We want the country to know, without euphemisms, the exact dimension of the problems our nation is facing. The central government's deficit is approximately 8 percent of the GNP." This same situation, Vivas Teran noted, is what has led the finance minister to be very cautious and "to take his time because, often, there are many unexpected ways in which a fiscal deficit can increase."
