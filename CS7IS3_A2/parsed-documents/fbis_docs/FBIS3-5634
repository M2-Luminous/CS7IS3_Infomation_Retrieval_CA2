At the end of the contact the head of the North side delegation was interviewed by home and foreign reporters on the spot. According to his briefing, the North side once again urged the South side to manifest its position on the four-point demand including the question of discontinuing large-scale nuclear war exercises that stands in the way of exchange of special envoys, a demand raised by it at the fourth contact. Then it put forward a new amendment to "agreement on the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the South" taking the South side's view into full consideration, out of a desire to realize the exchange of special envoys at an early date. The proposal involves detailed matters such as the rank of the special envoys of both side and their suite, the tasks of special envoys and the mode of their exchange, the date of their exchange and the timetable of their stay, procedures of their travels and security arrangements, news coverage and (?offer) of conveniences to reporters. The South side created difficulties, grumbling about what it called "creation of obstacle" or "unnecessary things" instead of expressing its clear attitude toward the principled demand raised by our side and entering the discussion of working matters. Our side proposed a tete-a-tete contact between the heads of both sides from a sincere stand to tide over the obtaining difficulties on all accounts and concluding the working-level contact. There was a contact between the heads of both sides. It was agreed to have the sixth contact between working delegates in the South portion of Panmunjom on March 12.
