A responsible security source said the ministry issued a statement last Saturday on the arrest of a leading group that had assisted terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam, including Lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, a dangerous terrorist who played a major role in recent terrorist incidents and who was arrested on 3 July 1990. He and others were also charged in Case No. 7 of 1990 in Markaz Isna for attacking citizens and preventing them from visiting cemeteries. The source said that the statement also indicated that Lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani was also charged in Case No. 4116 of 1991, the jurisdiction of Markaz Isna, when he was caught while distributing leaflets inciting extremist thought and instigating acts of violence. The security source said in his statement that the Interior Ministry's statement of last Saturday contained a warning about moves by some self-interested people who try in one way or another to support terrorism by using some confrontations to assume false heroic poses. He added that in its statement the Ministry stressed its intention to confront these elements firmly and decisively should they contemplate any attempts to violate legitimacy and the law under this cover while only aiming to create confusion among the people. The source added that this morning some elements known for their activities in connection with these groups and some members of the dissolved and banned Muslim Brotherhood incited some lawyers and misled members of the Bar Association to assemble at the Bar Association headquarters. There they urged the lawyers to stage a mass demonstration to rouse the public, incite them to violate the law, and subject the public to the danger of infiltration by elements who pursue only sedition and deception. Responsible Interior Ministry security sources said the security forces have emphatically advised these groups repeatedly not to stage any demonstrations from the Bar Association headquarters out of concern for the citizens' lives and security. But, he added, it was evident that there was a purposeful intention by this renegade minority to carry out sedition and incitement. He said this intention was manifested when those who gathered inside the Bar Association building threw bricks and stones down onto the police and passers by and then rushed into the street in a vociferous demonstration chanting hostile slogans. The source added that the security forces deployed in the area intervened immediately to break up the demonstration and arrested 39 of the leaders. It transpired that there were 27 lawyers among them; the rest were not members of the Bar Association. He said that lawyer Mursi Muhammad 'Abd-al-Qadir and (?teacher) Khalid 'Abd-al-Mun'im Ibrahim al-Jiddawi suffered slight injuries for which they were hospitalized but no damage was caused in the area because the security forces took control of the situation. The Interior Ministry responsible security source revealed that the Ministry authorities had received information that some extremist members of the Bar Association had called on their colleagues to carry arms to confront the security forces. He said the Ministry authorities at dawn today compiled a report on this information, numbered 2293-Qasr al-Nil, and sent it to the competent prosecution office. The security source said that the Interior Ministry has been patient with all the incitement incidents since the death of terrorist 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, despite the extremely sensitive security circumstances at this time. He explained that the Ministry did this to show the inevitability of democracy, which has been emphasized by the political leadership; but the attempts by a hireling minority of Bar Association members prompted the security forces to decisively confront this morning's attempts to endanger the Egyptian public's lives and property. The Interior Ministry will issue a comprehensive statement containing updated information and details on the issue at a later time.
