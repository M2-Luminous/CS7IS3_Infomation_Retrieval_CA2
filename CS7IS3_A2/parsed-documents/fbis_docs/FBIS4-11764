Former Palestinian mayor Mustafa al-Natshah told AFP: "The population in Hebron will only be safe when the 30 families of Jewish settlers situated in the heart of Hebron are evacuated." Some 400 settlers live scattered through the town of 120,000 people. Al-Natshah added he was "satisfied" that 160 lightly-armed observers from Norway, Denmark and Italy were to be sent to the town under a deal signed Thursday in Cairo. It is the first time that Israel has agreed to the deployment of an international force in territories under its control. The PLO demanded protection for Palestinians living in Hebron after a Jewish settler killed 30 Arab worshippers in a mosque here as a condition for returning to talks on launching self-rule. But leaders of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) said in Damascus the agreement would not ensure the safety of Palestinians in Hebron. The two dissident factions are opposed to the Middle East peace process. PFLP deputy leader Abu-'Ali Mustafa said Palestinian security would be "impossible without the dismantlement of the settlements." DFLP spokesman Dawud Talhami said settlers would still "continue to carry out massacres. "The 160 international observers will not be able to react seriously in face of the deployment of thousands of Israeli soldiers," he added. The president of Hebron university's graduate association Ahmad Tamimi said the agreement was "a step forward", but added Palestinians would never "know stability and security until the settlers have left." The deal reached between Israeli and PLO negotiators called for the observers to be deployed immediately in Hebron. It paved the way for an immediate resumption of autonomy talks on Thursday, suspended for almost five weeks since the February 25 massacre. A PLO spokesman in Tunis said the accord was "a first step in applying (UN) Security Council Resolution 904." The resolution adopted on March 18 condemned the massacre and called for international protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territories. But the spokesman urged extra measures "to guarantee an effective international protection for the Palestinian people, its land and its holy sites."
