These provocative military exercises codenamed "increase of the joint operation capacity" were a real war gamble of the U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique to drop Marines by transport planes and helicopters on supposed "enemy-controlled areas" to blast dam, bridge and other major setups and obstacles there. The puppet clique, instigated by the U.S. imperialists, is now staging large-scale naval manoeuvces in the West Sea of Korea, with the mobilization of various types of battleships. Thus, the coastal areas of the Korean peninsula are turning into a training place for a war against the northern half of Korea.
