The implementation of the peace agreement was to begin 37 days from 4 August 1993. Also, it is almost two months since RPF leaders and a battalion of 600 RPF soldiers arrived in Kigali. That was on 28 December 1993, which was in line with the implementation of the peace agreements. The broad-based transitional government was supposed to be set up on 29 December 1993. However, this was not possible up the present day due to a few people who want to maintain the dictatorship because of their personal interests and interests and benefits. Those people are none other than the MRND [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development] CDR [Coalition for the Defence of the Republic] clique, with President Habyarimana at the top. President Habyarimana created divisions within the PL [Liberal Party], after which he and his cohorts created another pretext that the broad-based transitional government should be set up after the parties that will comprise the transitional institutions have agreed to give amnesty to all people who have or may have comitted crimes in the past. By this, the clique intends to forget that amnesty is given by the people to whom the crimes were committed, and after the people who committed the crimes accept the crimes and confess to the people that were offended. However, this was not the real issue that the MRND-CDR clique wanted to bring forward, but only a tactic they wanted to employ so as to maintain the same powers MRND had before the signing of the peace agreements. With much effort to frustrate the setting up of the broad-based transitional government, President Habyarimana's clique has resorted to creating divisions in political parties, terrorism and widespread massacres all over the country, especially in the capital, Kigali. On the 20 February 1993, a group of MRND-CDR supporters who called themselves power started acts of terrorism in the capital, Kigali, with an intention to preempt a political rally that was organised by Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu, the prime minister-designate for the broad-based transitional government. The acts of hooliganism left car windscreens shattered, houses broken into and several people dead. The following day, on 21 February, the same group of people put barricades around the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Constitutional Court, thus holding hostage employees in the two places for the whole day. During the night of 21 February leading to 22, a date on which the broad-based transitional government was to be in place, the minister of works and energy, Mr. Felicien Gatabazi, who was also the secretary general of an opposition party, PSD, [Social Democratic Party] was shot dead. The death Mr. Gatabazi met could occur to any other political leader within the opposition parties, even the RPF. This is aimed at reducing the force that opposes the clique that wants to cling on to power. The RPF informs all banyarwanda [Rwandan people] and the international community that it cannot accept and allow President Habyarimana and his clique to continue acts of terror and killing innocent banyarwanda. President Habyarimana does all this when the international community is looking on and instead of denouncing him decided to attribute all that is happening in our country to political parties in Rwanda. The RPF will not keep on watching. It has the ability and the right to take decisions at any time. The RPF is impressed to see banyarwanda coming together to fight for their rights. The RPF also requests an inquiry into the death of the minister of works and energy, Mr. Felicien Gatabazi, so that those responsible for his death are brought to court.
