Nechanicky, who represented Otakar Kracik, one of the accused in the rum affair, is the fourth head of the Inspectorate in the almost two years that Ruml has managed the department. The Ministry's spokesman, Jan Subrt, justified the personnel changes by saying that the Inspectorate is returning to Ruml's management and will no longer be the responsibility of his deputy, Jiri Krizan. Krizan, however, will continue to manage the supervisory team that looks into the misdemeanors committed by the department's civilian personnel.
