Once again the negotiators did not make any progress. President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Alija Izetbegovic, when he gave our newspaper an interview, also told us in Geneva, after the very first day, on Tuesday evening, that he did not expect anything special. [Munda] Peace is the first and most sacred principle. Is it possible to achieve it in Bosnia-Herzegovina? What are the basic conditions under which you would consent to it, Mr. President? [Izetbegovic] Our principle is not peace, but rather a fair peace. After all these countless and unsuccessful negotiations, I am no longer convinced that it will be possible to achieve it at the negotiating table, at least not with the present balance of power and not with the people who are now sitting at the other side of the table, since they are the ones who launched the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We Muslims will probably have to prove for a while longer that they cannot conquer us. Only when they realize that will they be prepared to offer us a fair peace. [Munda] And what should that offer include? [Izetbegovic] The basic thing is preservation of the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state. In the kind of form that is being proposed by the emissaries of the European Union and the world organization, Owen and Stoltenberg, i.e., as a union of three republics, which of course is not even close to being a happy and good solution, it is possible and it would be possible to accept it. In that case the Serbs and Croats would have to leave the areas that they have now occupied, and in which the Muslims were the majority population before the war. The Muslim republic would thus be a solid entity with access to the Sava in the north and to the sea in the south. In the east and west, it would be adjacent to the Drina River and the Una. That state would be able to live and function. Saving What Can Still Be Saved [Munda] Is that feasible? Are you still convinced that Bosnia-Herzegovina can remain a unified state within the borders that were recognized by the international community with the three peoples living together in it, or have you already reconciled yourself to the partition of your state? [Izetbegovic] You obviously have doubts, as I sometimes do myself. I can turn your question around, however. Is there any other way? For the time being we do not see one. Can we drive Mladic's army out of Bosnia-Herzegovina? According to our estimates there are about 100,000 people in it, and they still have 700-800 tanks and 2,000 cannons. During the war to date we have already destroyed 300-400 of their tanks, and also some of their personnel, but above all it is important that we have crushed their morale. The morale of Mladic's soldiers is very low, and technical superiority is all that their side still has. The relationship between our army and theirs is an inverse one: our people are highly motivated, their morale is high and is still growing stronger, but they are too poorly armed. On the other side, there are well-armed people with very low morale, behind whom crimes of the worst sort stretch like a shadow. [Munda] After all the crimes and inconceivable horrors, is coexistence even still possible? [Izetbegovic] When we talked about this, the following idea arose: by partitioning the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina into three republics, we would at least prevent the advance of the occupying army, which is also spreading classic fascism, actually a mixture of the worst in both fascism and Bolshevism. And we are firmly convinced--and it is also confirmed by history--that neither fascism nor Bolshevism can last forever, and that they cannot survive either in peace or in war. Fascism was defeated in war and in peace in Spain, and Bolshevism collapsed on its own. One thus just has to have enough time and patience and wait for them to end. Let me be completely clear. We are convinced that neither the fascism on the Serbian side nor on the other one--I am thinking of Boban's Croatian parastate in Bosnia-Herzegovina--can survive. Our strategic concept is therefore to save what it is possible to save in Bosnia-Herzegovina, to establish a democratic system, to rebuild "our" part of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and then, through the reputation of our political model, to defeat the fascism of the left and the right. Of course, the decisive factor in this is time, which means 20 to 30 years. [Munda] Is it still possible to stop Karadzic, when he has already announced publicly the merger of Serbian Bosnia with Milosevic's Serbia? Boban is also obviously aiming at the same thing, the annexation of his Herceg-Bosna to the Croatian state. [Izetbegovic] The international community would not accept anything like that. Milosevic will not become involved in anything like that without our consent. It is not possible to legalize that, just as it is not possible to enter something stolen in an enterprise's ledgers, if I can make what is perhaps not the best comparison. Karadzic consequently cannot break up Bosnia-Herzegovina and secede without our consent, because we are an internationally recognized state, and that recognition only guarantees certain rights which cannot be simply ignored. [Munda] Are you also convinced that Serbian President Milosevic and Croatian President Tudjman already agreed on a partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina years ago, when you and Kiro Gligorov were still firmly advocating an asymmetric Yugoslavia, or Yugoslavia as a confederation? [Izetbegovic] I was convinced of that since day one. Only blind people did not see what was already clear from day one. We opposed it as much as we could. Thus, for instance, we neither recognized that secret agreement or accepted it as a fact; we acted outwardly as if that plan did not exist, and we organized against it, because we of course knew about it. A while ago Mr. Franjo Tudjman reminded me of 1939, when Bosnia was partitioned by the Serbs and Croats, and he asked me whether I was convinced that something like that was no longer possible, saying "You know, it is a real danger." Although I am usually a tactician, that time I answered him undiplomatically: "You know, Alija Izetbegovic and the 200,000 soldiers of the Bosnia-Herzegovina army were not around then." [Munda] Then you statesmen also speak in that undiplomatic language.... [Izetbegovic] I do have calm nerves, I know how to control myself and be a tactician, but during that conversation Franjo Tudjman reminded me of something that always upsets and affects me. He should not have brought up certain historical disgraces, the fragmentation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, when Cvetkovic and Macek agreed that they would divide up Bosnia according to the majority principle: wherever there are more Serbs should belong to Serbia, and wherever there are more Croats should belong to Croatia. When one of them asked what would happen where the Muslims were in the majority, the other one answered, "We will act as if there are no Muslims." The HVO Conducted the Most Brutal Ethnic Cleansing [Munda] What is actually happening in central Bosnia? Are the intensified battles in that section perhaps the result of an assessment that the Croats are militarily more vulnerable than the Serbs? Are you attacking there, or defending yourselves? [Izetbegovic] Don't forget that every action by our army in Bosnia-Herzegovina is legal, as long as it is in accordance with the laws and no crime is involved. That is all that it is not permitted in its own state. The Bosnia-Herzegovina army is acting there against the rebel HVO [Croatian Defense Council], which tried to establish a Croatian parastate. Furthermore, the broader public does not know that the HVO, where it had power and superiority, i.e., in central Bosnia and Herzegovina, conducted the most brutal ethnic cleansing. Thus, for instance, it "cleansed" Mostar, and it did the same thing in the traditional Muslim center Stolac and in central Bosnia. There are no more Muslims in Vitez, even though they were about 50 percent of the population previously. They are also no longer in Busovaca. The HVO consequently not only acted legally, since it is a paramilitary force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also criminally. The Bosnia-Herzegovina army's actions there are legal and legitimate; our army cannot be a conquering one, but only a liberating one. [Munda] Are you seriously disappointed in the world community, which seems to have completely turned its back on you and is indifferently watching the slaughter in your state? [Izetbegovic] I think that all well-intentioned people in this world are disappointed or at least richer by an extremely bitter experience. Perhaps in the beginning we Muslims really were badly mistaken, since we were convinced that the world community would help us, especially since it kept adopting promising declarations and resolutions and constantly citing documents on human rights. One day we had to rid ourselves of these illusions, and we did. Bosnia is a model example of what the international community seriously intends to do and of where it does not go beyond declarations. Bosnia is a sort of test, not only of good will but also of the world's seriousness and moral strength. Many of Europe's values lie under the rubble in Bosnia. What Europe represented for the world community has also been destroyed. After all of these bitter experiences and disappointments, we can also wonder whether Europe really is what we thought it was, and as we imagined it--a symbol of progress, peacefulness, and human rights. Let me remind you that in this century alone this continent of ours has "given birth" to great evil twice: fascism and Bolshevism. Europe really is the French Revolution, it really is the declaration on human rights, but it is also Hitler and Stalin, with purges and concentration camps, gas chambers. Europe has borne within itself a great deal of evil, which we Europeans do not like to remember. [Munda] Wouldn't another possible explanation be that you Bosnian Muslims are the victims because Europe supposedly did not want to have an Islamic state within its bosom? Furthermore, Islam, possibly because of Iran and Iraq, represents something negative in the eyes of the public.... [Izetbegovic] I think that it primarily has to do with passivity and indecisiveness, since that is primary in human nature. For instance, if Milosevic invites Europe and all of the West not to do anything and to take care of their own economy and profit instead, and we cry out to them and ask them to send their people here to help us, if citizens of the West are dying here, of course they listen to Milosevic first and more. If a Muslim republic would really be disruptive, one has to ask why the West was also indifferent when the Serbs destroyed Vukovar and fired on Dubrovnik. Believe me, Europe does not see Serbia as a bulwark against Islam, as one hears from that country. It is quite clear to the vast majority that it is a question of Serbia's policy of naked conquest, although I am not ruling out a completely different possibility, namely that a certain number of states are really secretly counting on something like what you hinted at in your question. I can proudly tell you that my people behave in a much more European manner than some big Europeans. They have destroyed and are destroying our mosques, bridges, and libraries, but such buildings and institutions are sacred to us, and we would never touch them. "The Weapons That Janez Jansa `Discovered' in Maribor Are Ours" [Munda] People who are not familiar with the background in which diplomacy usually operates are convinced that everyone has turned his back on you except for the Muslim countries. What about Slovenia? [Izetbegovic] Slovenia is proof that it is not true. Slovenia is not big and it is also not a strong state, but from the very beginning it has given us political and moral support. Furthermore, it has received almost 70,000 of our people. The position of our refugees in Slovenia is considerably better than in Croatia. In our country we speak with great respect about Slovenia, which, even though it has just left Yugoslavia itself, has managed to help us. [Munda] You are speaking very nicely and pleasantly about my young state. It seems that a shadow has just fallen between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovenia, however. What I have in mind is the scandal you know of at the Maribor airport, when 120 tons of what were obviously your weapons were discovered, and you also had to speak up in defense of one of your citizens, with the statement that from the beginning the suspect Hasan Cengic was an authorized representative of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Izetbegovic] Hasan Cengic was an employee of ours, an authorized representative of the Bosnia-Herzegovina government. Bosnia-Herzegovina was attacked, and we had to defend ourselves and arm ourselves. We could only obtain weapons from abroad. When Croatia closed the roads to us, we only had Slovenia left. The weapons that Janez Jansa "discovered" in Maribor are ours; we bought them in a certain other country and were bringing them to Bosnia through Slovenia. That is the truth, and nothing else. Hasan Cengic was not any sort of private arms dealer, but rather our representative for those affairs, not just in Slovenia but also in several countries. [Munda] Why was it done so surreptitiously? [Izetbegovic] Because an embargo was imposed on importing weapons into our country. It is paradoxical that the international community recognized the sovereign state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and also recognized that we are a victim of aggression, but at the same time did not allow us and is not allowing us to be able to defend ourselves, even though we have a right to do so even under the Charter of the UN, of which we are a member. Every state has the right to defend itself in two ways, but we were not defended by other states, nor did we supposedly have the right to self-defense. The fruit of that policy on the part of the international community is a devastated and to a considerable extent occupied country, and a refugee population, because at the beginning of the war we did not have weapons and we did not have anything to defend ourselves with. That is why we had to fend for ourselves and open up some other channels in spite of the embargo. Thank God, we succeeded, since otherwise we would have been literally trampled. We saved and are still defending what is certainly not a large, but nevertheless significant part of our state's territory: the valleys of the Bosna and Neretva Rivers, along the Drina Gorazde, Zepa, and Srebrenica, Krajina in the west, Sarajevo has already been defending itself for 20 months, and so on. That is all thanks to weapons brought from elsewhere, since one cannot defend oneself against tanks and artillery with bare hands. [Munda] And how will you survive if Serbia and Croatia completely close you off? [Izetbegovic] Our people have shown extraordinary vitality and the ability to defend themselves. For some time Serbia and Croatia will still surround us; they are surrounding us now and furthermore are still attacking. But we have survived, and we are still holding on. [Munda] In the eyes of the public you are--forgive me if I am also a bit provocative--a sort of symbol of the defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina, but Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic seems to represent something new and uncompromising. [Izetbegovic] I only know that Haris Silajdzic is younger and more handsome than I am. [Munda] Sooner or later you will see peace. What is your view of the future and the rebuilding of Bosnia, Mr. President? [Izetbegovic] Even if the Western countries have not helped us to defend ourselves, I am convinced that they will help us in rebuilding our country. Perhaps in that way they will somehow ease their consciences; and I am completely convinced that the Muslim countries will help us. A people that has been hardened in war, "purged," and has passed life's test, will quite certainly cope in peacetime. After these wartime experiences, I am not afraid of the future.
