According to a high-ranking intelligence official on 24 January, "Sanomaeng has announced it will begin legal activities through advertisements in daily newspapers and interviews with magazines. It has been learned that there is a move among those who advocate the legitimate line to found a legitimate progressive party." However, the official said, "Considering the fact that at the end of last year over 20 people were arrested for attempting to rebuild Sanomaeng in Cholla provinces, some remaining forces may insist on keeping the original Sanomaeng." Since its foundation in November 1989, Sanomaeng, which claimed to be "independent Leninist," has evoked controversy in and outside activist groups by founding a clandestine party and advocating the line for reforming the political system through revolution. Its activities were actually suspended after the arrest of its executive members including Pak No-hae and Paek Tae-ung.
