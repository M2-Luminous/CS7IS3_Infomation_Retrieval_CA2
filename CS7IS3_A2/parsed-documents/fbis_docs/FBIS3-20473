[Text] Everyone says the mainland is good: There is plenty of manpower, cheap land, and a vast market; it is a good place for Taiwan traders to continue to grow and make money. Is this true? What do Taiwan traders who have invested in the mainland say? Cheng Pao-t'ang [6774 1405 1016] (General Manager, China Giant) This Is No Return Home It is very hard going here. Very hard going. People who haven't come to the mainland do not appreciate just how hard going it is here. Here, you cannot look at the mainland with a Taiwan outlook. Doing things here with a Taiwan point of view does not work. But if you want to come here to complain, then don't come here. This is because the system that has existed on the mainland for the past 40 years has bred a large common pot mentality in which everyone expects the same benefits no matter his or her work. Different environments have bred different value concepts. One cannot say that theirs are wrong. Since they are people, and people's natures are different, there are no rights and wrongs about cultural matters. But standards should be improved. For example, people over here do not do things on time and they do not keep promises. They should be trained to do things on time and to keep promises, and they should may attention to sanitation. Mainland employees follow instructions, but their thinking and outlook is different. You have to spend a lot of time explaining things to them. I came here in August 1992, and we are still building a factory. I open my eyes at 5:30 every morning and climb to the top of a hill alone. At 7:00 o'clock I eat breakfast, and at 7:30 I go to the office. I work until 7:00 p.m. Then I return to my dormitory to eat dinner. At 9:00 or 10:00 o'clock at night, I often return to the plant area on patrol. Although I am only a junior middle school graduate, I have always believed that a person should have a desire to learn. After graduating, I worked in the underworld, and as a pharmacist in a clinic. I was 24 years old before I entered Jumbo where I worked as head of the model car manufacturing department, head of the warehouse receiving department, head of the issuing department, and head of the painting department. I also served as head of the on-site manufacturing section, in general affairs, and in procurement, and on up to the manager of the materials department. Both a Challenge and a Mission When the company asked me to become the Giant general manager in China, I wrestled with the matter for several months, finally deciding to come. I did not want to let the board of directors down after the many years they had invested in me. It was also an opportunity for me to move upward in the company and to expand my horizons. So I came to the mainland to give my all. It became my second youth. At first, in the quiet the night, I frequently wept thinking about my family. I felt very sad that my children were so small, but I could not be with them to help them grow up. I had three small children studying in middle school and primary school. It was the period of their schooling. When I was at home, they often asked me questions. Whenever they saw something, they asked about it. Now I was unable to perform my duty as head of the family. My father lost a leg in an automobile accident, and my mother has diabetes. In order for me to come to the mainland, I asked by younger brother to resign from his job in Taipei and move back to Ta-chia to look after our two parents. Coming here takes physical strength and stamina. One has to work hard. When I return to Taiwan for 10 days every 3 months, I am sure to help the children polish their bicycles. I thought about sending the children over here for an education, but in Taiwan, the savior of the people is Chiang Kai-shek. On the mainland, it is Mao Zedong... I often explain to the children what daddy's thinking is, and why I want to go to the mainland. When I first came here, I was very happy at returning to Taiwan each time, but now it is agonizing to return, because there is so much to be looked after here. The employees here are ignorant about bicycles. They have to be looked after and taught. I am very sad at heart at coming here, because coming here is no returning home, and because my tour of duty is open-ended. Coming here is a challenge and a mission. Anonymous Taiwan Trader: Everything Is a Swindle When you operate a factory on the mainland, very many people collect money under very many guises. Someone may suddenly come to collect a cleaning fee. Never mind the reason given, if they want to collect it, they collect it. Here fees for public order are also levied by the head, and the Customs also frequently makes things difficult for Taiwan traders. They like to cause trouble for no reason at all, suddenly issuing fines of tens of thousands of yuan. During one Mid-autumn Festival, I spent 15,000 yuan on dinner parties and gift giving. They often say that we are the most stingy, but since we are not engaged in smuggling, why should we give dinner parties? There are very many bogus joint ventures here that are actually sole proprietorships. When paying employees their salaries, you have to turn over Hong Kong dollars to the joint venture unit first; then, they pay the employees in renminbi, benefitting from the difference in the exchange rate. Here, management is the biggest headache. The workers here stonewall each other and are fond of quarrelling. This is very hard to deal with. Communism rules here. Using democratic methods to operate is impossible. One has to use forceful means. During my first year, I used Taiwan's humane management methods, which failed miserably. The following year, I changed. I used dictatorial management. I changed to arbitrary management. Here I found everything is a swindle. I have yet to meet a good person. There is no way to defend yourself against it. When we first set up the factory, they helped with everything, and I felt they were very good. But after two or three years, things are not the same. When I was in Taiwan, I did not take medicine for three years, but since coming here, I take medicine every day, and every two or three days, I have to have a shot. Criminals are beginning to appear here. Ranking cadres can also earn money easily. One ranking cadre runs a gambling parlor. One has seven automobiles, two of them Rolls Royces. Once I bought a generator. When it was delivered, I wanted to try it out to see whether it would generate electricity. But the other party would not let me try it out. I insisted. Several days later, he had a criminal come to kill me. I barricaded the door and had someone mediate before the matter was resolved. [passage omitted] Taiwan Trader Suicide Image Taiwan traders here must also engage in self-criticism. Some Taiwan traders are fond of indulging themselves. They go out karaoke singing; they go wenching; and they keep women. This causes bad feelings among the local people. Sooner or later, this will make for tense relations between the two sides of the Straits. In addition, some Taiwan traders engage in cut-throat competition. They engage in price slashing with each other, and some factories do not train their own personnel. Instead, they try to hollow out each other. Very many Taiwan traders who come here that do not make money in a year or two turn to smuggling. Well-behaved Taiwan traders are hurt by these Taiwan traders that have a bad image. Over here, one positively should not travel by bus. Two or three people may board a bus with knives to steal money. If you are a little slow in giving it to them, they may stab you. During the New Year when workers return home, robberies frequently occur. The place is simply lawless and godless, one swindle after another.
