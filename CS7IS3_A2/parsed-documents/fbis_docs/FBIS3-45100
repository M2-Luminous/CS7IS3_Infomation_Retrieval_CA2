C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, Jan. 12 (CNA) -- India is considering establishing a trade office in Taipei with a view to strengthening cooperative ties with Taiwan, an Indian official said here Wednesday [12 January]. Ashok Jha, director of the Asia-Pacific Department under India's Ministry of Commerce, noted that his country is also working to simplify visa procedures for Taiwan businessmen in order to facilitate the exchange of visits between the two sides. Jha, leading an eight-member Indian trade mission here, arrived in Taipei Tuesday for a three-day visit. India has relaxed a number of trade and investment regulations since July 1991 under a government strategy to promote market liberalization and internationalization, which aims to court more foreign investors, he pointed out. For example, he added, the tariff ceiling was lowered from 250 percent to the current 93 percent. India has attracted more than US$4.1 billion in foreign investment during the past two and a half years, he said, adding the investors mainly came from the United States, Japan, Britain, and Switzerland. With a population of 886 million, which provides a high purchasing power and low-cost labor force, India boasts great potential for development, he stressed. Moreover, he elaborated, Taiwan and India could enter into a complementary relationship as foreign trade plays a leading role in Taiwan's economic development and India's foreign trade currently accounts for only 15 percent of its gross national product. Taiwan manufacturers are welcome to forge joint ventures with their Indian counterparts or make investments in India in such industries as consumer products, auto parts, electronic components, and food processing, he said. To explore more trade opportunities here, Jha and his mission will meet with Taiwan manufacturers at the China External Trade Development Council (Cetra) in the afternoon. The Indian mission met with officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Board of Foreign Trade, and the Indian Chamber of Commerce in Taipei in the morning. Trade ties between Taipei and New Delhi have been growing. Cetra, a semi-official foreign trade promotion organization in Taiwan, opened an office in New Delhi last November. Two-way trade totaled roughly US$500 million last year.
