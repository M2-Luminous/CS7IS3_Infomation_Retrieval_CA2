However, France will wait for multilateral approval before unblocking its bilateral credits. Yesterday, on his way to Washington and IMF headquarters, the Algerian economics minister, Mourad Benachenhou, stopped off in Paris, where he met with his French counterpart, Edmond Alphandery. The meeting was described as "coming under the rubric of usual consultations," between the two countries, the Economics Ministry explained yesterday. Consequently, the Algerian minister had an opportunity to report on the economic situation in Algeria and, more importantly, on the difficult discussions currently being conducted between Algiers and the IMF. As France has already emphasized since the Balladur government took office, "France has reaffirmed its support for Algeria," experts from the Economics Ministry reiterated yesterday. In 1993, Paris awarded Algeria credits totalling nearly 6 billion francs [Fr], 5 billion of which were commercial credits (1 billion covering imports of cereals), and 1 billion in balance-of- payments aid. However, the French Government gave its assurance that new French bilateral credits will only be set up when an agreement has been signed with the IMF. Moreover, France has assured Algiers of its support among the industrialized countries of Europe, with a view to mobilizing "sufficient support from the international community" when an IMF program has been launched in Algeria, the Economics Ministry explained yesterday. The caution displayed by the French Government, in a -- both politically and economically -- particularly troubled time in Algeria, is in fact motivated by the imminence of an agreement between the International Monetary Fund and Algiers, which could be forthcoming within the coming weeks. So far, the Algerians have not succeeded in concluding such an agreement, due to the extremely difficult social consequences of the IMF's demands (devaluation of the dinar, liberalization of foreign trade, budgetary rigor, privatization, etc.). However, observers believe that the recent visit to Algiers by Michel Camdessus appears to have pushed things along at the political level. Algiers in a Financial Impasse Eagerly awaited for several months, this agreement would not only unblock new IMF credits (Fr500 million in "stand-by" loans, plus Fr300 million in aid for the balance of payments to offset Algeria's reduced income from oil, or even an "extended facility" in the coming months), and credits from the European Union (worth nearly $1 billion), but would also open up the way for the Paris Club to reschedule the Algerian national debt ($13.5 billion out of a total of $26 billion). Both the Algerian prime minister, Redha Malek, who returned to office one month ago, and the country's new president, Lamine Zeroual, now seem ready to accept the restructuring of Algeria's national debt that their predecessors had always categorically rejected -- on condition that this be done as "tactfully" as possible, taking account of domestic policy and the international financial markets. Consequently, before it mobilizes new bilateral credits, Paris -- which is a privileged partner of Algiers, but intent on seeing some light on the Algerian horizon -- is waiting to see what the new contributions to multilateral credits will be, and possibly to see which concessions on the debt are granted by Western governments. As in past years, in 1994 Algiers is having to face up to a new financial impasse. The drop in the price of oil will reduce its revenue even further this year: revenue of $8 billion for oil sales would represent a shortfall of $2 to $3 billion compared with 1993. However, $9 billion -- the cost of servicing the debt -- will remain exorbitant this year. All of which comes down to saying that whatever the voluntary restrictions on imports already decided by the government, the need for external financing is estimated to reach $4 to $5 billion this year.
