FR940317-2-00022 FR940317-2-00016 For general information on the DOE NEPA review process, please contact: Ms. Carol M. Borgstrom, Director, Office of NEPA Oversight (EH&hyph;25), U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;4600 or (800) 472&hyph;2756. PUBLIC SCOPING PROCESS: DOE will host a series of informal sessions to provide the public with additional information on the materials to be evaluated and the proposed action and alternatives discussed in this NOI. These sessions are intended to be interactive and DOE representatives will be available to answer questions. These informal sessions are scheduled at the following times and locations: 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., April 12, 1994, North Augusta Community Center, 495 Brookside Avenue, North Augusta, South Carolina; 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., April 19, 1994, DeSoto Hilton Hotel, 15 Liberty Street, Savannah, Georgia; 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., April 21, 1994, Holiday Inn Coliseum at USC, 630 Assembly Street, Columbia, South Carolina. DOE will then conduct public scoping meetings to assist in defining the appropriate scope of the EIS and identifying significant environmental issues to be addressed. DOE representatives will be available at the meetings to discuss, in informal conversations, SRS nuclear materials programs. These meetings are scheduled at the following times and locations: 1 p.m. to 4 p.m and 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., May 12, 1994, Coastal Georgia Center for Continuing Education, 305 Martin Luther King Boulevard (Battlefield Park), Savannah, Georgia; 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., May 17, 1994, North Augusta Community Center, 495 Brookside Avenue, North Augusta, South Carolina; 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., May 19, 1994, Holiday Inn Coliseum at USC, 630 Assembly Street, Columbia, South Carolina. DOE will publish additional notices on the dates and locations of the information sessions and scoping meetings in local newspapers well in advance of the scheduled dates. DOE is committed to providing opportunities for the involvement of interested individuals and groups in this and other DOE planning activities. The public, organizations, and agencies are invited to present oral and written comments concerning (1) the scope of the EIS, (2) the issues the EIS should address, and (3) the alternatives the EIS should analyze. Please address written comments to Mr. Wright at the address indicated above. These comments should be postmarked by May 31, 1994, to ensure full consideration. Organizations and individuals wishing to participate in the public meetings can call 1&hyph;800&hyph;242&hyph;8269 between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, or submit their requests to Mr. Wright at the address indicated above. DOE requests that anyone who wishes to speak at one of the scoping meetings pre-register by contacting Mr. Wright, either by phone or in writing. Pre-registration should occur at least two days before the designated meeting. Persons who have not pre-registered to speak may register at the meeting and will be called to speak as time permits. DOE will document comments received during the public scoping process. Copies will be available for inspection at these locations during regular business hours, Monday through Friday: The DOE Freedom of Information Reading Room, room 1E&hyph;190, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;6020; and The DOE Public Document Room, University of South Carolina, Aiken Campus, University Library, 2nd Floor, 171 University Parkway, Aiken, South Carolina 29801, (803) 648&hyph;6851. Additional locations may be selected through the scoping process. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Savannah River Site is an 800 square-kilometer (300 square-mile), controlled area in southwestern South Carolina. The Site is approximately 25 miles southeast of Augusta, Georgia and 20 miles south of Aiken, South Carolina. Since its establishment, the mission of the SRS has been to produce nuclear materials that support the defense, research, and medical programs of the United States. Historically, reactor fuel or target assemblies were chemically dissolved into aqueous solutions in the F- or H-Canyon chemical separations facilities. Various processes were performed to separate the useful isotopes (uranium-235, uranium-238, neptunium-237, plutonium-238, americium-243, curium-244, and plutonium-239) from the rest of the fuel and target material. The uranium-235 solutions were shipped off the site for conversion to a solid form and the uranium-238 in solution was converted to an oxide using the FA-Line facility at SRS. The neptunium-237 was recovered, and when required, converted to a solid and fashioned into new targets. The plutonium was recovered and converted to metal or oxide products using the FB- and HB-Line facilities. Most converted materials were shipped to other DOE sites. Any product materials stored onsite were placed in ``vaults'' designed for storage. In March 1992, chemical processing operations were suspended in the canyons to address a potential safety concern. The concern was subsequently addressed, but prior to resumption of processing, the Secretary of Energy directed that defense-related chemical separations activities (i.e., reprocessing) be phased out at SRS. Since this decision, the Department has determined that further action related to the disposition of nuclear material is subject to the NEPA process. Non-safety related facility operations have remained shut down, with the exception of plutonium-238 processing associated with the support of NASA missions. As a result of these shutdowns, the canyons and the reactor fuel and target storage basins 2 have a large inventory of in-process solutions, fuel assemblies, and targets. This inventory includes materials containing a wide variety of special isotopes (plutonium-239, uranium-235, plutonium-242, americium-243, curium-244, neptunium-237, etc.). There are approximately 100,000 gallons of in-process solutions in storage and approximately 200 metric tons of spent fuel and targets in storage. 2 There are several storage basins currently in use. These are the K-, L-, and P-Reactor basins, the Receiving Basin for Off-site Fuels (RBOF) located in H-Area, and the Canyon receiving basins. In addition to the above solutions and targets, there are over 90,000 gallons of uranyl nitrate hexahydrate (UNH) stored in tanks outside the facility. The UNH contains the uranium-235 recovered from the processing of fuel from SRS production reactors, and DOE, domestic, and foreign research reactors. There are also approximately 35,000 55-gallon drums of uranium-238 (known as ``depleted uranium'') oxide stored on the site. This material is the product of processing the targets from which plutonium-239 is recovered. For some solutions (e.g., enriched uranium and americium/curium) no conversion capability exists. Conversion, stabilization, or disposition options must be developed for such solutions.
