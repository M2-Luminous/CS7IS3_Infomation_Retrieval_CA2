FBIS4-13618 "drnes078__a94012" FBIS-NES-94-078-A Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 ANNEX Israel Expulsion of 2 Labor Officials Expected Expulsion of 2 Labor Officials Expected TA1804085894 Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English 18 Apr 94 p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY TA1804085894 Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST English BFN [Report by Sarah Honig] [Text] Former Health Minister Hayim Ramon will be formally expelled from the Labor Party at midweek, it was decided at yesterday's session of the Labor Political Bureau, prior to the meeting of the Labor ministerial caucus. Along with Ramon, MKs [Knesset Members] 'Amir Peretz and Shmu'el Avital will also be expelled for joining Ramon in his independent Histadrut [Labor Federation] list, challenging the official Labor list. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday for the first time put his full political weight against Ramon, who was the minister closest to him until recently, and who engineered Rabin's own 1992 electoral victory. By doing so, Rabin staked his own political reputation against Ramon's in what is expected to be a bitter, no-holds-barred battle by Labor to retain its Histadrut hegemony. Rabin told the political bureau members that there is "no room for considering pros and cons and for making political calculations. The party constitution could not be clearer. Anyone who is a Labor member but nevertheless runs against a Labor list in any election, is automatically ousted from the party. We are dealing with the basics of democracy." "The party conducts primaries and if some of the members don't accept the results of a democratic vote, then they can potentially wreck the entire democratic framework. They can cause this party to crumble from the inside. There comes a time when there are phenomena no party can tolerate. Party members cannot both campaign against their own party and at the same time continue to belong to it," Rabin argued. Ramon is expected to formally submit his Histadrut list to the elections committee tomorrow, though he has until the Wednesday deadline to do so. The minute his candidacy is filed, procedures in Labor will begin to expel him and his two allies. Yesterday's ministerial caucus and bureau session marked the total failure of the party moderates to prevail upon Rabin not to ban Ramon, Peretz, and Avital just yet. One argument was that Ramon's list might win, or at least be able to form a coalition, which would oust Labor from its 73-year Histadrut hegemony, in which case it would do well for Labor to claim Ramon as one of its own. Another argument was that even if Ramon is expelled from the party, he and his friends could still remain in the Knesset faction, as the Knesset rules do not address themselves to a situation in which a party expels a member, but only to walkout scenarios. Rabin was warned that if Ramon is expelled from the Knesset faction as well, this could set a precedent for those who oppose the government's dovish line in the peace talks. But Rabin, say sources, not only refused to be swayed by these arguments, but maintained that Ramon must be harshly dealt with as a deterrent to other would-be "troublemakers."
