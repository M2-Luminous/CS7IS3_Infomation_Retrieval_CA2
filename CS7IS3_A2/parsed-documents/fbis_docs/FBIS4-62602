Maj Gen Einseln will introduce the current process of drafting a defense conception as well as defense reorganization in Estonia -- that is, the organization of Estonian defense forces and their aims. He will also provide a survey of the issues to do with the formation of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion. I will speak about the Estonian security considerations in a broader sense, within the European context. [Kaldre] You say that a joint Estonian-American working group exists. When was it set up and how often does it meet?
