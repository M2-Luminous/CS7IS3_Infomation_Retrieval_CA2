"Japan understands that it was done based on Resolution 816," which was passed in October 1992, Takemura said of the shooting down by U.S. F-16 fighters of four military aircraft in central Bosnia. The chief cabinet secretary reiterated Japan's hope for the former Yugoslavia to achieve peace. The F-16s under the command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) shot down the planes that allegedly violated the U.N. no-fly zone over Bosnia. It was the first time that NATO warplanes have fired on alleged violators since the no-fly zone was declared.
