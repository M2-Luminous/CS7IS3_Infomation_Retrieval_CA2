FR940516-1-00017 FR940516-1-00001 Pro forma results present trading results with adjustments to reflect certain factors, such as a particular fee schedule or degree of leverage, to permit easier comparison with other types of results. In its rule submission, the NFA notes that in some instances the use of pro forma results may have some of the same limitations as hypothetical results. For example, some CPOs may use pro forma data to present results that a multi-advisor pool could have achieved had assets been allocated differently among CTAs than occurred in actuality. As the NFA Special Committee concluded, ``[t]his use of pro forma results reflects the same sort of hindsight that hypothetical results do and invites the same sort of abuse.'' Extracted performance results isolate a single component of a trading strategy for presentation to customers, and although based on actual results, are subject to manipulation as they may disproportionately emphasize a small portion of the overall strategy. Although the Commission believes that the use of pro forma, hypothetical and extracted results must be closely scrutinized, it has determined not to prohibit them at the present time. Instead, like other disclosures voluntarily provided, the disclosure of these types of results would be subject to such restrictions as may be imposed under the rules of a registered futures association and to the Commission's general antifraud prohibitions. NFA's proposed Compliance Rule 2&hyph;29(c) would strictly limit the use of hypothetical results in promotional material, except in promotional material directed exclusively to qualified eligible participants, as defined in CFTC Rule 4.7(a)(1)(ii). NFA's proposed interpretation of Compliance Rule 2&hyph;13 would permit pro forma performance histories solely for the purpose of adjusting performance presentations to the same fee structure as that of the pool or program offered. No pro forma results which reflect a hindsight analysis, such as to show results a multi-advisor pool could have achieved using a different allocation of assets among CTAs, would be permitted. Extracted results would only be permitted to be presented based on the percentage of net asset value actually committed to the particular component extracted. 10. Voluntary Performance Disclosures Pursuant to proposed Rule 4.24(v), disclosures, including performance disclosures, other than those required by CFTC rules must follow all relevant required disclosures in the disclosure document 37 and may not be misleading in their content or presentation or inconsistent with required disclosures. 38 Performance disclosures voluntarily provided could have misleading effects if favorable performance data are given undue prominence. For example, if the performance of two pools other than the offered pool operated by the CPO were voluntarily provided, it may be misleading to show the favorable performance of Pool 1 but not the negative performance of Pool 2 or to show the performance of Pool 1 in capsule format and that of Pool 2 in full format. It may also be misleading to show the performance of a pool in capsule format for year one and in full format for year two or to show the pool's performance for 1991 and not 1992. Generally, inclusion of voluntarily provided performance data should be made on a result-neutral basis that results in inclusion of all similar data. For example, the past performance of two CTAs allocated an equal portion of a pool's assets should either be included or omitted, as should the performance of the CPO's other pools. 37 As noted above, proprietary trading results would be required to follow all required disclosures. 38 See general discussion on voluntary disclosures, infra. The Commission also notes that the practice of advertising the performance of a particular CTA with an excellent track record to attract prospective participants and shortly thereafter reallocating pool assets to another CTA, a practice commonly referred to as ``bait-and-switch,'' is misleading and that performance voluntarily provided for this purpose is prohibited under general antifraud standards. 11. Cautionary Legends The proposed rules would continue to require the inclusion of certain legends alerting pool participants and prospective participants to the lack of experience of the CPO (or trading manager), the pool's CTAs and their principals. However, these legends have been revised and substantially streamlined. Under current Rule 4.21, these legends are required to recite the relevant performance disclosure requirement. For example, Rule 4.21(4)(i)(B) requires a statement that the CFTC requires disclosure of the performance of the pool offered and of other pools operated by the CPO and its principals and that neither the CPO nor its principals have any prior performance history. 39 The proposed rules would eliminate the prescribed statements concerning CFTC rules, with the effect of deleting the bulk of the bold-faced disclosures and of focusing attention upon the primary point to be conveyed, i.e., the fact that the CPO and its principals have not previously operated any commodity pools. Thus, the legend relating to the lack of trading history of a pool would read: ``THIS POOL HAS NOT COMMENCED TRADING AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY PERFORMANCE HISTORY'', 40 and the legend relating to the lack of experience of the CPO and its trading principals would read: ``NEITHER THIS POOL OPERATOR NOR ANY OF ITS TRADING PRINCIPALS HAS PREVIOUSLY OPERATED ANY OTHER POOLS OR TRADED ANY OTHER ACCOUNTS.'' 41 Similar legends would be required, where applicable, with respect to trading managers and major investee pools. To further reduce the bulk of these disclosures, where several legends may be required, the proposed rules provide an alternate legend consolidating the several statements that would otherwise be required. For example, the proposed rules would require a CTA disclosure document to disclose, if true, the lack of experience of the CTA and its principals. If the CTA had no prior experience, the following legend should be included: ``THIS TRADING ADVISOR PREVIOUSLY HAS NOT DIRECTED ANY ACCOUNTS.'' The following legend would be used for trading principals: ``NONE OF THE TRADING PRINCIPALS OF THIS TRADING ADVISOR HAS PREVIOUSLY DIRECTED ANY ACCOUNTS.'' If neither the CTA nor any of its principals had prior trading experience, rather than displaying these two separate legends, the following single sentence would be included: ``NEITHER THIS TRADING ADVISOR NOR ITS TRADING PRINCIPALS HAVE PREVIOUSLY DIRECTED ANY ACCOUNTS.'' These proposals are designed to reduce disclosures that complicate and lengthen disclosure documents while preserving disclosures that may be important to prospective investors. 39 The entire legend reads as follows: ``THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION REQUIRES THE OPERATOR OF A POOL THAT HAS TRADED COMMODITY INTERESTS FOR LESS THAN 12 MONTHS TO DISCLOSE THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE RECORD OF THE POOL FOR ITS ENTIRE OPERATING HISTORY AND THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE RECORD OF EACH OTHER POOL OPERATED BY THE POOL OPERATOR AND ITS PRINCIPALS. YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT THIS POOL OPERATOR AND ITS PRINCIPALS PREVIOUSLY HAVE NOT OPERATED ANY OTHER COMMODITY POOL.'' 40 Proposed Rule 4.25(c)(1)(ii). 41 Proposed Rule 4.25(c)(2)(iii). Similarly, the legend concerning major CTAs who have never directed accounts would read: ``(name of CTA), A COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR THAT HAS DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY OVER (percentage of the pool's aggregate initial futures margin and commodity option premiums allocated to that CTA) OF THE POOL'S DIRECT FUTURES AND COMMODITY OPTION TRADING HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY DIRECTED ANY ACCOUNTS.''
