This was an exciting event for the inventors and entrepreneurs in our country. We extend warm congratulations to these outstanding representatives who have won the title of excellent entrepreneurs with inventive achievements in this election, the first of its kind in our country. It is not easy to create an invention and it is even harder to apply an invention to industrial production. We have several tens of thousand inventions each year but too few of these inventions are applied to industrial production and transformed into productive forces. This group of entrepreneurs with inventive achievements who have now been presented to the public have not only made inventions of their own but have also applied their inventions to real industrial production, producing excellent economic returns and social benefits. Ours is a time of creation and reform which calls on more inventor-entrepreneurs to come forward and for more inventions to be applied to industrial production and commercialized. To transfer inventions to the industrial production process, we need a large number of entrepreneurs with knowledge of modern science and technology, modern management ability, modern business know-how, and a sense of creation. We hope this first nationwide election of excellent entrepreneurs with inventive achievements will give impetus to and set an example for the application of inventions to industrial production in our country. The history of the world and China has proved time and again that science and technology are daily becoming the most active and important motivation for social and economic development. Without the development and application of science and technology, there would be no economic prosperity and social progress. If an enterprise wants to grow and take the market, it had better develop its own inventions and patented technology. Every one of the 10 prize winners of this first nationwide election of excellent entrepreneurs with inventive achievements has his patented inventions and some of them are even the owners of more than 60 patents each. The history of the rise and decline of enterprises, in China and abroad alike, has shown that an enterprise without its own patented technology can hardly win in keen market competition. China is a country with an ancient civilization and a long history, which made splendid scientific and cultural achievements in ancient times. But, however splendid a nation's scientific and cultural achievements have been in the past, this nation will radiate a myriad of dazzling rays today and in the future only if it keeps developing its sciences and culture. We wholeheartedly wish that our inventors and entrepreneurs will unremittingly assimilate advanced scientific and technological knowledge, learn advanced business management know-how, constantly enhance improving themselves in the fields of science and culture, and thus carry forward the fine traditions of the Chinese nation amid the great tide of reform and opening up and make greater contributions to promoting technological progress and economic development of our country.
