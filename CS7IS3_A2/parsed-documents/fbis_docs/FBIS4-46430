Candidates fielded by three major parties are expected to be reelected: Ian Paisley for the Democratic Ulster Party (DUP), Jim Nicholson for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP, moderate), and John Hume, a Catholic, for the Social Democratic Labor Party (SDLP, moderately nationalist). "European stakes transcend our traditional fault lines. If we can cooperate with other European countries in view of a common interest, then we can work together at home," John Hume pleaded, to no avail. Once again, political and religious differences will prevail. And both the SDLP, which has been defending the Anglo-Irish document, and the UUP, which still favors it, fear the disenchantment of moderate voters with the slowness of the peace process. In this context, Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring explains Dublin's views on the European election's immediate stakes as well as the conditions for a potential referendum on Irish reunification. [passage omitted] Meutey: How can the conflict in Northern Ireland be ended? Spring: Right now, the best way would be for the Loyalists and Republicans to seize the chance offered them by the Downing Street declaration and subsequent texts. If they acknowledge these texts, they agree to support negotiation efforts between London and Dublin. Meutey: Do you favor reunification? Spring: All we want today is to put an end to the killing in Ulster. For the time being, reunification is not on the agenda. We must show respect for the Loyalists, who want to retain their links with Britain. The identity of the 500,000 individuals who want to retain their connections with the Irish Republic must be respected as well. Meutey: When would reunification actually happen, then? Spring: When a majority of Ulster's population has expressed a wish to see it happen... Meutey: If Sinn Fein agrees to stop the violence, when would the referendum take place in Northern Ireland? Spring: Even if violence were to stop tomorrow morning, at least 12 months of talks would be needed. So the referendum could be held in both Northern and Southern Ireland within a year. Meutey: Will voters in Northern Ireland be asked the same question as in your country? Spring: Ideally, yes. But we must take into account differences between the two countries. There will likely have to be two different questions. Meutey: Will the referendums be held on the same day? Spring: Same day, same time...
