In our foreign policy we give priority to Islamic countries. I had asked the esteemed sultan of Brunei to visit Iran to discuss common religious issues and the current situation in the world of Islam, which necessitates cooperation among Islamic countries. Also his excellency can become more familiar with Iran and we can get to know Brunei better. We can also assess any kind of cooperation which may exist between us and Brunei.
