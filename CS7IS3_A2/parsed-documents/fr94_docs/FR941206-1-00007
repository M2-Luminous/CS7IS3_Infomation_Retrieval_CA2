FR941206-1-00007 FR941206-1-00001 The Agency's regulation on the use of MS(S) and the absence of regulation on the use of MDP have raised two major policy issues. The first is whether current regulations are adequately protecting consumers. The second is whether different regulatory treatment for these similar products is justified. FSIS is not proposing this regulation because of the current differences in the regulatory treatment of MDP and MS(S), but rather because its basic statutory mission is to assure that products bear labeling that is truthful and not misleading. Accordingly, FSIS has determined that providing this assurance requires the regulation of MDP. V. Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking On June 15, 1993, FSIS published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) (58 FR 33040) soliciting comments, information, scientific data, and recommendations regarding the consideration of the need for labeling of poultry product produced by mechanical separation and products in which such poultry product is used. FSIS received 2744 comments in response to the ANPR, most of which were general reactions to labeling issues. The majority of commenters responded to whether there was a need to identify mechanically separated poultry in the ingredients statement on the labels of meat and poultry products in which it is used as an ingredient. One thousand four hundred eighty-seven commenters supported identifying mechanically separated poultry in the ingredients statement because, the commenters stated that, among other things, consumers have ``a right to know'' it is an ingredient. One thousand two hundred fifty-seven commenters did not support identifying mechanically separated poultry in the ingredients statement, citing, in part, that current policies are satisfactory and that labeling it would mislead consumers into thinking that they are purchasing products that are inferior or different than the product they have historically purchased. FSIS concluded that there is a ``truth-in-labeling'' issue that is founded in the mandate under which the Agency operates, viz., protecting consumers from misbranded poultry and meat products. Subsequently, FSIS decided to obtain the information and data necessary to pursue the development of amendments to the Federal poultry products inspection regulations to define and standardize, or establish other requirements for poultry products produced by mechanical separation, including possible provisions for the composition, characteristics, and use of such products, and requirements for manufacturing and labeling such products. On March 3, 1994, FSIS published another ANPR (59 FR 10230) which solicited comments and information from the meat and poultry industries and industry-related organizations, the scientific community, academia, consumers and consumer groups, and other interested parties on its tentative positions regarding poultry products produced by mechanical separation and products in which such poultry products are used. In the March 1994 ANPR, FSIS considered, among other things, that certain poultry products produced by mechanical separation, i.e., those with greater than 0.6 percent bone solids content, but no more than 1 percent bone solids content be separately identified on the labels of products in which they are used as ingredients by a distinct name. However, because of the improvements in separating the bone from muscle and other tissues of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses, FSIS considered that some poultry products derived from mechanical separation machinery, i.e., those with 0.6 percent or less bone solids, be identified on the label of products in which they are used as poultry or poultry meat, e.g., ``chicken'' and ``turkey meat.'' VI. Discussion of Comments on March 1994 ANPR FSIS received 106 comments in response to the March 1994 ANPR. Fifty-one comments were submitted by food manufacturers/distributors, 44 comments by consumers, 7 by trade associations, 2 by academia, 1 by a law firm, and 1 by a developer of machinery. The majority of the comments did not support the ANPR. The comments are summarized below. A. Bone Solids Content and Labeling. According to the tentative positions presented in the March 1994 ANPR, the tentative provisions for poultry product produced by mechanical separation would classify or ``categorize'' such product by bone solids content (as measured by calcium content). Mechanically separated poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids content would be termed ``(Kind)'' or ``(Kind) meat,'' where ``kind'' refers to chicken or turkey. Mechanically separated poultry with greater than 0.6 percent bone solids content (but not greater than 1 percent) would be termed ``Mechanically Separated (Kind).''
