Soyuz was to deliver a new crew, Yuriy Malenchenko and Talgat Musabayev, to the orbit station Mir. Commenting on the statement, the head of the manned flights and carriers department of the Russian Space Agency, Mikhail Sinelschikov, told Interfax that "an official decision had not yet been made, but the postponement may be caused by production problems concerning the manufacturing of a shield for Soyuz TM-19." According to unofficial sources, the launch will take place no earlier than July 20 1994. Malenchenko and Musabayev will work on the manned orbit complex Mir for 135 days as the main crew of the 16th expedition.
