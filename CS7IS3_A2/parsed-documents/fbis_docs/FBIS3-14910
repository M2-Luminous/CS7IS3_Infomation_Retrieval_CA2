The latest reports from the NKR indicate that the situation along the front line is tense. Regardless of the many casualties they have suffered, the Azerbaijan National Army [ANA] units have maintained their intermittent attacks in various parts of the front line. A report we received from the NKR Defense Army Press Service a short time ago said that the situation in a large part of NKR's front line was relatively peaceful last night and this morning, that is after the violent clashes in the southeastern sector yesterday. Only intermittent positional fighting took place in various areas. The NKR defense forces destroyed three armored vehicles and dozens of ANA soldiers. One of the NKR freedom fighters was killed and eight others were wounded. The NKR intelligence units have established that Azerbaijan is massing reinforcements and armored vehicles in the eastern sector of the front line. Several newspapers in Moscow have quoted the Azerbaijan mass media organs as saying that the NKR Defense Army Headquarters has established additional punitive units. The reports said that the punitive units have been assigned to prevent the retreat of the Armenian troops. S. Oganyan, chief of the NKR General Staff, has disclosed that only NKR's disclosures represent the true state of affairs. Oganyan asserted that the NKR has not felt the need to organize punitive units since the NKR military forces were established. However, such units have been used in Azerbaijan to fire on the retreating Azerbaijani military forces. It is no coincidence that Azerbaijan's military servicemen prefer to surrender to the Armenian forces to avoid being fired on by those units. Some 60 officers and men have surrendered to the NKR defense forces during the past two months. Citizens of several foreign countries were among them. The relatively peaceful situation on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan during the past week, has been disrupted once again. The Armenian Ministry of Defense Press Service has disclosed that the defense positions around Berkaber and Kirants in Armenia's Idzhevanskiy Rayon were fired on from Azerbaijan with various types of arms on 24 February. Armenia's border guards took retaliatory measures. No one was hurt on the Armenian side. The occasional provocative activities in Azerbaijan do not allow the establishment of peace and security on the border.
