"The recent crackdown on the Osaka and Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon was a fascist outrage designed to totally suppress Chongnyon, part of their premeditated anti-DPRK moves encouraged by the U.S. manoeuvres to isolate and stifle the DPRK over its fictitious `nuclear issue', and a grave challenge to the DPRK, an independent and sovereign state," the statement says, and goes on: "The Central Guidance Committee of the Korean Chondoist Association sternly denounces the Japanese police outrages in the name of the entire Chondoists of the DPRK, branding them as rash acts of murderers, fascist maniacs to commit a second Kanto massacre. "We will consider any suppression of Chongnyon to be an encroachment on the dignity and sovereignty of our republic and decisively counter it. "If the Japanese authorities persist in their crackdown on Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, they would be held wholly responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom." The statement expresses the hope that the South Korean Chondoists and Tangun Taejonggyo believers too would turn out in the struggle to defend the dignity of their resourceful nation and check the Japanese reactionaries' suppression of Koreans in Japan.
