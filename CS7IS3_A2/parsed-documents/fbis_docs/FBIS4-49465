After satisfactorily concluding his visit to four countries in Central Asia and Mongolia, Premier Li Peng conducted a work inspection of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region from 30 April to 3 May. Accompanied by Wang Qun, autonomous regional party committee secretary, and Wuliji, autonomous regional people's government chairman, Premier Li Peng zestfully inspected factories, enterprises, microwave communications equipment, and a large power plant under construction in the vicinity of a coal pit; visited the mausoleum of Chengjisihan [Genghis Khan] despite rains; and called on herdsmen at their homes. Li Peng inspected the Qingsong Garment Co., Ltd. He was very pleased when he learned that the Western-style clothing produced by the company had won a leading place in a contest between China's top 10 famous brands of Western-style clothing held in April 1994 and that it had been exported in large quantities. He said: "The fact that the Qingsong Garment Co., Ltd. can produce such good Western-style clothing shows that remote, border areas, like those in the hinterland, are capable of turning out first-rate products as long as they gear their production to the needs of the market at home and abroad and as long as they adopt advanced technology and management." Li Peng also inspected the Hohhot Machine Tool Accessories Plant. It is an old state-owned enterprise and is currently China's largest chuck-producing plant and largest chuck research and development center. The annual output of the Huanqiu- [universal] brand chuck with three and four claws and various power-driven chucks in the high- and medium-price r!nges accounts for 60 percent of the total chuck output in China; their products are sold to over 40 countries and regions of the world and have won several awards at home and abroad. After inspecting the plant's workshop, Li Peng said: "Why can the plant always maintain very good economic efficiency? The key lies in a good mechanism, specialized mass production, strict management, paying attention to quality, and establishing a business reputation on the market at home and abroad. It shows we also can successfully run the large and medium old enterprises owned by the state." He expressed the hope that the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region can successfully sum up the experiences gained by the plant. At a television conference room of the Inner Mongolia Radio and Television Station, Premier Li Peng had a teleconference meeting with leading comrades of 12 leagues and cities and listened to the work reports made by some leagues and cities. Li Peng affirmed the tremendous progress made by the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region in all fields of endeavor and conveyed his warm regards to the broad masses of servicemen and people who had recently put out a forest fire. He praised the teleconference, saying: Holding a teleconference not only saves time and money but also improves work efficiency. It marks a big step toward the modernization of office work. On the morning of 3 May, Li Peng listened to work reports by leading comrades of the autonomous regional party committee and government. First of all, he affirmed the important successes attained by the people of all nationalities in the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region in promoting reform, opening up, and economic construction under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Li Peng said: I have visited Inner Mongolia six times and have witnessed the tremendous changes taking place in the region since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. Inner Mongolia faced grain shortage in the past; now it is more than self-sufficient in its grain supply. This represents a remarkable success. Its animal husbandry has also enjoyed very great development. The Baotou Steel and Iron Corporation steel works has increased its annual output of steel from 1 million-plus tonnes in 1989 to 3 million tonnes now. Taking advantage of its abundant coal resources to build large power plants in the vicinity of coal pits, Inner Mongolia not only solved the problem of an electricity shortage but also supplied greater amounts of electricity to the power grid for Beijing, Tianjin, and Tanggu. He pointed out: Changing coal deliveries to electricity transmission is a strategic shift in Inner Mongolia's economy. Li Peng said he was very pleased to see that Inner Mongolia is enjoying political stability, unity between nationalities, and economic development, and that these have improved the people's living standards. Touching on Inner Mongolia's economic work, Li Peng stressed that it is necessary to further do a good job of promoting agricultural and animal husbandry production. As China's population grows, its demand for grain will further increase. First, we must transform medium- and low-yield farmland to increase the per mu yield; and, second, we must expand the area of cultivated land in areas where conditions permit. Inner Mongolia has potential in this field. It is hoped that Inner Mongolia will become a base for the commercial production of agriculture and animal husbandry. Because Inner Mongolia boasts a relatively large proportion of state-owned heavy industries, his speech required that vigorous efforts be made to successfully run the large and medium enterprises owned by the state, to conscientiously analyze their situations, and to find concrete solutions to their existing problems. We must be confident that we are capable of managing well medium and large state-owned enterprises. In fact, many medium and large state-owned enterprises in Inner Mongolia are functioning quite well, and we need to summarize and popularize these enterprises' experiences. However, for various reasons, quite a few enterprises in Inner Mongolia are encountering difficulties in their operations. The autonomous regional government is responsible for helping them. Enterprises must depend on themselves as well and make efforts to transform their operating mechanisms to gradually extricate themselves from their predicaments. Inner Mongolia is blessed with rich natural resources. As Inner Mongolia's economy develops, its strong point in natural resources is playing a more and more important role in economic development. Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and with the concerted efforts of ethnic cadres and masses, there is a great hope that Inner Mongolia will vigorously develop its economy. Li Peng stressed: People of various nationalities in Inner Mongolia are united. China is a multinational country, and unity between all nationalities is a very important prerequisite for our efforts in all fields. I hope that the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region will further cultivate the favorable state of unity between nationalities to make all peoples prosperous. In accompanying Premier Li Peng in inspecting Inner Mongolia, Ismail Amat, state councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, said after hearing the work reports: People of all nationalities in China are equal and united. They cooperate with one another and make progress together. In view of the protracted and complicated nature of ethnic problems, we must always attach great importance to maintaining unity between all nationalities to create favorable social environment for China's reform, opening up, and economic construction. He added emphatically: To strengthen national unity, we must fully depend on cadres and masses of all nationalities. People of all nationalities must consider safeguarding the reunification of the motherland and national unity as citizens' legal and moral duty. We must promptly and efficiently resolve inner contradictions between people of all nat)onalities accordi.g to the law. Cadres of all nationalities at various levels must take the lead in safeguarding the reunification of the motherland and unity between all nationalities. We must vigorously develop the economy and social undertakings in regions inhabited by minority peoples to continuously strengthen the economic foundation for unity of all nationalities. While inspecting Inner Mongolia, Premier Li Peng was also accompanied by Ye Qing, Han Shubin, Yao Zhenyan, Wang Mengkui, and Jiang Yunbao, who are responsible persons from relevant departments of the State Council.
