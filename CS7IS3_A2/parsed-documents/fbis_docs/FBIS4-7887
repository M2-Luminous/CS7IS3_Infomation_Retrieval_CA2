At a news conference this evening, Mr. Claes expressed satisfaction with the talks. Following his session with Foreign Minister Daskalov, Mr. Claes told reporters that the two sides hold similar views on the prospects of Bulgarian-Belgian contacts. He called attention to the exchanged visits by the two countries' chiefs of General Staff. Members of the Royal Institute for Defence Studies will shortly visit Bulgaria. Mr. Claes sees this as an indication of possible agreements in the field of defence. A number of Belgian companies, especially in food processing, agriculture and tourism, might show interest in investing in Bulgaria, the chief Belgian diplomat believes. He recommended that the Bulgarian Government launch structural changes and promised his Bulgarian counterpart that the Belgian Government would provide the necessary financing guarantees to catalyze investment. Encouragement of Belgian investment here was discussed by Mr. Claes with President Zhelev. The two found that there is a fine legal framework for an increase of Belgian investment in Bulgaria and a pick-up of commercial relations. In a couple of months, the Belgian Minister of Agriculture will visit Bulgaria. A bilateral accord may be signed during that visit. Mr. Claes told Acting Prime Minister Matinchev that by mid-May the ratification process of Bulgaria's Europe agreements will receive a fresh impetus. In April, the G-24 will consider Bulgaria's embargo-related losses. Mr. Claes expressed his conviction that the Bulgarian foreign debt problem will be settled soon and undertook personally to assist the negotiations with the London and Paris Clubs. The debt problem was also on the agenda of Mr. Claes's session with National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, who found that the only dispute between Bulgaria and Belgium was the Bulgarian debt to Belgian commercial banks. Mr. Yordanov set forth the Bulgarian position on the Yugocrisis. "On this matter, we have no differences whatsoever with the Belgians," he told reporters. The Bulgarian head of parliament appreciated Belgium's assistance to the entry into force of the Bulgarian-EC Interim Trade Agreement and expressed the hope that Belgium will help speed up Bulgaria's association with the European Union. "We count on the Belgian Parliament for an early ratification of the agreement," Mr. Yordanov said. Bulgaria's integration into the European Community was the centrepiece of the talks between Mr. Claes and President Zhelyu Zhelev. The president's foreign policy adviser said that Dr. Zhelev expressed the hope that Belgium will support Bulgaria in its efforts to acquire an enhanced status in the Western European Union and its integration into NATO. Dr. Zhelev and Mr. Claes also discussed the situation in the Balkans and the Yugocrisis. The guest lauded Bulgaria's position which upholds the balance and is in a position to prevent extremes in the behaviour of various forces in the Balkans, the Presidential adviser emphasized.
