He paid a short working visit to Bonn. It was his first visit to Germany as the chief of Polish diplomacy. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said he had made a deliberate decision to invite Minister Olechowski to visit Bonn as the first foreign guest of the New Year. During the meeting the following topics were discussed: Poland's efforts to join the European Union, the Western European Union, as well as NATO -- these constitute a block of issues linked with creating European security. Minister Kinkel said during a press conference that Germany will continue to be an advocate of the Polish cause in Europe. "It is obvious," Kinkel said, "that Poland should want to leave the security grey area through its integration with NATO and with the remaining organizations of European security." According to the German foreign minister, during the NATO summit on 10 January fundamental decisions will be made concerning the opening up of NATO to the East, but it will not be possible for new countries to join the Alliance in the nearest future. Decisions will be made during the summit on coming to some agreements, but these agreements will not contain ally-type commitments. But Minister Kinkel thinks that closer cooperation between Poland and NATO will be possible; this could be -- among others -- joint military maneuvers or joint peace missions. Polish public opinion has high expectations in connection with the NATO summit. "Poland wants to be a member of the Western family of countries," Minister Olechowski said, "which also means being a member of the European Union and of NATO. It will not happen tomorrow but it is our desire to have a clear and specific prospect opened up before us. Apart from Poland itself and the NATO members, nobody can decide whether we should join the Alliance or not," Minister Olechowski also stressed. That statement corresponded to one made by Minister Kinkel. When replying to a question asked by a German journalist, Minister Kinkel recalled that during talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev he pointed out that Russia has not had the right of veto in NATO nor will it ever have it in the future, but at the same time he assured Kozyrev that Russia's sensitivity will be taken into account. The Germans are in favor of NATO adopting the kind of solution that would take into account the interests of both the countries of Central Europe and of Russia. Minister Kinkel did not talk about "Partnership for Peace." Only Minister Olechowski mentioned it by pointing out that Poland expects the kind of partnership that would not mean giving up full membership in the future. "We can be satisfied with that part of the talks," Minister Olechowski said, and he suggested that Poland also take part in providing assistance to Russia and other eastern neighbors. The Polish and German foreign ministers also discussed bilateral relations of our two countries, but -- as Minister Kinkel said -- they are so close that there are no major differences of opinions.
