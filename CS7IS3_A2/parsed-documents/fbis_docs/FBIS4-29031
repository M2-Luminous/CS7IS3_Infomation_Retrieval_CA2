Speaking at a meeting of Democratic Liberal Party lawmakers and local chapter chairmen, Yi said North Korea had completed war preparations by July 27, 1993, stockpiling military supplies and expanding and strengthening underground facilities after forming a separate war preparation command. Yi said, however, there were no particular signs of North Korean military movements related to possible provocation at present. The government is strengthening the country's military preparedness in stages while drawing up joint defense strategy with the U.S. Forces, Yi said. He also said that North Korea is believed to have extracted enough plutonium to make one or two nuclear weapons. Although it is not certain if the North has a complete nuclear bomb, he said he could not rule out the possibility of Pyongyang having developed a primitive explosive device. With regard to military cooperation between the United States and South Korea in case of North Korean provocation, Yi said he and his U.S. counterpart are in constant contact through a hot line. Moreover, he said the two countries are ready to hold urgent security and military conferences in times of emergency.
