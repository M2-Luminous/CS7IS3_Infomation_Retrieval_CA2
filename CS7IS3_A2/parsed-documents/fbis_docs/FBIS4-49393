The exhibition was sponsored by such units as the provincial party committee's propaganda department, with the help of the provincial museum and Chongqing's Keleshan Cemetery for Revolutionary Martyrs. The exhibition displays 300 or so copies of photos, and close to 100 precious historical relics. These things left behind by history show the past facts of the heroic struggle carried out by the proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation in order to make the Chinese revolution a success, as well as the monstrous crimes committed by Chinese and foreign reactionaries in the concentration camp. These vivid, lively, and moving exhibits are lively material with which to conduct education in patriotism, and will play a positive role in training youngsters to love the motherland, will foster lofty ideals, and will enrich the building of socialist spiritual civilization. At the ceremony, more than 4,000 persons viewed the exhibition, including party, government, and Army leaders from the province and cities; officers and men of the People's Liberation Army and armed police; and pupils from Xining's (Xiacheng) and (Beiguan) district primary schools.
