At the Prime Minister's Office, Hosokawa told reporters: "I think the meeting is wrong. Since coalition parties have agreed to pick (the next prime minister) at the party representatives meeting [attended by party secretaries general], the meeting of party heads should be held after that. The coalition will not be able to reach an accord if the top-level meeting comes first."
