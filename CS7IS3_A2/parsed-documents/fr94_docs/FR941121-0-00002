FR941121-0-00002 FR941121-0-00001 NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION 12 CFR Part 707 Truth in Savings AGENCY: National Credit Union Administration. ACTION: Final rule; interpretation. SUMMARY: The NCUA Board is publishing its official staff commentary to Part 707 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations (Truth in Savings). The commentary applies and interprets the requirements of Part 707 and is a substitute for individual staff interpretations. The commentary incorporates much of the guidance provided when the regulation was adopted, and addresses additional questions that have been raised about the application of its requirements. In addition, the Board is implementing a provision of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, exempting accounts of unincorporated business associations from coverage of Part 707. A minor housekeeping amendment is also made to Part 707. DATES: This document is effective on January 1, 1995. Compliance with Appendix C to Part 707 is optional until May 22, 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: (1) Background The purpose of the Truth in Savings Act (``TISA'') (12 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.) is to assist members in comparing share and deposit accounts offered by credit unions and other depository institutions. TISA requires credit unions to disclose fees, the dividend or interest rate, the annual percentage yield, and other account terms whenever a member requests the information and before an account is opened. Fees and other information also must be provided on any periodic statement the credit union sends to the member. Rules are set forth for share and deposit account advertisements and advance notices to account holders of adverse changes in terms. TISA restricts how credit unions must determine the account balance on which dividends or interest are calculated. TISA is implemented by part 707 of the NCUA's Rules and Regulations (``part 707'') (12 CFR part 707), which becomes effective on January 1, 1995, for most credit unions. TISA authorizes the issuance of official staff interpretations of the regulation. (2) Rule Amendments The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, included a provision amending TISA. The amendment changes the definition of account: (1) Account._The term ``account'' means any account intended for use by and generally used by consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes that is offered by a depository institution into which a consumer deposits funds, including demand accounts, time accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, and share draft accounts. 12 U.S.C. 4313(1). The Conference Report to the Act clarifies the intent of this amendment: Section 332 defines the term ``account'' for purposes of [TISA] as an account used by consumers primarily for personal, family, or household use. The Conferees intend this section to provide a business purpose exemption similar to that provided in the Truth in Lending Act. Under this provision, accounts of unincorporated businesses (i.e., generally, non-profit entities) are exempt from coverage under [TISA]. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103&hyph;652, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 179 (1994). In order to implement the letter and intent of this new legislation, the Board is amending the definitions of the terms ``account'' (707.2(a)) and ``member'' (7072(q)) in Part 707, as well as other relevant references to unincorporated association accounts (Proposed Commentary, comment 2(a)&hyph;3 has been removed from the final commentary). The FRB has already adopted similar changes to Regulation DD. 59 FR 52657 (October 19, 1994). In addition, a typographical error has been removed from section 707.6(b)(3). The redundant phrase ``dollar amounts of the'' has been removed; so that the sentence now reads: ``The fees shall be itemized by type and dollar amounts.'' The Board is adopting these rule amendments without notice and comment. The Administrative Procedure Act provides that notice and opportunity for public comment are not required if the Board finds that notice and public comment are unnecessary or would be contrary to the public interest. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). The Board believes such a finding is appropriate in this case. The Congress has eliminated a class of accounts from Truth in Savings coverage, and the amendments merely make that change. In light of the Congress' action, the Board has no discretion with regard to the regulatory change; which is required by law and essentially ministerial. The other amendment removes a confusing redundancy in the rule. These amendments are technical in nature and not subject to interpretation. For these reasons, the Board has determined that publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and providing opportunity for public comment for the following amendments is unnecessary and would be contrary to the public interest.
