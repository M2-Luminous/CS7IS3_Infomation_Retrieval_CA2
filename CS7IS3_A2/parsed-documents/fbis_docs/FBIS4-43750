Butrus-Ghali's biased, aggressive, and blackmailing report to the UN Security Council is fresh confirmation of that painful reality. Meanwhile, the European Union [EU], which wants to have a say on the Cyprus problem, has moved to find a way to benefit from the UN officials' failure to resolve the Cyprus problem. EU officials believe that "since the United Nations has been unable to resolve the problem during the past 30 years, then the EU should move into action." Obviously, the EU approach on the Cyprus problem will be similar to the approach the UN organization has maintained thus far. Consequently, it will be unsuccessful, at least as much as that organization has been. However, finding a realistic solution to the problem is not their objective. Therefore, what difference would it make if the UN organization or the EU wastes time on it? After all, their objective is similar: To completely Hellenize the island by forcing the Turkish Cypriots to agree to having minority rights. The way that objective is to be achieved has come into light. The security and the communal and sovereignty rights of the Turkish Cypriots will be ignored and Cyprus will be admitted to the EU as a member. In other words, the integration between Greece and Cyprus will be realized within the EU framework. Considering all that, we can regard Butrus Butrus-Ghali's latest report as an indication of the UN organization's inclination to withdraw and leave the EU in the arena. If we have realized the design behind admitting Cyprus into the EU in Turkey's absence, then we should not ignore the fact that we have to make a historic assessment. That the process of admitting Cyprus into the EU as a member will begin on 1 January 1995 is a strong possibility. Apparently, plans are being drawn up with that date in mind. Therefore, we have to work with Turkey to decide on new alternatives. In fact, we are running out of time for that.
