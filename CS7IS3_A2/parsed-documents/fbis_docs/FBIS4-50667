Li made the call when meeting here today with Willy Claes, Belgian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, on Sino-European and Belgian relations. The European Union (EU) still has some restrictions on Sino-European relations which is incompatible with present needs, Li said, these restrictions should be abolished. Li expressed Chinese belief that Sino-European relations would develop smoothly if the two sides carry out the principles of seeking common ground while reserving differences, respecting, non-interference of each other's internal affairs and peaceful mutual benefit. Showing his understanding on Li's viewpoint, Claes said that the EU should adopt a positive attitude towards China, relaxing its restrictions to China on trade and economy and opening to the country. Li also said that the Chinese Government attaches importance in developing long-standing, equal and mutually beneficial relations with West European countries and that those relations are good on the whole. He stressed that both sides share the same or similar views on essential international affairs, the economic base for cooperation is concrete and the future for development is tremendous. Chairman Li said that Sino-Belgian trade and economic relations have been increasing in recent years. The healthy and fast pace of China's national economy with its big market and advanced technology, equipment and funds from Belgium offers great cooperation potential and a bright future for trade and economic cooperation of the two countries, he added. Li expressed China's willingness in making joint efforts with Belgian parties to promote mutually-beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Claes said the trade and economic cooperation between Belgium and China are satisfactory and Belgium has a strong wish to develop more relations with China. He added, Belgium will take new measures to expand trade and economic exchanges with the country and I believe the chairman's visit will influence positively the understanding and cooperations between Belgium and China. Freddy Thilemans, the mayor of Brussels, hosted a welcome ceremony this afternoon for Chairman Li, who is on the last leg of a five-nation European tour, which has already taken him to Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.
