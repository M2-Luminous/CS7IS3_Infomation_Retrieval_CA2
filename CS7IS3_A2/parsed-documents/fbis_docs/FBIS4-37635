FBIS4-37635 "drnes121_v_94002" FBIS-NES-94-121 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 Pakistan Foreign Minister Proposes Afghan Solution Foreign Minister Proposes Afghan Solution 94AE0135A London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 17 Jun 94 p 1 94AE0135A London AL-HAYAH Arabic CSO [Report by Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan and Ra'fit Yahya from Islamabad and by 'Abdallah al-Haj from Jeddah: "Pakistan Foreign Minister to Saudi Arabia With Proposal on Afghan Crisis"] [Text] Developments on the Afghan front accelerated yesterday, on the eve of the end of President Borhanoddin Rabbani's term. Pakistan has undertaken a new initiative to prevent a likely deterioration in the situation, now that opponents to Rabbani have threatened to launch a new campaign to isolate him should he insist upon retaining his position after the 28th of this month. Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali arrives in Saudi Arabia today for talks on this subject with Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal. In a major parallel development, Afghani Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar held a meeting yesterday at his office south of Kabul, with the ruler of the province of Herat, Esma'il Khan, after which the two sides agreed to launch an initiative to form a government of national unity within 12 days of the end of the Afghani president's term. Ismail Khan left in the evening for the capital to meet with Rabbani and to inform him of the initiative that would open the major roads to Kabul after verifying a ceasefire in its suburbs. Informed sources in Islamabad report that the initiative of Ismail Khan, well-known for his impartiality, which has dispelled the specter of war from his regions, enjoys Pakistani support. The initiative stipulates the participation of all the mojahedin parties in the interim government, which will organize general elections as early as possible and disqualify the (formerly communist) militias from the new formula for governing. Moderate Afghani sources did not rule out that the Pakistani foreign minister would show his support for the initiative, especially as Hekmatyar is a party to it, because of the support Islamabad still provides him. Afghani sources indicated the importance of the position stated by the Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Akram Zaki, who emphasized the need for the Afghani president to stick to the agreement, in terms of the duration of his term, especially as the countries affected by the Afghani situation have backed the agreement. Informed sources in Islamabad have told AL-HAYAH that the Pakistani minister will bring this subject up for discussion in his meeting with Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal. The same sources added that the Pakistani minister would emphasize, in the meeting with his Saudi counterpart, Islamabad's insistence that all Saudi and Islamic humanitarian aid to Afganistan be routed through its Pakistan's territory. They thought it likely that this position would be the focus of debate among Afghani ranks, especially as Afghan officials believe that Kabul and Herat are capable of taking delivery of the aid from the Muslim world. Officials believe that the direct delivery of aid to Afghanistan will be of help in the speed and distribution to the needy, and in helping it to reach specific sites. The Pakistani minister will discuss the efforts being made to achieve total reconciliation among the mojahedin leaders, with the officials he will meet in Saudi Arabia. Afghani Government sources told AL-HAYAH that Saudi Arabia is inclined to expand the framework of participation for Afghan leaders in decisions to ensure its implementation. At the same time, Pakistan still sees Hekmatyar as the major player, and perhaps the only one, on the Afghan scene. This has influenced the positions of numerous Muslim countries who criticize the imposition of certain figures on the Afghan scene. The fear of observers in a number of capitals affected by the Afghan question is that Pakistan will go too far in its pressure on Rabbani and its support for Hekmatyar, particularly if Ismail Khan fails to persuade the Afghani president to accept what the ruler of Herat and prime minister have agreed to. An informed Pakistani source told AL-HAYAH that the possibility for holding a peace conference in Islamabad, and the formation of a transitional government in Kabul, would be among the 10 points the Pakistani foreign minister would discuss with Saudi officials. The source said that the proposed peace conference would be along the lines of the Islamabad conference held in March of last year. The same source indicated that the Pakistani proposal was the same one Hekmatyar had advanced in a press conference held in Jalalabad (eastern Afghanistan) last Friday [10 June], and said it was a means for finding a comprehensive solution to the Afghan question. Not Comfortable The Pakistani source reaffirmed that his country is not comfortable with the Afghani president's position, that he would remain in power until the end of this year, according to resolutions adopted by a local consultative council held at his invitation two years ago. In the press conference the day before yesterday, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman indicated that the Pakistani foreign minister would go to Jeddah to meet with the secretary general of the Islamic Conference Organization, Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid, to discuss the Pakistani proposals, and would then proceed to Iran with the same purpose.
