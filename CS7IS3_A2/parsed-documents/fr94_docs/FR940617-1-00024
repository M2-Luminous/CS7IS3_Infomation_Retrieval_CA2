FR940617-1-00024 FR940617-1-00009 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 22 [CC Docket No. 92&hyph;115; FCC 94&hyph;102] Public Mobile Services AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Communications Commission proposes further revisions to its rules governing the Public Mobile Services. The proposed further revisions are necessary to update these rules. The intent of this proposal is to eliminate unnecessary information collection requirements, streamline licensing procedures, reduce the processing and review burden on the Commission's staff, and ensure that licensees in the public mobile services are fully qualified to provide service to the public as expeditiously as possible. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before June 20, 1994. Reply comments must be submitted on or before July 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Address written comments to: Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Leila Brown, 202&hyph;632&hyph;6450 or Dan Abeyta, 202&hyph;632&hyph;6450. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Summary of the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking The following is a summary of the Commission's further notice of proposed rulemaking in CC Docket No. 92&hyph;115, adopted April 20, 1994 and released May 20, 1994. The full texts of all Commission decisions are available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Docket Branch (room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC. The complete text of this decision may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Services, (202) 857&hyph;3800, 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037. 1. In this Further Notice, the Federal Communications Commission proposes further revisions to 47 CFR part 22. The rules in part 22 govern the Public Mobile Services. These revisions are proposed in order to eliminate unnecessary information collection requirements, streamline licensing procedures, reduce the processing and review burden on the Commission's staff, and ensure that licensees in the public mobile services are fully qualified to provide service to the public as expeditiously as possible. 2. On May 14, 1992, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the docket 57 FR 29260, July 1, 1992 proposing comprehensive revisions to part 22. Prior to adoption of a Report and Order in this proceeding, Congress enacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act) which amends section 3(n) and section 332 of the Communications Act. The Budget Act creates a comprehensive regulatory framework for all mobile radio services, including existing part 22 common carrier mobile services, private land mobile services, and future services. Because of the broad statutory changes that affect the regulation of mobile services, action on the part 22 revision was deferred. The proposals adopted in the further notice augment those proposals adopted in the notice. 3. We propose to require licensees notifying the Commission of minor modifications to their systems on FCC Form 489, which include Service Area Boundary (SAB) extensions into the adjacent market, to specify whether the 5 year fill-in period for the market has expired and, if so, to state that the SAB extension does not cover any unserved area. Current rules allow a cellular licensee to expand its SAB into an adjacent cellular service territory pursuant to a written agreement with the latter licensee. A licensee is permitted to expand its SAB into an adjacent cellular geographic service area (CGSA) at any time and may extend into an adjacent metropolitan service area or a rural service area provided the 5 year fill-in period has not expired. Many of the contracts included with FCC Forms 489 that notify the Commission of such minor modifications simply acknowledge a licensee's permission to allow a SAB extension into its market, even when the 5 year fill-in period has expired. In these cases, the staff must devote a significant amount of time to determine if the SAB extension covers any unserved area, because licensees may apply to serve such area only by filing a separate application with the Commission. 4. We propose to revise the scale of the maps required to be filed by the Commission's rules from 1:250,000 to 1:500,000. We believe that reducing the map scale would serve the public interest by reducing both filing burdens on applicants as well as review burdens on the staff. 5. We propose to modify the rules to allow cellular licensees to make minor changes to their facilities and to add transmitters within the contours of authorized stations without seeking prior approval or notifying the Commission of such changes. If we adopt this proposal, we plan to eliminate the listing of internal cell sites on our authorizations for existing licensees. However, we intend to maintain accurate, current information regarding the cell sites that constitute a system's CGSA boundary_i.e., the external cell sites. Therefore, we propose to require all cellular licenses to submit the following information for each of their external cell sites: (1) The geographic coordinates and cell site location description as required in Item 27 on Schedule B of FCC Form 401 and (2) the operating and technical parameters for the cell site which is currently required in Table MOB 2 and Table MOB 3 of FCC Form 401. This is a one time filing that would assist the staff in updating the Commission's database systems. 6. We propose to modify the information that licensees must submit pursuant to rule ยง22.925 of the Commission's rules. First, consistent with the proposal to revise the map scale, we propose to revise the scale of the full-size map to a scale of 1:500,000. Second, we propose to require that all maps submitted pursuant to this rule show only the exterior cell sites and their respective service area boundaries that make up the CGSA. Third, we propose to require licensees to include an exhibit providing the coordinates for each exterior cell site and the information currently required in the MOB 3 Table of FCC Form 401. Fourth, we propose to eliminate the requirement that licensees submit a frequency utilization plan or chart. Fifth, we propose to require licensees to label all System Information Update maps with specific language explaining which carrier is filing the map and for which market.
