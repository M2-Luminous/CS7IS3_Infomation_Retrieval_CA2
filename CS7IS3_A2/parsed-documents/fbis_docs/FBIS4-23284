SAPU said in statement the unilateral decision followed media statements by minister of safety and security Mr Sydney Mufamadi that he would meet police unions to thrash out issues of salaries and benefits. The union criticised the medical aid schemes' decision as "arrogance of the worst kind". According to SAPU it would embark on action which would have a serious effect on the medical aid schemes should the decision not be reversed. The reduction of benefits was "a slap in the face of SAPS employees" who were already financially disadvantaged. The statement said SAPU had already entered negotiations with other employee organisations, medical professionals and the SAPS on the issue.
