In the process, 14 people were killed, as Angelika Beer, a member of the party's Executive Committee, reported on Sunday [27 March] from Diyarbakir. A press release further says that the Turkish Government has done everything over the past few days to prevent foreign observers from watching the local elections in Kurdistan. The Greens called on the Federal Government to make it unambiguously clear to Ankara that any further cooperation is linked with observing human rights in Turkey. This, for its part, can currently mean only that all military and economic support must be ceased immediately.
