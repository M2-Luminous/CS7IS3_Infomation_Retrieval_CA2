FR940304-1-00145 FR940304-1-00014 5. Conclusion. Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard level 5 for amended direct heating equipment standards. Of the standard levels analyzed, level 5 will save the most energy per unit but, because of fuel switching from gas to electric, this level actually causes an energy increase of 0.23 quad between 1996 and 2030. In order to meet this standard, the Department assumes that all direct heating equipment will be condensing with induced draft and electronic ignition. This level produces increased life-cycle costs compared to the base case for all classes of product and has payback which exceed the average product life for all but two classes. Additionally, this level reduces manufacturer short-run return on equity from 7.4 percent in the base case to 0.9 percent and has a negative net present value of $1.1 billion. The Department therefore, concludes that the burdens of standard level 5 for direct heating equipment outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. The next most stringent standard level, level 4, is projected to have energy savings of 0.23 quad, but the savings here are also reduced by fuel switching. This level also produces life-cycle cost increases, compared to the base case, of $132 for the representative class, with similar increases for most classes. The payback at this level is 15.0 years for the representative class, equaling the average product life, with similar payback for most of the other classes. Additionally this level has a negative impact on the environment by increasing two of the three atmospheric emissions studied. The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 4 for direct heating equipment outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act_imposed 1990 standard for direct heating equipment with standard level 3. The Department concludes that standard level 3 for direct heating equipment saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible and economically justified. There would be a significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings are calculated to be 0.38 quad of primary energy and are essentially not affected by fuel switching. The standard could have a slight positive effect on the environment by reducing the emissions of NO 2 by more than 37,000 tons and SO 2 by almost 32,000 tons by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard is projected to reduce emissions of CO 2 by 26 million tons over the forecast period. The technology that is necessary to meet this standard: derated burners, electronic ignition, and burner box dampers or induced draft, is presently available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The consumer payback of this standard level is 7.5 years, approximately one-half of the average product life. This standard is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle cost of approximately $42. Additionally, the standard is expected to have little or no impact on the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 7.4 percent and has a net present value of $328 million. Since this standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors. d. Mobile Home Furnaces 1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed The Department examined a range of standard levels for mobile home furnaces. In reviewing the design options necessary to achieve those standard levels, the Department determined that a new energy descriptor was needed to adequately address some of the design options in the analysis because the current energy descriptor, annual fuel utilization factor, does not include electrical consumption. For example, to consider improvements in fan motor efficiency, the savings in electrical consumption would have to be accounted for in the descriptor. Furthermore, other design options (for instance, fan-assisted combustion) improve thermal efficiency but, at the same time, increase overall electrical consumption which, unless accounted for in the energy descriptor, could lead to higher annual fuel utilization factors with little or no net energy savings. Lastly, since annual fuel utilization factor is defined in the Act in terms of an isolated combustion system, there are steps that could be taken to obtain a higher annual fuel utilization factor, such as adding jacket insulation, which would have no impact on the efficiency of a furnace installed indoors. Since practically all mobile home furnaces are installed indoors, the current descriptor is not entirely appropriate for this rulemaking. Because of the above, the Department conducted the analysis, and is proposing the standards, in terms of a new energy descriptor, annual efficiency. The test procedure to determine this energy descriptor is contained in the previously mentioned Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Table 4&hyph;7 presents the six efficiency levels selected for analysis for the two classes of mobile home furnaces. Level 6 corresponds to the highest efficiency level, max tech, considered in the engineering analysis.
