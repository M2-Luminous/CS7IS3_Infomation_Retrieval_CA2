Following meetings of the CDU presidium and executive, Kohl said in Bonn this afternoon that the CDU and CSU have "reached an important stage." However, there are no grounds for sounding an all-clear. In the coming weeks and months, the CDU and CSU will have to fight for every vote, he stated. Kohl is also confident that the Free Democratic Party will again enter the new Bundestag.
