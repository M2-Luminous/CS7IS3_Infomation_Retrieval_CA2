FR940302-1-00027 FR940302-1-00012 Accordingly, 48 CFR parts 1815, 1837 and 1852 are proposed to be amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for 48 CFR parts 1815, 1837 and 1852 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 2473(c)(1). PART 1815_CONTRACTING BY NEGOTIATION 1815.608&hyph;72 [Added] 2. Section 1815.608&hyph;72 is added to read as follows: 1815.608&hyph;72 Uncompensated overtime. The contracting officer shall conduct a risk assessment of any proposal received for technical and professional services that includes low labor rates or uses a high level of uncompensated overtime (as defined in 1852.237&hyph;71) in key technical positions. Such practices on the part of the contractor may jeopardize its ability to successfully perform contract requirements due, for example, to its inability to hire or retain qualified personnel. Such a risk assessment shall be performed as part of the technical evaluation and considered in proposal evaluation (See (FAR) 48 CFR 22.11 and 1837.102(b)). PART 1837_SERVICE CONTRACTING 3. Part 1837 is amended as set forth below: 1837.102 [Added] a. Section 1837.102 is added to read as follows: 1837.102 Policy. (a) To the maximum extent practicable, it is the policy of NASA to acquire services on the basis of the task to be performed rather than on a labor-hour basis. (b) The use of uncompensated overtime (as defined in 1852.237&hyph;71) is neither encouraged nor discouraged. When the proposed uncompensated overtime is consistent with an offeror's written policies and practices, NASA will consider it in proposal evaluation and the evaluation of professional compensation (see (FAR) 48 CFR 22.11). 1837.110 [Amended] b. Section 1837.110 is revised to read as follows: 1837.110 Solicitation provisions and contract clauses. (a) The contracting officer shall obtain the Associate Administrator for Procurement's (Code HC) approval before using in a solicitation, contract, or negotiated contract modification for additional work any installation-developed clause involving pension portability. (b) When professional and technical services are acquired on the basis of the number of hours to be provided, rather than on the task to be performed, and the resulting contract is expected to exceed $500,000, the contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.237&hyph;72, Identification of Uncompensated Overtime, in the solicitation. Use of this provision is optional between $100,000 and $500,000. This provision requires offerors to identify uncompensated overtime hours and the effective hourly rate for all Fair Labor Standards Act-exempt personnel included in their proposals and subcontractor proposals. This includes uncompensated overtime hours that are in indirect cost pools for personnel whose regular hours are normally charged direct (see 1815.608&hyph;72). PART 1852_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES 4. Section 1852.237&hyph;72 is added to read as follows: 1852.237&hyph;71 Identification of Uncompensated Overtime. As prescribed in 1837.110(b), insert the following provision: Identification of Uncompensated Overtime (XXX 1993) (a) Definitions. As used in this provision: Uncompensated overtime means the hours worked in excess of an average of 40 hours per week, by direct charge employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) without additional compensation. Compensated personal absences, such as holidays, vacations, and sick leave shall be included in the normal work week for purposes of computing uncompensated overtime hours. Effective hourly rate is the rate which results from multiplying the hourly rate for a 40-hour work week by 40, and then dividing by the proposed hours per week. For example, 45 hours proposed on a 40-hour work week basis at $20.00 per hour would be converted to an effective hourly rate of $17.78 per hour [($20.00 x 40) divided by 45 = $17.78.]
