The negotiating delegations were led by Laszlo Kovacs for the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and Istvan Szent-Ivanyi for the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. There are no fundamental differences between the ideas of the two parties, Kovacs said. He added that the three main directions of foreign political activities -- Euratlantic integration, forming good-neighborly relations, and supporting the justified efforts of the Hungarian minorities living beyond the border -- are closely related and equally important, and they need to be handled in parallel with one another. It is especially important for Hungary to become part of the European Union [EU] as soon as possible and on the best possible conditions, Kovacs emphasized. Until membership is achieved, we have to make the most of the options provided by the Association Agreement, and we have to make use of the opportunities to develop the agreement and to amend it if necessary. However, this does not mean that the agreement will be renegotiated. He added that the talks on membership have to be started already in this parliamentary cycle, and then a referendum has to be called on the issue. The views of the two parties differ somewhat on the issue of NATO membership. The MSZP is in favor of holding a referendum on this issue after the talks on membership are completed. Although the SZDSZ would not oppose a referendum initiated by the public, it does not consider it absolutely necessary. Without normalizing relations with the neighboring countries, there is no chance of an improvement in the situation of Hungarians living there, and the establishment of good-neighborly relations is also important for Hungary's image and integration, Kovacs said. The document prepared by the experts committee makes special mention of Hungarian-Slovak and Hungarian-Romanian relations, and emphasizes the importance of the next government showing a willingness to have talks on the [bilateral] basic agreements. These agreements will have to contain a mutual renunciation of territorial demands, recognition of current borders, and obligations to respect national minority rights in accordance with the norms of the Council of Europe and the CSCE. The two parties agreed that it is the government's constitutional, political, and moral obligation to support the interests of Hungarians living beyond the border; this includes national minority rights, the economic development of Hungarians, and their local social self-organization. Szent-Ivanyi said that views on the Foreign Ministry's structure were not included in the committee's documents because this will be the responsibility of the party that runs this ministry. However, they agreed that it has become necessary to modernize the Foreign Ministry's structure, to reduce compartmenalization, increase the efficiency of the flow of information, and to rationalize its budget. If possible the ministry's staff has to be reduced. Talking about personnel policy, Szent-Ivanyi said that preference will be given to professional considerations and the Foreign Ministry will not have any kind of political cleanup. In reply to a question, Kovacs said that appointing the foreign minister or deciding whether the ministry should belong to a single party do not fall within the competence of the experts committee. He added that, in the committee's view, the structure of the Foreign Ministry will also have to reflect the tasks resulting from the changed governmental structure. In reply to our question, Szent-Ivanyi said that the SZDSZ is proposing the establishment of a ministry or office responsible for European affairs because, in the interest of Hungary's membership, it would be more favorable to concentrate the related issues in one hand. He added that it would be expedient also to jointly handle the issues of national minorities living over the border and within the country. Emphasizing that this was his personal view, Kovacs said that the assignment of the ambassadors is for two to six years. It will be a task for the new foreign minister to examine which ambassadors' work is absolutely necessary and to ask them to stay on if possible. In reaction to Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's remarks (regarding the resignation of Pal Tar, ambassador to the United States], Kovacs said that it is indeed a basic citizens' right to run in the elections on the Hungarian Democratic Forum's list, but to be an ambassador is not such a right; the two issues cannot be linked. It is doubtful that a person who had demonstrated his commitment to a foreign policy attitude based on a belief in historical mission and ideological antipathies and sympathies would be able to serve a foreign policy not based on these, Kovacs said. Talking about defense, Imre Mecs (SZDSZ) and Gyorgy Keleti (MSZP) said that they consider it essential to maintain armed forces that could guarantee the country's security. The committee considers it necessary to continue to reduce the size of the armed forces and to draw up a long-term development plan. The draft reform plan of the armed forces has to be submitted to Parliament in 1995. The experts committee would like to see rescinded the government decree that planned to unite the Defense Ministry and the Army headquarters.
