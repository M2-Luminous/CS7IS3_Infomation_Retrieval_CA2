L. 89&hyph;4, 79 Stat. 5); and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486). None of the authority comes from SMCRA. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 did not provide any funds to address coal output fires. AML funds can only be used to control or extinguish fires involving eligible abandoned mine land. Section 880.2␣(Redesignated 880.5) Definitions The definition of State was deleted as it limited States to those listed in section 403 of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965. Funds made available under the Act of August 31, 1954, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, can be used in any State or by Indian tribe. The definition for Local authorities was modified to make it clearer. A definition was added for Approved abandoned mine reclamation program stating it means a program meeting the requirements defined in Section 405 of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, as amended, and for two terms in the Act of August 31, 1954, Operating coal mine and Inactive coal mine, to relate them to terms in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, as amended. Project is defined as ``a project whose purpose is to control or extinguish fires in coal formations.'' No comments were received on this section. Section 880.3␣(Redesignated 880.11) Qualifications of Projects This section was revised to include the provision in the Act of August 31, 1954, that Federal funds cannot be used to fund projects to control or extinguish fires in coal formations in privately owned operating coal mines. It was also amended to provide that only projects funded by the Appalachian Regional Development Commission must be submitted by the State to the Commission and receive the approval of that body. This Commission has not funded such projects in many years. No comments were received on this section.
