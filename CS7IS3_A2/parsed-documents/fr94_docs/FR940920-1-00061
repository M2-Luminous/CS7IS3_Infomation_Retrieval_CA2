See combined limit. f Or 85 percent reduction. g The proposed NSPS does not include a combined limit for Hg and Cd; however, based on the individual limits, a combined limit is shown for comparison. h Based on periodic determination. i Cr, Cu, and Mn are abbreviations for chromium, copper, and manganese, respectively. j No combined limit specified. See individual Pb limit. k Or 95-percent reduction. Emissions measured by an annual stack test. l Based on a 7-day rolling average, measured continuously. m Or 80-percent reduction. Limit based on a 24-hour average, measured continuously. n No limit specified. o For mass burn/waterwall combustors. Based on a 4-hour average, measured continuously. p Based on an hourly average, measured continuously.
