They are confirming in practice the correctness of their scientific study that contradicted the opinion of the foreign company that surveyed the area for radioactivity in 1965 and declared it "devoid" of radioactivity indicating the presence of uranium ore. Amid nature's harshness and despite difficult conditions, they hope to build up a remote area that will change the facts of the region and Egypt's future in years not very distant. AKHIR SA'AH lived among them, observing the digging into the rocks for the sake of the future. Here is the report. Far From Offices: Egyptian Youth's Epic Struggle Although I was dead tired, I could find no justification for sleep. There was a yellow scorpion under my pillow, and a snake at the door of my room. But for a foreboding from what you might call a sixth sense (in reality it was only God's protection) and the alertness of an on-site technician who quickly dispatched the snake with a sharp instrument while his colleague hurried to bring some gasoline and a lighted match--had it not been for all these things, there would have been a different story to tell, as the sports commentators say. Even worse, we were in an area called Umm Ara, 180 km south of Aswan in the remotest part of Egypt's eastern desert, some distance from the place called Wadi al-'Allaqi. An experienced camel trader in Aswan told me that once a camel got across, it was perfectly safe. It was a burning furnace in the summer months. Circumstances in the Atomic Materials Agency had compelled us to go there to celebrate with them the beginnings of the first experimental mine to search for uranium in the southeastern desert. It was a mine with great promise. Having awaited the event for years, we agreed immediately, saying: "Heat passes, and no one dies of it." In our joy we gave no thought to scorpions and snakes until we actually confronted them. All our escorts had been completely silent about anything of the sort. On the other hand, after the two incidents, a flood of stories poured out so frightening to my photographer colleague and me that, until just before the return trip, we could hardly think of going into our rest house, even to get our things, without carefully inspecting our simple equipment. A 180-km trip would be simple with modern automobiles and paved roads. However, on a bumpy dirt track in the heart of the desert's harshness in perpetually dusty Zil cars that turned us into ghosts with eyes, it took about eight hours broken by a number of rest stops to help us endure the way. If you realize that there was no antivenin at the site where we were, what would our state be by the time we reached the hospitals of Aswan, if--God forbid--we were bitten? I did not succeed in calming myself for sleep by repeating to myself that I was not the most important visitor to the site and that two of Egypt's top nuclear power scientists were with us on the trip: Dr. Taha Sabah, former head of the Atomic Materials Agency, and Dr. 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Halim, head of the agency's research section and supervisor of its development departments. Not to mention that the least of the dust-caked young people staying at the site had the academic rank of assistant professor of atomic materials. All, without exception, counted as a valuable part of Egypt's scientific treasure, along with the other members of the camp--technicians, workers, and drivers. As we saw and experienced, they were working as hard as they could. Not only did they have expertise rarely found at many sites, but in their dedication to the job despite its small economic rewards they deserved to be esteemed and envied. While the dangers of the place frightened me during a two-night visit, they were the daily life of those staying at the camp and caused them no evident distress. Nor did the jokes of Dr. Ahmad Faruq, head of the southeastern desert department, and Dr. Sa'd-al-Din Mansur, head of the mission, succeed in bringing me out of the state of grumbling that overcame me as I sat by myself in the camp. The comment of one of the young geologists, that they all had children, made me again feel an embarrassment as a human being and journalist that attacks me whenever I journey to one of these harsh sites scattered throughout Egypt's deserts. Sadly, I suddenly realize how the frills of Cairo life have made me forget the reality of what I was seeing there--the effort, creativity, and dedication of outstanding university youths, graduates of the generation of the seventies, eighties, and even nineties, who had embarked on this difficult life. Results of Study Doubted Intuition was the main reason behind the discovery of this site. We had come to celebrate the blasting open of one shaft of the experimental mine, the first fruit of work that had already gone on for about 25 years. It all began about 1965, when the Canadian Hanting [name as transliterated] company started making a aerial radioactivity survey of the area south of Aswan as part of the regional planning project for the Lake Nasir area. A group of young Egyptian geologists assisted the company in carrying out the work. They were from the nuclear geology department of what was then called the Nuclear Power Agency, which later developed into the Atomic Materials Agency, and had been sent by presidential order because of their special competence in the field. The work at the time was organized so that an Egyptian geologist would accompany the airplane on its daily flight and then would take the tapes for examination, approval, and delivery to the foreign company the next morning. Apprehensive about the results of the aerial survey, the young Egyptians decided on their own, without informing the foreign company, to hand copy the aerial survey tapes. They spent long sleepless nights doing so. As they expected, the Canadian company's report stated that there were no radioactive anomalies in the area, and thus no probable presence of uranium ore. Rejecting this conclusion, the young geologists insisted on studying the copies they themselves had made and submitted doctoral dissertations based on them to prove what they deemed to be true. Their dissertations as well as ground survey parties proved this, and about 17 areas with radioactive anomalies came to light. These young people were: - Dr. Ahmad Abu-Bakr, now head of the exploration section of the Atomic Materials Agency; - Dr. Wafiq Musharraf, who became deputy chairman of the Petroleum Agency; and - Dr. Hamdi Sayf-al-Nasr, who became head of the electrical survey department of the exploration section of the Atomic Materials Agency. Because the result of the foreign company's radiation survey came out in 1967, when the work of exploration parties in the mountains had to be postponed due to war conditions, and because the doctoral dissertations took time to complete, real interest in the Umm Ara area started in 1975. A ground party was formed, including Dr. Ahmad 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Majid and Dr. Sa'd-al-Din Mansur. The work began with the submission of a master's dissertation on the area by Dr. Ahmad 'Abdallah (he also received his doctorate on the same area). These dissertations revealed that there really were radiation anomalies, and the men investigated the sites on the ground, locating them on maps so that detailed study of them could begin. Because the work of the Atomic Materials Agency in the mountains depends for its studies on academic theses submitted on the research areas, a number of doctoral and masters essays were submitted, among them the master's thesis by Dr. Muhammad al-Ahmadi. In addition, six students are currently working in the area to complete their master's and doctoral dissertations: 'Adil al-Afandi, Sa'id Faraj, Hamdi 'Abd-Rabbuh, Abu-al-Futuh 'Abd-al-Ra'uf, 'Adil Fu'ad, and 'Abd-al-Ghani Faw. Encouraging Field Visits In 1983, the Aswan mission began making field visits to the Umm Ara area for detailed studies. These studies had encouraging results and were accompanied by the development of the mission camp from a hasty camp of one or more tents to a large camp. It has now become a permanent camp of limestone rest houses with all the requisites of settled life, such as a restaurant, a meeting hall, and electricity generators. Work goes on all year-round, despite the harsh conditions. Even in the fearful heat of July, August, and September, which stops work on implementing the mine due to the difficulty of providing the necessaries**necessities of life, especially water, for a large number of people, a limited number of people stay to continue building rest houses for lodging and to ready the camp's other needs, not to mention maintaining life there so that the camp does not become a haven for the region's animals and insects seeking shade or food. The site was set up by the individual efforts of workers at costs less than a quarter of what one contracting company had set for implementing the project in this rugged area. A Canadian scientific mission then visited the site and suggested constructing an experimental open mine of two parallel trenches in the hill in which the evidence for uranium had turned up. Each trench was to be 1,000 meters long, so as to follow the course of the ore in extension and various depths and evaluate it in preparation for presenting feasibility studies on exploiting it--which would be the prelude, God willing, to great benefit for Egypt. A dynamite storehouse was constructed for this purpose. It was especially designed to keep its temperature below 30 degrees [centigrade] in summer to protect the dynamite--quite a marvel in the fiery heat I experienced there. Experimental Mine Implemented Actual work to implement the experimental mine began in March 1991. Twelve trenches were dug, through the colossal efforts of the blasting team, which included Engineer Ashraf Jawdah, who was in charge of the blasting, Hamid Sa'd, the chief technician, Muhammad al-Mahdi, and blasting technician Tariq Ibrahim. One should note that although the Umm Ara area is the most important prospecting area in the southeastern desert thus far, it is one of a number of areas in which parties are working under the supervision of the Aswan mission. These include: - the Jabal al-Bakriyah areas south of the road from Idfu to Marsa 'Alam, where there are anomalies whose sites have been investigated; - the Wadi al-Jimal [name as transliterated] area, where there is new evidence; - the Wadi Qafah area; and - the Majal Jibril [name as transliterated] area, where there are small anomalies. Aerial Surveying, Experimental Mine Before finishing the details of our trip, we must pause over two points of importance to nonspecialists. We asked Dr. Taha al-Sabah and Dr. 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Halim to clarify them. First, an aerial radiation survey involves using an airplane equipped with devices to observe any radiation emanating from the rocks. The plane makes low flights at regular distances. Afterward, the tapes that the observation devices record are examined to determine the areas of anomalies. Ground parties do detailed follow-up of these areas for confirmation. This system was implemented intermittently in Egypt using various airplanes from 1956 until 1982, when the last airplane caught fire while parked on the ground of the airport. No other airplane has been obtained to date, although only about $5 million is needed. Seventy-five percent of Egypt's area has not been radiologically surveyed. Doing so would bring great good to light. The airplane would also be important now in monitoring any radiation that comes to Egyptian territory from a foreign nuclear accident such as the one at Chernobyl. Second, the experimental mine is a very advanced phase of the search for and evaluation of uranium ore. It is the first stage in implementing the basic operating mine, which will take about 15 years. Egypt now has about four experimental uranium mines located in the areas of al-Musaythamat [name as transliterated], al-'Ardiyah [name as transliterated], Jabal Qitar [name as transliterated], and Umm Ara. Blasting Mine Passage All the geologists rushed to the top of a high hill far to the right of the blasting site for shelter from the danger of the small stones thrown long distances by the blast and covering the open area of the mine, as we saw. They said that the small stones were hurled so fast after the blast that they might be lethal. However, my colleague, photographer Ahmad Nasr, insisted that the small hill directly facing the blasting trench was the best place for photographing--"Why else did I come?" So all I could do was take cover on the lowest part of the hill. Thus I was at the foot of the hill, keeping an eye on the course of the cloud of small stones as it spread toward us, so as to warn of danger--even if no photographing was done--rather than death. I found beside me Dr. 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Halim and Dr. Ahmad Faruq, so that we all might encourage and reassure him, though we kept warning him that his safety was more important. There was a strong, muffled explosion that sounded like a shot from a cannon close by. It was followed by a loud echo that the mountains around us reflected. Then we saw a large mass of stone rise into the air with a gray cloud, and then a broad cloud of pebbles that we followed with our eyes until it fell at the foot of the hill. No sooner did the features of the blasting trench become visible again, than I noticed that there was a human being wearing protective clothing standing on the ground of the site with instruments to measure the radiation in the walls of the mine. I did not know when he had arrived there or where he had been hiding. It was 'Abd-al-Ghani Faw, who was responsible for radiation monitoring and was making studies involving observing the degree of radiation at the moment of the blast and at regular intervals thereafter. He was the dark, handsome young man whom I had just met in conversation the night before. The difference between him dusty and with his head wrapped in a scarf and his present appearance was great. He is a young man from Qina, a 1978 honors science graduate of Asyut University. Shortly before that, we had stood in the middle of the blast trench, the sides of which rose above our heads. We were using Geiger counters to monitor evidence of ore, whose rays caused the counters to sound. At the end of the passage the blasting groups were stuffing the holes that had been prepared for the purpose. Near us a bulldozer is at work moving the debris from the blast. We learned that its presence had spread joy among those standing around us. It had arrived a few days ago after a full week of travel in the desert. There had been enormous difficulties in getting it here, and now it was doing in minutes the ore-moving job that used to take many workers hours to do, thus compressing the time for completing the tunnel and successfully fulfilling the plan. Everyone agrees that the temporary workers should stay to work in the summer, instead of a mandatory halt during the summer months because of the climate and the end of the fiscal year. They should work on building the new guest house at the mission's Aswan headquarters to replace the original metal building that gets so hot that entering it, even in the middle of the night with fans that work all day, is a real adventure. Practical experience has demonstrated that the best buildings for these hot areas are those that use rock from the environment and that they are much more merciful. Near the end of Wadi al-'Allaqi we turned our car to guide the other cars on the road with our headlights, so that no one would get lost in the dark. As the car turned, we noticed creatures moving under the light like the reflection of moving water. "No, they are scorpions," explained the driver calmly. We could not even open the doors to let in a breath of air! His saying that they could not climb the body of the car did not reassure us. As soon as the cars answered our signal with their lights, we fled from the place. In our present location we feel reassured by the company; for the site is lit up and all activity, and the camp dump is far away as a precaution against the visits of nocturnal animals. Hopefully they will find what they get there sufficient, instead of making the rounds of the camp as they used to do last year. One cunning jackal kept getting into the kitchen for months on end and had the men baffled. They used every trick on him from poisoned food to a barrel filled with water for him to drown in. They chased him by car, but to no avail, until he suddenly disappeared for no apparent reason. The camp dog is the clearest proof of the nature of this strange life. One of the workers brought him as a pup to play in the camp. He ran happily around the camp until he met a jackal and went to play with him. The jackal soon gnawed off half of his tail, and the dog hurried back so terrified that it lost its voice. It still does not bark, despite its size and age. Atomic Materials Youth Nevertheless, you can only be delighted and sense the hope in the young geologists whose forms materialize around you under the evening light of the rest house: - Geologist 'Adil al-Afandi, the head of the camp, has a master's degree and is preparing to defend his doctoral dissertation. A 1976 science graduate of al-Mansurah University, he has worked in the agency since 1979. He is married and has a daughter. His eyes gleam as he tells how she acts with Uncle Fu'ad in the Ramadan Riddles children's programs. - 'Abd-al-Ghani Faw is preparing a master's thesis. A 1978 honors graduate of Asyut University in science, he is responsible for radiation monitoring. He is married and has a son. - Abu-al-Futuh 'Abd-al-Ra'uf is preparing a masters thesis. He is a 1981 science graduate of Sawhaj University with a grade of very good. He has been working since 1985. - Hamdi Mahmud, a 1983 science graduate of Alexandria University, is preparing a doctoral dissertation. He is married with children. - 'Adil Fu'ad is preparing to defend his master's. He graduated in science from 'Ayn Shams University in 1985 with a grade of very good and honors. Yellow Paste With these liberated minds and youthful hearts, it has become possible to realize the Atomic Materials Agency's 40-year dream of obtaining the "yellow dough" of uranium ore in the Egyptian deserts. Thus was I told by Dr. 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Halim, head of the research section and supervisor of the agency's development departments. The first uranium crusher has now arrived at the Umm Ara area. It was recently imported at a price of about three-quarters of a million pounds. It arrived at the port of Alexandria and was transported to Aswan. Foundations are now being built to set it up at the mine site. Three months from now the crusher will start crushing the result of the blasts at the mine--currently estimated at 2,500 cubic meters--and turning it into gravel measuring from 2 to 10 cubic centimeters. It will then be piled in special basins, where it will be sprayed with sulfuric acid in a closed cycle for 13 weeks during which the ore will dissolve in the acid, which will then go to laboratories for concentration. The uranium ore will be obtained in the form of a yellow paste for delivery to the Atomic Energy Agency, which will handle its subsequent processing. In the meantime, work at the promising mine will be developed by increasing the number of trenches and implementing a program of deep excavation to 100 meters. This important event will entail future participation in the celebrations for the implementation of this work at the site now in its first stages. This is what we shall do on a future trip for this purpose, God willing.
