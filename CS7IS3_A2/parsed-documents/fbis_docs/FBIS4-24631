In a document distributed throughout the country a few days ago, the top CPC level said that all kinds of measures will be adopted to maintain the stability of the situation and "to nip unrest in the bud." Armed police and anti-riot forces nationwide, as well as mechanized troops in the military regions, have been on level one alert since the middle of May. According to a source in Beijing, although there is nothing out of the ordinary among Beijing residents, many insiders are worried about the externally relaxed but internally tense atmosphere. A reliable source disclosed that a number of children of senior CPC officials studying in the United States had originally planned to return to Beijing by the end of May and early June to meet relatives or do business. However, they recently received calls from home urging them to postpone their trips. As Chinese-American Larry Wu has entered the mainland on numerous occasions with false identity papers, shooting documentaries which slandered the authorities, it is said that the Ministry of Public Security, Immigration Management Bureau, Armed Police Headquarters, and Ministry of State Security jointly sent a message a few days ago to all border posts urging them to keep a close watch over foreigners, Chinese students returning from abroad, and, in particular, foreigners of Chinese origin on the eve of 4 June. In a document for internal circulation distributed throughout the country, the source disclosed that the top CPC level had stressed that stability is the overriding task at present. Party committees and governments at all levels must try by every means to adopt all sorts of measures to maintain social stability. It is a Chinese tradition to mark 5th and 10th anniversaries of events, the document pointed out. As the fifth anniversary of the 1989 Beijing political disturbance (referring to the 4 June incident) falls this year, hostile forces at home and abroad have threatened to launch a series of sabotage activities. Therefore, all localities should take precautions on the eve of 4 June and "nip all sorts of unrest in the bud." The document said that the central authorities are ready for any eventuality and have taken precautions. It is said that public security, armed police, and special anti-riot forces nationwide, even mechanized troops in the military regions, have been on level one alert since the middle of May. The general office of the CPC Central Committee and State Council notified departments at all levels a few days ago, asking central, provincial, and ministerial leaders who are on inspection tours to return to their posts before early June, personally be on duty, and to be prepared at all times for any contingency. The externally relaxed but internally tense precautions adopted by the authorities have exerted great pressure on government officials and intellectuals. Outspoken intellectuals and dissidents in Beijing have been very careful while receiving telephone interviews from abroad. They almost spoke in unison: "I dare not say that. It is not convenient to say that." A pro-democracy activist living in the home of a friend explained: "They are afraid of getting other people involved." Another writer, who ended his life in exile and returned home not long ago, cried out in alarm: "How can they make phone calls at such a moment!"
