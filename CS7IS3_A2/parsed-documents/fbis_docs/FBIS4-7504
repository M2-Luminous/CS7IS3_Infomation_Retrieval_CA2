FBIS4-7504 "dreeu063_i_94006" FBIS-EEU-94-063 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Muslims Launch Offensive From `Safe Area' Muslims Launch Offensive From `Safe Area' LD3103184894 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1700 GMT 31 Mar 94 LD3103184894 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [By Nevenka Marcic] [Text] Belgrade, March 31 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems have launched a new offensive, "spring '94", from the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, one of the U.N.-protected "Safe Areas" in Bosnia-Herzegovina which should have been demilitarized last spring, Bosnian Serb military sources said on Thursday. According to the same sources, around 10,000 Moslem fanatics are engaged in the five-pronged offensive launched on Tuesday in the directions of Cajnice, Rudo and Visegrad, the Bosnian Serb towns on the border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and of Grebak and Trnovo, stops on route to Mt. Igman overlooking Sarajevo. The offensive's objective is for the Bosnian Moslems to link up with the Moslems in the Raska (Sandzak) region in the [word indistinct] and have the war spread to Yugoslavia, i.e. its republics of Serbia and Montenegro, and to link up the Gorazde troops with those on Mt. Igman and in Zepa and Srebrenica, also "Safe Areas" in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to information available to the Bosnian Serb army. Bosnian Serb military sources set out that, since Bosnian Serb troops are deployed around Gorazde, the town could have been supplied with arms and ammunition only by NATO aircraft as part of the U.S. operation of air dropping relief aid to Bosnian Moslems. The city of Sarajevo and the Moslem enclaves of Srebrenica, Zepa, Gorazde, Tuzla, and Bihac were proclaimed U.N.-protected "Safe Areas" under U.N. Security Council Resolution 824 in May 1993. The resolution called for the U.N. peacekeepers to demilitarize the "Safe Areas." However, not only have the U.N. troops failed to act accordingly but they have even failed to take any steps to prevent Moslems from using "Safe Areas" for military purposes. U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, himself, said in a report to the Security Council in mid-March that Moslems were using "Safe Areas" to train, equip and give a rest to their troops, and to open fire at Serb positions in the hope of provoking Serb retaliation. The U.N. secretary-general urged that the concept of the U.N. protected "Safe Areas," in which he said crime and prostitution were rampant, be redefined so that "Safe Areas" could not be used by Moslems to gain "tactical military advantage." However, the U.N. Security Council has failed to take a stand on the Butrus-Ghali request, just as it has failed to act in the case of similar reports and warnings from the Bosnian Serbs. The Bosnian Serb leadership has many times drawn attention to the fact that Moslem military provocations, in particular from Srebrenica and Gorazde, are aimed at forcing Serbs to launch military operations against U.N.-protected "Safe Areas" and, thereby, securing a foreign military intervention. The warnings from the Bosnian Serbs did not reach the Western public because Western media have been waging a pro-Moslem i.e. anti-Serb propaganda campaign since the outbreak of the war two years ago. Therefore, it would not be surprising at all if the latest Moslem offensive, launched from the U.N.-protected "Safe Area" of Gorazde, was to be disregarded and the Serbs were instead to be accused of attacking the town.
