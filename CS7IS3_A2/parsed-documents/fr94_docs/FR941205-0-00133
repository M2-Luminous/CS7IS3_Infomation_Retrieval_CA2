FR941205-0-00133 FR941205-0-00027 Allow Interchange of Detectors in EPA Methods 505, 507, 508_Commenters favored this proposal. Two commenters noted that data with alternative detectors must be verified, and were concerned about poor ECD response of some nitrogen-containing compounds. EPA agrees that data must be verified when changing detectors, and that the results for all chemicals in Methods 505, 507 or 508 may not meet quality control requirements when an alternative detector is used. This is why Section 6.8.3 of Methods 507 and 508, and Section 10.4 of Methods 505, 507 and 508 allow alternative detectors only if the initial demonstration of capability criteria in Section 10 of each method is met by the alternative detector. One commenter wanted to allow use of other detectors with EPA Method 504. EPA cannot approve this request, because EPA has no data to justify use of alternative detectors in Methods 504 or 504.1, which use an electron capture detector (ECD). The ECD has been the only detector capable of routinely measuring EDB and DBCP at the required parts-per-trillion concentrations (56 FR 3550, January 30, 1991). Guidance on Preserving Samples_A commenter asked that biocide procedures be dropped from the VOC methods, because EPA has dropped mercuric chloride as a biocide in synthetic organic chemical (SOC) methods. EPA dropped mercuric chloride from SOC methods, because EPA has no data to show that biodegradation of a regulated SOC occurs in a typical drinking water sample, and because mercuric chloride is toxic and a hazardous waste. However, EPA has data to show degradation (EPA, 1994e) in samples collected for measurement of VOCs. The biocide procedures required in the VOC methods require some combination of chilling, rapid transit and analysis, or acidification. None of these procedures pose health or waste disposal problems that compare with the problems associated with preservation using mercuric chloride. Therefore, EPA continues to require use of a biocide in VOC methods. Liquid-Solid Extraction (LSE) in EPA Methods 507 and 508_Some commenters believed more data were needed before EPA allowed use of LSE in Methods 507 and 508; EPA agrees. EPA stated in the December proposal that ``the Agency regards this proposed modification as tentative and will base a final decision on whether to approve on public comment and additional EPA performance data.'' After studying this option and developing additional data (EPA, 1994e), EPA has decided not to add LSE as an option in Methods 507 and 508, because EPA does not have data to support use of this technique for all of the chemicals in the methods. As an alternative, EPA has developed and is approving Method 508.1 (EPA, 1994c). Method 508.1 uses the procedures and the electron capture detector that are used in Method 508, and it allows use of LSE. The scope of Method 508.1 covers many of the Method 507 and 508 analytes that are subject to regulated or unregulated contaminant monitoring requirements, but it does not include butachlor, PCBs or toxaphene. In today's rule EPA will approve Method 508.1 for measurement of alachlor, atrazine, chlordane, endrin, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, hexachloro-benzene, hexachlorocyclopentadiene, lindane, methoxychlor, and simazine, which are regulated SOCs. It is also approved for aldrin, dieldrin, metolachlor, metribuzin, and propachlor, which are unregulated SOCs. Methods for Other Contaminants_In the 1993 proposal EPA provided guidance to systems that wish to measure chemicals that are not regulated, and need advice on what method to use. The guidance stated that ``although EPA approves methods only for contaminants regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Agency encourages laboratories to use these methods for other contaminants if the method description specifically includes these contaminants.'' One commenter mistakenly believed that this eliminates the use of other methods or techniques, such as test kits. Although EPA encourages laboratories to save money by using a compliance method to measure all chemicals of interest that are in the analytical scope of the method, this does not preclude systems from using other methods, including test kits, for samples other than compliance monitoring samples.
