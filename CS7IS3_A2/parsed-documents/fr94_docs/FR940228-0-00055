FR940228-0-00055 FR940228-0-00013 3. The 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band is authorized for co-primary use by the broadcast auxiliary service, the terrestrial fixed service, and the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) service. Additionally, the frequencies adjacent to this band are allocated on a primary basis to the instructional television fixed service (ITFS), the multi-channel multi-point distribution service (MMDS), fixed services, mobile services and for industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment, and to the radiolocation service on a secondary basis. 4. On August 5, 1992, we proposed to allocate these bands to the mobile-satellite service systems, shared on a co-primary basis with the RDSS. See 57 FR 43434 (September 21, 1992). 5. Based on the record in this proceeding, we find that there is substantial interest in using both LEO and GEO technologies to provide new voice and data MSS services in the subject bands. As we indicated in the Notice, MSS LEO systems will offer significant new benefits to both domestic and international communications users. MSS LEO systems potentially can provide a universally available world-wide cellular-like radiotelephone service offering voice, data, and facsimile service. In addition, radiolocation and radionavigation applications also can be provided. 6. Some of the new applications envisioned include: (1) personal locator services that could be used to locate accident victims or persons stranded because of weather or injury; (2) fleet management and tracking services that would permit more efficient shipping and transportation of goods, including the tracking of hazardous wastes and material; (3) public safety services that would allow state and local governments to use MSS to extend health and emergency services to rural and remote areas currently unserved by traditional communications facilities; and (4) International Services that would permit global MSS and make modern telephone communications available to remote and underserved areas throughout the world. 7. Further, the Commission determined that although the specific method for sharing among systems remains to be determined, based on the record, bi-directional operations in the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz band is feasible, and accordingly the Commission is providing for a secondary allocation for space-to-Earth operations in this band. 8. The Commission also concluded that MSS operations in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 and 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz bands should be subject to the e.i.r.p. and power flux density levels set forth in the international Radio Regulations. In addition, such MSS operations will be subject to the coordination and notification procedures set forth in Resolution 46. 9. We continue to believe that, at least initially, the existing FSS bands are sufficient to accommodate MSS feeder links. We note that there may be difficulties in using FSS bands that generally are congested with significant numbers of geostationary fixed-satellite systems (GEO FSS). Consequently, because of the significant coordination difficulties arising from the global nature of LEO operations, MSS LEO feeder links would need to operate in FSS frequency bands that are not heavily used by GEO FSS systems. We are also including the inter-satellite service bands at 24.45&hyph;24.65 and 24.65&hyph;24.75 GHz and the already allocated inter-satellite service band at 22.55&hyph;23 GHz in the United States Table of Frequency Allocations for non-government use. 10. In view of the important health issues involved, the fact that no general manufacture of consumer equipment for MSS in these bands has yet begun, and our intent to provide for the expeditious initiation of the services for which this spectrum is being allocated, we believe the ANSI/IEEE guidelines (IEEE C95.1&hyph;1991) should be used when evaluating the potential for harm to public health from exposure to RF emissions of MSS user devices. If we modify the ANSI/IEEE guidelines in ET Docket No. 92&hyph;62, those guidelines will be applied to MSS equipment. We will require that all hand-held devices comply with the ANSI/IEEE specifications for ``uncontrolled'' environments because the new MSS service as envisioned would include consumer use that would be within the ``uncontrolled'' definition. 11. Further, in the Notice and Tentative Decision, 57 FR 43434, September 21, 1992 supra, we dismissed a petition for rule making filed by CELSAT to use the RDSS frequency band for a hybrid satellite and terrestrial ground personal communications service (PCS). CELSAT had an alternative request for spectrum in the 2120&hyph;2129 and 2410&hyph;2428 MHz bands, including a pioneer's preference request which remains pending. On October 5, 1992, CELSAT filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the Commission's Notice and Tentative Decision in which it argues that the Commission incorrectly dismissed its proposed spectrum allocation because the terrestrial element of its proposal was incompatible with WARC&hyph;92. TRW filed a petition to dismiss the CELSAT Petition for Reconsideration. The Commission grants TRW's petition but accepts CELSAT's petition as late filed comments. The Commission continues to believe that for the purpose of international coordination it is important that our domestic allocation be compatible with the WARC&hyph;92 spectrum allocation. Thus we continue to hold that terrestrial operations in these bands is inappropriate. For this reason, we accept CELSAT's Petition for Reconsideration as a comment in this proceeding. 12. In the Notice and Tentative Decision we noted that the proposal was analyzed with respect to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and found to contain no new or modified form, information collection and/or record keeping, labeling, disclosure, or record retention requirements, and will not increase or decrease burden hours imposed on the public. No comments were received regarding the Paperwork Reduction Act. 13. Further, in the Notice and Tentative Decision we invited comments on the impact of the proposed allocation in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980. No comments were received in response to our analysis of this allocation as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
