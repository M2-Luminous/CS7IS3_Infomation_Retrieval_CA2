In this period, a remarkable progress has been made in the comprehensive mechanisation of agriculture, the number of tractors increasing 6 times, lorries 5 times, weeding machines 5.6 times, harvester combines 7 times and rice harvesters 1.5 times. Each subworkteam of the cooperative farms across the country has one or more rice-transplanting machines and rice-seedling pullers, putting the mechanisation of farm work on a high level. In "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country", the great leader President Kim Il-song set the task to carry out the comprehensive mechanisation of agriculture, a part of the rural technical revolution, and indicated ways for its implementation. He saw to it that many industrial establishments engaged in agriculture such as tractor, spare part, farm machine and farm tool plants and farm machine stations were built in all parts of the country. Thus, the Kumsong general tractor works, the "chungsong" tractor plant and several hundred trailing machine factories and farm machine stations have made their appearance in many places of the country. With the brisk training of agrotechnicians, experts and tractor drivers the number has markedly increased. Under the bright rays of the rural theses, the agricultural working people of Korea now do all farm work ranging from ploughing of paddy and non-paddy fields to sowing, rice-transplanting, weeding, harvesting, threshing and transport with the help of machines.
