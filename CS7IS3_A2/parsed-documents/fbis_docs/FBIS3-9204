More than 5,000 people were thrown out of their homes illegally by Croatian security forces during 1992 and 1993, many of them beaten, threatened and robbed in the process, it said in a report released Tuesday [22 March]. "Despite assurances (...) forced and illegal expulsions, acts of violence and the absence of all protection for their victims continues in Croatia," it commented. The report gave details of 21 cases, including one where the victim died, and criticised Croatia for not keeping a promise made in December to open inquiries on the many complaints brought to the authorities. The victims were Croat citizens or long-standing residents of non-Croat origin, mostly Serb, who lived in homes built by the former federal Yugoslav army for veterans and their families. Since Croatian independence in 1991, the homes have been under the control of the Ministry of Defence.
