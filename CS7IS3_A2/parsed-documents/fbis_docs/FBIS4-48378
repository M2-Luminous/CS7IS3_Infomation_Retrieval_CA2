In the last three days, the RPF near Rusumo has received many returnees including 86 orphans who had fled to Tanzania. Some returnees are accommodated in temporary camps for some of them have feared going back to their homes believing that the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] youthwingers are still operating in the countryside. But some returnees have been escorted to their homes and, after ensuring that they are safe, they have stayed in their homes. Life is returning to normal in Prefecture Kibungo. The returnees are calling upon their relatives, neighbors, and friends who are still in refugee camps in Tanzania to take the first opportunity available and come home. They should ignore the malicious propaganda that the RPF is committing atrocities in Kibungo. These rumors, this propaganda is being spread by MRND's militia who are haunted by the massacres they have been carrying out. The MRND's youthwingers are spreading the rumors of atrocities by the RPF so as to discourage the refugees from returning home. For if the refugees were to return home, it would be easy to conduct investigations into the atrocities by the youthwingers and the criminals would be easily exposed. But the delay is not a solution. These criminals will eventually be charged, whether in Rwanda or in Tanzania, for they have been committing crimes against humanity.
