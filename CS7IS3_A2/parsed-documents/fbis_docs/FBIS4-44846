The European Consortium, "Future Large Aircraft" (FLA), has now decided on turboprop propulsion for its heavy military air transport project. British Aerospace Corp., the FLA program partner in London, explained that jet propulsion had been rejected because considerable technical difficulties were anticipated in having the jet engines attain the short-takeoff capability required on undeveloped terrain. A further consideration in the decision is that turboprop aircraft are cheaper to develop and produce. Moreover, modern turboprop aircraft can now fly just about as fast as jet aircraft. On the basis of current calculations, the FLA aircraft is expected to fly at a maximum cruising speed of 72 percent of the speed of sound (Mach). The most advanced U.S. military transport aircraft, employing jet propulsion, fly at 77 percent the speed of sound. Just a few months ago, it seemed certain that the FLA aircraft would be driven by jet engines. Several European companies had already proposed their engines for the planned aircraft, and for some time it seemed as though the future belonged to strictly jet propulsion. In the second half of the 1980s, the U.S. aviation industry dropped plans for the construction of a turboprop commercial aircraft when the airlines decided against it on the grounds that the flying public were too accustomed to jet aircraft. Even the significantly lower specific fuel consumption of advanced turboprop engines could not alter the decision. Two European consortia are already interested in building the turboprop engines for the FLA aircraft. One is the German-British BMW-Rolls Royce grouping, and the other is the Snecma (France), Fiat (Italy), and MTU (Germany) group. Ratier-Figeac and Hispano Suiza of France and Dowty of Great Britain are interested in developing and producing the propellers. The main competitors of the planned FLA aircraft--the new An-70 from Ukraine and the Lockheed C130J from the United States--are likewise driven by turboprop engines.
