Apart from 21 regions and the Crimean peninsula, where turnout proved to be far above 50 per cent, the required number of eligible voters came to the polls in the Khmelnitskiy and Cherkassyy regions. Thus, the validity of today's polls remains undecided only in the Odessa region, Kiev and Sevastopol, according to UKRINFORM news agency. Election results will be available after preliminary counting of votes. For the Ukrainian parliament to function normally, at least 300 deputies should be elected to the 450-seat supreme legislature.
