The meeting was attended by cabinet ministers and HZDS parliamentary deputies. Meciar said that the HZDS expressed dissatisfaction with the activity of Slovak President Michal Kovac which harmed the reputation of the Slovak Government and the Slovak Republic. The movement also expressed concern about the internal political situation in Slovakia and the situation among citizens as the situation is not stabilizing but, on the contrary, fragmentation of the political scene is taking place. Meciar said that on Monday the whole cabinet will resign along with him. At the same time ministers in Meciar's cabinet rejected the offer by President Kovac to hold their functions until a new government is appointed because the president had insulted them in his speech when he accused them of corruption. "He should bear the responsibility and consequences by himself," Meciar said, referring to Kovac. It is highly improbable that Parliament would agree on early elections because the opposition does not want them, Meciar said. He said that a fight for who would be the premier in a new government was currently going on and there were also problems with its personnel filling. "Peter Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), believes that he will be the premier but he did not notice that behind his back a coalition between Milan Knazko (former Slovak foreign minister and HZDS deputy chairman), Ludovit Cernak, former chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS), and Jan Carnogursky (chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), is being formed which have more votes that the SDL has, Meciar said. Referring to the SDL Meciar said that the HZDS Presidium considered the SDL leadership not trustworthy and specifically Weiss and Milan Ftacnik who had breached all agreements. Meciar voiced doubt that the confidence between the HZDS and SDL could ever be restored. He said he had delayed his speech in Parliament on agreement with the SDL because before the vote on confidence in the government a vote on the early election date could have taken place. During today's meeting Meciar proposed that he leave the post of the HZDS chairman given his defeat in Parliament. However the Presidium, in a secret ballot, unanimously confirmed him in the office.
