The distribution of the costs of transformation and the sharing out of their still limited results give rise to reservations. This is the spirit in which the public expressed itself during the last elections. Consequently, a reduction in the social costs of the reforms is a key issue for the government. (2) Poland particularly needs a longer-term perspective today, a strategic conception of economic development that sets three objectives: rapid economic growth, institutional and macroeconomic stabilization, and an improved standard of living. That is precisely the kind of program the government is presenting to society, which is going to be implementing it in its own long-term interests. It is Strategy for Poland that opens a new phase of Poland's transformation. (3) One of the fundamental values on which Strategy for Poland is based is the principle of distribution of results of labor through negotiation. In principle, conflicts of interests in the economy occur between various social groups rather than between groups and the state or the government. The government proposes solutions that establish a partnerlike system of labor relations and wage regulation. This means a decentralized wage regulation mechanism based on negotiation, in which representatives of employers and employees conclude collective agreements, while the state plays the part of an arbitrator that settles disputes. (4) Rapid economic growth should lead to an increase in the gross domestic product [GDP] in 1994-97 of about 22 percent; that is an annual average of about 5 percent (in constant prices). A speeding up of the current positive trends will be furthered through a policy of mobilizing national savings and, in addition, through foreign investments. An improvement in the efficiency of utilizing these resources will be assured through improved administration of the state assets, including the following: --owner supervision exercised by the State Treasury, which will gain a separate institutional identity; --widespread use of management contracts and agreements between state enterprises and tax offices; --continuation of ownership transformations, including privatization and the State Investment Funds program. Consolidation of development trends will be furthered through investment in human capital, especially in improving staff qualifications and employee retraining, as well as in scientific research and health care. (5) Macroeconomic stabilization and institutional stability will meet the expectations of economic entities. Its first aspect is the need to reduce the rate of growth of the public debt so that, prospectively, the debt does not exceed 60 percent of the GDP by 2004. This will be ensured through an increased domestic product and mainly through successive reductions of the budget deficit, which should fall to about 2-3 percent in 1997 from the level of more than 6 percent in 1992 and approximately 4 percent in 1994. The debt will also be reduced through the use of mechanisms that turn some of it into shares in privatized state property. This will also lead to an acceleration of structural changes and an influx of foreign investment. The second aspect of the policy of macroeconomic stabilization is the reduction of price inflation under the conditions of complete liberalization of prices. The financial policy is directed at reducing inflation to single figures in 1997. Reducing the rate of price increases, with a simultaneous policy of maintaining positive rates of interest in real terms, will promote a growing trend toward savings by all entities, stimulate investments, contribute toward growth in productivity, and reduce the costs of servicing the public debt. The third aspect of macroeconomic stabilization is gradual balancing of the balance of payments and the current turnover account so that, in 1997, the continuing negative balance of this account should reach the level of 1.5 per cent of the GDP. The government is consistently stabilizing the principles of economic play and the expectations of the entities that take part in it. (6) Improving the standard of living is the social backbone of Strategy for Poland. Its successful implementation will make possible an increase of nearly 11 percent in the average real wage in 1994-97 and a perceptible increase in the purchasing power of the average old-age or disability pension after their increase by about 7 percent in real terms in 1994. The distribution of earnings has to guarantee for all at least an elementary sense of social safety, the loss of which in recent years has been the main cause of public frustration. The government is undertaking the difficult and complex reform of the system of social protection that has been continually postponed for several years now. The realization of the intentions in the field of economic growth creates an opportunity for an effective and least painful implementation of this reform. A program of active countermeasures against unemployment has been launched. Unemployment should decrease from nearly 16 percent now to under 14 percent at the end of 1997. We are gradually entering a phase during which new--and often modern and competitive--jobs will be created more quickly than old jobs disappear. (7) In the longer term, the international competitiveness of the economy is a measure of economic success and a source of cultural progress. Export production, as one of the forces that stimulate the economy and a source of financing for imports expenditure and efficient servicing of foreign debt, will be given institutional, especially financial, preferences. One of the policy instruments improving the Polish producers' competitiveness will be an increased influx of foreign capital, especially of direct private investments. (8) Poland is and always has been a part of Europe. Consequently, its striving for early membership in the European Union is natural. The realization of Strategy for Poland will bring us closer to this objective, especially as its direction is compatible with the long-term European Union program "Growth, Employment, Competitiveness." The integrational experiences of the past three years, despite the financial assistance provided to Poland, have not been completely satisfactory. The time has come when our striving to participate in the European Union should be met with a greater opening of its markets. We, for our part, are intensifying adjustment activities, especially in agriculture. (9) Reform of the economic center is a precondition for the realization of Strategy for Poland. A reform of the economic center will be carried out, consisting, among other things, of the establishment of a strong State Treasury, with a separate institutional identity, a Ministry of Economy, and a Ministry of International Economic Integration. (10) Historical experiences of the countries that have already scored successes in the economic field clearly show that the sources of success were hard work by society and enlightened policies by those in power. We also need lasting social peace. In time, the results of Strategy for Poland will ensure such peace themselves. Today, however, we also need the goodwill of all proreform forces. These store tremendous social energy. This has to be focused on creative efforts directed to the future. An integral part of Strategy for Poland are 10 crucial programs. These are directed at specific issues and operations. Apart from these, the government package contains sets of sector and departmental programs, as well as economic and social policies, the implementation of which are the responsibility of specific ministries. By assigning specific tasks to economic ministries, Strategy for Poland itself focuses on the crucial problems and a macroeconomic and macrosocial approach.
