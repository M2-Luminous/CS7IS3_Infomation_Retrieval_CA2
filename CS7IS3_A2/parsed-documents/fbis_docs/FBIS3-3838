Zheng Hongye, president of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and John Maree, chairman of the Nedcor Group, attended the opening ceremony. Zheng said in his speech that Nedbank, as a financial bridge linking Asia and Africa, has spared no effort to promote the economic and trade ties between the two continents, especially those between China and South Africa. The establishment of its Beijing office will open a new channel for Sino-South African cooperation in the fields of trade and finance, he said. Maree told those attending the ceremony that as the largest finance group in South Africa, Nedbank has always attached great importance to expanding its business in the Far East region, especially in China, because the region is developing very fast economically, and China has kept the highest development speed. The bank established an office in Hong Kong in 1984, he said, adding that its Beijing office will provide loans and information to those South African companies coming to China and help Chinese enterprises which are interested in investing in South Africa. Nedbank, founded in 1888, has assets of R [Rand] 51 billion and a total capital stock of R2.5 billion.
