FBIS4-1154 "drafr079_d_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-079 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Mozambique UN, Renamo Officials Discusses Peace Process UN, Renamo Officials Discusses Peace Process Ajello Comments on Demobilization MB2204172994 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1030 GMT 22 Apr 94 MB2204172994 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network Portuguese BFN [Text] UN Special Representative Dr. Aldo Ajello said today that in his next report to the UN Security Council he will inform them that despite the fact that Mozambique's peace process has progressed significantly, there are still serious problems to be resolved. These include the slow confinement of government and Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] forces and the need to find a speedy and realistic solution for the formation of the new Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [FADM]. Ajello revealed that these and other issues of concern will be thoroughly discussed in a Supervision and Control Commission meeting scheduled for this afternoon. In this meeting, the UN representative in Mozambique will propose a date for closing the assembly areas and by then all soldiers who will join the new army should be in training centers, and those remaining ones should be demobilized. He said these guidelines should be established immediately, stressing that the debate scheduled for today will be an opportune time to discuss the issue. In his normal Friday news conference, Dr. Aldo Ajello called attention to the fact that 55 percent of government soldiers and 81 percent from Renamo have now been confined in assembly areas. He expressed profound concern, saying this is a problem, and added that if this tendency persists, there will be problems in concluding the process. Ajello revealed that 14,306 government soldiers and 561 from Renamo have now been demobilized. The UN Operations in Mozambique Technical Demobilization Unit has a list of 18,859 government soldiers and 1,112 from Renamo that should be demobilized. Aldo Ajello said the process of demobilizing soldiers from both sides is very slow. Renamo must demobilize 4,000 soldiers and the government 60,000. Meanwhile, he noted that Afonso Dhlakama's movement is slower in demobilizing its forces, although President Joaquim Chissano and the Renamo leader agreed to speed up the process in their last meeting. Ajello said that until now nothing of what they decided on the issue has been fulfilled. The UN Security Council will discuss these issues by the end of the month and it is expected that if appropriate measures have not been taken by then, the UN will take appropriate steps in accordance with the circumstances. Concerning the process of the formation of the new armed forces, the UN special representative in Mozambique revealed that the movement of soldiers to training centers scheduled for this week has been concluded, despite the fact that a number of soldiers refused to join the new army. According to the program for forming the new army, the soldiers will be trained in Boone center, located in Manhica District, Maputo Province and Dondo center in Sofala Province under the supervision of British instructors. Since it is expected that a large number of soldiers will be trained, the participation of Zimbabwean instructors is being considered. Aldo Ajello said the most important thing now is to completely demobilize all those who will not join the new army and to consider the possibility that the formation of the new forces may be extended to the post electoral period.
