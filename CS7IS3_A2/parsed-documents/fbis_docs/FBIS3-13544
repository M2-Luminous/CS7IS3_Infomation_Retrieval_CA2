The Islamic Resistance, Hizballah's armed wing, said "a Merkava tank exploded and a truck fell into the valley in flames" in the attack at the entrance to al-Shaqif Castle in Israel's self-declared security zone. Lebanese security services confirmed the attack but could provide no information on eventual casualties. Israeli tanks and artillery then shelled woods and the area around villages opposite the Crusader-era castle while Israeli helicopter gunships machinegunned targets in the region, police said. There were no immediate reports of casualties following the Israeli attacks.
