The message said that communication workers, who are ensuring the functioning of the system, received only 7.5 billion roubles in payment of this year's debt, which amounts to 209 billion. This makes less than four per cent. The Russian Ministry of Finance plans to provide financing in the current year only for 25 per cent of TV and radio programmes. The Chita radio broadcasting station has already been stopped because of the absence of money. Radio broadcasting stations in Blagoveshchensk and some other Russian cities may also be closed down soon. According to the message, "the president should have a final say in settling this important problem." Communication workers, who are practically working gratis, stated that they would not be held responsible for the reduction of the volume of TV and radio broadcasting.
