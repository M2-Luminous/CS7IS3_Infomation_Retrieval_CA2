On 15 April, the Russian and Ukrainian presidents came to terms on a gradual settlement of the Black Sea Fleet problem on the basis of the fleet's division. Ukraine is to have 15 to 20 percent of the fleet. Baltin believes that Ukraine will fail to ensure the combat efficiency of the ships and the normal functioning of the fleet. He noted that Ukraine had unilaterally established control over 35 percent of the Black Sea Fleet. So 65, not 100 percent of the fleet will have to be equally divided, he said. Baltin also announced that 18 months ago, Ukraine received a missile cruiser, small antisubmarine boats, small amphibious ships and a coast-guard boat, all of them new and 65-85 percent combat ready. None of these ships have been brought to complete combat readiness, said Baltin. He pointed out, meanwhile, that if Ukraine had enough money it would have a unique missile cruiser not to be found either in the Black Sea, or in the Mediterranean or in the U.S. 6th Fleet.
