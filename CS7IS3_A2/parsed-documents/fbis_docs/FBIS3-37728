Following the Ukrainian side's reasoning that: "No one has done this before. If God has given you gas, it is not worth abusing this," a preliminary accord was reached on selling 60,000 tonnes of wheat to Turkmenistan to credit the debt and payment by Ukraine of $50 million of the 150 million debt. After this, it is likely that the supply of gas to Ukraine will be resumed.
