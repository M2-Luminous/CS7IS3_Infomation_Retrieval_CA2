The OAS has now turned its attention to the Summit of the Americas, organized by U.S. President Bill Clinton for December in Washington [as received] with the participation of all the chiefs of state and government of the hemisphere. The main subject of the summit has yet to be announced. Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said today he expects the summit will produce concrete measures to strengthen Inter-American cooperation and to enhance social development. In his closing speech to the 24th OAS general assembly, Amorim described the results of the deliberations in Belem as "extremely encouraging," especially in the field of human rights. He called the attention of the plenary to the "deep social difficulties that affect broad sectors" of the Latin American community and to the "serious economic problems" that challenge their governments. After admitting that there are no easy answers to such problems, he spoke of the need "for a real partnership for development that includes free trade, increased financial inflow, and total access to state-of-the-art technologies." The OAS secretary general made a resume of the results of the assembly, recalling one of the most important points of the final declaration: The document begins by stating the firm commitment of the OAS to become the main hemispheric forum of political understanding, and thus "promote and consolidate peace, democracy, social justice, and development" in the Americas. The Declaration of Belem reasserts the OAS commitment to contribute to the prompt and total implementation of the decisions agreed during the Uruguay Round of the GATT so as to reestablish a non-discriminatory, fair, and multilateral open trade system to effectively support efforts toward the total development of the countries of the continent. He reasserted the commitment of the OAS to intensify cooperation in the economic, social, educational, cultural, technological, and political fields; to study measures, within the juridical framework of each country, seeking to combat corruption and improve the efficiency of public administration; to continue to promote the Common Market of Knowledge [Mercado Comun do Conhecimento] (Mercocyt) as an instrument to share experiences and progress among OAS member countries; to strengthen cooperation and thus make drug enforcement efforts more efficient; and to contribute as much as possible toward the success of the Summit of the Americas organized by the U.S. President. Celso Amorim took the opportunity to encourage those member countries that have yet to sign the Tlatelolco Treaty -- to denuclearize Latin America -- to do so as soon as possible to thus inspire other regions of the world to support the idea of global disarmament. Finally, after briefly referring to the efforts to restore democracy in Haiti where the OAS expects to carry out its 25th General Assembly, the Brazilian foreign minister highlighted the importance of the friendly atmosphere created by the foreign ministers and chiefs of delegations in Belem. Amorim's final words were: "We have achieved challenging works and obtained a positive balance. I think everyone has the feeling of having fulfilled his duty."
