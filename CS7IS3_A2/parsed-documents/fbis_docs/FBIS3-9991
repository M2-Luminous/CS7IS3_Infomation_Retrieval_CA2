He explained that a MIR committee was then in charge of collecting those funds. Capobianco added, however, that he did not know about Chavarria's illegal activities and Chavarria had introduced himself as a prosperous businessman. Capobianco requested that Gonzalo Torrico explain whether he knew about Chavarria's illegal activities. The former minister said Chavarria contributed money to the MIR New Majority political campaign, but he does not know exactly when the contribution was made. He added that Chavarria lent his planes to former President Jaime Paz Zamora's campaign, during which the photographs that have been creating commotion were taken. Capobianco explained that he does not know how much Chavarria gave the campaign. He denied, however, receiving these funds because they were handed to a committee of MIR members in charge of receiving this sort of campaign contribution. Capobianco pointed out that at the time, the MIR was fully implementing the New Majority political program, but did not count on the financial help of prosperous businessmen as interested as we were, he said, in financially supporting them. He added that at that time, Chavarria introduced himself as a prosperous businessman dedicated to agricultural activities in the Chiquitana region and offered to help in the implementation work [words indistinct]. From then on, he said, facts are known to a [word indistinct] committee and that he has nothing to do with them.
