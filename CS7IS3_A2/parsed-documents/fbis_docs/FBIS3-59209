Segni's call for direct election of a premier has long been a sticking point with the People's Party and its predecessor, the Christian Democratic Party. The announcement comes just days after Segni signed a programme deal with the federalist Northern League, a deal which broke down last night when League chief Umberto Bossi said he would have nothing to do with the People's Party. Segni is continuing a round of meetings with representatives from the Liberal, Socialist and other lay parties, aides said.
