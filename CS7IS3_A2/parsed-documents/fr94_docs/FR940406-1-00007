SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 This proposed rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the USDA, it has been determined to be ``economically significant'' because it would have an annual effect on the economy of more than $100 million and would materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof. Budget outlays for deficiency payments are expected to range from $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion annually. This proposed rule would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities, would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency, and would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis A Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this proposed rule and the impacts of implementing each option is available from the above-named individual. Environmental Evaluation It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. Federal Assistance Program The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to which this rule applies are: Wheat Production Stabilization_10.058. Regulatory Flexibility Act It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is applicable to this proposed rule since the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is required by section 107B(o) of the 1949 Act to request comments with respect to the subject matter of this rule. The Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis referred to above determined that the 1995 Wheat Acreage Reduction Program (ARP) will have no significant economic impact on small entities because the regulatory burden on the affected entities would remain the same regardless of the determinations made by this action. Thus, CCC certifies that this rule will have no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12372 This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983). Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. This rule does not involve the preemption of State law, is not retroactive, and does not involve any exhaustion of administrative remedy issues.
