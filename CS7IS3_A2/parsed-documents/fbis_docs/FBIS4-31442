In Bosnia right now you control more than 70 percent of the territory. [Bosnian Serbs leader] Karadzic himself says that he is ready to make sizable concessions in order to achieve peace. What more remains? As a military man, how do you view the situation now? [Mladic] The reply can be read in what Muslim General Rasim Delic said very recently to the LJILIAN newspaper. I can only add that, with the very recent creation of the Muslim-Croat federation, an enormous potential for war has been released which is turned against us. [Cianfanelli] Which, specifically? [Mladic] I am talking of attacks against us. Until a few days ago there was intense fighting in this same region near the Zvornik corridor. The Muslims have attacked us several times in the area of Srbobran, Turbe, and Mount Vlasic. They have also violated the truce around Bugojno and in the Sarajevo demilitarized zone. [Cianfanelli] But there is also news of Serbian troop movements around the Brcko corridor, where, it is feared, the next crisis could explode. How is the situation at Brcko? [Mladic] Stable. [Cianfanelli] Do you mean that there are no encounters? [Mladic] On the contrary, every day we are subjected to provocations from the Muslims with tanks, artillery, and medium-caliber weapons. The Croats in the meantime are attacking us from the direction of Orasje, and to the south of Brcko they are involved in joint actions, which we are opposing. [Cianfanelli] At Sarajevo General Delic told us that you want to enlarge the Brcko corridor from three to ten kilometers. Is this true? [Mladic] We have not moved in the corridor since 28 June 1992. [Cianfanelli] Are you then ready to sign a truce with Delic which would be respected by both parties? [Mladic] I am not interested in a truce with Delic. When we got him with his back to the wall at Gorazde, all Delic knew what to do was to scream for help from the United Nations, inundating the runways of the NATO airport with rivers of Muslim tears. His one aim was to force the West to intervene... In any event, we are ready to negotiate for a political peace on all territorial disputes which are currently outstanding in Bosnia. Before Gorazde I was in Sarajevo three times. I negotiated with General Rose and was ready to negotiate with the Muslim and Croat commanders. But they did not come. Their aim was to tie my hands with the negotiations, whilst continuing to attack me in Gorazde and in central Bosnia. [Cianfanelli] Excuse me for being frank. From your point of view Gorazde was not a success. In terms of international image, the siege was a disaster for you. Think only of the negative publicity, and the risk of a massive NATO intervention. [Mladic] There we go, NATO. But do you not see in Italy either that NATO is looking for an excuse to move its advanced bases further east, as at Tuzla and Skopje, where they are less dangerous and less expensive for you? [Cianfanelli] If you permit me, it is not NATO which is moving further east. In the Balkans NATO is intervening under UN mandate. And, if anything, it is the East European countries who are queuing up to be allowed into NATO. [Mladic] I do not want to go into politics. But I can say that in Italy you are not fortunate in having Aviano and Ancona [NATO bases] on your territory. For you, moving these bases further east would certainly be an advantage. As to NATO's intentions, let me insist sincerely. You in Italy are wrong, and the longer you take in realizing this, the more it will cost you. [Cianfanelli] With the same sincerity I can assure you that in Italy there are at least two generations who think that, if Italy defeated communism and did not slip into communism, but is free and, despite everything which needs to be changed, has made enormous progress, and if also the great fraud of socialism in the East has collapsed, we owe this to NATO. [Mladic] How then do you explain, if NATO is not expansionist, the NATO attack on Gorazde? And the support which NATO, together with the United Nations, continues to give to the Muslims and the Croats? No, frankly, I am not convinced. [Cianfanelli] Thank you for your frankness, which is always the basis of friendship. You have already said that in Bosnia there is a need to achieve a political and not a military solution, but meanwhile the war, with deaths and devastation, continues. When will there be a political solution? [Mladic] This does not depend on the Serbian people. It depends on the gods of war, who, following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, have not yet reached their objectives in the Balkans. Unfortunately, for the immediate future, I am not optimistic.
