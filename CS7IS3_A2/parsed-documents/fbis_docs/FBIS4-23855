Dhlakama said that Renamo's electoral campaign will not require a lot of funds, adding that "what we want is transportation to be able to move about." The Renamo leader, who was speaking at a well-attended news conference, said during his visit to the United States he informed UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali about this. Afonso Dhlakama also said that during his meeting with Butrus-Ghali, they also discussed the peace process in Mozambique, the confinement and demobilization of troops, the training of a single and nonpartisan army, and the difficulties that "we are facing." He also said he held meetings with members of the UN Security Council during which they discussed the issue of the "trust fund." He said there were problems because the figures allegedly announced by the media are not correct. Afonso Dhlakama said, however, that "modalities are being studied to find a solution to this issue of the trust fund." Dhlakama, who described his first official visit to the United States as successful, stressed that Renamo is ready for the October general elections, "although we do not possess material resources." He said: "We cannot say that we will not take part in elections because of lack of material resources". According to Renamo leader, the United States promised to contribute $1 million for his movement's "trust fund". Asked whether he was happy with the U.S. contribution to his movement, Afonso Dhlakama said yes. He stressed however that the money was not enough but then said "a donation is never little." The Renamo leader still advocates the establishment of a government of national unity and said that he had presented his proposals to the U.S. Administration. "They said it was a good idea, and they even promised to convey the message to President Joaquim Chissano," Dhlakama said. On the disappearance of 12,000 troops from the government army, the Renamo leader said the U.S. Administration accepted his request for greater monitoring of the situation and the need to "warn the government led by the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party." He said the "disappearance" of these troops was a "serious" issue and not a problem of arithmetic "as the government tries to explain it." Dhlakama said his movement thinks these troops were transferred to the Police Force, since a similar situation took place in Angola, where the Government led by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola diverted 80,000 troops to the Police Force. During his recent visit to the United States, the Renamo leader was confronted with accusations that his movement used children during the war against the Mozambican Government. In reply, Dhlakama said he told Americans that in Africa it is a common to use children in war. As examples, he said liberation movements such as the African National Congress, the South-West African People's Organization, the Zimbabwe African National Union, and Frelimo also used children during war. Afonso Dhlakama clearly admitted for the first time that his movement used minors during its war against the government led by Frelimo, when he said that "all parties use children." At the news conference, the Renamo leader also referred to the voter registration process now under way in the country. He said foreigners have already been detected registering as voters. Dhlakama said that in Cabo Delgado Province two Tanzanians were detained by police for trying to register as voters. The Renamo leader also said he was going to register as voter in Maputo today and then leave for Inhambane Province, where he will preside over a conference of Renamo cadres. He also revealed he will visit the provinces of Sofala, Manica, and Tete beginning 20 June.
