But the Russians go on producing plutonium. Why? [Dyakov] This situation is far from logical to me also. Three reactors -- two in Tomsk, one in Krasnoyarsk -- are still producing weapons-grade plutonium. But they also generate electricity. If they were closed down, many people would be without electricity and heating. Yet, the government says there is another reason as well: The fuel used in the reactors cannot be stored for a long period. It has to be processed if even greater risks to humans and the environment are to be avoided. [Rybak] Russia is in the midst of an economic crisis. Does this have an effect on the destruction of nuclear weapons, as laid down in the START Treaties? [Dyakov] This is, indeed, a major financial problem. A total of 30,000 nuclear warheads are to be destroyed. Storing one gram of plutonium costs between $1 and $2 per year. The warheads contain a total of 60 tonnes of plutonium. This means that storing them alone would cost $60 to $120 million a year. The entire nuclear complex consumes some $1.5 billion per year. Using about 20 percent of capacity for disarmament would cost some $300 million per year. And the work will take 10 to 15 years. [Rybak] The United States promised Russia financial support for disarmament. [Dyakov] There is a $800 million fund. But this has been almost completely exhausted. [Rybak] The rich threshold countries are very much interested in Russian nuclear scientists. How big is the danger that they might sell their knowledge? [Dyakov] I, personally, do not know of any scientist of the "inner circle" who has emigrated to these countries. [Rybak] But an increasing number of them lose their jobs. Scientists at the secret nuclear complex Arzamas-16 were on strike recently because their salaries had not been paid. [Dyakov] The scientists' situation is very bleak. But I do not think this will lead to mass migration. [Rybak] In Germany and Poland there have been several cases of smugglers being arrested with nuclear material. [Dyakov] This was only slightly enriched uranium that is not suitable for weapons. As to the military nuclear complex, the situation is still under control. [Rybak] Corruption is on the increase within the Russian Army. All kinds of weapons are being stolen and sold. Why not nuclear weapons? [Dyakov] Your concern is justified. If everybody steals, including government personnel, you cannot expect the Army to be any better. [Rybak] The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will expire in 1995. What will happen then? [Dyakov] I think that the Treaty will simply be extended. I hope that we will finally achieve a ban on tests. [Rybak] In spite of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iraq and North Korea have almost finished developing the bomb. How can such things be prevented in the future? [Dyakov] We have to put heavy pressure on such countries, impose economic sanctions. But we must also stop discriminating against the threshold countries. We cannot modernize our arsenals and prohibit them from developing the bomb. The First World must set an example by completely destroying its nuclear weapons.
