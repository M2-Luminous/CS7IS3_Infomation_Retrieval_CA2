(a) Allowances for Job Search Outside the Commuting Area under CAETA . Allowances for job search outside the commuting area shall be an allowable activity under CAETA, only where it has been determined that the dislocated worker cannot reasonably be expected to secure suitable employment within the commuting area in which the worker resides. Procedures for determining whether a dislocated worker cannot reasonably be expected to secure suitable employment within the commuting area in which the dislocated worker resides shall be described in the grant application and shall be subject to approval by the Grant Officer. The cost of job search outside the commuting area shall be an allowable cost, but shall not provide for more than 90 percent of the cost of necessary job search expenses, and may not exceed a total of $800, unless the need for a greater amount is justified in the grant application and approved by the Grant Officer. (b) Relocation Allowances under CAETA . Relocation allowances under CAETA shall be allowable only where the eligible dislocated worker cannot reasonably be expected to secure suitable employment in the commuting area in which the worker resides and has obtained suitable employment affording a reasonable expectation of long-term duration in the area in which the worker wishes to relocate, or has obtained a bona fide offer of such employment, provided that the worker is totally separated from employment at the time relocation commences. The cost of relocation for an eligible dislocated worker shall not exceed an amount which is equal to the sum of the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in transporting the dislocated worker and the dislocated worker's family, if any, and household effects, and a lump sum relocation allowance, equivalent to three times such worker's average weekly wage. The maximum relocation allowance, however, shall not exceed $800, unless a greater amount is justified in the grant application and approved by the Grant Officer. Necessary expenses shall be travel expenses for the dislocated worker and the dislocated worker's family and for the transfer of household effects. Reasonable costs for such travel and transfer expenses shall be by the least expensive, most reasonable form of transportation. (c) Needs-related payments under CAETA and DDP . Funds from grants for CAETA and DDP shall be available for needs-related payments to enable participants to participate in and complete training or education programs under those grants, subject to the following: (1) Needs-related payments shall be provided to the participant only if the participant: (i) Does not qualify or has ceased to qualify for unemployment compensation; (ii) Has been enrolled in training programs by the end of the 13th week of an individual's initial unemployment benefit period following the layoff or termination, or, if later, the end of the 8th week after an individual is informed that a short-term layoff will exceed six months; (iii) Is making satisfactory progress in training or education programs under this section, except that an individual shall not be disqualified pursuant to this clause for a failure to participate that is not the fault of the individual; and (iv) Currently receives, or is a member of a family which currently receives, a total family income (exclusive of unemployment compensation, child support payments, and welfare payments) which, in relation to family size, is not in excess of the lower living standard income level. (2) Needs-related payments shall be equal to the higher of: (i) The applicable level of unemployment compensation; or (ii) The poverty level determined in accordance with the criteria established by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. (3) Total family income shall be reviewed periodically, based upon information obtained from participants with respect to such income and changes therein, to determine continued eligibility, or to begin payments to individuals previously found ineligible for needs-related payments under this section.
