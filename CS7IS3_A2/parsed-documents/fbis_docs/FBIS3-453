He was reacting to speculation that a group of Boereparliament members who supported AVF Gen Constand Viljoen's registration of the Freedom Front party would indeed submit a candidates list, contrary to an AVF transitional representative assembly decision last Saturday. Speaking on Radio 702 on Tuesday, Prof Boshoff said the group was still considering whether to submit such a list, and the issue was still being negotiated. "I am convinced an effort should be made to resolve the deadlock," Prof Boshoff said. "We therefore think we should continue with negotiations in own ranks to establish whether we should not participate in the election. At this moment no final decision has been made and the matter is still being discussed." Every effort should be made to prevent another split in Afrikaner ranks, but Prof Boshoff thought the main issue was whether it was possible to break the deadlock. Last Saturday the AVF's transitional representative assembly voted by 73 votes to 20 to boycott the election unless it was granted a volkstaat [homeland].
