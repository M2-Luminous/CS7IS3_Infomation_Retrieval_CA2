The official, who declined to reveal his identity, said that the PLO's main military offices were in Hammam al-Shatt suburb (16 km south of the capital, Tunis). These offices were the target of an Israeli raid 2 October 1985. He put the number of these offices at about 50, concerned with the mobilization, guidance, command, and military security of the Palestinian forces scattered throughout nine Arab countries. He stressed that the closure of these offices, including the office of the commander in chief, was also in implementation of another decision made by President 'Arafat, who is also the commander in chief of the Palestinian revolution's forces, stipulating that no official or cadre should remain in the military offices in Tunisia after 1 July. It has been noticed in PLO offices and departments that preparations are underway for the departure from Tunisia to the autonomy areas. The Palestinians have begun selling their furniture and motor vehicles, but no decision has been issued for the closure of civilian departments and offices, and there is no clear date for the cadres and employees in PLO departments to leave Tunisia. The general feeling, however, is that they will not remain in Tunisia after the end of July. Meanwhile, a highly placed Fatah source has stated that the Organization and Mobilization Office run by [Fatah] Central Committee Member Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir), the Ideological Mobilization Office run by Central Committee Member Sakhr Habash (Abu-Nizar), and the Office of Fatah's Revolutionary Council run by Hamdan 'Ashur, will remain in Tunisia until the end of this current year at least. That is in addition to the PLO departments which, it has been decided, will remain abroad. The most important of these departments are the Political Department, the Returnees Department, and the Arab and International Relations Department headed by Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin). Furthermore, AL-HAYAH has learned that the PLO has prepared a new name list of 1,000 people working in Palestinian offices and departments, mostly in Tunisia, to be submitted to Israel for approval of their entry to the autonomy areas. An official who participated in preparing that list said that it would not be handed over before approval is received from Israel for the first list of 601 officials and cadres who will accompany President 'Arafat on his journey to Jericho which was handed over recently by the PLO. He added that the new list contains information identical to that contained in the first list: full name, place of birth, office of work, and type of travel document held. Palestinian sources have confirmed that President 'Arafat's move to Jericho has been postponed further, until the beginning of next month at the earliest. They said that Palestinian and Arab figures, including Muhsin Ibrahim, who recently came to Tunis to accompany President 'Arafat on his return journey, have now left there following the second postponement.
