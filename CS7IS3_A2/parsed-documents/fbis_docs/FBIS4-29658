We have been staying at the PDK office in Phnom Penh in conformity with the Paris agreement and later, at the august decision of His Majesty the king, who has graciously given us permission to occupy this crown property so that we can maintain sustained, uninterrupted contact with the aim of gradually fostering mutual understanding pending the procecss of national reconciliation. However, the two-headed government's Ministry of the Interior has just set a deadline for us to leave Phnom Penh before 19 June. We therefore feel compelled to leave Phnom Penh. 3. We would like to thank the people in all circles for giving us all kinds of support and assistance throughout our stay in Phnom Penh. 4. We want to live with all of you in Phnom Penh forever within the framework of national reconciliation and national concord and within the framework of genuine peeace. 5. However, we are compelled to take temporary leave of you and we hope that one day we will be able to return and see you again. 6. We pray that there will be national reconciliation and national corcord in the near future so that peace returns and Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity are restored.
