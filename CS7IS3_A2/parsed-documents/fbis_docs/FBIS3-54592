Chavan, has reiterated that Rajiv Ganhi-Longowal accord [on Punjab] still holds good and will be implemented after total peace and normalcy returns to Punjab. Talking to newspersons after laying the foundation stone of a building complex at Chandigarh today, Mr. Chavan said Pakistan has launched an aggressive disinformation campaign about the alleged human rights violations in India. He pointed out that Pakistan itself is responsible for creating disturbing conditions by abetting terrorism in Punjab and some other parts of the country. Mr. Chavan stressed the need to counter this campaign by evolving a suitable strategy. Replying to a question about the future of Chandigarh, the home minister said that the prime minister is the competent authority to decide this. Replying to a question on Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Chavan said the government is willing to have a dialogue with the militants there on the condition that they first give up violence. But the talks should be within the framework of the Indian Constitution, he added.
