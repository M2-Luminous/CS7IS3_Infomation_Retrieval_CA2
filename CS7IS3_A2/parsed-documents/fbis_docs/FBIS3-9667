At the end of the talks, in particular with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and the President's General Secretary Hubert Vedrine, Mr. Jovanovic noted that by virtue of a "tacit agreement" they had not mentioned the events of recent weeks (the role played by France in the ultimatum imposed by the West on the Bosnian Serbs) and he expressed his satisfaction with the fact that France wanted to reestablish political contact with "the Yugoslav side." In fact, since the United States decided to intervene in the search for a solution to the Bosnian conflict, starting with the agreement between the Muslims and the Croats, the French foreign minister has constantly repeated that peace would not come through a bilateral agreement in a three-sided contest and that the Serbs had to be brought into the negotiations. France recalled the plan it had initiated and which the European Union [EU] had proposed in November which, in particular, suggested a progressive and conditional lifting of the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations in exchange for concessions from Serbia. It is on this aspect that Mr. Jovanovic is now insisting, stressing his disappointment that the EU had not "kept those promises" and expressing his hope that it would "again take the initiative" on this point. The trade embargo imposed on Serbia "is an anachronism," he said, and "a major obstacle to peace and its lifting is a condition for arriving at a solution." Military Logic However, the Yugoslav foreign minister did not make this a precondition to the Serbs taking part in negotiations on Bosnia to which they are being convened by the Americans. He said: "The sanctions must be lifted completely in parallel with the implementation of a peace plan. If we conclude a peace plan, we must automatically start to remove the sanctions and they must have been lifted completely by the time the Serbian side has met the commitments it signed up to in the peace plan." He added: "If we do this, the Muslims will be stripped of any remaining hopes they have of winning the war and obtaining a unitarian Bosnia thanks to sanctions." Mr. Jovanovic did not want to "speak on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs" on the Bosnian issue, and said that Belgrade cannot force them to accept something they do not want. When his opinion was asked as to whether some of their leaders, such as General Mladic who commands the Bosnian Serbs, are not opposing any negotiated settlement, he replied that Mladic "is a military man following a military logic," and that, as a result, his comments cannot be considered to be "official" on political issues. He added: "What counts is Radovan Karadzic and his closest advisers." Mr. Jovanovic does not therefore speak for them. He noted that the Bosnian Serbs had refused to enter the Muslim-Croat federation signed last week in Washington, but, in his opinion, they remain "open" to any initiative geared toward finding a solution. He added: "The problem is that the Americans are inviting them to join the process without telling them what is being proposed. What they need is more details on the proposal that is being made to them." Mr. Jovanovic would only (cautiously) discuss one of the points up for negotiation: the distribution of territory between the Muslim-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serbs. He reiterated that the Serbs had previously accepted to "offer" 33.3 percent of Bosnia to the Muslims (and 17.5 percent to the Croats) and considered that "it is not impossible" for them to again accept such a partitioning after fresh negotiations. Without any doubt, Mr. Jovanovic will have met with the support on this point of Alain Juppe, who had declared himself in favor of this distribution of territory when the Muslim-Croat negotiations started, which in his opinion not go ahead at the expense of the third party. Krajina Where the fate of Krajina is concerned (the region of Croatia controlled by the breakaway Serbs and for which Zagreb wants to reestablish its sovereignty), Mr. Jovanovic was again careful not to reveal Belgrade's strategy: "We do not take sides. The negotiations must take place between Zagreb and Knin (the Serbian stronghold in Krajina)." He moreover stated that the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations on Serbia "were not related to the Bosnian crisis," although he added that, when asked by the EU, Belgrade had agreed to "make an effort" on the other crises in the former Yugoslavia with a view to the progressive lifting of sanctions. Belgrade, he said, is ready to "aid in a process of normalization," in particular focusing on restoring communications, on condition that the Croats "do not immediately complicate" the issue by straightaway raising the political issue of the status of Krajina. Hesitation by France However, it is this problem that the breakaway Krajina Serbs are raising themselves when they oppose, for example, the reopening of the Zagreb-Belgrade highway, provided for in an agreement between the two capitals, claiming they will set up border posts on the section that runs through their region. Mr. Jovanovic stressed that Croatia was only recognized by the United Nations after the decision had been made to send UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] troops into Krajina (the Vance plan), "that is, when Croatia had not established its sovereignty over the region." Zagreb obviously disputes this version, basing its argument on other UN resolutions that assume that Croatia will retain the same borders it had in the old Yugoslav federation. France appears hesitant about expressing a clear opinion on this issue, which is again becoming essential to finding a solution. As for the United States, its position has been laid down if we are to believe the declarations made on Sunday to representatives of the Krajina Serbs by the U.S. ambassador to Zagreb: "I told them very clearly that the United States and Russia and the whole of the international community consider that the zones under UN protection are part of Croatia and that there is no possibility of a political solution which would make Krajina independent or a part of Serbia."
