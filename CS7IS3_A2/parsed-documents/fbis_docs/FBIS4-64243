Under the Soviet system, Russia was as advanced in these fields as members of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which groups together the world's 24 most developed countries. Now, it faces structural changes likely to retain only those aspects of science which can help the country's renewal, says the report, based on studies carried out in the second half of 1993. Under the communists' centralised system the sector had developed out of all proportion to the country's Gross National Product, and spending on military applications must now be cut to allow civilian development, it said. Current priorities are modernisation of the health and social security system, energy, telecommunications and pollution. Russian science, once cut off from the international community, can now benefit from the new contacts and collaboration with other countries, despite fears about a "brain drain," it comments.
