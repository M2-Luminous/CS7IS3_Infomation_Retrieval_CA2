Since the beginning of 1994, more than 150 business people from Hong Kong, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Italy, Malaysia and Taiwan have come to Tianjin for business inspections and trade talks. Ninety-five contracts were signed in the first ten days of January, involving a negotiated investment volume of up to 168 million U.S. dollars in the aggregate. Meanwhile, billions of yuan worth of agreements and letters of intent have been reached between the city and overseas companies. Both contracts and funds involved are equal to those for the whole year of 1991. Mayor of the municipality Zhang Lichang described the inflow of overseas funds as a result of the city's bold reform measures designated for a market economy. He said his city is attractive to overseas investors because of its ideal geographical location, advanced transportation, rich natural resources, high-grade technologies, and well-trained personnel. Following the northward movement of foreign investments coming to China, the mayor said, Tianjin has become a new favorite for investors across the world. General manager of the Japanese Mitsubishi Corporation Kawamura Hiroshi, regretful for his company's belated arrival to invest in Tianjin, said he was convinced that much of China's development potential lies in the north, with Tianjin the most hopeful contender to lead the northern economic take-off. While facing competition from other provinces in the drive for overseas funds, Tianjin's success, starting from the sound foundation laid down over the past few years, will hinge on the established policies of accelerating development through more foreign investments, the mayor said. As part of the efforts to expand business overseas, Mayor Zhang led a trade delegation to the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Hong Kong. During the tour, he had talks with chiefs of more than 40 financial groups about conducting business cooperations. As a result, agreements were reached on more than 20 cooperative projects, which involved more than four billion yuan in overseas investments. Thanks to these efforts, Tianjin has become better known worldwide, which in turn benefits the city economically. According to a recent meeting on foreign trade and economic relations, the city's target for 1994 is five billion U.S. dollars of contracted overseas investment. Meeting participants were told that the bulk of the funds will go to the construction of infrastructures, capital industrial projects, the upgrading and renovation of old enterprises, the development of real estate, and the service industry. As mapped out in the city's development strategy, Tianjin will complete the renovation of more than seven million old and unsafe houses within seven years. And eight years is the maximum period in which to finish upgrading of old enterprises. The city also envisages setting up a new development zone in its coastal areas along the Bohai Sea.
