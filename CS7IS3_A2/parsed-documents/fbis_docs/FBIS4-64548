Ayaz declared that it is out of the question to retract the decision on the appointments. The campaign launched by 80 nationalist-conservative TPP deputies following Ayaz's dismissal of three high-level bureaucrats, who are said to be religious sect members, triggered a deep crisis in the party. Kocaeli Deputy Ismail Amasyali, who is leading the campaign within the TPP, said: "The minister should either make a statement to satisfy us, or he should reinstate the officials. Otherwise, the assembly group is determined to overthrow him." Ayaz, on the other hand, noted: "These changes were effected with the knowledge of the prime minister, on professional grounds. There is no question of retracting the decision." [passage omitted]
