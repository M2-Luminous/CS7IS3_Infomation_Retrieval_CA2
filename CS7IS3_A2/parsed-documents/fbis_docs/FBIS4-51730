Recalling that the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) at a press conference on April 25 on the first anniversary of its inauguration expressed the determination to intensify the anti-U.S., anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle, saying there is nothing to expect from the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime, the analyst goes on: The U.S. imperialists are deploying massive reinforcements of the aggression forces including Patriot missiles in South Korea, crying for the resumption of the "Team Spirit" nuclear war exercises and staging war gambles against the DPRK almost every day together with the puppets, while putting an undisguised pressure on the DPRK in the international arena over its "nuclear issue". Unable to tolerate the dignity and interests of the nation being encroached upon by outside forces and the beloved fellow countrymen being threatened with a nuclear disaster, the South Korean students have risen up valiantly in the anti-U.S., anti-war struggle to remove their root cause. The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique are now running about like a headless chicken to block the righteous and patriotic struggle of the students. The traitor Kim Yong-sam clique ruthlessly cracking down on their righteous struggle will face curses and denunciation by the whole nation. The just struggle of the South Korean students cannot be blocked with anything.
