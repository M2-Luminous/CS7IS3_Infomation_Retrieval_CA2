FR941007-2-00062 FR941007-2-00037 [PR Docket No. 94&hyph;105; DA 94&hyph;1054] Commercial Mobile Radio Services; California State Petition To Retain Regulatory Authority Over Intrastate Cellular Service Rates AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Notice; extension of time and permitting replies to revised petitions. SUMMARY: The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate and entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. States were given the opportunity to file petitions for the authority to continue regulating these intrastate rates. California filed such a petition and subsequently filed revisions to that petition. This Order extends the deadlines for reply comments in partial response to a request filed by the People of the State of California and the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California and allows additional time to comment on the revised petition. This extension will provide interested parties enough time to complete their review and submit meaningful replies and additional comments on the issues we raised in this proceeding. DATES: Reply comments must be filed on or before October 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send reply comments to the Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Regina Harrison, Private Radio Bureau, Land Mobile and Microwave Division, (202) 632&hyph;7125. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Matter of Petition of People of the State of California and the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California To Retain Regulatory Authority Over Intrastate Cellular Service Rates. Order Extending Time and Permitting Replies to Revised Petition Adopted: September 26, 1994; Released: September 26, 1994. By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau: 1. Petitioners, People of the State of California and the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California (collectively California) have filed an emergency motion for a 45-day extension of time from the October 4, 1994 deadline for filing reply comments. 1 For the reasons given below, we grant California some, but not all, of the relief requested. 1 Emergency Motion of the People of the State of California and the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California for a 45-Day Extension of Time To File Reply Comments (dated Sept. 19, 1994) (Motion). 2. The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate and entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. A state could, however, obtain intrastate rate regulatory authority by fling a properly supported petition with the FCC. 2 States with existing rate regulation could petition by August 10, 1994 to continue regulating, and would obtain a stay of statutory preemption until the FCC acted. The Commission has one year in which to rule on the petition and to decide any reconsideration. California filed such a petition on August 9, 1994. Pursuant to the Commission's rules, 3 interested parties had 30 days in which to comment and then 15 days for replies. 2 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;66, Title VI, ยง6002(b)(2), 107 Stat. 312, 392 (1993), amending Section 332(c)(3) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 332(c)(3). 3 Second Report and Order, Implementation of Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act, Regulatory Treatment of Mobile Services, 9 FCC Rcd 1411, 1522&hyph;23 (1994), 59 Fed.
