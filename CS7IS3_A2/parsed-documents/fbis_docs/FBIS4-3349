The fact that the contract system of the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation has aroused the interest of famous professors and entrepreneurs at home and abroad indicates that the contract system is of positive significance not only in China, but also around the world. In particular, the contract system of the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation has given brilliant answers to some issues of a general character which are faced by both Chinese and foreign enterprises. In my opinion, the current international symposium has been successful. The success lies in the consensus reached by the participants on several important issues concerning how enterprises should be properly run. 1. The Management Ideology of Men Being the Foundation [subhead] At present, various countries realize that the fundamental factor of running enterprises properly rests in fully releasing the initiative of staff and workers. Both the theory of "taking people as the foundation" proposed by the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation and that of "behavioral science" put forward by the Western countries are primarily aimed at fully releasing the initiative, wisdom, and creativity of staff and workers. This is a common understanding and is also the most important hallmark of modern enterprise management. Therefore, an enterprise that fails to release the initiative of its staff and workers cannot be called a modern enterprise, and an enterprise system under which the initiative of staff and workers cannot be released is not worthy of the name of a modern enterprise system. This concept is accepted by more and more people in China and the world. The more modern an enterprise is, the more necessary it is to fully release the initiative of its staff and workers. The view that the more modern the technology and equipment in an enterprise, the smaller the role of men, obviously does not accord with the trend of the times. An important point of the management ideology that men are the foundation is reflected in the participation in enterprise policy decisions by staff and workers. In order to release the initiative of staff and workers, it is necessary to enhance their "awareness of being masters of the country." To enhance such awareness, it is necessary to let them assume the role of "masters." In the boards of supervisors in German enterprises, half of the members are representatives of staff and workers, who, being masters of half the enterprises, are directly participating in and supervising major policy decisions of the enterprises. The system of a workers' representative conference practiced in the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation also allows staff and workers to directly participate in and supervise enterprise policies. This is an important foundation leading to the success achieved by the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation. Therefore, the participation in and supervision of enterprise policies by staff and workers have become a significant trend of modern enterprise management. It is also an important yardstick for measuring whether an enterprise is practicing a modern enterprise system. 2. State-Owned Enterprises Should Properly Resolve the Issue of Mixing Up Government Administration With Enterprise Management The issue of mixing up government administration with enterprise management in making policy decisions universally exists in state- owned enterprises all over the world, which is the root cause of low efficiency and poor performance in state-owned enterprises. Owing to the failure of resolving this issue, an upsurge of privatization was set off around the world. In China, it is necessary to develop the private economy, but it is impossible to let all enterprises privatize. Likewise, it is impossible for all state-owned enterprises in various countries to privatize at present. Hence, we should conscientiously study the knotty problem of mixing up government administration with enterprise management. The Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation has made a breakthrough in resolving this problem by practicing a contract system, and the key of the breakthrough rests in the rational definitions regarding the relationship between enterprises and government in terms of responsibility, power, and benefit, so that the ownership and management right of state assets are really separated. As a result, the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation is robust in its independent operation. In fact, it is not difficult to separate the ownership from management rights in the private economy, but it is very difficult to do this in the state-owned economic sector. The contract system practiced in the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation is a useful experiment, and it can be called a new contribution that the enterprise has made. 3. The Incentive Mechanism in Enterprises International experience shows that the incentive mechanism in private enterprises refers to the property mechanism and market mechanism. However, this incentive mechanism is chiefly effective for owners and operators, and not for staff and workers. Recently, a new wage system was introduced in Britain, under which the employers of industrial and commercial enterprises no longer pay all the originally fixed wages to staff and workers. Instead, they pay only two-thirds of their wages, while the remaining one-third is linked to the profits of enterprises and their amounts are decided by the size of enterprise profits. Thus, the mechanism of distribution linked to performance is introduced into the labor market in determining laborers' wages. This change has shown that the incentive mechanism in enterprises is developing in the direction of mobilizing the enthusiasm of owners, operators, and workers. The success of the distribution system of the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation lies in its reflection of mutual existence and common prosperity of the interests between government, enterprises, staff, and workers. This is an orientation for both state-owned and private enterprises. The Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation is an example of China's enterprise reform, and the contract system is a focal point of the reform in which "the contract is regarded as a foundation," as people in the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation put it. The contract system and the complete set of measures relating to it practiced in the corporation is of universal significance to enterprise reform in China. Just as Mr. Chao Yao-tung from Taiwan said in his thesis presented to the symposium, "it was necessary to thoroughly put into practice the spirit of the contract system," and "since the spirit of the contract system implies independent operation, self-accumulation, self-transformation, and self- development, and advocates separating ownership from management rights, then the owners of enterprises should give full and complete authority to the managers." Of course, there is still something imperfect in it. That is why we should adopt a positive attitude to making it perfect. What needs emphasizing is that, taken from a development point of view, the perfection of the contract system must be connected with the institution of a modern enterprise system. That means the two systems should be joined together, and this calls for carrying out in-depth reform in various aspects, including the system of ownership and management rights, the system of organization, the system of management, and so on, and genuinely establishing an operational mechanism which is suited to the requirements of a socialist market economy. No operational mode is invariable. The ever-developing market economy always calls for us to constantly accept new things and quicken the pace of reform. An important aspect of the modern enterprise system is to practice a joint-stock system in enterprises and set up limited liability companies. As a matter of fact, a contract system does not reject a joint-stock system, and they are compatible. The model of "combining the contract system with the joint-stock system," initiated by the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation, is the best proof of it. In this sense, its contract system bears a scientific and modern character to a certain extent.
