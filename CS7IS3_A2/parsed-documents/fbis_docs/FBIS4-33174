Surplus liquidity increased as the country found itself forced to reduce production and imports because of the termination of the fair and fruitful ties that had existed with the now dissolved socialist bloc. The country's purchasing power was further reduced as a result of the tightening of the U.S. economic blockade. Eventually, supplies dwindled, and this led to Cuban workers who found that they held large amounts of money they could not spend. Excess currency in circulation undermines the motivation to work and to produce, and it fuels the black market which benefits a group of citizens who dedicate themselves to profiting from the needs of the majority. One way of collecting this excess money is by increasing prices on nonessential products and service fees, while making adjustments designed to protect certain sectors of the population. In addition, the government will introduce these reforms gradually and will continuing subsidizing staples to the tune of 365 million pesos a year. This helps the family economy a great deal. Today's cigarette price hike affects 3 million smokers, but addicts as well as those who do not have this harmful habit will continue receiving a monthly quota at prices below the new price, but always higher than the current price. Another reform that went into effect today has to do with new prices on liquor -- a category that rightly is considered nonessential. The impact of this price hike will not affect the entire population. Today, 1 June, the fees for air and sea transportation to and from the Isle of Youth will also be increased, but the increases will be relatively modest. With the implementation today of the new prices on cigarettes, liquor, and transportation to the Isle of Youth begins the first phase of a plan that will cover other nonessential products and services, although there will be some exceptions based on specific situations. These new prices and fees represent an increase in family expenditures, but everybody knows that the funds collected will be used to benefit society.
