During his visit to Bonn, Aranibar encouraged German business people to invest in Bolivia. Aranibar, who had a chance to address a large audience of private German business people during a meeting at the Confederation of German Industry and Commerce Chambers, tried to interest business people in a series of privatization projects and some significant industrial projects. During a news conference this afternoon, Aranibar explained that he had told his audience about the capitalization project involving some public enterprises in the natural gas and oil, electric power, telecommunications, railway, smelting, and air transportation fields. The German business people also showed great interest in the plan to build a gas pipeline between Santa Cruz central Bolivia and Sao Paulo, Brazil. This represents a "megaproject" for Bolivia and is necessary for Brazil's energy supply system. The Germans also were interested in the plans for Ilo, the Peruvian town on the Pacific coast where Bolivia, after an agreement signed with the Peruvian Government, intends to build an industrial and tourism free zone and hopes to turn it into an important port for the shipment of its exports. Aranibar, who believes the Germans are the right people for this project due to their experience and technology, also will show the plans for Ilo port to business people in Berlin, with whom he will meet on 27 April in the morning, and especially to those in Hamburg, the great hanseatic town and German port, where he will end his visit that same afternoon. During his two-day visit to Bonn, Aranibar had a tight agenda that ended on 25 April with a meeting with his German counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, with whom he signed a financial cooperation agreement for 50 million German marks ($30 million), earmarked for potable water and sewage infrastructure projects, as well as for the preservation of natural resources. Aranibar announced that the German-Bolivian Joint Commission will meet next July in Germany to establish the framework for future cooperation between the two countries, among them cooperation for the institutional consolidation of the recently created La Paz Justice Ministry. According to the minister, during all the meetings held in Bonn with politicians, legislators, representatives of organizations or business people he found great interest and understanding for the efforts toward political and economic reform in Bolivia.
