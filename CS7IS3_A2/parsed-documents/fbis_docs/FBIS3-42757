Of 3572 Sajudis members polled, 304 stated that Sajudis should cease its activities, only 18 of those polled were prepared to reorganize Sajudis into a political organization, and 344 expressed the view that Sajudis should remain a mass political movement. V. Landsbergis, the honorary chairman of Sajudis, opened the proceedings by asserting that Sajudis had always been consistent, that during its five years of activity it had created and nurtured its party--the National Union [Tevynes Sajunga]. In V. Landsbergis' opinion, that was the final task of Sajudis, and it was now necessary to think about new forms of activity which would help defend against internal and external threats. The professor mentioned several of these in his speech--the "Zhirinovskyization" of Russia, as well as her efforts to acquire the mandate of peacekeeper, to which the statements of the Russian and British foreign ministers in the English press testified, the attempts to recreate the Bolshevik party and soviet rule in Lithuania, as well as the actual readiness of the LDDP [Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party] to accept the Russian yoke. V. Landsbergis cited the rejuvenation of Lithuania as the primary assignment for the new Sajudis. Sajudis could look after volunteers, farmers, and the Lithuanian schools. It could rally the forces of the political right. "Sajudis must be Lithuania's mainstay," said V. Landsbergis. In an analysis of the results of the last two years of Sajudis activity, Chairman A. Katkus of the Sajudis Seimas Council said that those were years of intense political struggle, which were overshadowed by the victory of the LDDP. "The leaders of Sajudis could be blamed, or even condemned, but the clock cannot be turned back, nor the previous status quo restored," said A. Katkus. In his opinion, Sajudis had made mistakes--it had not psychologically prepared the people for reforms, it had not taken over the means of mass communication, and it had dissociated itself from Supreme Council deputies that it had formerly supported. A. Katkus also informed the delegates to the congress of his resignation from the Sajudis chairmanship. A wide range of opinions were expressed in the discussions that took place after lunch. They were greeted by the delegates either with approving applause, or with a stamping of feet and retorts indicating dissatisfaction. Much criticism was directed at S. Valentinavicius and R. Gajauskaite, ex-leaders of the Vilnius city Sajudis council; according to V. Narbutas, they had expressed extremist opinions and had wanted to separate Sajudis from the National Union. V. Nezgada said that no party can claim the Sajudis name. "We may help the National Union, but we cannot cater to it exclusively. Conversely, it cannot adopt the attitude that 'we can do whatever we want with Sajudis.'" In V. Nezgada's opinion, this congress can make no decisions concerning the future of Sajudis, for two-thirds of the deputies belong to the National Union, which is already speaking of future victories, though there is no way of knowing whether they will take place or not. One delegate asked why Sajudis should not remain what it has always been, a mass political movement, and further, why it was that people who called themselves democrats could not seem to tolerate dissenting opinions and began to stamp their feet, while others said that those Sajudis members who are trying to seize Sajudis were functionaries who even dealt in threats. The vote on the future of Sajudis confirmed the results of the poll of the Sajudis rank and file--468 delegates came out in favor of making Sajudis a mass organization, 30 wanted Sajudis to become a mass political organization, and 32 felt that Sajudis should cease its activities. After the results of the voting were announced, member of the Seimas K. Uoka took the floor and read a statement that expressed disagreement with any change in the status of Sajudis. According to the authors of the statement, prior to the congress in-depth discussions of the future of Sajudis had been avoided, there had been no assessment of the mistakes made during the period in power, nor of the reasons for the defeat in the Seimas elections and of the loss of the press. The statement went on to say that a new group was being organized, which will be open to present and future members of Sajudis. By the way, at the 3rd congress of Sajudis, which took place on December 14-15 of 1991, K. Uoka said that Sajudis was torturing Lithuania with scripts and speeches, upbraided the then-current government of G. Vagnorius, and said that it had to be kept in line by "strong blows from outside." The speech K. Uoka gave then was greeted with a thunderous ovation, and soon signs appeared, reading "K. Uoka for Chairman of Sajudis." When asked by LIETUVOS RYTAS at the press conference that took place Saturday evening for his opinion about the decision of his colleague K. Uoka to create a new Sajudis group, V. Landsbergis said that it would be a new organization, and would not be Sajudis. To do this, in the professor's opinion, would be a political mistake--just like the one K. Ouka made when during the presidential elections he announced his candidacy and thereby split the rightist forces. According to V. Landsbergis, Sajudis should remain a movement uniting those who dread the word "party," or who are not yet inclined to join any party. According to A. Katkus, a participant in the press conference, it is difficult to create a viable organizational structure within Sajudis because its membership is concerned solely with Lithuanian independence. In recalling the suggestions that were made at the 3rd Sajudis congress to recast Sajudis into a party, V. Landsbergis observed that at that time Sajudis was affected by destructive forces, and that in the meantime, the National Union had matured as the Sajudis party. "That was combined with political blows and losses," emphasized V. Landsbergis. The congress confirmed the Sajudis platform and bylaws, according to which former CPSU-Lithuanian CP secretaries of the national, district, and city organizations, current members of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party, and former KGB employees were barred from participating in Sajudis. R. Batura, the holder of a doctorate in history, was elected chairman of the Sajudis council. The Sajudis council also includes Seimas members A. Racas, I. Uzdavinys, and A. Vaisnoras. The congress accepted several resolutions, statements, and a declaration. Among other things, the last states that "the day of the old forces is drawing to a close. We are convinced that by peaceful, democratic means, we will soon reach the point at which the helm of the country will be taken by people who are genuinely concerned with the welfare and fate of the nation." The resolution "On Lack of Confidence in Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party's Economic Policy," like a resolution of the National Union conference, came out in favor of holding Seimas and municipal elections concurrently.
