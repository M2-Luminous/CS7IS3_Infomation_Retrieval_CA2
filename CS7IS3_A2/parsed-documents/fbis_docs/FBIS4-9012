Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov, head of the Bulgarian delegation to the talks, and Deutsche Bank Director Peter Tilch, coordinator of the London Club of commercial bankers, today briefed the press on the key parameters of the draft agreement, radio correspondent Aleksandur Vladkov reported from Frankfurt. Bulgaria's debt to the London Club totals $8,700 million, of which about $2,000 million in arrears of interest. 25 percent of the debt is repayable in the short term. About $850 million are to be paid in debt service by the end of 1994. "So far the European Union, G-24, the IMF and the World Bank have promised and will extend about $1,000 million," Aleksandrov said, "so that, thanks to the international financial and economic institutions, Bulgaria will be in a position to make these payments." According to Mr. Tilch, there are different options for the implementation of the deal, guaranteeing Bulgaria at least 36 percent debt reduction. Depending on the choice of option -- repurchasing of debt, re-investment by foreign creditors, etc. Bulgaria could get a debt reduction of over 50 percent, Mr. Tilch said. It is too early to cite an exact figure because it is not known which option will be chosen by the 400-odd banks. "We wish to establish a lasting presence in business with Bulgaria and will act accordingly. In its present version the agreement is a real breakthrough in the complicated foreign debt problem. I hope that by the end of May you will have settled all technicalities. A long-term agreement with Bulgaria would greatly encourage financial and industrial circles showing interest in investing in Bulgaria", Deutsche Bank director told national radio. On his part Finance Minister Aleksandrov expressed satisfaction with the outcome of three years of negotiations and observed that this was the Bulgarian Government's most important task in the foreign economic field. Mr. Aleksandrov noted the special understanding shown by the international financial institutions for Bulgaria's present problems which has found expression in the credits they have extended. "The rest remains with us -- to step up the economic reform and above all privatization," Finance Minister Aleksandrov said. Two days ago Bulgaria reached an agreement on the debt to its official creditors of the Paris Club.
