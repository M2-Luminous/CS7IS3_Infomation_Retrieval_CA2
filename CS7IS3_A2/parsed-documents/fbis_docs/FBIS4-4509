Actually, the prince asserted his endorsement of the UN stance following his return from Thailand where he paid a two-day visit at the invitation of Thai counterpart Prasong Sunsiri. UNHCR High Commissioner Mrs. Sadako Ogata, in a message to the Thai diplomacy chief, expressed her anxiety over the repatriation by the Thai Government of 25,000 Cambodian refugees to another Khmer Rouge-held zone, instead of regions controlled by the Royal Government of Cambodia. The Khmer Royal Armed Forces on 19 March took control of Pailin, the "capital" of the Khmer Rouge, prompting an influx of 25,000 Cambodian refugees, most of whom were Khmer Rouge families, into Thai territory. Thailand has lately begun to send those people back to a Khmer Rouge-held area at Phnum Malai hill, 45 km north of Pailin.
