Not a few people are of the opinion that bankruptcy would have been more appropriate than a rescue. However, at the same time, ever so many fewer argue for setting in place an infrastructure to eliminate from the market the impact of a securities firm's going bankrupt. Any argument for the appropriateness of bankruptcy will never be anything more than irrational unless policies are put in place to avoid securities settlement risks along with mechanisms to isolate the impact of bankruptcies from market trading. The Myth of No Bankruptcies in the Securities Industry "Compared to a bank, the bankruptcy of a securities company would have trifling impact." One hears this said again and again of late. This may be true, if we take into consideration the degree impact such a bankruptcy would have on the financial order. However, in reality the issue is not something that can be written off so easily. To begin with, as is the case with financial institutions and the funds settlement system, settlements involving securities transactions (securities settlements) are bolstered by a myth of no bankruptcies among securities companies. Nevertheless, these last one or two years the mechanism of funds settlement has been modified through a process "best called a revolutionary reform in awareness" (a top-ranking city bank). Specifically, the change involves the establishment of same day settlements in the all-bank system which handles funds settlements between banks for domestic exchange, on-line CD's, etc. The essence of this is something that determines the actual goal (conceptually already existing) of not giving rise to obstacles in the settlement system for participating financial institutions even should unexpected circumstances arise and it is certainly correct to label this self-denial of the myth of no bankruptcies. As a philosophy underpinning the framework of the settlement system, it is nothing short of a Copernican revolution. As for converting to this, securities settlements remain as before. Bankruptcies of securities companies are not actually being contemplated. This is despite talk of the business slump among securities companies. For example, one person connected with the securities business said about the actual situation, "In the final analysis, the securities industry has not rid itself of the idea that it is a private market." This is a cold indication of the thinking that, even though irregularities do at times occur in settlements related to securities transactions, because they are dealing with their Kabuto-cho confederates, this somehow can be solved through a few secret incantations. The origin of this thinking stems from a total belief in the myth of no bankruptcies. However, should a securities company one day go bankrupt in carrying out a large volume of securities transactions, talk would change. Surely the facile conception of "What might happen?" would be shaken by a harsh reality. What is the problem with the current securities settlement system? The possibility that a chained series of failures might occur in the system. Had Cosmo Gone Bankrupt Faced with an operational crisis, Cosmo Securities avoided the worst through rescue measures on the part of Daiwa Bank. Although popular opinion is varied regarding this, more than a few feel they should have been allowed to go bankrupt. However, there is another side to this. What would actually have happened if Cosmo had become technically insolvent? Under the current securities settlement system the failure of Cosmo probably would have reverberated through the system and in the worst case other securities firms could have been drawn into the same position. Had that happened, the current securities settlement system could not have quarantined the risk. Let's try to look this in concrete terms. The Cosmo Securities operational crisis came to light on 13 August. What would have been the outcome of the stock and bond trades made by Cosmo up to the day the company would have entered default? Stock settlements take place on the fourth day following the trade. Consequently, assuming that all were business days, Cosmo would have been unable to meet settlement following the 13th for transactions made on 10, 11, and 12 August. Thus, the company would have been unable to pay the proceeds of trades made in behalf of sellers of stock and could not have fulfilled its obligations on demand. Which is to say, because in four-day settlements the certificates are also transferred on the fourth day, in a manner of speaking we could say that the flow of funds and certificates would have come to a halt. However, in terms of risk, being unable to sell when one wants to sell causes harm and being unable to purchase when one wants to buy entails losses as well. This is not all. Strictly speaking, this is tantamount to default. This is because securities firms use checks for funds settlements for some situations. For example, the date when Cosmo Securities would have had to issue a check as settlement for a 10 August buy was 13 August, the fourth day. The date when the bank (the bank having the account of the seller in the transaction) would have taken delivery of the check, would have honored it and transferred it into the seller's account would have been one day later, 14 August. Consequently, although formally speaking it appears that the funds settlement occurs the same day as the certificate transfer, in reality the seller would have received the funds paid by Cosmo Securities the day after the certificate had been transferred. Moreover, what we must consider here is the fact that Cosmo Securities was bankrupt. Assuming that funds remain in the account of a business that is bankrupt makes no sense. Rather, it is more realistic to assume that the funds to cover the amount of the check would not have been in the account. Consequently, if we understand this fact, the bank on which the check was drawn would return the check issued between banks in the funds settlement marked insufficient funds. Consequently, Cosmo Securities would have been in a stop payment status and in the end the recipient of the funds would have sustained a loss. Put another way, settlement would not occur on the fourth day following a sale and would not actually happen until the sixth day, allowing two days for the check to clear, at which time the trade would fall through. Thus, the settlement risk following the transfer of the certificate would have continued two days beyond the settlement date. Are the Emergency Reserve Funds Adequate? It is not that this issue of securities settlement risk has not been debated before now. On the contrary, an international inquiry was conducted in 1989 into creating an infrastructure that would avoid settlement risks and a report was issued on the securities settlement system as it then was. This was the initiative of the "Group of 30" (G30) leading countries concerned with securities. The report made nine recommendations aimed at improving the securities settlement system. Those applying to Japan were: (1) netting; and (2) the simultaneous settlement of funds and securities. First, (1) netting being a structure for settling the claims and obligations existing between parties A and B involved in a transaction. Although netting between two parties (bilateral netting) is already widely employed in Japan, the problem is conducting multilateral transactions involving three or more parties (multilateral netting). There is no way to put this into practice other than to establish a settlement agency to function between the parties to the transaction. Thus, the settlement agency and the company representative involved in a transaction could draw on an emergency fund earmarked for settlements where there is nonpayment of settlement funds. In reality, arrangements would be made in advance to replenish the fund in anticipation of payments that would draw down the fund. Although such a system is widespread among the securities markets of Europe and the United States, regrettably it has been introduced into Japan only in the Money Futures Exchange. The Tokyo Stock Exchange appears to have a function similar to this; however, the reality is that its fund must be judged unreliable. The emergency fund of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is money for losses and indemnification for breach of contract now totals only a little less than 6 billion yen. This amount is actually quite paltry were truly large stock transactions to be involved. Total losses stemming from default on trades is the "net base." Moreover, such losses are indemnified by this reserve fund for "occasions when liquidation or full payment of losses due to nonpayment of debt cannot be made in accordance with the principle of good will, or with business and other rules." Consequently, on the surface we cannot easily compare transaction amounts. Although we must not lose sight of this point, at the same time, as we discussed earlier, in the case of stock trades with settlement on the fourth day, it is unforgivable that there should be a one day difference between payment and transfer that could give rise to losses. Is 6 billion yen enough to cover any losses? There are those within the securities industry who are saying, "The fund does not in reality suppose the possibility of bankruptcies" (leading securities firm). According to the rules of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the governing body may decide that the exchange can gather fresh funds from company representatives in case the emergency fund is drawn down. However, one must assume that were a major securities bankruptcy to occur, a focused and unlimited fund would be required. The burden placed on the company representative would not be trivial. Government Bond Trading Moving Toward Delivery versus Payment Most importantly, a discussion of the fund scope is not the primary consideration from the viewpoint of alleviating securities settlement risks. The reason is that this is nothing more than after-the-fact management once a stop payment occurs. Instead, the highest priority topic in terms of a risk policy is "preventing the occurrence of risk through eliminating the time differential between the two separate settlements of the funds and the certificates." The degree of settlement risk is manifested in the mathematical formula, "the pending settlement amount times the pending settlement time." Consequently, reducing the amount of the pending settlement and shortening the pending settlement time would be effective in lowering the risk occurrence rate. If transfer of the negotiable securities by the seller and settlement of the funds by the buyer are accomplished simultaneously, theoretically the risk drops to zero. Herein is the reason for the G30's recommending the implementation of provision (2), simultaneous securities and funds settlements (popularly called DVP [delivery versus payment]). Accordingly, if we examine Japan's securities settlement system, at first glance it appears that simultaneous settlement is a reality. That is because certificates and funds have to be liquidated on the same day through a settlement structure that is the fourth day for stocks and five and 10 days for BB (broker's broker) settlements involving government bond trades. However, we discussed earlier that it is not a reality in the case of stock trades. For fixed period contracts involving government bond trades that are handled as broker's broker trades, settlements are made for a set day double the five days for stock trades. As for the settlement method, although in general account transfers are used, in some cases checks are used. In these cases, the buyer's funds settlement is delivered by check the day before settlement. For this reason, once the check drawn on the bank maintaining the company's account is presented to the bank holding the seller's account, in reality a one-day delay occurs before the money is actually deposited into the seller's account. If we consider this in parallel with the transfer of the certificate, we find that with the buyer delivers a check one day prior to transfer and that there is still a one-day delay pending settlement. Moreover, in terms of account transfers, certificate and funds settlement times do not coincide at all. Moreover, this does not suffice as an explanation for broker's broker transactions. Which is to say, this is because in these cases the buyer and seller have not made a mutual contract on the same trade. For example, in the case of Nippon Sogo Securities, which maintains a representative broker's broker market and which has a dealer's license, the company can make trades independently and do settlements standing between buyer and seller. That is, the seller sells to Nippon Sogo Securities even as on the other side the buyer buys from them. Consequently, should it happen one day that the company does not receive the certificates and furthermore that the funds settlement is delayed, the stop payment order for the debt falls to Nippon Sogo Securities. In this sense, as with funds settlements with domestic exchanges, it must cover the occurrence directly with the settling parties. Should we employ forward leaning evaluation of the current structure as "a structure in which unexpected situations are quarantined," or, improve the system with the judgment that "each contract carries risk?" The latter is now the goal being concretely examined by the involved parties. The basis for this is the fundamental recognition that, "for not being a rational system, the market will be shaken by unexpected events. It is extremely important that unexpected situations which occur for specific securities firms not reverberate through the market" (a leading securities firm). Accordingly, what is currently being put into place is the move to DVP. The concept is that simultaneous settlements will take place with funds transfers going through Bank of Japan (BOJ) current deposit accounts and certificate transfers through the BOJ network. For government bond bookkeeping, a government bonds transfer settlement system was introduced in 1980 and since May 1990 the transfer business has been on-line using the BOJ network. Regarding certificate transfers there are no real problems. Driving a Porsche on Farm Paths Securities firms and banks that participate in the broker's broker market and who carry out major trades in government bonds have current deposit and government bond accounts with the BOJ. In addition, if market participants who have government bond accounts but not current deposit accounts could make use of accounts with "proxy settlement banks," there would be no problems. The introduction of a simultaneous settlement system which ties together both infrastructures concerned with settlements is planned for this coming March [1994]. Tokyo Stock Exchange government bond transactions similarly are being made DVP. For the leading security firms involved in the government bond market, one-time settlement amounts reach several trillion yen. To respond to emergencies in this gigantic market, major moves toward conversion to DVP next year are under way. Most important, settlement risks inherent in securities trades despite this do not disappear entirely. As ever, a pending settlement time for stock trades continues to exist and in the case of general bonds other than government bonds, settlements face a tougher situation. Because the emphasis up to now has been on holding rather than on circulation in the case of general bonds, it has been difficult to discuss settlement risks. However, given the importance of a set number of days for transfers, the present system has serious problems in that "the completion of the name transfer and the funds settlement do not at all coincide" (leading securities firm). As it is, should the circulation of general bonds gain in frequency, we can anticipate that, "While funds settlement will go forward, the ownership of the certificate will remain unclear." A person connected with securities points out that even now, even if trading is carried from A to E in a short period, "By abbreviating the transfer bookkeeping procedures from B to D, there still will be the problem of managing the transfer of ownership from A directly to E on settlement day." Accordingly, should a related securities bankruptcy occur, there will be "utter chaos." It goes without saying that stipulations for speedy settlements are needed in order to develop the securities market. However, what I am talking about is that an infrastructure that will not present obstacles to settlement needs to be put in place. One person connected with the securities industry expressed this metaphorically as follows. "Are we going to drive a tractor along farm paths or a Porsche on the autobahn? These are the only options." The current securities market seems to be driving a Porsche along farm paths that even now have yet to be properly maintained.
