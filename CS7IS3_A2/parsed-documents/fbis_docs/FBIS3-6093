Through the meetings with coalition leaders, the JNP intends to seek their cooperation for its idea of setting up a "policy study group," taking into consideration the proposal by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, JNP representative, to form a unified parliamentary group of the ruling parties within the House of Representatives. The idea leads to an attempt to build a structure led by the ruling coalition parties in preparation for an upper house election set for the summer of next year as well as the next general elections. This JNP move means that the party has come into close relations with Shinseito and Komeito which are citing the need to form a "new party" in a bid to establish a political system based on two major parties. For this reason, JNP leaders are expected to face tough going in coordinating views with the SDPJ, the Democratic Socialist Party, and Sakigake [Harbinger Party] which are trying to differentiate between them and the Shinseito-Komeito bloc. Immediately after Prime Minister Hosokawa gave up his plan to reshuffle his cabinet, the JNP changed its executive members at the prime minister's designation, and members who have close ties with Sakigake have been excluded from the party executive. In response to this, the JNP has been activating its exchanges with both Shinseito and Komeito. For example, Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa ate successively with young JNP members, and young members from the JNP and Komeito have started a study group.
