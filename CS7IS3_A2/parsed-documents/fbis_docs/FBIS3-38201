Mr. Demirel said police had failed to provide sufficient security and were to blame for the incident in which one demonstrator was killed by shots fired from inside the embassy. He was speaking in Davos where he is attending the World Economic Forum. Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti denied there had been any security lapse. The shooting and Turkey's refusal to lift the diplomatic immunity of its embassy staff led to a diplomatic row between the two countries.
