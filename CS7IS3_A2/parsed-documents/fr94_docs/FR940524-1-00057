FR940524-1-00057 FR940524-1-00010 (b) Closed-circuit apparatus. The concentration of carbon dioxide in inspired gas in closed-circuit apparatus will be measured at the mouth while the parts of the apparatus contributing to dead-air space are mounted on a dummy head and operated by the breathing machine as in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section. (c) During the testing required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the concentration of carbon dioxide in inspired gas at the mouth will be continuously recorded, and the maximum average concentration during the inhalation portion of the breathing cycle shall not exceed the following limits: ␣ 1Where the service time is 1Maximum allowable average concentration of carbon dioxide in inspired air percent by volume Not more than 30 minutes 2.5 1 hour 2.0 2 hours 1.5 3 hours 1.0 4 hours 1.0 (d) In addition to the test requirements for closed-circuit apparatus set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, gas samples will be taken during the course of the man tests described in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this subpart. These gas samples will be taken from the closed-circuit apparatus at a point downstream of the carbon dioxide sorbent, and they shall not contain more than 0.5 percent carbon dioxide at any time, except on apparatus for escape only, using a mouthpiece only, the sample shall not contain more than 1.5 percent carbon dioxide at any time. §84.98 Tests during low temperature operation. (a) The applicant shall specify the minimum temperature for safe operation and two persons will perform the tests described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, wearing the apparatus according to applicant's directions. At the specified temperature, the apparatus shall meet all the requirements described in paragraph (e) of this section. (b) The apparatus will be precooled at the specified minimum temperature for 4 hours. (c) The apparatus will be worn in the low temperature chamber for 30 minutes, or for the service time of the apparatus, whichever is less. (d) During the test period, alternate 1-minute periods of exercise and rest will be required with the exercise periods consisting of stepping onto and off a box 21.5 cm. (81/2 inches) high at a rate of 30 cycles per minute. (e)(1) The apparatus shall function satisfactorily at the specified minimum temperature on duplicate tests. (2) The wearer shall have sufficient unobscured vision to perform the work. (3) The wearer shall not experience undue discomfort because of airflow restriction or other physical or chemical changes in the operation of the apparatus.
