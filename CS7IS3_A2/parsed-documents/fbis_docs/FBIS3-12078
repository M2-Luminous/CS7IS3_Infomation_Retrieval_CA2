Both parties claim that they will win. The decision of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), the third Salvadoran political force, not to support either contender cleared up the new electoral panorama and dispelled rumors about a possible alliance with ARENA, of which the PDC has been among the staunchest critics. Joaquin Villalobos, leader of the former Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN] guerrillas, told ACAN-EFE that the PDC decision "creates conditions to increase the coalition's possibilities to win over votes." Arena Deputy Rene Figueroa, however, told ACAN-EFE that the PDC decision "does not affect us" because his party "is supported by a majority of the Salvadorans." The PDC leadership based its decision on the fact that the government models of the contenders in the runoff elections -- which has not yet been officially announced by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] -- "fail to meet the aspirations of our voters," and this leaves us free to choose "conscientiously." The runoff election will pit ARENA's Armando Calderon Sol, the former San Salvador mayor, and Ruben Zamora, vice president of the Legislative Assembly. The latter was nominated by the former FMLN guerrillas, Democratic Convergence (CD), and National Revolutionary Movement (MNR). Rene Figueroa said that, although his party will not ask the left wing to give up a runoff election, its leaders "should reflect and save us energy and money, because it is clear that most Salvadorans want democracy and liberty, this meaning ARENA." Zamora, his partner Francisco Lima, and the leaders of the three parties that comprise the coalition yesterday rejected rumors that it would not participate in runoff elections and demanded that the TSE guarantee the vote of all Salvadorans. The ARENA deputy doubted that the PDC rank and file would vote for the left wing, because that party has faced several divisions in recent times and "discontented PDC members who already voted for the FMLN on 20 March." A visibly happy Villalobos, however, said that the PDC decision "improves everything because the PDC rank and file is an important element in the runoff election that will be decisive, and it will vote for us." Juan Ramon Medrano, also of the FMLN, told ACAN-EFE that the minority parties, namely, the Unity Movement and National Solidarity Movement, of evangelical persuasion, have adopted an attitude that is similar to that of the PDC. He pointed out that what is important is "that they did not side with ARENA." The only party that decided to support ARENA is the conservative National Conciliation Party (PCN). Its secretary general and presidential candidate Roberto Escobar Garcia told ACAN-EFE that Arena's alliance is "mainly based on our ideological line, and obviously, we do not support the FMLN." Calderon Sol and Zamora said they are talking with various sectors in search of support for the runoff elections. They are also willing to reach a consensus, because they realize that governing will be the major problem of the new peace situation. The candidates agree that the TSE must solve serious anomalies that were present during last Sunday's elections, in which 84 deputies to the Legislative Assembly and 262 mayors were elected. The most serious problems were related to the voter registration list. Many citizens were unable to vote because their names were not on it. There were delays in opening voting sites, lack of transportation, and other incidents the United Nations described as "minor."
