Speaking to ITAR-TASS by telephone, he turned down Kravchuk's allegations that the Crimea is looking for independence. On the contrary, Meshkov stated, it was Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy who actually "expelled the Crimea from Ukraine" banning its president from participating in the Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea fleet held last week in Sevastopol. Meshkov said that "on the eve of the presidential elections Kiev is merely staging a political show to please nationalists of all sorts". According to the Crimean president, the Ukrainian leadership makes "a serious mistake" by ignoring the opinion of Crimea's people on the sharing of the fleet, whereas it would be the best option to attract the Crimea to the negotiations in the capacity of the third party.
