Kozlik took part in negotiations today with the German ambassador to Slovakia, Heike Zenker, on the completion of construction work in Mochovce and its financing. The key issues, in his opinion, concern the repayment of German loans through supplies of nuclear energy to Germany and the closing of the nuclear power plant in Jaslovske Bohunice, West Slovakia, on which the realization of the project is conditional. Kozlik said that clear economic calculations are necessary if Slovakia is to prove she can be depended on to repay her loans. A total of 1.5 billion DEM [German marks] in foreign loans is to be provided for the construction of the nuclear power plant in Mochovce.
