(Minnegasco). It is further stated that as a result of a property Exchange Agreement between Minnegasco and Midwest Gas, that Minnegasco agreed to acquire Midwest Gas' Minnesota service territories. It is averred that since the service associated with the 1973 Agreement is primarily to serve customers only in Minnesota, Midwest Gas no longer has any incentive to maintain the 1973 Agreement after the transfer of its Minnesota distribution facilities to Minnegasco. No facilities are proposed to be abandoned herein. Comment date: July 5, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 7. Equitrans, Inc.
