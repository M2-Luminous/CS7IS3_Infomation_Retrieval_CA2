It had to be made known that this was all just press gossip and that it was unseemly to try to link him to petty political operations. What we heard, therefore, were contradicting presidential statements. On 14 July last year, the head of state was fulsome in his praise for Tapie, the former minister of urban affairs, officially launching his campaign for the European elections. Today, he scarcely admits to knowing him. So by what miracle was Jean-Francois Hory, president of the MRG [Left Radical Movement], received several times at the Elysee while Michel Rocard was still awaiting an audience? Indeed, by trying to turn the anniversary of Pierre Beregovoy's death into an anti-Rocard and anti-PS [Socialist Party] operation, by inviting Bernard Tapie to that ceremony, the Elysee strategists went too far too quickly. Especially in view of the fact that those close to the deputy for les Bouches-du-Rhone [Tapie] did not hesitate to fully exploit this move to the maximum extent. And this is the rub: Francois Mitterrand has found people who are even better gamblers than he is. He thought he could use Tapie, but it is Tapie who has used the Elysee. Obliged To Be a Rocard Supporter This is a loss of control, a badly controlled political operation which has a high price for Francois Mitterrand: He is obliged to say nothing until 12 June when or, if he speaks, it will be to express solidarity with the PS and its first secretary. By pushing Tapie, the president of the Republic wanted to reopen the game on the Left and give himself the means of influencing the choice of the Socialist candidate for the presidential election. His blunder strips him of any room to maneuver, and he is obliged to support Rocard. From this we can gauge the extent of his anger.
