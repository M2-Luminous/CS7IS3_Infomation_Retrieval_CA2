The Defense Ministry authorities intends to officially sign with the United States in September an overall munitions support agreement on the storage, support, and cost sharing for the 12 areas of major strategic materials, including ammunition and communications, and to include it in writing in the Wartime Host Nation's Support Agreement [WHNS] signed between the ROK and the United States in 1991, after getting approval of the National Assembly. The WHNS stipulates military and civilian support for the U.S. reinforcement forces to be deployed on the Korean peninsula in case of emergency, and the U.S. side is stockpiling up-to-date military equipment, including new-type ammunition, in advance. A senior government military official on 16 June said, "We are checking and supplementing this plan in order to smoothly supply military supplies, such as ammunition and weapons, in case a war drags on." The government official said that this comprehensive and systematic munitions support plan will also comprise the plan to enhance the capacity to mobilize the defense industry and the organic cooperation between the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces and the 2d ROK Army which is not under the control of the Combined Forces.
