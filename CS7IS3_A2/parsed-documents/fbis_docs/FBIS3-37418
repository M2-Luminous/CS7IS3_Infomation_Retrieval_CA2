The document is called "Organized Crime and the Prospects of National Socialists Coming to Power in Russia." It says, in particular, that the growth of organized crime, which is interwined with the Internal Affairs Ministry organs and local executive authorities, threatens Russia's political and economic development and creates real conditions for national socialists to come to power. In Russian cities and rayon centers literally all owners of stalls, stores, cafes, and restaurants pay money to bandit groups. All market vendors and car importers pay them money. Some 70-80 percent of privatized enterprises and commercial banks have been victims of extortion of late. The size of the payment (a kind of tax benefiting bandit groupings and corrupt officials) is 10-20 percent of the turnover, which often exceeds the enterprise's final profits. Bandit formations have informers everywhere in the militia organs, traffic police, and banks. According to entrepreneurs in Tver, a vehicle will be stopped by racketeers if they get word from a traffic police checkpoint that it is carrying a valuable load. Vladimir administration leaders confirmed that attempts to carry out surprise searches of bandit groupings' headquarters were blocked because they had been alerted through the traffic police-Internal Affairs Ministry system. In Moscow transport inspectors are unable to monitor the work of mobile service stations because the illegal traders are alerted by traffic police personnel. In Kazan only bandits are allowed to drive foreign cars, Volgas, and Zhiguli-9's. Other citizens have these cars taken away from them. The same rule has applied for some time in St. Petersburg too. Bandit groupings have started to demand money from farmers, market gardeners, and inhabitants of suburban settlements in Kazan. A similar practice is now being introduced in the Moscow region. In Tver entrepreneurs are required to obtain permission from the leaders of bandit groupings to set up a stall or open a store. Only with their consent will the local authorities issue licenses. Independent entrepreneurs have been driven out of some areas of activity altogether, since organized crime is financing on very favorable terms (a very large interest-free loan, for example) young people who are prepared to cooperate. As a result they have a significant advantage over their competitors (of course, when they achieve some success they surrender a large part of the profit as payment for the credit). Incidentally, this distingishes the situation in our country from the situation in Western Europe and the United States: There organized crime controls only "criminal" areas of activity, such as prostitution, the drugs trade, and gambling. In Russia organized crime controls all types of activity. The extra tax paid to the bandits and the artificial restrictions on business activity for the purpose of obtaining massive monopoly profits lead to price rises of 20-30 percent. The population's living standards fall accordingly. The memorandum notes that organized crime's accumulation of capital during 1991-1993 has been vast. Some of it is transferred abroad through banking structures (under threat of physical violence), but this does not save the bank managers. They are eliminated because they know about the secret deposits. Bankers have the highest death rate among entrepreneurs. In Russian cities a large class of young hoods has developed, whose sole function is racketeering and obtaining money. In St. Petersburg there are tens of thousands of these hoods, 500 of whom are hardened criminals. They all have high incomes and drive foreign cars. They take over restaurants and cafes and do not allow ordinary mortals into them. The boom in organized crime is closely linked to the economic status of entrepreneurs and privatized enterprises. The extremely intricate tax system that exists at the moment does not encourage enterprises to increase profits. For instance, according to the calculations of M. Kabakov, director of the machine building plant named for Kalinin, the plant's doubling of its profits through drastic economies and manpower cuts will only increase net profits by two percent. Under the present tax system an entrepreneur who owns a distillery can only ensure 11-percent profitability, given an inflation level of 1,000 percent per year. Entrepreneurs are forced to conceal income. Bandit groups find out about these things through agents and tell the entrepreneurs that if they do not pay them money they will be "handed over" to the tax police. The entrepreneurs reckon, not unreasonably, that it is better and safer to pay the bandits. In the banking sphere centralized credits distributed outside the tender system are the economic basis of organized crime. Some 10-20 percent of the cash earned on commission is taken in exchange for these credits. The abandonment of targeted credits would make it possible to eliminate the economic basis of organized crime. All the aforesaid, the memorandum says, means that an entire generation is growing up for whom the situation is normal and who, when in difficulty, turn not to the official authorities, but to the unofficial authorities. These people will sooner hire killers to punish a partner who has gone wrong than go to the courts or seek arbitration. The Analysis Center concludes that if this continues, we may arrive at a situation similar to that in Latin America or, say, Italy, where policy is actually determined not by government or parliament, but by organized crime. In particular, there is no longer any doubt that the leaders of Russian organized crime are compiling a meticulous dossier on all major officials and politicians. In these conditions Zhirinovskiy's populist promises to establish strict order could attract tens of millions of Russians and -- which would be particularly dangerous -- hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs to the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] banners. A failure to take decisive steps to remove the economic roots of crime and provide the laws to combat organized crime amd the absence of political will in the fight against organized crime could bring the national socialists to power during the 1996 presidential elections. What needs to be done, in the analysts' opinion? Practice shows that it is futile to depend on local militia departments to combat organized crime. Informers give the bandits several days' notice of impending raids so they can lie low. Only the creation of well equipped special formations, reporting direct to the president and located outside cities, will make for an effective fight against organized crime. These formations would have access to information stored in Internal Affairs Ministry organs. According to experts, in order to arrest the organizers, leaders, and "godfathers" of bandit groupings in a city such as St. Petersburg all you need is special formations numbering 100 men. These detachments must have extensive rights (for example, preventive detention for a period of several months) and major privileges, in particular: a large salary ($250-300 as of December 1993), an official apartment, of which the occupant automatically becomes owner on his retirement, compulsory life insurance, and so on. If evidence of corruption comes to light the employee will be automatically sacked and stripped of all privileges. These detachments should not include anyone who has served in the Internal Affairs Ministry or KGB (Security Ministry) in the past, but they should be given access to all the information collected by these departments. At the same time, a committee should be set up along the lines of the U.S. FBI. Its employees would monitor certain regions, with frequent changes of personnel. If such structures were created, organized crime's current freedom from punishment would rebound on it, since at the present time its members have no fears and their names are well known in every militia station. Internal Affairs Ministry personnel could be drafted in from from other cities for use in operations to put down organized crime. Having no links with organized crime in that particular city, they would be able to assist the president's special detachments. You can catch two or three members of bandit groupings these days by raiding restaurants or cafes. Practically all of them carry illegal weapons or they could be charged on other grounds. Since the organization of bandit groupings depends entirely on their leaders, the preventive detention of them for a period of several months and the severing of links with informers in Internal Affairs Ministry organs and the local administration will destroy the bandit groups. This is evidenced by the fact that even if a leader goes on "leave" for a month the bandit grouping is paralyzed. Changes must be made to the Criminal and Criminal Procedure Codes providing the organs combating organized crime with wider rights. They should be given the right to preventively detain people suspected of involvement in organized crime for a period of up to three months without charge. Tax legislation should be radically reformed, with the emphasis switching to the taxation of resources and, above all, land. We should dramatically curtail the use of the mechanism of quotas and licenses, switching to the regulation of foreign economic relations through duties. The granting of targeted credits should be abandoned. We must switch to the allocation of Russian Central Bank credits on a competitive basis.
