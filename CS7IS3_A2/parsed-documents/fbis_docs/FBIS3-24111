N.: "State Administration for National Security Is Being Restructured"] [Text] According to a decree issued by President Levon Ter Petrosyan on 14 January, Armenia's State Administration for National Security [SANS] will be reorganized. According to the decree, all functional services of the SANS have been disbanded and the activities of their staff have been terminated, though they will receive another 3 months of pay. The Main Administration for the Protection of State Borders as well as administrative, technical, financial-economic and medical services have been retained within the SANS structure. Eduard Simonyants has been relieved of his duties as the head of the SANS. His functions will be performed by Davit Shahnazaryan who has been appointed as the acting chief of the Administration and who will continue to serve as the president's envoy on special assignments. Shahnazaryan has been assigned the responsibility to evaluate the SANS staff and to present to the government the bylaws and organizational structure of the administration within the next 3 months. During a briefing yesterday, the president's press secretary, Aram Abrahamyan, noted in connection with the presidential decree on the restructuring of the SANS that the primary responsibilities of the Administration must be intelligence gathering and counterintelligence. He added that the Administration must undergo structural changes in order to perform those functions. According to Mr. Abrahamyan, the former structure was created during the Soviet period and served other purposes, mainly the pursuit of dissidents. Now that, according to the president's press secretary, there are no such problems in Armenia, the SANS services must concentrate on the issues mentioned: intelligence gathering and counterintelligence. As for the issue of who heads the SANS, Mr. Abrahamyan stated that the envisaged restructuring is not at all related to the person of former chief Eduard Simonyants, whom the president holds in very high regard and whose capabilities will be utilized in other areas. As is known, Eduard Simonyants is a petrochemist by training and entered the national security apparatus in 1990 as part of the president's team of national security advisers. In February 1993 he was appointed chief of the SANS. As for how he became part of the national security apparatus, in Simonyants's words, there are few people today who have had much relevant training for their present jobs. That is what he declared in March 1993 during a meeting with reporters. Now, approximately 1 year after his appointment, the SANS is headed by a person who is equally inexperienced in national security work (or at least has no directly relevant experience in that field). As is known, the new head of the SANS, Davit Shahnazaryan, is a physicist by training. He is the president's envoy on special assignments and has considerable experience in international mediation activities. At one point Shahnazaryan was considered a contender for the position of the republic's foreign minister. With respect to his experience in national security bodies, the president's press secretary said at yesterday's briefing that what is important is not his experience but whether he has a clear political posture. Mr Abrahamyan cited as an example Minister of the Interior Vano Siradeghyan who also was not trained for or had experience in his domain of work. Mr Abrahamyan noted that the issue of restructuring the SANS has been under study for a long time and that, in his opinion, it must be run by a political appointee. Did this lengthy study also include the issue of Eduard Simonyants as the SANS chief? The 57-year-old former SANS chief declined to comment in any way on his dismissal during our short telephone conversation. When we asked him whether there were any specific grounds for his dismissal he answered in the negative. The only positive answer Mr Simonyants gave us was that he has genuinely been offered another position whose details he declined to provide. Thus, Armenia's SANS is being restructured by a presidential decree. Let us recall that Russia's agency responsible for national security, the Ministry of National Security, has been restructured by President Boris Yeltsin's decree. Given that internal developments in Russia affect events in Armenia in one way or another, the restructuring of Armenia's SANS can, perhaps, also be tied to the reorganization of Russia's Ministry of National Security. Of course, one must add to that all the known and unknown causes and preceding events in Armenia, stated and unstated opinions about the restructuring of the SANS and one must not rule out any relationship to the resignation of the president's former national security adviser, Ashot Manucharyan. One must also take into account the fact that Eduard Simonyants is a "product of that blacksmith's shop."
