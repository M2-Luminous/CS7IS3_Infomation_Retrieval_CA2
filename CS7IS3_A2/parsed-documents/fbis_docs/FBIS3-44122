Dr. Jeque took wrong, dry [secas], and groundless stands in the course of that interview. He went as far as to say that the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] government is placing blacks in the state apparatus while showing hostility to coloreds. Personally, I would prefer not to touch this issue of blacks and coloreds, because I view all of them as Mozambicans; however, Dr. Jeque's views force me to say something about it. The fact is that the majority of Mozambican citizens are black and that reality cannot be denied in any way. Hurt whoever it may, blacks are in the majority. In view of that, it is not and it will not be anything extraordinary to see many blacks working in the state apparatus. The extraordinary thing was that most officials in the state apparatus used to be whites, Indians, and coloreds when the late President Samora Machel headed the government and even some years after President Joaquim Chissano had taken over that post. Those officials were and are part of the minority in relation to the country's blacks, but none of them protested it. Blacks did not have the right to say anything. Their sole spokesman was the late President Samora Machel, who was surrounded, dominated, and guided by the lot mentioned above. Under those circumstances, the country promptly fell into misery because none of them had any interest whatever in serving the Mozambican people. Eighty percent of the Mozambican economy is in the hands of the Indian section of society and those citizens are only interested in helping their own people. They have no interest in seeing the country develop. Their sole interest is money, and part of that money is already abroad, which is of no benefit at all to this country. It will be a good thing for Dr. Carlos Jeque to grasp immediately that when the Mozambican people, Africa, and the whole world see that the majority of senior officials in the state apparatus are blacks they are satisfied because, given that blacks are in the majority, it is only legitimate that they should govern the country. This is no racist view, and it is not intended as an attack on other Mozambicans. Dr. Carlos Jeque has a superiority complex in relation to the black person. If that is the case, then I am sorry for him. It is completely unjust that a social minority should make up the majority of senior officials in the state apparatus. That is unacceptable. I am only too aware that there are some (very few) blacks who have been assimilated by the colonial government and who regard themselves as whites. Those are the people who continue to this day shamelessly to defend a return of colonialism to this country. In concrete terms, what exactly is it that Dr. Jeque wants? Would he like whites, Indians, or coloreds to be put in the state apparatus instead? Would he like to see a return to the times when a Mozambican team sent abroad would be confused with an European or Asian team because it would always be made up of whites, Indians, and coloreds? If such a team included a black person, that person was bound to be the bodyguard of the team's leader. Dr. Carlos Jeque: Such situations did really happen and should not be repeated. By the same token, you cannot demand, for instance, that the senior officials in the Portuguese state apparatus be black Portuguese citizens. Neither can you demand that in the United States, Great Britain, France, and so forth. To me, it is absurd to deny a government of the majority. Blacks are not racist here in Mozambique. Quite the contrary, in fact: They are against racism. Racism was instituted by the colonialists against our ancestors and it lasted to the day of our independence. When blacks defend themselves against racism today, the creators of racism turn around and accuse blacks of being racist. They want blacks to shut up so they can continue to stay on top and make blacks the usual targets for racism. Blacks will never agree to that, or they would never have fought for independence. Mozambique's indigenous section of the population always came last during the entire colonial period. There were those who dreamed that, after independence from the Portuguese, the Indians and coloreds would take over and the blacks would continue to occupy the same place they did before independence. That type of dream is also in Dr. Jeque's mind. Dr. Jeque does not wish to see a government of black people because, in his opinion, black people have never known anything. Our party, the Mozambique Democratic Party, Pademo, fights and will always mercilessly fight that sort of mentality. Today, racists are going underground and are beginning to show their teeth. They act as though they are good people in a bid to regain the trust they lost among the indigenous population so they can attract votes during the elections. Dr. Carlos Jeque has felt he has not been getting moral support from his colleagues in the Fumo leadership and other people because of his cynicism, vanity, and superiority complex. That was what caused his isolation and his subsequent resignation from his post as deputy Fumo chairman. Dr. Jeque is a half-hidden colored armed with a colonial mentality and racism against black persons. To me he is a dangerous Mozambican because of his racism. At one point in his interview, Dr. Carlos Jeque said that "the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] had adopted an inflexible stand because it sought to get involved in a tug of war with another inflexible party, the government. That led to certain less informed political parties misreading those positions and leaning more toward Renamo." That passage is false in its entirety. The group of eight unarmed parties understood quite well what they were doing. Renamo may be an armed party but it is in the opposition. Personally, I do not see Dr. Carlos Jeque as an opposition leader. To me Dr. Jeque is not well, health-wise. He always looks bothered. In view of that, it would be a good thing for him to give up on politics altogether and turn to simpler things. My advice to those who are not satisfied with a majority government is that they should choose some country where they can live in happiness and leave in peace the majority government here in Mozambique. The majority in this country does not discriminate against, or show hostility to, the other sections of society. Dr. Carlos Jeque's views on the excessive placement of blacks in the state apparatus and an alleged hostile behavior in relation to coloreds are purely and simply groundless.
