"Let's put the Nagano remarks in the past and move ahead thinking of the future," Jiang told Wataru Kubo, secretary general of Japan's No. 2 opposition party, the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ]. Kubo on Monday delivered a letter to Jiang from Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata expressing regret over Nagano's claim that the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication. Jiang told Kubo that he appreciated the apology from Japan. Regarding concerns that North Korea may be trying to build a nuclear arsenal, Kubo said he hopes the issue could be resolved through dialogue and he had expectations for China's role in unlocking the stalemate. Jiang also hoped to see the issue resolved through negotiations but cautioned the international community should not overestimate China's influence on North Korea. "Looking forward to a resolution through dialogue, China hopes to play a positive role," Jiang said but added, "it is unrealistic to overestimate China's role." Jiang told Kubo that China, North Korea's only major ally in the world, wants to see a stable Korean peninsula free of nuclear arms. Kubo is currently in China on an eight-day visit through Sunday as head of an SDPJ delegation marking the 10th anniversary of the party's exchanges with China's Communist Party.
