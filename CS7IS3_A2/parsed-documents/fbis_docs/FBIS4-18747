[passage omitted] We have just spoken to Deputy Prime Minister Elio di Rupo: [Begin recording] [Di Rupo] First of all, I would like to say that we are more than indignant: We are shocked by what happened, and our thoughts go to the families. [passage omitted] Concerning concrete action, there are two types of action. First of all, in the name of the government, the prime minister and the foreign minister have asked the UN secretary general to reinforce the security of our peacekeeping forces on the ground. The secretary general has indicated that this request will be answered with action. Secondly, we have taken the necessary measures to guarantee the security of our nationals on the ground. For all those who are concerned, a crisis center has been opened, and there is a telephone number which is 02-5014000. [Unidentified correspondent] What do you mean exactly by reinforcing the security of the blue helmets? Does this mean that the nature of their mission will change, or will they be receiving reinforcements? [Di Rupo] I could of course answer this question, but please understand that if our official statements are rather vague, it is because we want to keep all the opportunities on our side to ensure that our action can be as effective as possible, and especially to ensure that we do not further endanger the lives of our nationals. [end recording] [Announcer] The situation of our expatriates, who our holed up at home, seems increasingly precarious. According to a number of eyewitness reports from Kigali, there have been casualties among the foreign community in Kigali, in particular among those with a Rwandan husband or wife. [passage omitted]
