The poll was explained through the absolute need to stabilize the sociopolitical and economic situation, create favorable conditions to strengthen the independence of the Republic of Moldova, and ensure its territorial integrity. For us, it is only an exercise of testing public opinion and we will treat it as such. We note, however, the tendency of certain forces to unilaterally and generally view it as a firm answer to a question to which only history has the right to provide an answer. It is regrettable that these forces continue to make efforts to win political capital and to exacerbate Romaniaphobia. At this time, too, we very firmly reject such attempts to distract public opinion from the real problems and causes of the situation in the Republic of Moldova and from the real threats to its independence. Romania was the first state to recognize the independence of the Republic of Moldova, to which it has granted and continues to grant its entire political, diplomatic, and moral support to contribute to its affirmation at the international level. The Romanian Government has pledged to grant material assistance for the benefit of all the citizens of the Republic of Moldova to overcome the difficult times generated by the economic and social difficulties they are confronting. Romania will continue to support the consolidation of the independence of the Republic of Moldova and will work toward economic integration of the two Romanian states and toward strengthening our common cultural and spiritual area, the press communique of Romania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs concludes.
