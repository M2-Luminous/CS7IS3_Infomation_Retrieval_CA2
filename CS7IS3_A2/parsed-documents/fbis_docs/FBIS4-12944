Israel's prevarication and refusal once again to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho within the period ending 13 April was a blatant breach and a scandalous, open violation of the bases of the Declaration of Principles agreement signed in Washington between the PLO and the Israeli Government. In a press statement by its chief amir and Abu-'Abdallah Fa'iz al-'Aswad, its official spokesman in the occupied territories yesterday, the movement added: The procrastination of the Israeli side, which is not implementing the withdrawal by the set date, will lead to further deterioration of the situation in the occupied land. Consequently, the Rabin government will be responsible for the developments which will result from the non-implementation of the mechanisms of the Declaration of Principles agreement. Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine further said that the escalation of terrorist acts by the settlers and the troops of occupation, the sealing off of the occupied territories, and the imposition of a military and economic blockade on the children of our Palestinian people would not weaken their determination to persevere in their legitimate right to rebel, rise, and fight the Israeli occupying enemy until the recovery of their legitimate national rights. Namely, their right to return and the right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent state with holy Jerusalem as its capital.
