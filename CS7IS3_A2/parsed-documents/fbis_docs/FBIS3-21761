Fifteen african countries were not party to any drug-control treaty, according to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) 1993 report. It said the worldwide drug menace had outgrown its traditional classification as a criminal and social issue to penetrate international politics and economics. Although the INCB recognised prevailing political, economic, social and even climatic conditions that created obstacles for African governments, it said limited law enforcement and weak control over the pharmaceutical market had contributed to increased drug abuse. Increased cultivation of dagga was attributed to growing domestic demand and trafficking to European markets. Supplies came from local cultivation and regional trafficking, said the report, which annually reviews the world drug scene and international compliance with three major drug control treaties. Heroin abuse, which a few years ago was a limited phenomenon, was increasing because African airports were being used to smuggle the drug into mainly European markets. A similar trend had been observed with cocaine, mainly in west Africa. The current drug pattern in Africa showed how quickly abuse and trafficking could spread in a region, notably central Africa and most recently to southern Africa where the report highlighted the illicit manufacture and distribution of methaqualone (mandrax). Established in 1968 as an independent and quasi-judicial organ for the implementation of the United Nations drug conventions, the INCB seeks to identify weaknesses in national and international drug control.
