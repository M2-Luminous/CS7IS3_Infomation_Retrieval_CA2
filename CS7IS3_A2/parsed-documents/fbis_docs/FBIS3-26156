Locked up in the Tongge Heading Radiator Factory on the outskirts of Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, they worked hard more than 12 hours a day, but only three meals were provided for. "The housing and wages stipulated on the contract were hollow words," Wang Li, head of the Yilong labour wrote to the Yilong Administration Bureau of Employment Service (YABES), which had signed the contract with the radiator factory and recruited them for the job. "Help us, if you didn't tell us a lie," he continued. Upon receiving Wang's letter, Zhang Youlun, the director of the employment service bureau immediately flew to Taiyuan to talk with the labour contractor at the privately run factory. Zhang travelled back and forth between Yilong and Taiyuan five times. He negotiated hard and long before being able to get his village folks back home with their wages. Compared with millions of other peasant labourers from China's most populous province, Wang Li and his fellow-townsmen were fortunate. They were organized and were contract labourers with the local Employment Service Administrative Bureau, a new subdivision of the local county government, while many others are not. "They are blind drifters," Wang said. While the "blind drifters" flock into cities in early spring with little idea where to locate jobs and how to secure wages and other benefits, the jobs and wages for Wang and his folks were secured. When they ran into problems, they had Zhang and his colleagues to help them settle the problems. "Though the factory fooled both the employment service and us, we could still have the agency to represent us and to fight in our interest," Wang said. "This has made us feel safe." That's the duty of the YABES, one of 50 branches of the Sichuan Administration Bureau of Employment Service (SABES) which is now spreading all over Sichuan. With its branches in Sichuan and four administration offices in Beijing, Xiamen, Guangzhou and Haikou, SABES, as a government organization set up in 1987, has been providing services for a few hundred thousand country labourers in Sichuan who spend the better part of a year working away from home either in the province or in prosperous coastal areas and major cities. More than five million Sichuan peasants working outside the province are sending money back to their homes, thus creating an important source of income to the province. In 1992, the labourers sent back more than 8 billion yuan ($1.38 billion). But the job is not easy. "No other thing is more difficult than `dealing with' people," Tan Renzhou, an official with SABES, said. At first, the work was routine. Staff members at the branches of the bureau simply granted "work permits" to those labourers who wanted to find work in other provinces. They examined tens of thousands of labourers' resumes a year and conducted interviews. People who applied for the work permit would have to prove that they were physically strong and had no criminal record, and pay 50 yuan ($5.7). The resume plus the 50 yuan would soon land the applicants in jobs the bureau helped to locate. But soon, Tan and his colleagues discovered that it was very difficult to locate jobs for the millions of people. To look for better and more openings, they had to maintain frequent contact with all kinds of enterprises. Tan said they mainly worked with the State and collective-owned factories, rarely privately-run enterprises. "As the go-between of the labourers and the employers, we are responsible not only to businesses, but also to our Sichuan labourers," Tan said. To take up the responsibility, they often had to haggle with those enterprises to secure the best possible wages, housing, and working hours. To make sure that the businesses followed the contract, Tan and his colleagues often visited those enterprises on the spot to check. Over the years, SABES and its branches have worked out good relationships with Sichuan labourers and also with many companies across the country. For instance, in 1990, the Guangda Toy Factory on the Dongguan County in Guangdong asked the service's main headquarters in Chengdu, the provincial capital, for 800 workers. SABES handed the request to its branch in Xichong County, a relatively poor county with a large number of surplus countryside labourers. Under the guidance of the county employment service, the 800 peasants left home and began their work. They worked in teams, and leaders were appointed who could write to the branch frequently. In the same year, Liu Minxian, head of the county employment service branch visited the factory twice. As time went by those Xichong peasants gained a foothold in the city. In comparison with colleagues in Sichuan, the employment service officials working in local offices are dealing with what they call more trifling issues. Ju Haiyan, the 32-year-old woman official of the Beijing branch of the service, takes charge of about 10,000 Sichuan labourers who have obtained work permits to work in Beijing from the service. The few weeks after the Spring Festival are the busiest period of the year, she said, when labourers from the countryside pour into Beijing and other major cities in China. Besides cooperating with the Beijing Labour Bureau to grant the "Beijing Temporary Living Permit" to them, she said she has mainly handled conflicts between labourers and their employers in Beijing. In May last year, Ju got calls from both the Sichuan labourers and their employer at the Beijing Plush Bird Factory in the suburbs of Beijing, which signed an employment contract with SABES. The employer complained that some of the 30 workers from Sichuan had already left while others had stopped working. But Chen Jun, the young team leader of the Sichuan workers reported that they had been leading a dull life, "even worse than that at home," and that they were earning about 200 yuan ($35) a month, "too little to save any after eating in this expensive city." Ju went to the factory to investigate. She found that the factory failed to provide the contract Sichuan workers the chance to see films or videos. There wasn't even a library. Ju first consulted with the factory management and it promised to furnish a reading room and a few entertainment facilities, such as pingpong tables for the young migrants. She also talked with the young Sichuan workers, persuading them that their experience working at the factory would be beneficial to their future development. In three days, the young migrants began to work again. But it was still regrettable for her that the factory refused to give those labourers a pay raise. "First, the average wage level of Beijing is lower than that in the coastal areas," Ju explained with some regret. "Of course, all factories need just `cheap' labour." Today, Tan, Ju and their colleagues are trying to expand the service's influence. Tan admitted that he and his colleagues had not been able to strike accords with privately-run businesses and thus, they had not been able to secure protection and benefits for Sichuan workers working in those enterprises. He said the service would try to amend their shortcomings. "After all, if the labourers get good administration, they will become a huge source of wealth for Sichuan," he said.
