FR940603-0-00061 FR940603-0-00025 Comments received by NMFS generally fell into one of the following categories: (1) Those who were in favor of the designation as it was proposed; (2) those who were in favor of the proposed designation, but recommended that additional regulatory actions be taken at the time of designation to protect northern right whales; (3) those who were in favor of designating critical habitat for northern right whales, but recommended expanding the boundaries of the critical habitat; (4) those who were not in favor of the designation because it was not necessary, given the protective measures for right whales that are being implemented through section 7 of the ESA; and (5) those who were not in favor of the critical habitat designation because it may lead to further restrictions on a specified activity. Most comments received by NMFS from private individuals, environmental organizations, and state agencies supported the critical habitat designation for northern right whales. Several commenters suggested that the proposed rule lacked clear conservation measures to ensure the recovery of the northern right whale. Many of the recommendations were duplicative of those of other commenters; therefore, individual comments were combined and addressed together below, unless otherwise specified. Comment 1: One commenter recommended that NMFS designate a Northern Right Whale Recovery Plan Implementation Team for the coastal calving grounds off Florida and Georgia. The commenter further suggested representative agencies and organizations that might participate on this team. Response: On August 26, 1993, NMFS convened a meeting to discuss the monitoring program that needed to be in place to protect northern right whales on their winter ground, prior to their winter arrival. During this meeting, the Southeastern U.S. Right Whale Recovery Plan Implementation Team was formed. The team consists of representatives from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (Chairman); Florida Department of Environmental Protection; NMFS/Southeast Fisheries Center and Southeast Regional Office; U.S. Navy, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, FL; U.S. Navy, Submarine Group, Kings Bay, GA; Georgia Ports Authority; Canaveral Port Authority; Glynn County Commission, Glynn County, GA; University of Georgia; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE), South Atlantic Division; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); Port of Fernandina, Fernandina, FL; and the U.S. Coast Guard. NMFS is also coordinating the development of a Right Whale Recovery Plan Implementation Team for the Northeastern United States. Recovery Plan implementation for the northern right whale has been ongoing at some level within NMFS, Northeast Region (NER), since December 1990, and has involved agency staff and scientific experts in the area. The most recent Massachusetts Water Resources Authority outfall Biological Opinion (issued September 8, 1993), and associated conservation recommendations, are part of the recommendations and programs that have been instituted in the NER that address Right Whale Recovery Plan tasks. The Northeast Implementation Team will address the possible cumulative impacts to right whales from all activities in Massachusetts Bay. Comment 2: Several organizations recommended that NMFS implement an early warning system, consisting of daily surveys (from December 1 through March 31) of the known wintering grounds. Several organizations also recommended that monitoring be conducted along the migratory route of this species. Response: ``Early warning systems'' for right whales in the southeast United States were first developed through ESA section 7 consultations between NMFS and ACOE, Jacksonville District, as a result of dredging operations at the Navy's submarine channel at Kings Bay, GA; the Port of Fernandina, FL; the Port of Jacksonville, FL; the Naval facilities at Mayport, FL; a navigation channel at St. Augustine, FL; and numerous beach disposal projects using offshore disposal sites throughout this area. Measures to protect right whales have included daily aerial surveys at the time that the dredges are in operation during the calving season. If a right whale is seen within a 16-kilometer (k) radius of dredge and disposal areas, dredges and support vessels are required to carry an observer during daylight hours and to reduce speeds at night to reduce the likelihood of a collision with a whale. However, these precautions were only in place while the dredging operations were being conducted, not throughout the entire winter calving period. Therefore there were gaps in the aerial survey coverage, and thus in protective measures for the whales. In December 1993, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard provided funding to conduct aerial surveys during the remainder of the time that the whales were in the calving area; the area of concern from the Savannah River south to approximately Jacksonville, FL, was surveyed through March 1994. The ACOE will continue to provide coverage during those periods when hopper dredges are active. Therefore, the whale sightings are passed on to appropriate agencies if a survey finds whales in or near a navigational channel, vessels are asked to proceed at minimum safe operational speeds and communicate locations of the whale so other vessels can avoid them. This procedure will continually be reviewed and revised through efforts of the Southeast Implementation Team. NMFS intends to continue cooperative efforts with the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, the ACOE, and the implementation team to conduct daily aerial surveys throughout the calving season and to operate the early warning system to reduce the likelihood of ship strikes. It is unlikely that right whales can be monitored throughout their range for the purpose of protecting them from ship strikes. NMFS is developing a research program that may include satellite tracking of tagged northern right whales to determine those areas (winter and summer) where right whales occur, but which are unknown at this time.
