FR941110-1-00013 FR941110-1-00004 Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866 Based upon the supplementary information set forth above and because the opening and examination of baggage and merchandise is mandated by the statutes cited above, pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), it is certified that the proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, the proposed amendments are not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 or 604. This document does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in Executive Order 12866. Drafting Information The principal author of this document was Janet L. Johnson, Regulations Branch. However, personnel from other offices participated in its development.
