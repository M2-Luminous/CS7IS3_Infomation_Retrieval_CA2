FBIS4-8884 "dreeu075_k_94009" FBIS-EEU-94-075 Daily Report 22 Mar 1994 CROATIA Issue of Early Elections, HDZ `Moles' Issue of Early Elections, HDZ `Moles' 94BA0239A Zagreb DANAS in Serbo-Croatian 22 Mar 94 p 23 94BA0239A Zagreb DANAS Serbo-Croatian CSO [Article by Damir Jurisic: "Moles, Agents, and Provocateurs"] [Text] Is the Republic of Croatia facing early elections, as Tihomil Radja, vice president of the HSS [Croatian Peasant Party], has asserted in VECERNJI LIST? This is a question which has another two more important ones in the background: Who in the government is thinking of organizing those elections and to what purpose? Aside from that, Radja's assertion about a "mentor" from the government who ordered a split in the HSS is the finale of these 12 months since the election, during which most of Croatia's parliamentary parties--from the HSP [Croatian Rights Party], DA [Dalmatian Action], SDH [Social Democrats of Croatia], IDS [Istrian Democratic Conference] to the HSS--have been less concerned with politics and more with hunting "moles" and "agents provocateurs of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union]" in their own ranks. Which gives rise to a new question: If the stories about the moles are accurate, who in the HDZ planted them, the soft line or the hard line? Finally, are there moles even in the very top leadership of the HDZ? We might well ask ourselves following the public statements by Stipe Mesic, president of the Sabor [Croatian Assembly], and Josip Manolic, president of the Chamber of Zupanijas. Mesic has not only displayed a lack of party discipline by refusing--say well-informed sources--Dr. Tudjman's request that he submit his resignation, but has confused the public with his statement in GLOBUS that many decisions in Croatia are being made by the "force of authority, not by force of law" and that some of the members of the HDZ have taken over the "bolshevik model of thought and political behavior." He had something equally important to say in SLOBODNA DALMACIJA to the effect that the Washington agreement is a victory for the original HDZ, and a defeat for the "current which favored war." Continuity or Change of Direction At just about the same time, Josip Manolic in FERAL was calling upon Gojko Susak, defense minister, to take responsibility and resign because of the Muslim-Croatian conflict, and indirectly President Tudjman himself for the erroneously chosen policy of the HDZ, and thereby also that of the Croatian state, toward Bosnia and Herzegovina. Manolic, say sources close to the top leadership of the HDZ, also broke with party discipline and violated the decision to interpret the signing of the Washington agreement as expressive of the continuity of HDZ policy, rather than as a change of direction. Can the policy of the state be conducted without exchanges of fire between responsible statesmen along party lines, especially in decisive moments, the citizen-voters are wondering and remaining confused as to whether Mesic, Manolic, and the president of the HSLS [Croatian Social Liberal Party] are on the same line? And why now? As Drazen Budisa says in GLOBUS, it should be explained to every one of our citizens that the opposition has been in favor of an integral Bosnia and Herzegovina from the beginning. Is not Zdravko Tomac of the SDP [Social Democratic Party] more sober and wiser when he warns in NEDELJNA DALMACIJA that this is the time for the highest degree of Croatian concord, that everything should be subordinated to reestablishment of Croatian authority over the entire territory, that maturity should be shown, and there should be no rejoicing when leaders of the HDZ interpret the new decisions as proof of the correctness of their Croatian policy conducted toward Bosnia and Herzegovina up to now? So, if, as the speculation runs in Zagreb political corridors, an early election to the Sabor is the objective of the Mesic and Manolic current, what is expected? The result is allegedly supposed to be a weakening of the right wing of the HDZ and, with the establishment of new coalitions among the winners, constitutional and legal changes that would restrict the authority of the president of the state to the advantage of the Sabor. Would that compel President Tudjman to listen to them, in spite of his legitimate five-year term, why would the government have to schedule new elections for president? These questions will nevertheless remain at the level of speculation, because an "early" election for the deputies in the Croatian parliament is called by--the president of the state! So the real question is whether the president of the state wants an early election to the Sabor, and could these dissonant tones within the HDZ hurt him? What can the Mesic-Manolic "faction" do? They can capitalize on the assumed political power and influence of their parliamentary posts only to the real limits of their influence on the coercive agencies: the army, the police, and--most important in domestic political conflicts--the state treasury. Integration and Confederation That influence, say the well-informed, is not nearly what it would have to be to mount even a small threat to the president of the state. There is evidence that that is the case in the fact that Josip Manolic presented his argument to the public through FERAL. The impact is only a bit greater than if he had given the interview to HRVATSKA LJEVICA, whose managing editor Stipe Suvar put on the front page of the first issue (could it be an accident?) a 1946 poster of Andrija Maurovic with the caption "Long Live Election to the Constitutional Assembly, an Expression of the Statehood and Sovereignty of the People of Croatia"!? At the moment President Tudjman certainly has no reason to call an extraordinary parliamentary election. What is more, as the political realists suggest, there are also not many reasons for a referendum on confederation of Croatia with the federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A customs union between the two countries would be sufficient for the beginning. Aside from that, although the first solicitor general, Smiljko Sokol, has said on Croatian TV that only the percentage of votes "in favor" in the referendum on confederation is important--so that it would be valid even without being conducted on the occupied parts of Croatia--the attitude of the public is summed up in the formula: first, return of what has been occupied, and then possible alliances with other states.
