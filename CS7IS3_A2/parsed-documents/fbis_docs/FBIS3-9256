What is the nature of your visit? [Jovanovic] So many things worry us: The Yugoslav crisis, the unjust and artificial isolation in which we have been placed. [Lamfalussy] In practice, you want the sanctions to be lifted? [Jovanovic] The European Union (EU) must keep its promises. It was it which proposed the peace plan to us. It asked the Serbian side to fulfill the conditions. And they have been fulfilled. It promised us that it would start to lift the sanctions. And we have been waiting for several months. Hoping that its promise means something. If not, its credibility in the negotiations will be greatly affected. [Lamfalussy] There is still an impression that Serbian Bosnia and Serbia are the same... [Jovanovic] Our influence on the Bosnian Serbs has limits. When three of our presidents went from Belgrade to Pale last year, they were humiliated. Their prestige suffered as a result. The Bosnian Serbs have been living there for a thousand years. They know their rights better than us. If they feel that we do not support them, they are ready to tell us to go to the devil. [Lamfalussy] What is your influence on the Serbs in Krajina who are opening negotiations with the Croatian Government this Tuesday? [Jovanovic] We cannot tell them what agreement they must sign. We can tell them that the hostilities must end, which is what we are saying to the Croatians too. [Lamfalussy] What is your feeling? [Jovanovic] We must return to the self-determination which was guaranteed by the last federal constitution of Yugoslavia and the penultimate Croatian Constitution. Croatia was defined as the state of the Croatian nation and the Serbian nation. When Mr. Tudjman came to power, his first action was to revise the constitution and reduce the Serbs to a minority. Until their rights are restored, there will not be much room for a compromise. [Lamfalussy] In one country which would be Croatia? [Jovanovic] It is possible if they reach agreement. [Lamfalussy] Is the agreement signed in Washington by Croatians and Muslims another sign of hope? [Jovanovic] God willing. It may be a hope, but it may also be dangerous. It will all depend on the American vision. Do they want a just and lasting peace? Or do they want to humiliate the Serbs? [Lamfalussy] Mr. Redman has visited Belgrade... [Jovanovic] He only gave broad outlines. The Americans are not telling us openly what they want. That makes us suspicious. [Lamfalussy] One guarantee for peace is the control which you have over the war criminals, Arkan for instance... [Jovanovic] Arkan only carried out one escapade in two years without our knowing about it. He was invited by the mayor of Bijeljina [as published] who wanted to oppose a mini-coup d'etat by the Muslims. We have never accepted the atrocities committed by him or by other parties. But in a civil war, there is no room for angels.
