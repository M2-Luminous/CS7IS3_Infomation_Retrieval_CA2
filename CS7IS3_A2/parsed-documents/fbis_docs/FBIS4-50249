On this issue, the United States and Britain do not agree with countries such as France and Russia. The former two are in favor of continuing the oil sales embargo, while the latter maintain that, since the Iraqi Government is cooperating with UN weapon inspectors and showing some progress in its attitude, lifting the embargo should be considered. The oil sales embargo on Iraq was an important part of the overall sanctions against Iraq imposed by the UN Security Council when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Oil is the main source of Iraq's foreign exchange income and an important underpinning of the national economy. Cutting off its oil sales channels undoubtedly spells disaster to the recovery and development of Iraq's national economy and its people's livelihood. To solve its predicament and break the blockade, Iraq has repeatedly called for the Security Council to end the sanctions and has adopted a positive, cooperative attitude in accepting the United Nations' destruction of its long-range missiles and chemical and biological weapons, as well as the organization's long-term supervision of its ordnance production. Not long ago, Iraqi culture and information minister Hammadi made a public statement to the outside, saying that Iraq has long dropped its territorial claim on Kuwait, and the Iraqi National Assembly has also withdrawn its decision to annex Kuwait, which was approved by Iraq's supreme power organ, the Revolutionary Command Council. It was in the hope that the Security Council would end its sanctions against Iraq at an early date that Iraq made those efforts and took those positions. What is worth mentioning here is that the Security Council initially also cited the above-mentioned conditions, stating that, as long as Iraq could meet those requirements in its behavior, it would lift the sanctions. The relevant sources pointed out: The efforts Iraq has made in the above-mentioned areas have reached and satisfied the conditions set down by the Security Council at that time; therefore, lifting the oil sales embargo should be considered and Iraq should be released. France argues that the Security Council must stand by the agreement. In other words, once Baghdad has satisfied the requirements raised at that time, the oil embargo should end. At present, the Iraqi side is launching a new diplomatic offensive and is sending out important officials in all directions to explain that Iraq's efforts have met the requirement for scrapping the sanctions, thus putting pressure on the Security Council. But the United States and Britain have taken exception to the positions of France, Iraq, and other relevant parties. They have ignored all dissenting views and have insisted on continuing the oil embargo against Iraq, splitting opinion on the matter. Some say that Iraq deserved the sanctions earlier because it had invaded Kuwait and was in the wrong, but, now that Iraq has admitted defeat and bowed to justice, if one again made a futile effort to convince people with one's arguments or was actually scheming about something else, it would indeed be absurd. [sentence as published] The Western media pointed out: The Americans want to use sanctions to stop the Iraqi Government from persecuting the Kurdish people and the southern Shiite Muslims in the country, but the oil embargo resolution did not cover these issues. It is common knowledge that the Kurdish and Shiite Muslim problem is purely Iraq's internal affair.
