Perhaps in order to act on its promise to investigate and tackle serious cases, the CPC announced on 12 April the final verdict on the sensational and unprecedented financial swindle involving the Great Wall Company. Shen Daifu, the former president of the Beijing Great Wall Electric-Machinery Technology Company, was found guilty of corruption and bribery and sentenced to death; Li Xiaoshi, a former vice minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, was also found guilty of accepting bribes and corruption and received a 20-year jail term. That same day, RENMIN RIBAO issued an editorial stressing the maintenance of being alert to corruption in the long term, indicating the authorities' intention to wage another long battle against corruption. Informed sources in Beijing revealed that the CPC's transformation of the drive against corruption into a long-term effort obviously has to do with the fact that corruption is becoming increasingly serious and is growing unchecked. There have been three onslaughts of corruption among Chinese officialdom over the last decade or so, each worse than the preceding one. The first occurred around the late 1970's and early 1980's on the crest of the first mercantile tide and took the form of abuse of power for monetary gain. The second saw rampant "official speculation" in the mid-1980's, and the third began in 1992 with the entry of power into the factors market and power-for-money deals, in which credit, securities, and property became "juicy gains" for corrupt officials. Corruption among officials chiefly takes the form of overseas trips sponsored on public funds, reckless spending and waste, graft involving huge amounts of money, increases in the number of criminal gangs, consecutive offenses motivated by strong greed, and increasingly open and blatant power-for-money deals. Corruption Within the Party Is in Fact Power Corruption Even worse, some officials have absconded with money obtained through bribery and the abuse of power to foreign countries to live comfortable lives there. Some cadres sold highly confidential documents they spirited out of the country for huge amounts of money, causing enormous economic losses to the country and society and very bad political repercussions. Increasingly rampant corruption became a target for criticism from all sides at the two sessions of the Eighth National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] as deputies and members aimed at corruption with deafening volleys. The authorities responded by having Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, and Procurator General Zhang Siqing reveal details about investigations into corruption cases to the two sessions and announcing seven serious cases in hand: 1) the Li Xiaoshi and Shen Daifu cases in Beijing mentioned at the beginning of this report; 2) cigarette smuggling involving Wang Jianzhi, the former party secretary of Rushan City, Shandong Province, Liu Qishan, the former commercial bureau chief, and Fan Zhanwu, a former CPPCC member in the Weihai City Prevention Bureau; 3) the extraordinarily serious bribery and crime case in which five bureau chiefs and 10 office heads of the Minjiang Project Bureau of the Ministry of Power Industry accepted a 3 million [currency not specified] bribe; 4) the extraordinarily serious case of corruption, bribery, and misappropriation in which Gui Bingquan, grain bureau chief in Changtu County, Tie Lin, Liaoning Province, his deputy bureau chief Yang Maoyuan, and 23 others accepted a 2.5 million yuan bribe. 5) the case of Guo Zhengmin, head of Guizhou Province Public Security Department, accepting a 100,000-yuan bribe; 6) the bribery case of Chen Zhiwen, of Beijing's Changping County Procuratorate; 7) the case of Li Kainan, member of the Hubei Higher People's Court Judiciary Commission, who accepted bribes. These seven serious cases show that corruption among mainland party and government officials is in fact power corruption. Deng and Chen Urged High-level Authorities To Come to Grips With Corruption Sources said that worsening power corruption prompted the CPC to launch another anticorruption struggle in the summer of 1993, which was conducted under the direct command of senior CPC statesmen. As soon as the anticorruption struggle began, Deng Xiaoping pointed out to the CPC leadership collective of the third generation: "There must be a correct estimate of the extent of corruption. Some say corruption is spreading Is it that serious? In my view, to a considerable extent, this estimate is accurate about some departments and areas. If the Communist Party can lead reform, it can surely lead the masses to stop corruption. The key lies in a firm attitude and a clear stand. We must not let others take up the anticorruption banner and tasks. The Communist Party must do this job well. A few years ago, I said that it was necessary to correctly grab a number of corrupt elements and hit them and some big figures hard. Show no mercy to them, as long as they have committed a crime, however highranking they are -- even cadres at the ministerial and provincial levels. Now, let us take a look: Are there cadres at the ministerial and provincial levels committing crimes? I think there must be. A few decades ago I put forward grabbing reform and opening up with one hand and hitting economic crime with another. This, like `grabbing with both hands' and `two hands equally tough,' was repeatedly brought up over the last few years. It seems we did right. We may have to persist in this for the next few decades or 100 years. In addition, we must also stress that the anticorruption efforts must be legislated for. Corrupt phenomena must be tackled with the legal system and legal weapons, so that the anticorruption effort can rely on law and will persist." Later, Chen Yun and Peng Zhen also said that the Communist Party would not be able to do so again if it did not pursue the anticorruption struggle now. "Corruption eats into the foundations of the party and turns the party against the people. When the party is rotten and has no power to solve its corruption problem, other people will step forward and overthrow it as a corrupt phenomenon. We must be alert to the seriousness of this problem. Realistically, it is the biggest threat." Under the prodding of senior CPC statesmen, CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin made a startling speech on 28 February this year at the third plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection on planning for anticorruption work. He said: "The problems uncovered by the anticorruption struggle are serious. Corruption has spread to many sectors of social life, especially to cadres in CPC party and government organs. Power abuse, embezzlement, fraud, stealing impounded goods, obstruction of justice, bribery, and graft have reached alarming proportions. The danger of the party and the country being toppled if we are not determined to fight this tough battle against corruption, is real enough." He also said: "We will be toppled if we do not handle the economy well. But--suppose the economy is doing well--we will still be toppled if corruption spreads, graft and bribery run amok, and the party is divorced from the people." Unrestrained Power Invariably Leads to Corruption All of this suggests that the high-level CPC authorities and senior statesmen are united in their attitude toward the anticorruption task and are equally determined. However, corruption has continued unabated and has even escalated recently in some sectors. Why? A person in Beijing political circles pointed out that this has to do with the permanency of ruling status in Mainland China assigned to the Communist Party. He said: Such permanency gives the Communist Party a superior sense of "being always in a ruling position" and prevents it from taking the erosion of its ruling position by corruption seriously. And when corruption becomes so serious that it finds itself unable to eliminate it completely, it starts worrying too much about its ruling status, so much so that it would rather cover up the seriousness of corruption in order to retain its secure position, and it will not allow outside political forces or social groups to question or challenge its power and mandate to rule over the corruption issue. It refuses outside supervision of any sort and forestalls the formation of restraining mechanisms. Power without supervision and checks invariably leads to corruption. This person also said: The corruption of power within the CPC now has developed from "power-for-money" deals in the economic realm to "power-for-power" deals in the organization and personnel realms. So-called "power-for-power" deals refer to installing one's confidantes in official positions, forming cliques, removing outsiders, and turning one's department and system into virtual fiefdoms. They are even more harmful than "power-for-money" deals. Therefore, if a relatively independent supervisory organization is not set up, the struggle against corruption can only deal with symptoms and not the underlying cause. But if corruption, now the most serious social pollutant in Mainland China, cannot be weeded out, the CPC will not be immune to the danger of being toppled.
