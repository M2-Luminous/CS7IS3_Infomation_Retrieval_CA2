So said Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma International Affairs Committee, in conversation with journalists after the first parliamentary hearings, held at the end of last week, on a priority area of Russian foreign policy -- Yugoslavia. V. Lukin made it clear that the West's stance on the former Yugoslavia does not conform in all respects with Russia's interests in the Balkan region. Sergey Lavrov, Russian Federation deputy minister of foreign affairs, made the same point when addressing deputies. He emphasized that Russia does not support the idea of air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions, as proposed by NATO, and has never ever advocated such methods for resolving the Yugoslav conflict. He reminded people that the UN resolutions permitting coercive measures against any side in the Yugoslav conflict contain tough restrictions. Such measures are possible in the event of an attack on humanitarian aid convoys, violations of the "closed skies" regime by the sides' military aircraft, or the creation of obstacles to the activities of the UN peacemaking forces. As the Russian diplomat pointed out, the NATO leadership's recent statements of readiness to make strikes against Serbian positions have not contributed to the process of negotiations on the former Yugoslavia. He reaffirmed the immutability of Russia's position on a Yugoslav settlement, which is aimed at a peaceful solution. While rating the direction of the Russian Foreign Ministry's activities at present as "correct" on the whole, Chairman Lukin recalled that the Foreign Ministry had made a serious mistake by supporting sanctions against the former Yugoslavia last spring. In the opinion of a number of observers, the State Duma is faced with the need to make a clearer assessment of Russian interests in the former Yugoslavia and to elaborate, jointly with the Foreign Ministry, ways of acting that really can result in the unblocking of the Yugoslav conflict. The activation of Russia's policy in the Balkans is becoming increasingly urgent in view of the fact that the West's leadership has virtually led the peace process into an impasse. Moreover, there is a real danger that the military conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina will escalate to an all-Balkan scale. The idea was voiced in the parliamentary lobby that the time has come for serious consultations both with Western partners and with the most influential Islamic states on the coordination of interests and the implementation of a more realistic policy in respect of the Balkans by a particular group of states. Obviously an alternative does exist to a very dangerous escalation of the conflict and to extremism in Bosnia. It lies in support for those Bosnian leaders, including Muslims, who enjoy the people's support and who have proved the sincerity of their desire for peace.
