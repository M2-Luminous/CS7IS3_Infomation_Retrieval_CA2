The agenda of the session of the upper chamber of Russia's parliament tackles some organizational issues which were left undecided at the first session, including the elections of a third deputy chairman of the Council of Federation and chairpersons of four committees (the leaders of six other committees have already been elected), adoption of the regulations of the Federation Council and several other documents. The upper chamber is also to consider several presidential decrees which cannot come into force without its approval. These include President Yeltsin's decree on prolongation of a state of emergency in the southern Republics of Ingushetia and Northern Ossetia which is likely to top the list. The Federation Council will also consider the social and economic situation in the Russian Federation, Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation Council, told a recent press conference. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is expected to report on the issue at an early date. Afterwards the prime minister and the deputies who include many heads of local administrations and presidents of Russia's republics, will discuss the 1994 budget of the Russian Federation, Shumeyko said. The discussion will precede an extended session of the government on the issue and therefore should enable, in Shumeyko's opinion, the State Duma to adopt a draft budget to be worked out by the cabinet as soon as possible. According to Shumeyko, he has coordinated the lawmaking activities of the two chambers with Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the State Duma. (The Russian Constitution has it that the Federation Council has to decide on the bills adopted by the State Duma within 14 days). There is no indication so far that the State Duma will take a non-constructive stand, Shumeyko noted. The sessions of the Federation Council will last, as a rule, for a week and then a two-week break will follow, he specified. Only 34 persons will work for the Federation Council on a full-time basis, including the chairman and his deputies, chairpersons of the committees and their deputies.
