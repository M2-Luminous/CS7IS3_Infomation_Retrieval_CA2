At the present time it is necessary to ensure for all of Europe a strong stability and security, and to jointly overcome conflicts on national grounds. In order to achieve this goal, we must develop a consistent strategy of action which strengthens the unity of all the democratic states of Europe, a common European partnership. Today, agreements on partnership and announcements of intentions are clearly apparent. However, there is as yet no regulated stable and mature partnership which is backed by the necessary resources. This is evidenced by the difficulties which Russia is encountering, along with other post-communist countries, in conducting negotiations with the Western partners regarding access to the market without discrimination and on the basis of free competition. For example, today the European Union proposes for democratic Russia a ceiling of 10 percent for the export of nuclear materials, while even quite recently the Soviet Union had 16 percent. Partnership in the political sphere is still being subjected to serious trials along the sharp turns of European policy. The latest example is the unilateral ultimatum on Sarajevo. One may debate the expediency or inexpediency of the threat of using forceful measures by a certain deadline. Today this matter has passed and there is no sense in returning to a review of all the "pros" and "cons." However, it is obvious that the adoption of such decisions without consultation, with coordination with all the key state officials participating in the search for Yugoslav regulation, in this case with Russia, in itself introduces an unnecessary element of tension and, frankly speaking, risk. This is why today it is important not to lose the tempo, to make use of the moment of positive movement created by the initiative of President Boris Yeltsin, which has led to an important breakthrough in lifting the blockade of Sarajavo. We need energetic and necessarily joint actions. Moreover, these may even be rather decisive measures, but they must be jointly undertaken. In the context of unified efforts, the individual powers, as well as their associations, including NATO, will find their place and make their contribution. The block, bipolar system of security is irreversably retreating before the realities of a multipolar world. To hold onto the illusion, as some naive political scientists do, that a membership card in a military-political alliance is a panacea for all ills, is to close one's eyes to the essence of the processes going on in Europe, to the nature of the crisis of the new generation. Such an approach initially presupposes the presence if not of a real, then of an imagined enemy. In any case, it is fraught with new splits and divisive tears in Europe. Moreover, not only are the ghosts of the past--aggressive nationalism, territorial aspirations, religious intolerance--not retreating, but the danger of their turning into a real factor of European policy is increasing. We cannot agree that Europe is experiencing another repartition in the zones of influence. According to our conviction, it is important not to let the chance to form a unified democratic Europe slip by. This presupposes the provision of an equal level of security for each state, a real partnership on the basis of the common democratic principles of the CSCE [Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe]. I am sincerely concerned by the longevity of certain outdated dogmas and arguments. Some political leaders are even trying to pass them off as axioms of current European policy. The first argument: Accelerated membership by the East European states in NATO will not only "remove the barriers dividing Europe," but "will become a step in strengthening democracy and stability, from which Russia itself will stand to win." The question is, what Russia? Russia--the great power following the path of democratic transformations and openness to the world, or an isolated Russia, and consequently one which may again turn into a military camp. The second argument, which does not fully correspond with the first: The expansion of NATO through the East Europeans is necessary, since Russia is unpredictable and is infected with neoimperialist ambitions. Well, in the case of emergence of new barriers in Europe and isolation of Russia, it will become predictable: Armed with missiles and threatening its neighbors. The third argument. Russia intends to hinder the states of Central and Eastern Europe from meeting their needs for reliable security. This too is not so. We do not dispute the sovereign right of any country to ensure its own defense, including by means of joining in various military-political alliances. But if we want a peaceful life for ourselves and our children, the criterion here must be the degree to which the steps taken facilitate stability in the region as a whole. We are proceeding from the fact that there are no longer grounds to class the European countries into those which threaten and those which are threatened. Today the Europeans are on one side of the barrier, while the problems which they must deal with--economic, social, and international--are on the other. These are the three components of European security, which cannot be divided. For decades, dissident democrats in our countries have struggled for common values, turning their glances to the CSCE, the only common European structure, which became their Magna Carta. Today the national-patriots are encroaching on these values. However, for the first time we have the unique capacity to defend them, using all the wealth of the existing European institutions. From this stems the conception of the common European partnership, which Russia proposes. Here are its basic elements. First. Developing Euro-Atlantic cooperation on the basis of transformation of the CSCE into an effective all-regional political organization, and the Council for North Atlantic Cooperation (CNAC)--into an independent structure of military-political cooperation, but one which is closely tied to the CSCE. The goal is to coordinate the efforts of NATO, the EC [European Community], the Council of Europe, the West European countries and the WEU [Western European Union], and the CIS in the sphere of strengthening stability and security, peacemaking and protection of the rights of national minorities in Europe. Second. Increasing cooperation within the framework of the CNAC with the involvement of the neutral states of Europe, including on the realization of the program, "Partnership in the Name of Peace," on an equal basis, and turning the CNAC into an independent agency with a compact secretariat. The CNAC may become the common European laboratory for peacemaking, greater openness in military activity and conversion of the VPK [military-industrial complex]. Third. Formulating a network of mutually-supplementing bilateral agreements on partnership, cooperation and consultations not only between NATO, on the one hand, and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, Ukraine and so forth, but also between the states which are not members of the alliance. We do not exclude the possibility that Russia too will someday become a part of NATO, but today the key factor is the concept of partnership. The advantage and, if you will, the farsightedness of the program adopted by NATO leaders, "Partnership in the Name of Peace," consists specifically of the fact that it seems to open up NATO and takes the first step in changing it over from a block to some other form of security organization. And so, common European partnership fits entirely into our conception. In the future we see also the opening of a channel of communications between the CIS and NATO. Fourth. Granting the countries of Central Europe reciprocal guarantees of security on the part of Russia and its West European partners. Such a network could be extended to all of Europe. Fifth. Increasing the peacemaking potential of the European states, seeking a unified response by Europe to the conflicts of the new generation. Giving practical aid in peacemaking efforts of Russia and the CIS on the territory of the former USSR. Sixth. Strengthening the European component of the regimen of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, other types of mass destruction weapons and missile technologies, as well as promises to tighten control over the sale of "dual purpose" technologies and the most destructive types of conventional weapons, primarily in the zones of conflict. Seventh. Increasing economic potential for purposes of stability and security on the continent. Including Russia and the states of Eastern Europe in the international division of labor on an equal and nondiscriminatory basis, and ensuring their entry into the European and world markets. Our proposals echo the concepts expressed in numerous European states. We are ready to cooperate closely with our East European colleagues in the search for the best decisions and realization of a program of partnership.
