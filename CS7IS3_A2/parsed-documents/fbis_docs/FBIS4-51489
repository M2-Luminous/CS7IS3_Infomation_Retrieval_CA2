Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said today that the army was now facing a shortage of armoured vehicles as it had sent a substantial number of such vehicles to protect its troops serving under the United Nations in Bosnia and Somalia. He said although the army had about 1,000-odd armoured vehicles in its inventory, almost one-third were between 20 and 30 years old. He added that the choice was between buying new armoured personnel carriers, which would cost hundreds of millions ringgit or upgrade and refurbish the existing armoured vehicles. "We are studying the cost of such work and hope to make a decision soon," said Najib in an interview. Apart from the 200-odd Commando V-150 APCs, the army also has about 500 German-made Condor APCs, 165 Belgium-made Sibma Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) 25 British-made Scorpion AFVs, 26 Stormer APCs, and an unconfirmed number of Ferret Scout cars. The Scorpions and Stormers are armoured tracked vehicles while the others are armoured wheeled vehicles. The most modern of the vehicles are the Scorpions and the Stormers, which were delivered in the mid-80s. The Ferrets, he said, were about 30 years old and were used by security forces as escort vehicles during operations against the communist terrorists during the 1960s and 1970s. The Commandos, which were also used extensively in counter- insurgency operations, were delivered in batches from 1973 with the last delivery in 1983. MMC Engineering Services Sdn Bhd [Company Limited] (MMCE), a wholly owned subsidiary of Malaysia Mining Corporation Bhd, had been awarded a contract to modernise the Ferret Scout cars at its plant in Nilai, Negri Sembilan. It is also carrying out general overhaul work on the Condors which are more than 10 years old with the help of the manufacturer, Thyssen Industrie AG Henschel of Germany. MMCE had also been given a contract to reengine some of the Commandos from petrol to diesel to save costs and ensure a longer engine lifespan. Meanwhile, Cadillac Gage, the United States manufacturer of the Commando APCs, said refurbishing the vehicles would cost one-third of the price of buying a brand new APC and that it would extend the service lifespan of the vehicles by between 10 and 15 years.
