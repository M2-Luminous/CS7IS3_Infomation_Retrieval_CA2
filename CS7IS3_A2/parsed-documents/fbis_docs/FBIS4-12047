While no one has the right to question and doubt the necessity of this great duty and while the need to adhere to this religious rite has an ever increasing importance in today's world, is it right for some to obstruct the path of departure of Muslims toward the House of God and to be among those who obstruct the path of God and who hinder the departure toward this House? While some holy and religious cities easily welcome and house over two million pilgrims a day throughout the year, is it dignified for an Islamic country such as Saudi Arabia, which enjoys so much God-given wealth, to claim that it is not able to provide suitable and necessary services for the pilgrims of the House of God? Is it basically befitting for a wealthy country such as Saudi Arabia to express inability and impotence in providing services at the time of this religious duty of world Muslim people? If there really is a disability in the management of the holy sanctuaries and in provision of services to the pilgrims, it would be suitable for this to be announced to Islamic governments so that the affluent and able Islamic countries can come to aid and assist the government of Arabia in a decent administration of the pilgrimage duty. However, to prevent the departure of enthusiastic Iranian pilgrims, who have waited for years for their turn to visit the House of the Friend, the government of Arabia has brought up the subject of accepting quotas of one-thousandth or a thousand pilgrims per one million population. There are a number of significant issues involved here, the first of which is the fact that the quota system has no basis in religious laws and there are no references to this in either the Koran or the tradition of the prophet. To the contrary -- the prevention of visits to the mosques of God or blocking the path of God and the House of God have been the subject of rebuke and censure. Second, while many Islamic countries and Muslim nations are not able to send as many pilgrims as their declared quotas, should there be any constraints -- from the point of view of religious law -- in increasing the quota of countries such as Iran? Furthermore has the acceptance of 120,000 Iranian pilgrims caused any problems in the past? Why should the government of Arabia accept more than the announced pilgrim quotas from some other countries but when it comes to the Muslim people of Iran the matter is left to detailed accounting? It is possible to point to these nations -- including Egypt -- whose population is less than Iran, but the government of Arabia accepts tens of thousands more of their pilgrims than their claimed quota. The other important point is that this quota system was planned and administered after the tragic killing of pilgrims to the divine sanctuary in 1987. This indicates that the government of Arabia has taken a political stance regarding the pilgrimage and is playing a political game with the religious duties of people. Of course, political experts and analysts more or less understand the sensitivity and negative consequences of such act. While the Islamic world is facing an extensive military and cultural offensive by the West and its regional agents and while Muslims are the target of extensive anti-moral and anti-Islamic bombardments through satellites or books such as apostate Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses and while in Bosnia, Palestine, Kashmir, Somalia, and Algeria world Muslim are killed by Westerners or their agents, is it suitable for this congregation of pilgrims -- which is the most important gathering and congress of Islamic unity against the above aggressions -- to be limited or for religious duties to be restrained? It is necessary for the government of Arabia to look at this issue from a brotherly point of view -- which has always been emphasized by Islamic Iran -- and to remove those officials who might cause, even with a hint from foreigners, such unnecessary problems between the two Muslim nations and countries and thus prepare the grounds for a better administration of the glorious religious duty of pilgrimage. Presently Islamic Iran, according to the agreement of the foreign ministers of the two countries in Oman, is preparing itself for the dispatch of 120,000 Iranian pilgrims and is ready to start the great operation for their transfer to Arabia. Arabia's adherence to the Koranic principle of fulfilling covenant, which is the very basis of international law and relations, is a religious and moral duty that will in turn open the way for the administration of ceremonies by the enthusiastic pilgrims of the House of God.
