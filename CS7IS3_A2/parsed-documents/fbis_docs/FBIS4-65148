Although this is the reason for my appearance--bearing in mind the social disquiet that has been caused and the political uncertainty experienced in the past few days--you will understand if I make, albeit briefly, a number of points of a more general nature. First, the circumstances that can be explained with regard to the flight of Mr. Roldan were explained by former Interior Minister Asuncion in an appearance before the joint justice and interior committee held last week after the calling of this plenary session. The course of the investigation by a large team from the security forces is continuing both inside and outside our borders. We hope it will bear fruit as soon as possible. For my part, ladies and gentlemen, to add any more details on this task would be imprudent because it could detract from the effectiveness of the work of the security forces. You know, however, ladies and gentlemen, that the prosecutor's office has applied for the freezing of Mr. Roldan's current accounts. This will not only facilitate the work of justice but will also limit his capacity for movement. Second, knowledge of the government's position is called for with regard to the other responsibilities of all kinds that arise from his flight. In my view, these responsibilities could have a political, administrative, or penal nature. There seems to be no doubt that political responsibilities exist, although the juridical-constitutional limits of surveillance are also clear. Well, after the first report--the first, ladies and gentlemen--of the disappearance of Mr. Roldan, the interior minister presented his irrevocable resignation in less than 24 hours. This is an assumption of political responsibility with regard to the specific fact of the flight itself. Bearing in mind the gravity of the matter overall and its great social repercussions, [former Interior Minister] Mr. Corcuera gave up his seat as a deputy in a gesture that, by its very nature, surely goes beyond the normal demands of such responsibilities. In relation to his flight, there is no doubt that there could be other kinds of responsibilities in the administrative or penal areas. The ministry is investigating those that may have lain in its jurisdiction. If penal responsibilities derive from this investigation, the findings will be passed on to the judiciary so that they can be dealt with in accordance with the law. However, I want to make it clear to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the main priority is to place Mr. Roldan at the disposal of the courts. The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Interior are directing their utmost efforts to this end. Consequently, it is necessary to recognize the serious public concern caused by his flight. One can and should be critical and demanding with regard to the circumstances that brought about his flight, but one should not be more specific at the present time in order to avoid prejudicing the work of the security forces. Responsibility can be demanded for a fault confirmed by the facts; this has already been fully assumed. In my view, one should not speculate from positions of responsibility about hypothetical blackmail or impossible battles of wills in a law-governed state. As a government, still less can we accept any suggestion of connivance. For us, I repeat, more than for anyone, the main priority is to place Mr. Roldan at the disposal of the courts. The fulfillment of this intention will clearly demonstrate that there cannot be any kind of impunity. I know that some groups have persistently asked, now and on previous occasions, for my resignation as prime minister. As I have already said to the House with regard to the positions taken--when they do not have clearly biased connotations and partisan or other interests--I believe that it is my obligation to remain at the head of the government, respecting the will of the ballot box, helping to clarify this and other matters, with the aim of seeing justice done and the necessary confidence reestablished in the institutions. I said at the beginning of my address that I thought it was necessary to explain my government's attitude toward the disquiet caused in our society by this and other events of undoubted importance, even though they may not be the specific motive of the request for my appearance today. We are witnessing the recovery of our economy, together with what this means for employment. This is without a doubt the greatest and the most constant concern of our society. As a government, we are duty bound to maintain political stability and to overcome the justified concern of society, not only because of the importance that this has in itself but also in order to establish the climate of confidence that aids the process of recovery. So, ladies and gentlemen, I feel myself doubly obliged to contribute through the action of the government to reestablishing this confidence in the functioning of the institutions, and I am firmly determined to do so. For this reason, I do not share the requests for my resignation, in the conviction that this would generate a climate of instability that would make this task more difficult. Three weeks ago, during the state of the nation debate, we discussed in depth the problem created by the cases of corruption. We decided on government actions, parliamentary actions, and we also announced our readiness to accept those responsibilities corresponding to us. We considered it necessary to improve the instruments for anticipating, investigating, and judging irregular practices and corrupt conduct. Since that time, Mr. Roldan's flight has, without a doubt, heightened the climate of social concern. At the same time, however, the government and parliament have acted by fulfilling the commitments emanating from that debate. In these three weeks, we have demonstrated with actions our capacity to adopt measures, measures that strengthen the chambers' control or which entail government initiatives and decisions. We have also demonstrated our readiness to assume political responsibilities by virtue of the desire to contribute to the lessening of society's disquiet or the desire not to prejudice a shared project. We are thereby contributing to the improvement of the situation, despite those incidents that may occur on the way. Today one can see with the clarity provided by the facts that the fight against corruption is a priority of our political action. [passage omitted] As I said at the beginning of my statement, a series of political responsibilities have to be assumed, and this is what has happened over the last few days. I have already mentioned the decision by former Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion to tender his resignation, assuming his political responsibility for the flight of Mr. Roldan. I have also mentioned Mr. Corcuera, who has given up his seat in parliament--linking it to his former responsibility as interior minister. Mr. Carlos Solchaga, former head of the parliamentary group and socialist deputy, also tendered his resignation from both posts, linking them to the responsibility taken on when he was finance and economy minister. There was also the case of Mr. Rubio, the former governor of the Bank of Spain. I have said before--and I repeat myself here--that, in my opinion, this taking of responsibility most surely goes beyond what can reasonably be expected. The generosity of those who assumed responsibility, however, is meant to contribute and to give a stronger answer to this situation and to reestablish the citizens' confidence in the institutions and in their political representatives. Finally, the former agriculture minister [Vidente Albero] also assumed his political responsibility linked to tax issues, which he explained to the public after presenting his irrevocable resignation. The recent events show clearly that there cannot be any kind of impunity in our democracy. In fact, there is none for irregular or illegal acts. Furthermore, they show our will as a political group to assume our responsibilities. Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is urgent to finish this set of measures and to clarify fully the corruption situations in order to wipe out any kind of feeling of impunity that may have been felt and to thus clear up any uncertainties that might weaken the impulse and energy needed for ending the economic recession. This recovery means reestablishing confidence in the future. That can only happen in a calmer atmosphere than the one we have had over the last few days. The best contribution we can all make to this climate of confidence would be for everyone to assume their responsibility and renounce political advantages made by hurting the whole of society. It is our duty to avoid causing more social alarm, considering the circumstances we must face, and to help restore as soon as possible a climate of confidence in the institutions and in the real economic possibilities that exist in the future. We cannot reach this without political stability. Following the 6 June elections, in order to guarantee this stability, one has to complete the majority that is governing in minority--which our party represents. This is what we are doing, correctly interpreting the will the citizens expressed in voting. In our democratic system, a respect for rules represents a guarantee for all. It does not help stability, and thereby does not help the confidence we need for economic recovery, if we try and discuss alternatives not chosen by the voters. As prime minister, I agree to have a vote of no confidence as soon as I feel that it is necessary to determine the support, or lack of it, in this chamber. This has not happened until now. So it is our obligation as a government to continue making the necessary decisions to combat corruption cases and to reestablish a climate of confidence that will further the recovery of our economy. Ladies and gentlemen, the initiatives that make this double task more difficult will, sooner or later, be seen as negative by the society because they will diminish the needed political stability. Thank you very much.
