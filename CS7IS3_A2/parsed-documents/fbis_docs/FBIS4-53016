They said though threat and pressure of outside forces against the DPRK have been intensified, the Korean people have registered tremendous achievements in socialist construction. Member of parliament Ali Ibrahim Tutu said after visiting the construction site of the Rungna suspension bridge: "I was deeply impressed by the sight of soldiers engaged in peaceful construction with safety helmets and welders, not military helmets and rifles. Though the mass media of the West are alleging that Korea is making war preparations on an extensive scale, they can never cover up the truth." He said he was deeply moved by the strong spirit of the Korean people, who were doing their business with courage and composure even in a serious confrontation with the imperialists. Mayor Gurbuz Capan of Esenyurt City, Istanbul, said after visiting the Mangyongdae school children's palace that he could see the happiness and the bright future of the Korean people through the beaming faces of children. Noting that the Korean people without worries about food and clothing are granted excellent benefits and conditions by the state in educating and bringing up children, he stressed that Korea is an earthly paradise, a country of the people. Female lawyer Senal Sarihan said Korea that has successfully built socialism is the ideological support to her. Pointing out that Korea is a model for the world people aspiring after a new life, she stressed that the press circles of the West captive to prejudice must regain reason and properly look at and represent the reality.
