During the debate on a draft resolution on the trilateral statement by the Ukrainian, U.S. and Russian presidents, Deputy Serhiy Holovatyy put forward an amendment to Paragraph 2, as follows: "To this end (in order to exchange ratification certificates), government activity should be stepped up to conclude specific international agreements that follow from the reservations in the Supreme Council's resolution on the ratification of the START I Treaty [the resolution now in question is that of 18 November 1993]." This version of the resolution was approved by the Supreme Council of Ukraine. In the official text of the resolution, however, a different version of Paragraph 2 was presented. Namely, the words "to this end" were excluded. Thus, the contents of the Supreme Council's decision on this issue were essentially altered. The text of Paragraph 2 in its amended version makes provision for the following sequence of the Ukrainian Government's actions relating to the START I Treaty: first, concluding international agreements [words indistinct] Holovatyy, it was stated that Ukraine lifted all reservations relating to the START I Treaty, also including security guarantees. [passage indistinct] In fact, this does not conform with reality.
