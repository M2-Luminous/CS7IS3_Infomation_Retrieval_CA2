Col. Anders Eisen revealed. "Before we can reply, the Air Force and the JAS consortium has to fix its next program of test flights," he said. "The only thing we can do at the moment is show the aircraft on the ground or in a simple fly-past." The JAS received bad press when it crashed during an air show at the Water Festival last year. According to Jan Ahlgren of Saab's Military Aircraft Division, Norway -- which will start replacing its U.S. F-5 aircraft by the turn of the century -- is among the countries which have shown an interest in the JAS-39.
