FR940610-1-00054 FR940610-1-00008 A number of commenters addressed the potential link between diet and learning and behavioral difficulties. These comments ranged from general observations regarding improper nutrition and lack of concentration, to specific concerns addressing functional disabilities, behavioral disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive disabilities. Commenters also pointed out that nutritional issues are especially vital for under-privileged and ethnic populations. Specifically, commenters cited the poor nutritional intake among low income children and certain minority populations. One commenter indicated that these populations, who are most at risk, do not appear to associate nutritional risk factors with leading causes of death. Commenters also expressed concern over the high incidence of major diseases among low-income, minority populations_specifically, the higher incidence of heart disease and hypertension among African-Americans, obesity among Hispanics and Native Americans, and diabetes among Native Americans. Finally, a large number of commenters addressed the growing incidence of obesity among children, and the threat this poses to future health. A number of commenters expressed concern over the lack of physical activity in schools as a factor leading to the increase of obesity among school children. Several indicated the need to integrate exercise with other components of good health including school meals. In addition, the unique needs of children with special health problems, the need for proper diet in the prevention of osteoporosis, and the escalating cost of health care and the role of diet as a preventative measure were identified as important concerns. Dietary Guidelines for Americans' Comments Over 700 commenters, many from the public and from the school food service community, addressed the issue of school meals meeting nutritional guidelines, the majority of which overwhelmingly agreed that meals should comply with the Dietary Guidelines, especially the recommended limits on fat and saturated fat. Most commenters agreed with the need for school meals to meet the Dietary Guidelines; however, several commenters indicated that compliance with the Dietary Guidelines should be voluntary. With respect to the current meal patterns, many school food service commenters indicated that they could not meet the Dietary Guidelines within the meal pattern requirements, and others indicated that the current meal pattern requirements make it difficult to provide multi-cultural meals to children. Many commenters supported the implementation of Nutrient Standard Menu Planning (NSMP), a menu planning system that is based on the analysis of nutrients. Commenters believed this system would provide increased flexibility in meal planning as well as consistent analysis of nutrients. Commenters also suggested that this NSMP approach can assist in providing more culturally diverse meals. It must be noted that some commenters expressed concern that some smaller schools may not have or be able to afford the technical capability needed to conduct the analysis. Some commenters also suggested that the Department or State agencies should develop menus that meet the Dietary Guidelines. These menus can be used by smaller and school districts with fewer resources, which may initially have difficulty implementing NSMP. Nutrition Education Comments Close to 800 commenters pointed to the need for nutrition education for parents, teachers, children, food service staff, and school administrators. Many commenters came from the nutrition and food service arenas as well as the general public. Commenters supported the idea that nutrition education should be included in comprehensive health education curriculums and should begin at an early age. Commenters also indicated the need for nutrition education to be reinforced by healthful meals in the cafeteria. Commenters pointed to the need for a national nutrition media campaign. Many school food service commenters expressed their desire for national minimum professional standards which food service personnel would be expected to meet. In addition, a significant number of commenters urged health promotion as a component of health care. Finally, many commenters supported the need for increased funding for the Department's Nutrition Education and Training (NET) program, 7 CFR Part 227. Taste and Plate Waste Comments Many commenters from a wide range of commenter categories were quite critical of the current quality of school meals, noting that lack of appeal leads to increased plate waste. Some cautioned, however, that drastic changes in the kinds of food served may drive children away from school meals. These commenters generally supported the need to make meals both appealing to children and nutritious. A number of commenters also cautioned that the increased amount of certain foods that may be necessary to provide a nutritious diet may result in more plate waste if children do not find the meals to be appetizing. Several commenters supported the need to involve culinary institutes and chefs in meal preparation as a way to improve taste and presentation. Fat in Meals Comments Nearly one out of two commenters discussed fat in school meals, with most of these commenters coming from the general public and the medical community. The large majority of commenters who addressed the issue of fat content cited the need to lower fat and saturated fat levels in school lunches. Some of the comments were general statements such as ``need more low fat foods,'' while others made specific recommendations detailing the levels of fat and saturated fat that school meals should meet. A number of medical, public health, and school food service related organizations addressed this issue, all of which were in support of lowering the fat content of meals. A number of commenters recommended that the fat content of meals be set at between 10 to 20 percent of total calories_lower than the current Dietary Guidelines recommendation of 30 percent of calories from fat.
