The statement writes: "Taking advantage by establishing the democracy in Albania and the friendly feelings of the Albanian people toward the Greek one, the Greek chauvinists used all their means to bring to Albania propagandistic materials, so-called `Vorio Epiri' flags, Greek priests with anti-Albanian missions, as it was the case of Kostas Stamos; in illegal ways they tried to take the leadership of the Albanians Orthodox Church through Janullatus, who has declared himself the prime bishop of the Albanian Autocephaly Orthodox Church through devices and contrary to the statute of our church. Janullatus has been hindering the Albanian state through slanders and has gathered around himself anti Albanian elements." The committee underlines that it is for preserving the friendship with the Greek people and primarily with our Greek brothers of the Greek minority. But at the same time, the committee emphasizes that it is for a strict approach and determination against the chauvinism. "Every piece of the Albanian soil is sacred," the statement emphasizes. Further on the statement continues as following: "We urge our government to take measures that these acts never be repeated, to inform all the international organisms of this question, to dismiss Anastas Janullatus as soon as possible because as it has been proved that he has caused great damages to our country. We will solve our state and church problems without the Greek intervention."
