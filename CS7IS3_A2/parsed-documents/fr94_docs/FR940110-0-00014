FR940110-0-00014 FR940110-0-00004 Section 910.80 of the order authorizes the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, to establish minimum quantities and types of shipments which shall be free from regulation under this order. Section 910.180(d)(3) of the administrative rules and regulations prescribes procedures governing exemption from volume and size regulations for organic lemons handled in minimum quantities. On July 23, 1993, Mr. Rich Hart, President of Rainbow Valley Orchards, sent a letter to the Committee requesting an increase in the amount of organic lemons a handler may ship free of order regulations to 500 cartons per week. Currently, handlers can ship up to 350 cartons of such lemons weekly. At its August 3, 1993, meeting, the Committee recommended increasing the organic exemption provision from 350 to 500 cartons per week that handlers may ship to organic or health food wholesalers and retailers without regard to volume and size regulations. The vote on the recommendation was 12 in favor and 1 abstention. The person who abstained expressed a concern with the definition of organic. Shippers of organic lemons have indicated that organic fruit markets can absorb more fruit than in the past, and that they need to take advantage of the additional marketing opportunity. The Committee expects the increase in shipments allowed will provide shipping flexibility for organic shippers and will facilitate the marketing of organic lemons. The Committee also believes that sales of organic lemons will not adversely impact sales of regulated lemons. The interim final rule was issued on October 4, 1993, with an effective date of October 8, 1993, and published in the Federal Register [58 FR 52401, October 8, 1993]. The interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending November 8, 1993, and no comments were received. The interim final rule amended the rules and regulations of the lemon marketing order. This rule modifies language in the order's rules and regulations to increase from 350 to 500 cartons per week, the amount of organic lemons handlers may ship free of order regulations. Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the information collection requirements that are contained in this rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned OMB No. 0581&hyph;0120. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 910 Lemons, Marketing agreements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 910 is amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for 7 CFR part 910 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674. PART 910_LEMONS GROWN IN CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA 2.
