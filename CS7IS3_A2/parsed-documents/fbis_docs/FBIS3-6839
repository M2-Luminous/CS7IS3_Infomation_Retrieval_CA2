Domestic demand contributed to pushing up the gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.0 percentage point and external demand to depressing it by 0.6 percentage point, the agency said. Consumer spending, one of the prime engines of domestic demand, rose 0.7 percent from the previous quarter, while another pillar, corporate capital spending, declined 3.5 percent. Meanwhile, Japan's real or inflation-adjusted gross national product (GNP) during the quarter shrank 0.4 percent from the quarter before, or an annualized 1.6 percent. GDP and GNP represent the total output of goods and services, with the GDP excluding net income from abroad. Starting with the previous quarter, the agency switched its emphasis from GNP to GDP to assess the nation's economic performance more accurately in line with international trends.
