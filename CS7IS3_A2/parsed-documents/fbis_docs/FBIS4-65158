He said this Tuesday [10 May] following his meeting with Tjeenk Willink, who is consulting on behalf of the crown on which government coalition is possible. Van Mierlo, who let it be known through Tjeenk Willink that nothing more could be said about the content of the talk, said that "there was no reason for pessimism. We are moving forward one step at a time and every day things are getting a little more purple." On Tuesday, Tjeenk Willink received the floor leaders of the three parties which must be part of the "purple coalition." Now that it looks like these talks will be successful, there is an expectation that Tjeenk Willink will talk with these three at the same time. Observers in The Hague do not rule out that Tjeenk Willink will be able to present the queen with his conclusions this week, meaning that his information-gathering efforts lasted shorter than he was expecting on Monday.
