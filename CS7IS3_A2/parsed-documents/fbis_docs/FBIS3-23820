The well-known politician and economist Gavriil Popov recently visited ARGUMENTY I FAKTY. Today we are publishing the first part of a conversation with him. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] At this time everyone expects inflation to increase and is trying to salvage his small savings somehow. As an analyst, do you allow for the further siphoning in of currency and hyperinflation? [Popov] There will be no hyperinflation. I believe the concept of manipulating paper currency to be brilliant. On one occasion, Keynes was asked to outline the essence of his teachings in an easy to understand manner, and he narrated: "Someone manufactured a counterfeit dollar and bought meat with it. The butcher paid a greengrocer for carrots with his dollar. The greengrocer paid a tailor. The tailor paid a watch repairman. It reached a physician, who did not intend to spend the dollar and took it to the bank. At the bank it turned out that the dollar was counterfeit. Subsequently, everyone began to return this dollar to one another, and it went back to the manufacturer of the counterfeit dollar. He gathered together all the participants, 15 people, and said: `It is true that the dollar is counterfeit. However, each one of you got 10 cents of absolutely real profit on this counterfeit dollar. In total, you got 150 cents of absolutely real profit. Let us cover the counterfeit dollar with 100 cents from these profits, and it will become real. As far as the 50 cents is concerned, split it among the 15 people and everybody will still have a profit.'" In essence, if the circulation of deceptive, inflationary paper money yields profits that exceed the volume of emission, nothing horrible happens. F. Roosevelt carried this out in reality in bringing the United States out of the Great Depression. Therefore, even if emission increases, nothing horrible happens as long as circulation together with profits exceed this emission. Danger looms when, in conventional terms, two rubles [R] are issued while only R1.5 in profits is generated; then currency depreciation begins. If even a deceptive instrument energizes the entire economic circulation, it ultimately becomes something real. However, the state should still control the volume of inflation. To this end, we should have a cerebrating and wise government which is capable of taking risks, that is, completely different people. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] A reader wrote to us: Let us collect what foreign exchange remains and buy a wise government abroad. [Popov] A wise government for Russia cannot be found abroad. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] To your mind, what is particularly dangerous for our government? [Popov] The pattern of forming the government that has been accepted is the most dangerous. People allegedly representing parties have become members. They belong to the government, but they do not intend to be responsible for the actions of the government. Everyone pulls his own way, like the swan, the crawfish, and the pike in Krylov's fable. I believe that Chubays may be a member of the government, but not as a representative of Russia's Choice. The same is the case with Shokhin and everyone else. There may also be a second variant: the government consists of party representatives. Shokhin represents the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], Chubays--the Choice, but then it will be a coalition government rather than Chernomyrdin's government. In this case, all the factions in the Duma must be responsible for it. What is happening now? There is a government, to which these people belong, and in the Duma they intend to sign a collective document aimed against this government! This is the most horrible thing. This cannot be allowed to happen. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Still, if it were up to you, how would you form the government? [Popov] The government will not be able to carry out any fundamental reform in the two years until new elections. This is why from the very beginning I would consider our current government to be transitional. It should prepare the premises for the next four years. It should primarily cleanse the country from the most scandalous consequences of Gaydar's, Fedorov's, and Chubays' shock therapy and mainly resolve the issue of taxation. Have you not filled out a declaration yet? This is what it indicates: for example, workers must pay a tax if an official bus takes them to work. A veteran who retires and receives a benefit is also taxed. They have not yet resolved to tax the voucher, but as soon as you buy shares with it, you are taxed. Even if you do not receive profits from stock, changes in the price of stock also constitute income and, therefore, are taxed. If they got you a newspaper or magazine subscription at work, this is income, and you pay tax. If a theater ticket was purchased for you or if there was a collective visit, you pay tax. One gets the impression that the impoverished officialdom must fleece the country to the hilt in order to raise the minister's salary by a factor of two. As far as people in the creative arts are concerned, this is an outrage pure and simple. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Gavriil Kharitonovich, you are a radical politician, but for some reason you did not support the shock therapy of Gaydar's reforms (although Gaydar believes that he has not yet reached the shock). Why? [Popov] Shock therapy was in the interests of not only the West but also the Russian bureaucracy. It would never have been implemented here had this not been the case. If there is anyone who did not agonize over the shock, it is Yegor Timurovich. I think he was ready to go for the shock until the last Yeltsin voter. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] However, as steadfast reformers are trying to convince us, privatization has won, and a return to the old times is not possible. [Popov] Privatization as such does not resolve the main issue. Private property has been present in the history of humanity for 2,000 years. However, it became the driving force of progress only in the environment of free competition which was created by capitalism. Under feudalism there was the feudal lord, who was also the landowner. However, he did not have competition, and there was no incentive to improve the state of affairs. Privatization should proceed to the extent to which a competitive situation is created thereafter. If you have one plant in the entire country, the situation will not improve but will rather become more dangerous because we proclaim it to be private. After all, when a state-appointed director is ensconced, he is dependent on the state; he has no great interest in maneuvering. Imagine now that we have a private owner here. For example, can a state-appointed director allocate R5 million for a bribe? No, he has to report. The private owner may do so freely if this holds the promise of R15 million in profit later. Monopolies with private owners are a horrible thing. Please recall that antitrust laws have been passed in the United States, whereas we left everything to its own devices. We should abandon a monopolized structure. This means very large expenditures. Enterprises must be converted into joint-stock companies so that employees will share in the profits and be better motivated. However, enterprises may not be made private. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] If we look a little ahead, how do you see our society precisely a year from now? [Popov] There is a specific scenario. First: the president makes a decision, but the Duma does not poll 50 percent of the vote for it. Therefore, the decision is rejected. Or the Duma makes a decision, the president fails to sign it, the proposal is returned to the Duma and fails to poll two-thirds of the vote--likewise, the decision is not passed. This adversarial scenario must end in the dissolution of the Duma. Since by that time the Duma will have been working for a year, the president will have the right to do this (as early as January). A second version: the Duma, the president, and the government begin to operate making an effort not to get involved in conflicts among themselves. I do not think that this is going to be very effective because all structures feel uncertain. The president and the Duma know that elections are coming in one and a half years, and the government knows that a new president will need a new Duma. Therefore, their entire activities will amount to a game of "short-term gains." That is, they will implement a set of measures so that their effect will be felt within three to seven months. In this case, this may be used in the preelection struggle. They likewise cannot do anything radically bad in this mode because it will also be used in the preelection struggle. From the point of view of tranquility, this is a normal scenario. From the point of view of reforms, this means slowing down the pace. The third scenario: all of them will adhere to the same strategy, but do work to be built on in the future. I would consider this scenario to be the best. [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Will Yeltsin still be president a year from now? [Popov] Of course. After all, he wants to be reelected yet again. If we do not proceed from that, I cannot explain his actions otherwise. [No 8, Feb, p 3] [Part 2] [Text] The People Do not Want Any Shooting The motion picture "Repentance" has a scene in which an old woman asks whether this road leads to the temple, and she is told: "No, this is Varlam Street, it cannot lead to the temple." The December elections showed that those who voted rejected the version of reforms that was proclaimed following August 1991. Although until then the "top" had maintained that the chosen model was the right one and that the people supported it. But it became clear in a matter of hours here that the country was opposed. To formulate it concisely, this was the road of the post-August Boris Nikolayevich which also "did not lead to the temple," just as that of Mikhail Sergeyevich had not. Is this a tragedy or a success? A success, I believe. Had we dragged out this process, the next stage of the conflict would have been very grim. In actual fact, whose election program, pray, contained shock therapy? It was in no one's. Whose program contained the abolition of the USSR? No one's. Whose program contained the fact that governors, mayors, and so forth, would be appointed from the top? Again, no one had this. So that after August 1991 an entirely different concept of reforms, different from that which had gained approval at the time of the presidential ballot in June 1991, was put forward "on the quiet." Ideas What ideas were, in fact, adopted after August? The first idea was that Russia would pursue reforms faster and better than the Soviet Union and that the Soviet Union was a burden. We are feeding them all, they are like stones around our neck. Second idea. The West will give us big money so that we might pursue the reforms. It was generally believed that the West was simply dreaming of immediately rearing a new competitor for itself. The third idea was that it was possible to get by with the current mechanism of power, having updated it somewhat. The fourth idea: Instead of the transition to a multiparty system, the idea of depoliticization was advanced. Not only the CPSU but also all political organizations at enterprises and in the army and the law enforcement authorities were banned. The bureaucracy undertook to govern itself. And, finally, the fifth idea: The national structures, which Russia had inherited from socialism, needed to adopt and conclude a federal treaty, in which there would be no Russia but dozens of krays and oblasts. But practice has shown that since the liquidation of the USSR the republics have been warring with one another and that wars are being fought within republics among individual nationalities. Thus the premise that by removing the USSR we would be removing a delayed-action mine was not justified. Economically either. There are things that simply cannot be valued in terms of money. One of man's basic instincts is self-preservation. People feel surer and more composed in a big state. And this compensates for both undernourishment and other inconveniences. Why in April had the pro-president forces not yet lost, but did so in December? First, because use was not made of the results of the referendum. Second, because the people saw that they were being governed by those who might shoot. And they categorically have no desire for any shooting. Mistakes Our movement, the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms, lost tactically on several counts. We believed that some bloc could be formed. I did not think that the personal interests of, let us say, Yavlinskiy, would be above common interests. We hoped to create a bloc with part of Volskiy's Civic Union also. There was one condition: I implored them to detach themselves from Rutskoy, and this meant detaching themselves from Lipitskiy. But they could not bring themselves to do so. We had, therefore, to act alone, and this was a futile undertaking. But I decided that it was better to lose but declare our independence than to do as the Republican Party did: become dissolved among the blocs. But all the tactical mistakes in aggregate do not cover up the main mistake--strategic. Yes, after August 1991 and the choice of new policy I realized that the electorate would run from the government fronts. That we needed to create the RDDR [Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms] as a defensive line, which would halt all these fugitives and attract them to itself. I quit the office of mayor--this was all correct. But I made a mistake. First, we erected this defensive line too close. The people were running past, bypassing not only us but Volskiy and Travkin and even the Russian Communist Party, and running up to Zhirinovskiy. Second, I had assumed that there would be both flight and confrontation at the presidential elections. I was thrown off in my calculations by the April referendum, and I underestimated the scale of the impact of October on people's minds. I believed that the people would still show patience--this purely Russian trait. Had we allowed for the fact that there would be a confrontation with the government model of reforms in December even, the RDDR would have gone to the elections aggressively and on the offensive. We proceeded, however, from the idea that the people would vote for the presidential-government party and that we would remain, as before, the opposition. But we should here, apparently, have emphasized all along the line not opposition but confrontation. That is, we should have played an entirely different game. Shock Therapy It meant that we would start to live according to the plan of transformations formulated for us in the West. The West itself, however, has not employed this plan, no developed countries have ever resorted to it. It is what they have recommended for export, to backward countries. We will admit you to our table only as second-rate partners. But account was not taken of the opinion of our people, who could put up with and agree to a great deal more in order to remain among the leaders. This is a particular historical feature of theirs. Shock therapy did not come off for the following reason also. Power after August was a bloc of two bureaucracies: young and old. At the first stage the tone was set by the young bureaucracy. What suited the old bureaucracy in the shock therapy, on the other hand, was the fact that property would be shared out under the control of the apparatus. But when the speed of the reforms increased, it transpired that the "old men" were still not prepared for it. They (as distinct from the young ones) are realists and had a presentiment that were they to openly purchase a plant, the workers would kick them out of this plant. They understood that, before buying the plant, they needed to control the militia and the public prosecutor's office and to have their own judges. But there was as yet none of this. They were opposed, therefore, to the pace that had been imposed by the shock therapy. Nor did the ideology of shock therapy rule out the fact that the purchasers would be foreigners, who, with the current value of the dollar and the ruble, would buy up many plants here. This did not suit the old bureaucracy either. And the final--social--aspect. Shock therapy proceeded from the idea that the people should themselves pay in full for all these problems of transition to the market. It was a plan whereby a large part of the people would pay for the whole of the past in full while the other part would at this time obtain the privileges. Power I consider the presence of stable power to be the most important thing for the reforms. No one will invest money and no one will work until stable prospects appear. How was the stability of power in Germany and Japan secured? Stability was secured by two conditions: there was in both places the American Army. There were elections, but such that Adenauer was in power in the FRG for 20 years, and in Japan the Liberal Democratic Party has governed for 40 years. Things could calmly be seen through to a conclusion. In South Korea or Chile stability was embodied by a military dictatorship. In Spain, by a constitutional monarchy. None of these options would do for us. Military dictatorship in a multinational state is an impracticable thing. We had an opportunity to take the Chinese path, in the event of the CPSU finding within itself the powers to reorganize. It would have been a guarantor of stability. But we did not take this path. American Army options would do even less. In my opinion, we are left with just one option: seeking a version of a coalition of political forces. This would be a center agreement. And this coalition should agree within itself on the main lines of the transitional period. I believe that two categories of people should be a part of the government. Those who are capable of creating a long-term program (if Gaydar has been removed, and he was a person of conceptual thinking, Yavlinskiy, who can create long-term programs, needs to be brought in, consequently). And those who can pull the cart. I believe that the president needs to put some distance between himself and the government. We have too big a country, we cannot permit such a concentration of power--all for the president. He should appoint the prime minister. And that is all. He should not be involved with either ministers or programs. He should remain aloof and be a guarantor of the reforms. And replace in good time a government that has realized part of the set of problems by another that could go further and realize the next stage.
