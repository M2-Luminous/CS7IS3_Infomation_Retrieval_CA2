"We do not just want a change of government, we want to exterminate the capitalist system and establish socialism as many other countries have. We will not lay down our weapons for any reason," said one of the commanders near the occupied area of Ocosingo and Altamirano. The so-called "Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN)," which took its name from the legendary peasant guerrilla leader Emiliano Zapata of the armed revolution of 1910-17, began on 1 January by occupying four important municipal capitals of Chiapas State, one of Mexico's poorest and most underdeveloped states. "We had waited many years for solutions to our problems, many years of poverty and ignorance, and that is why we decided to go to war," said the rebel commander who identified himself simply as "Captain" of the EZLN, during a conversation with journalists at one of the rebel road blocks on the San Cristobal-Ocosingo road. The insurgents first occupied San Cristobal de las Casas, Las Margaritas, Ocosingo, and Altamirano, but later left the first two towns and fell back to the mountains of the so-called chiapan highlands [altos chiapanecos], near the border with Guatemala. The first clashes have left an unofficial tally of 100 dead and several dozen wounded. Even though when they left San Cristobal De Las Casas they attacked an Army garrison near the town, their initial tactic seemed to be to fall back from the occupied areas without offering resistance to the Army in order to strike other points in the region. Another rebel commander, who identified himself with his nom de guerre, "Lieutenant [teniente] Jesus," said that "the armed struggle is the only path for changing the situation of oppression and marginalization in which the indigenous persons and peasants have been kept for 500 years." "For the poor, all the legal paths have been closed for years," added "Lieutenant Jesus, "a young man of 18 years of age who was in command of a roadblock approximately 25 km from San Cristobal. The insurgent group, whose existence was reported -- and officially denied -- last May, has apparently existed for several years. "On 1 January the war started, we declared war on the enemy, but our organization had existed for many years," said the guerrilla "Captain." "At first there were the guerrillas that only operated in the mountains, later it grew and extended its field of operation. Peasants, teachers, and workers joined the movement and that is how we formed the Zapatist National Liberation Army," he said. Now -- he added -- "we are structured like an army, we have military ranks, as the federal Army does, but we are different, we are an army of the people, not of the bourgeoisie." Witnesses said at lease 500 guerrillas participated in the occupation of the four towns. They were armed with rifles, handguns, knives, machetes, and automatic weapons such as AK-47's and Mini-14s. Wearing military uniforms and with their faces covered with ski caps or red handkerchiefs, they still occupied on Monday night the towns of Ocosingo and Altamirano, less than 100 km east of San Cristobal de las Casas. At Least four roadblocks, placed by the rebels on the road, block the access routes to Ocosingo and Altamirano. "Lieutenant Jesus" said the EZLN is prepared for a long war. "We will accept many casualties, but will never surrender our weapons. We will continue the revolution until we win it with the weapons in our hands. That is our objective," he stressed.
