At a summit marked by the EU leaders' failure to find agreement on a successor to Commission President Jacques Delors, Berlusconi told reporters at a press conference afterwards that he had found himself "on the same wave length" as the other summiteers. On the naming of a new head to the EU's executive, Berlusconi said the Italian position was that the choice would be "of a philosophy" as much as a person whence the counsel against haste. According to the Italian premier, the philosophy involves leaving only joint defence and security to the EU level of Europe, ensuring that joint economic policies are applied with a minimum of regulation and also requiring continual application of the "principle of subsidiarity" whereby the EU should not do what can be done at a lower level. The Italian candidate for the commission presidency was Ruud Lubbers, but there were no objections to the Franco-German suggestion of Belgian premier Jean Luc Dehaene. The British veto postponed any decision until mid-July. "The important thing is for each country to identify itself in the new president," said Berlusconi. "For this reason, too, we have to wait a bit." According to Berlusconi, he voiced support for a further summit on this specific issue on July 15. He also described the signing of Norway, Austria, Finland and Sweden into the EU as projecting the future union towards Central and East Europe. In other points, he said Italy's only claim in Slovenia was to the return of property confiscated from Italian nationals after the war and forecast that the EU would only be able to introduce a single currency after the year 2000.
