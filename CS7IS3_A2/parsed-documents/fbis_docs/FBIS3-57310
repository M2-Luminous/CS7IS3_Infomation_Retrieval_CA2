Conflict Building Up Between Foreign Ministry and Duma"] [Text] Andrey Kozyrev has rejected Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's ultimatum and does not intend to take a pro-Serb stance in the Bosnian conflict. The minister made this statement in an interview with the INTERFAX agency a few minutes before his flight from Moscow to Bishkek. Last Friday [21 January] the leader of the liberal democrats threatened Kozyrev with dismissal unless he changed his policy on the Balkans within a week and put himself unconditionally on the Serbs' side. According to Kozyrev, by making such demands, Zhirinovskiy is pushing Moscow toward a world war. "Certain political forces," the minister said, "are trying to drag Russia into a global catastrophe, and use this to their own advantage, to seize power.... If Zhirinovskiy or anyone else demands my resignation, I will perceive this as the best admission that my policy is correct." A conflict between the Duma and the Foreign Ministry looks inevitable. More than likely, as early as next week -- having completed his trips to Yugoslavia and Poland -- Zhirinovskiy will put his threat into practice and demand a vote of no confidence in Kozyrev. The majority of factions in the Duma will scarcely be able to resist the temptation to settle scores with the minister, who has always been an object of hatred for the nationalists and Communists and, following Gaydar's departure, will probably become the main target of their criticism. The "anti-Kozyrev lobby" in the lower chamber of parliament is very influential, uniting representatives of the most diverse political forces -- from the liberal democrats to Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the International Affairs Committee and until recently Russian ambassador in Washington, whose strained relations with his former boss are no secret to anyone. Two-thirds of Duma members may vote no confidence in Kozyrev, which, admittedly, does not commit either the minister himself, or President Yeltsin, to anything. In the recent past, the Russian leader ignored the majority of foreign policy resolutions adopted by the Congress and the Supreme Soviet. Is Yeltsin likely to start heeding the opinion of the Duma which, under the new Constitution, has considerably less power than Khasbulatov's parliament? Especially since, once they discard any liberal-democrat demagoguery, the deputies will hardly be able to clearly define the turnabout they expect from Russia's diplomacy. Since the middle of last year, the Foreign Ministry can hardly be blamed for any lack of pro-Serb sympathies: Russia was among the first to call for an easing of sanctions against Belgrade and, just like before, is against any strikes by NATO aviation against Bosnian Serb positions. Even if we were to agree with the highly dubious thesis that our foreign policy's priority must be to uphold Serb interests, it must be admitted that Kozyrev has not given all that many causes for criticism in the recent past. Provided, of course, that one does not take the positions of Zhirinovskiy who is calling for Russian divisions to be sent to the Balkans and is prepared to confront the entire world for the sake of the "Serbian brothers."
