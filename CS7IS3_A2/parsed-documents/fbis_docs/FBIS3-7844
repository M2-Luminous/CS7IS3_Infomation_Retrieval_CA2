It was a NATO action, he said, which was carried out in agreement with the United Nations resolution on a no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina, Akashi told Croatian television. Akashi said he had spoken to the commander of NATO's southern command who had assured him that the regular procedure had been respected. Akashi said he had also contacted Bosnian Serb Leader Radovan Karadzic, telling him that the incident should not be dramatised, and that efforts to establish peace should continue. NATO combat planes on Monday downed four planes near Banja Luka, a city in the northwest of the Bosnian Serb republic. Neither NATO nor the U.N. could determine to which of the warring sides in Bosnia the downed planes had belonged.
