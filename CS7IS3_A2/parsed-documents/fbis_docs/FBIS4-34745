The Canadian official, who ended her working tour of Havana this Tuesday, said during a news conference that she met with the Cuban statesman last night and talked about the island's current economic difficulties as well as Canada's domestic problems. It was "a very interesting, pleasant conversation with a man who has a warm personality, who is obviously interested in the world around him, who has a great love for his country, and who, in my opinion, only wants the best for his fatherland," the minister of state asserted. The objective of Stewart's visit was to increase relations and further Canadian investments. She is the highest ranking official from Ottawa to visit the Caribbean country in 18 years, since former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's trip to Havana in 1976. Regarding her meetings with Fidel Castro and other top local officials, Stewart emphasized that Canada has no intention of dictating solutions to Cuban problems and only wants an opportunity to exchange experiences with the hope that both parties can learn from each other. "We want to make sure that Cubans know they can count on our experiences." Stewart said Fidel Castro appreciated Ottawa's decision to officially renew economic aid to the island, and they both agreed that "this is only the beginning of new ways that Canada can help Cuba." Aid was suspended in 1978 because Cuba gave military assistance to Angola when it was attacked by South Africa. That decision, however, did not negatively affect the development of their ties, especially in the commercial and tourism sectors. Stewart announced a modest package of $360,000 in food for children and pregnant women this year and another $700,000 for 1995. She also promised that, upon her return, she would study ways to better assist the Caribbean island. On another topic, the Canadian minister of state emphasized Canada's growing interest in conducting business with Cuba, especially in establishing mixed enterprises that will yield mutual benefits. She also highlighted the willingness of authorities in Ottawa to encourage the investment of Canadian capital in Cuba.
