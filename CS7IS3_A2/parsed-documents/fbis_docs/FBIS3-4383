Song Jian, Chinese state councillor and minister in charge of the State Science and Technology Commission, met here today with Russel E.

The newly-established joint venture will concentrate on the development of software for computer-aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacture (CAM), and sell the products both in China and in the international market. Liu Jiyuan, general manager of China Aerospace Corporation, said that more than ten years ago China's aerospace industry began to introduce CAD and CAM software from the CV Corporation for researching and manufacturing various rockets and satellites, with fairly fruitful results. Now China Aerospace Corporation has made computer application as one of the three pillar industries producing civil products with aerospace science and technology, and the corporation will further expand foreign economic and technological cooperation and exchange in this field, Liu added. Sources said that the CV Corporation is a world-renowned software producer, with a history of 25 years. Last year it had a total sales income of 800 million U.S. dollars, some 18 percent of the world's machinery engineering software market.
