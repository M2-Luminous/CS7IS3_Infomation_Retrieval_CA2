Both there and in almost all the other settlements with a Bulgarian population Bulgarian janissaries are in power. Five hundred years of servitude have taught us that no oppressor is more terrible and vile than they. They are the mayors, municipal councillors, judges, and police chiefs who have long been in the service of an alien faith and an alien language. Otherwise, everything appears to be civilized and normal. When the Serbian authorities receive delegations from Bulgaria -- and there have been plenty of them of late -- they assure them that in the areas with a predominantly Bulgarian population in eastern Serbia our compatriots occupy leading places in the administration and in municipal life. Moreover, the Bulgarian language, even if it is not the chief language, is only so because the Bulgarians themselves want it so. Later our delegations meet these mayors, municipal councillors, judges, and police chiefs, from whom they hear the same thing, and then return to Bulgaria enchanted by this new Arcadia, where everything flows with milk and honey. They then start publishing one article after another in which they try to convince the other 8 million Bulgarians that those who defend the rights of the Bulgarians in the Western Outlands are a handful of dubious personages who want to provoke a quarrel between us and Serbia, which shows abundant love toward us. As this is going on, our compatriots can barely make ends meet, because not a single new workshop has been built for decades in their villages, forgotten by both Belgrade and Sofia. They try to come to terms with their children's new Serbian names, hoping that they at least will not have to suffer as they are, and even regard with distrust the enthusiasts from the DSBYu, because they have known for ages that every time a voice is raised in defense of the Bulgarians violated rights, only misfortunes and torment follow. How can they fail to think like this, when even in their motherland people were found to assure us that everything is fine in the Western Outlands? Who then is to tell our compatriots that the other minorities in former Yugoslavia have been fighting for their rights for a long time and will certainly win their rights and freedoms through their struggle? Who is to tell them that the time for bowing one's head is already long past? The totalitarianism here, like totalitarianism anywhere else, has created an impression of ostensible democracy. The Serbian Parliament has no deputies from a party that defends the Bulgarians' rights, nor will it ever have any. A fiendishly cunning electoral system has divided the Bulgarian settlements in such a way that in all the electoral constituencies a Serbian population predominates that will never support a Bulgarian candidate. However, Bulgarian deputies from the ruling parties have served in parliament and will certainly continue to do so. The trouble is that history has not recorded the name of a single Bulgarian deputy who has said at least two words in defense of his compatriots. Precisely the opposite is the case -- to this very day they are remembered only for having defended the rulers' policies more fervently and furiously than the rulers themselves. When the enthusiasts, who included some of the most eminent and respected names of Bulgarians in Yugoslavia, founded the DSBYu, the Belgrade mass media poured out rivers of defamation and abuse. The first legal political organization of Bulgarians that had appeared in the Western Outlands since their separation from Bulgaria in 1918 was stigmatized not by Serbs, but by Bulgarians. They even signed their denunciations and gave their addresses, so as to be sure receive their thirty pieces of silver. I know that every undemocratic government needs such traitors, and that every such government rewards them highly by quickly promoting them up the ladder of the administrative hierarchy. However, I also know that any self-respecting government cannot fail to hold them in contempt. Therefore, I think that if Belgrade listens to the calls of its Bosilegrad informers, if it bans the only organization of Bulgarians of the kind that all the other minorities in the multinational state possess, this will mean that Belgrade has lost its own sense of self-respect.
