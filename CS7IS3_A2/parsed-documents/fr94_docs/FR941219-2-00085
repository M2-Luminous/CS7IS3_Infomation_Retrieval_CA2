FR941219-2-00085 FR941219-2-00052 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Office of the Secretary Section 4(e) Conditions for the Kerr Hydroelectric Project, Montana AGENCY: Department of the Interior. ACTION: Extension of Public Comment Period. SUMMARY: On November 22, 1994 (59 FR 60158), the Department of the Interior published a notice of availability and a request for comment regarding its proposed Section 4(e) conditions for the Kerr Hydroelectric Project license. In an effort to allow more time for public participation the Department is extending the comment period for an additional 45 days. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 797(e), the proposed conditions provide for the adequate protection and utilization of the Flathead Indian Reservation and the Fish and Wildlife Service administered Flathead Waterfowl Production Area. DATES: The Department will consider all comments on the proposed section 4(e) conditions received on or before February 6, 1995 in the formulation of the Secretary's final section 4(e) conditions for the Kerr Hydroelectric Project. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Anne Crichton, Department of the Interior, Office of the Solicitor, 1849 C Street, NW., Mail Stop 6456, Washington, DC 20240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Janice Schneider, Department of the Interior, Office of the Solicitor, 1849 C Street, NE., Mail Stop 6456, Washington, DC 20240, 202&hyph;208&hyph;6967. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The November 22, 1994 (59 FR 60158) notice of availability and request for comment provided a 30 day period during which the Department would receive comments regarding its proposed Section 4(e) conditions for the Kerr Hydroelectric Project. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 797(e), the proposed conditions provide for the adequate protection and utilization of the Flathead Indian Reservation and the Fish and Wildlife Service administered Flathead Waterfowl Production Area. The proposed conditions for the Flathead Indian Reservation provide for the imposition of a base load operational scenario at the Kerr Project. This operational scenario precludes the use of Kerr Dam as a load regulating or peak power generation facility, and requires minimum flows, certain restrictions on flow fluctuations (ramping rates), and a two year ramping rate study. In addition, the proposed conditions provide for non-operational measures designed to protect and provide for adequate utilization of the Flathead Indian Reservation in conjunction with operational measures. The non-operational measures include the development of a Fish and Wildlife Implementation Strategy, development of an operational rule curve, habitat acquisition, habitat development, fishery supplementation and reintroduction, development of recreational resources, and the identification and protection of cultural resources on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The proposed conditions for the Flathead WPA provide for the imposition of erosion control on the north shore of Flathead Lake and the upper Flathead River, island restoration, and habitat acquisition and development. The costs of all measures will be borne by the project licensees. The deadline for comment on the proposed Section 4(e) conditions is extended for 45 days by this notice. The comment period, which began on November 22, 1994, therefore, consists of a total of 75 days. All comments are due to the Department on or before February 6, 1995. In addition, the Department will be making available two technical reports that further support the proposed Section 4(e) conditions, the ``Kerr Hydro-electric Project Report'' by Stetson Engineers, Inc., and ``An Evaluation of the Wildlife Components of the Kerr Dam Project Mitigation and Management Plan and Recommended Section 4(e) Articles'' by BioSystems Analysis, Inc. The proposed conditions and the above referenced reports are available for review and copying at the Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC in room 6443. Copies of the proposed Section 4(e) conditions and the above referenced reports will be made available to all interested parties upon request. Dated: December 12, 1994. Willie R. Taylor, Acting Director, Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31045 Filed 12&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;02&hyph;M
