This comment overlooked the public statement by President Carlos Menem that Argentina would join the TLC together with the entire Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. Let us go part by part. What does Uruguay think about this commercial agreement? [Abreu] Our first assessment is positive. The TLC represents an additional effort by the region's countries with the purpose of forming commercial blocs, following the world trend in this field. Therefore, the signing of an agreement that involves Latin American countries such as Mexico with Canada and the United States is a positive fact. [Banales] Does the TLC clash with Mercosur? [Abreu] They complement each other. These schemes begin to overlap each other to the extent that the regional integration blocs all lead to a greater liberation of trade. In other words, we are making the integration project and the commercial opening compatible, but for this the integration systems must be flexible. It is not a matter of imposing a model to substitute imports that will entail the isolation and autarchy of the member countries of those blocs. For example, we believe that the TLC, the Group of Three, the Andean Pact, Mercosur, and the bilateral agreements reached within Aladi [Latin American Integration Association] complement each other and head for a commercial opening in keeping with the objectives also sought by the Uruguay Round that ended last 15 December. [Banales] Let us talk about Di Tella's comment. Can Argentina -- in its capacity as a Mercosur member country -- unilaterally ask to join the TLC? Does that not affect the Asuncion Treaty? [Abreu] The Asuncion Treaty is the legal framework by which Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, or Paraguay must abide. This treaty clearly establishes the terms and condition for their relationship with third countries. The four countries have been jointly negotiating within the GATT, coordinating their stances. We have legal duties established in the treaty that compel us to design common commercial policies, and also the four countries have an agreement with the United States known as "Four Plus One" proposed by President (George) Bush that, to some degree, has materialized following the congressional approval of the four Mercosur member countries. It is a negotiation and consultation forum that does not have the power of a commercial agreement but allows for an institutional and political rapprochement that, in our viewpoint, is the appropriate mechanism for this relationship. [Banales] Right. But what happens if one of the four countries that signed the Asuncion Treaty decides to split away and unilaterally ask to join another treaty, such as the TLC? [Abreu] If Argentina, or any of the other three countries, wants to leave Mercosur to join the TLC, it must apply the appropriate mechanism established in the treaty. In this case, the commercial concessions granted remain in force for another two years. But if it wants to join the TLC, it also must follow the same procedures Mexico is following. That is, it must negotiate the concessions granted to third countries by virtue of the agreements reached through the Montevideo Treaty signed within the framework of Aladi. And this goes for Argentina as well as for the remaining three other countries. It is not just a matter of expressing a desire; there are obstacles that must be overcome. The TLC is an integration mechanism that is just starting; it establishes a free trade zone and is far from the achievements already made by the four Mercosur member countries. [Banales] In what sense? [Abreu] Look, we already have reduced 82 percent of our tariffs and as of next year -- with some exceptions for Paraguay and Uruguay -- we will enjoy free trade, which is the TLC's objective. This is why I maintain that Mercosur is not a mere political expression or desire. We all want to join the TLC not because it is a matter of standing in line to join another treaty, preference zone, or free trade zone, but rather to seek the mechanisms to join or become compatible with the different integration schemes. [Banales] Is Mercosur one of Uruguay's priority issues? [Abreu] For us Mercosur is a top priority for the four member countries. This was politically ratified by the four countries, and currently we are defining the Common Foreign Tariff, a field in which we have made great technical and political progress. Therefore, going back to your question, we believe that any desire to join the TLC is naturally subject to the legal and political situation. We support any initiative within this framework because we believe that joining the TLC merely complements the integration systems. Argentina, as well as Brazil, have ratified their decision to remain within Mercosur and then negotiate with the rest of the regional projects. [Banales] Has Mercosur already yielded any concrete results for Uruguay? [Abreu] Well, if you analyze it, yes. Uruguay's intra-zone trade during the past few years has gone from $3 billion to $8 billion. This difference may be conditioned, among other things, by monetary or exchange policies that sometime distort trade in -- should we say -- a non-genuine manner. But we also must admit that our intra-zone trade has increased substantially. To Uruguay, its Mercosur partners represent a record percentage of its trade history. Currently our Mercosur partners account for 45 percent of our foreign trade, and we notice that the treaty has an important impact in the commercial field. Uruguay's concentric circles policy favors our commercial partners such as Argentina and Brazil, in addition to complementing this subregional strategy with a more global commercial opening. The Mercosur path is undoubtedly full of obstacles and difficulties but Uruguay continues to unwaveringly support the treaty's ratification.
