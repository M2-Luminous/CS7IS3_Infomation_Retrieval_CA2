FBIS4-1373 "drafr082_d_94015" FBIS-AFR-94-082 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Namibia DTA: Angolan Troops in Country To Attacks UNITA DTA: Angolan Troops in Country To Attacks UNITA MB2604205294 Windhoek THE NAMIBIAN in English 21 Apr 94 p 4 MB2604205294 Windhoek THE NAMIBIAN English BFN [Text] The DTA [Democratic Turnhalle Alliance] has alleged that the Angolan government has been sending military troops to Namibia charging there were about 2,000 MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] government soldiers in areas along the northern border with Angola. DTA president, Mr Mishake Muyongo, said his party had been informed that the soldiers were in Namibia to launch attacks on UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] positions across the Kavango and the western Caprivi areas. "If this information is correct, as we believe it is, one would like to know from the Namibian Government whether Namibia is now participating in the Angolan war by backing the MPLA government and giving them sanctuary in order to attack UNITA on Namibian soil," he said. "Is the Namibian government overlooking the fact that Angolan war can spill over to Namibia, thereby forcing the people of Namibia to become victims of the Angolan conflict, which is not of their own making?" Mr Muyongo said it was ironic that while Namibians stood on their "toes", fearing that the South African situation could spill over here, the Government was prepared to "close" one eye to the activities of the MPLA government on Namibian soil. Such a situation, he said, could promote a war spill-over from Angola. "Is the Namibian government overlooking the fact that the Angolan war can spill over to Namibia, thereby forcing people of Namibia to become victims of the Angolan conflict?" asked Mr Muyongo. "Or, is it the price that SWAPO [South-West African People's Organization] has to pay to the MPLA for the long years that the MPLA helped them while operating from Angola?" The shadow president said his party did not want Namibians to be victims of the Angolan war. "The Government of Namibia will be well advised not to get involved in this protracted war in Angola under any circumstances, but rather try and find a peaceful solution that will reduce the human suffering that is now prevalent in Angola," said Mr Muyongo. He said his party had also received information alleging that the consulate of the MPLA government in Rundu and the Military Attache of the Angolan Embassy in Windhoek were involved in bringing soldiers to Namibia. "If this is also true, then we ask the Namibian Government to urgently take action against these Angolan officials who are implicated in bringing these armed MPLA soldiers to Namibia, before the situation gets out of hand," said Mr Muyongo.
