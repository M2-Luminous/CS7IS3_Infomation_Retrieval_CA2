In an interview for the left-leaning Czech daily, Weiss is referring to former Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar who, along with the rest of his government, had to quit after the parliament voted no confidence on him last Friday. Asked what led the SDL, then the strongest opposition party, to push for the removal of Meciar, Weiss stresses that it was not due to any personal controversy between Meciar and himself. "What happened in the parliament on Friday [11 March] was purely a rejection of his manner of rule, his way of exerting power based on the creation of the idea of an enemy, on the feeling of the exclusivity of a single movement (the Meciar-led Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS), and on his unwillingness to cooperate with other political subjects soberly, seriously and on principles of partnership. These are the methods perfectly mastered by Meciar, who used them to create conditions for strengthening HZDS's power in the state administration and economy. In implementing these methods, Meciar also considerably damaged Slovakia's good image abroad," Weiss emphasizes. He says the main priority of the SDL is early elections. He dismisses speculation that through removing Meciar, the opposition ensured more votes for him in the planned elections. The present situation in Slovakia differs from that of three years ago, when Meciar was dismissed as premier and then gained 38 per cent in the June 1992 elections, Weiss states. "People now have certain experience from the two-year HZDS rule, including great dissatisfaction over its economic policy," he explains. Weiss confirms that the SDL is for maintenance of a "reasonable continuity" between the outgoing and new cabinets, mainly in key spheres such as the ministries of defense, interior, foreign affairs, justice, economy and finance. "The continuity can also be preserved by -- let us say -- by appointing present state secretaries, who well know the situation in the sphere controlled by relevant ministries, as ministers...so that they do not have to start from scratch in acquainting themselves with the work of the ministry," Weiss says. He notes that Roman Kovac, the former deputy premier expelled from the HZDS in February as the co-founder of the HZDS faction the Alternative of Political Realism, was considered by the opposition as the future Slovak premier a month ago "under certain circumstances. However, these circumstances have changed. It is necessary to continue negotiations," Weiss states. He says that the SDL is ready to present its own candidate for the presidential post "if developments necessitate it". Weiss also comments on Meciar's efforts to re-gain a majority in the 150-seat parliament. He points out that the referendum on early elections and the removal from the parliament of the deputies who quit their parties, "lacks logic: if the referendum sets June as the date of early elections (as requested by Meciar) and also agrees with stripping the defectors of their deputy mandates, the early elections will take place and there will be no need to expel anybody from the parliament. However, [Meciar's] political game would probably aim at persuading citizens that it is only necessary to oust the disobedient deputies from the parliament, without calling early elections," Weiss says. He adds that if Meciar succeeds, he will re-gain a majority in the parliament and "probably also solve the conflict between himself and President (Michal Kovac)". Moreover, the SDL finds the retroactive effect of the Meciar- considered provision that the deputies who quit their parties have to leave the parliament incompatible with the law. The economic experts of the opposition agreed that immediately after its inauguration, the new government would push for the amendment of the law on the state budget for 1994. Another goal of the opposition is "depolitisation of the privatization process and its oversight. However, not by a single movement as it has been practiced so far," Weiss says in RUDE PRAVO.
