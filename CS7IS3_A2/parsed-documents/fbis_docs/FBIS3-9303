[Begin Klaus recording] I am not at all willing to comment on this rally because the government has not contributed one iota to this rally. This is simply a 100-percent, or 101-percent, matter of the trade unions. This has nothing to do whatsoever with the government. The talks between the government and the trade unions have been conducted in an absolutely correct way, I think. A number of comments trade unions had regarding the amendment of the Labor Code have been accepted. Thus, any consideration that the government failed to consult these matters with the trade unions is an absolute lie and a fallacy. It does not necessarily follow that the government should accept all of the trade unions' comments in their entirety, as some trade union leaders might wish. In my view, there is nothing in this matter that the government would have to feel responsible for. I am getting reports from all over the Republic speaking about false pressure campaigns when trade unionists invite people to take a free trip to Prague, where, as part of this trip, they would briefly attend some kind of rally. Telephone calls, faxes, and letters coming from people all over the Republic clearly reveal these actions on the part of the trade unions. Personally, I would be ashamed to be a trade union leader.
