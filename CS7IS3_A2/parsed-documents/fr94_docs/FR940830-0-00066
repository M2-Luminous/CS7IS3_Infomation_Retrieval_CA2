FR940830-0-00066 FR940830-0-00013 Response: HUD disagrees that it will take up to 15 months for HAs to have an executed ACC amendment and receive funds. HUD has streamlined the ACC amendment process. As noted in Notice PIH 94&hyph;13 (entitled Expediting Obligation/Expenditure of Modernization Funds in the Pipeline, issued April 6, 1994), the ACC amendment is prepared by Field Office program staff, reviewed by the HUD Field Counsel and forwarded to the HA for signature. Unless required by State or local law or the HA by-laws, the Executive Director is permitted to sign and return the ACC amendment without a Board Resolution. HAs are encouraged to consider amending their by-laws (where permitted under law) so that a Board Resolution is not required or, if a Board Meeting is not imminent, the HA may consider conducting a telephone Board Meeting to authorize the signing of the ACC amendment. After ACC amendment, the Field Office should spread the budget line items in the Line of Credit Control System/Voice Response System (LOCCS/VRS) as quickly as possible. As to the need to speed up the provision of funds to HAs, HUD has made significant progress in this regard, and in fact, advised HAs of their funding amount in February of this year. It is anticipated that additional progress will be made and access to funds will occur even earlier in the FFY since HUD will provide only one formula amount and the Formula Characteristics Report for the next FFY will be sent out for review and validation prior to the end of the current FFY. HUD must again emphasize that there is no mandatory two-year obligation period, three-year expenditure period, or 5-year statutory limit for spending funds approved in a particular FFY. Generally, HUD expects that funds allocated in a FFY will be obligated within two years and expended within three years of approval unless a longer implementation schedule is approved by HUD. The HA has responsibility for establishing its implementation schedule, as part of its Annual Statement. In instances where it is unreasonable for a HA to meet the two year-three year expectation for obligation and expenditure of funds, e.g ., size of grant, complexity of the work, the HA may propose a schedule of longer duration. Also, as previously noted, the HA may self-execute a time extension of the approved implementation schedule for reasons outside of its control. HUD plans to speed up release of modernization funds to the extent possible. However, HUD disagrees that this affects the modernization pipeline and suggests that addressing the pipeline is a reprogramming issue. For additional guidance on the issue of reprogramming, see Notice PIH 94&hyph;13. Comment: Another area commented on as causing delay in the obligation of formula funding is the LOCCS/VRS automated draw-down mechanism. Problems include systemic problems such as having to draw equal monthly amounts as well as persistent problems with errors by Field Office staff in placing edits on accounts and not removing them in a timely fashion. Reports were received indicating that some Field Office staff do not agree with the expedited policies and deliberately delay the process. Response: This system is new and monitoring its use is essential. To the extent that adjustments are needed in its administration, they will be made. Other LOCCS/VRS issues are discussed below under the heading ``Miscellaneous Issues.'' Comment: It was recommended that the obligation requirements should be made consistent with the annual submission section which allows a HA to self-execute an extension when delays are out of its control. HUD was cautioned that while on the surface accelerating the program's implementation schedule for obligating and expending funds would suggest a quicker utilization of these dollars, such an acceleration without a transition period or a recognition of the needs of larger HAs would likely result in either schedules not being met or those dollars being poorly utilized. They noted that HAs are still shifting their modernization operations from one based on the CIAP to one based on CGP. HUD was urged to review and alter other regulatory standards or work practices as the mechanism for accelerating the usage of Federal modernization dollars. Response: HUD again notes that the obligation time-frame is a general rule. If a HA can demonstrate that a longer obligation timeframe is warranted, HUD may initially approve a time period longer than two years, and subsequently, a HA may extend the approved implementation schedule if there are reasons outside of its control, as long as the extension is made in a timely manner. Comment: One HA noted that HUD's proposal was reasonable except for FFY 92 and FFY 93. In those years their plans included making 504 accessibility improvements, assessment and removal of lead-based paint, and capital improvements required as the result of deferred maintenance and inadequate previous years funding under their operating budget and CIAP. It was recommended that the changes under proposed rule for obligating funds not be retroactive to FFYs 92&hyph;94.
