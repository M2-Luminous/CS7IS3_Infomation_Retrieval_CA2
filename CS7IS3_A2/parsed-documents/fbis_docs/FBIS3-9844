Major General Pavel Strubl, Air Force and Air Defense inspector, said that success had been attained in fulfilling the basic objectives. A three-tier system of command has been set up in the Air Force and Air Defense Forces. Thus, there is the Air Force and Air Defense headquarters, which is a body of the chief of General Staff. There is also the 3d Tactical Air Force Corps and the 4th Air Defense Corps, which are the operational levels [operacni stupne], and, last, there are the Air Force and Air Defense units, which are tactical factors [takticke prvky]. This year will be the most complex period for these two bodies. Just for illustration: The numbers of aviation equipment in use will be radically reduced. Seventy-seven combat aircraft, 11 combat helicopters, 20 training aircraft, and other equipment will be discarded. Compared to the present, this amounts on the whole to a 30.6-percent reduction. There will also be similar changes in the Air Defense Forces. Newsmen learned from the information service that 11 inspections verifying the organizational structure and 81 inspections checking the elimination of superfluous equipment took place on our territory from 1 January 1993 until 1 March [no year as heard]. What is pleasing is that the inspections confirmed the responsible attitude of the Czech Republic to the fulfillment of (?an agreement) in all spheres.
