Federal Prime Minister Kontic received the Hungarian foreign minister at the Palace of the Federation today. The meeting was also attended by Federal Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic. Views were exchanged on bilateral relations between the FRY and Hungary, stability in the Balkans, and the consequences of the unjustly imposed sanctions. The two sides expressed mutual interest in the development of good-neighborly relations and the desire to resolve all disputes through dialogue. "Yugoslavia is firmly determined to settle all disputed issues in a peaceful way", the Yugoslav prime minister pointed out. The prime minister also stressed that relations with neighbors were a priority in Yugoslavia's foreign policy, emphasizing that national minorities should be bridges of cooperation, not causes for confrontation. Consequently, all national minorities in the FRY -- including members of the Hungarian minority -- are enjoying and will continue to enjoy all rights in conformity with the highest international standards, Kontic stressed. He informed Minister Jeszenszky about the effects of the unjustly imposed sanctions and said there were no longer any reasons for maintaining them. Hungarian Foreign Minister Jeszenszky conveyed his government's interest in maintaining good-neighborly relations with the FRY and expressed his conviction that they will be even more beneficial in the future. Jeszenszky believes that peace in former Bosnia-Herzegovina was now closer at hand than ever before and assessed that the FRY was making a significant contribution to this effect. The two sides also discussed economic cooperation, especially after the sanctions. Prime Minister Kontic extended an invitation to the Hungarian prime minister to visit Yugoslavia.
