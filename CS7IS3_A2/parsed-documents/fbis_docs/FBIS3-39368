Chirac was attempting to quell his party's criticism of Balladur on the occasion of the announcement of the prime minister's economic stimulation plan. Nevertheless, the article contends that, given the presidential election timetable, the truce between the two officials is "fragile." The following issues may yet rekindle the "polemics" between the Chirac and Balladur partisans. Opinions are divided on Bosnia. While Pierre Lellouche, Chirac's diplomatic adviser, thinks French troops should be withdrawn from the area, others in the RPR advocate armed intervention. Balladur's entourage is much more "prudent," for the prime minister knows that President Francois Mitterrand is reluctant to discuss a withdrawal publicly. On Africa, Chirac opposed the devaluation of the CFA franc which, he believes, stands in major contradiction with one of the pillars of Gaullist policy and will provoke serious domestic troubles in the countries involved. Balladur was careful not to oppose Mitterrand's decision to stop nuclear testing to avoid a confrontation with the president. However, neo-Gaullists consider nuclear tests a symbol of de Gaulle's strategy of deterrence. When Chirac maintained in the past that Balladur's government was called upon only to manage cohabitation because important reforms could only be enacted after the presidential elections, Balladur contradicted him, saying that his government was elected to provide a "new breath" for the country. The RPR now criticizes Balladur's stimulation plan as "insufficient," while the prime minister himself attempts to "put the brakes" on any significant reforms to preserve his popularity. According to the article, Chirac's "critical" support is designed to show that Balladur "is decidedly unable to fill the presidential function to which he aspires without saying so." The European Parliament elections are a final bone of contention. The prime minister flip-flopped in first agreeing to head the list of the majority and then refusing to do so, for fear that the elections would turn into a test for the government. Similarly, Chirac first agreed to his own candidacy and then rejected it when the RPR's partner, the Union for French Democracy (UDF), refused to support it. In the end, Balladur gave up, affirming that the issue depends on negotiations between parties. However, the prime minister is aware that the cohesion of his majority, and, hence, the presidential race, are at stake.
