The independent watch-dog group said the eighth paragraph in the fourth appendix calls for free passage to markets. Israel has limited the entrance of agricultural products from the autonomous area until proper compensation is arranged for Israeli producers and until quality control for agricultural products and livestock are ensured. A joint Israeli-Palestinian committee has been set up to deal with the matter.
