FR941004-0-00002 FR941004-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;221&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9039; AD 94&hyph;20&hyph;10] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 Series Airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (Military) Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes, that requires inspections to detect fatigue-related cracking in certain areas of the horizontal stabilizer; and repair of cracked parts. It also requires installation of terminating modifications, which, when accomplished, would eliminate the repetitive inspections. This amendment is prompted by reports of fatigue-related cracks found on the horizontal stabilizer. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of the load carrying and fail safe capability of the horizontal stabilizer, damage to the adjacent structure, and subsequent reduced structural integrity of the airplane, due to the problems associated with fatigue cracking. DATES: Effective October 31, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of November 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, P.O. Box 1771, Long Beach, California 90801&hyph;1771, Attention: Business Unit Manager, Technical Administrative Support, Dept. L51, M.C. 2&hyph;98. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Wahib Mina, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANM&hyph;121L, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Los Angeles ACO, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California 90806&hyph;2425; telephone (310) 988&hyph;5324; fax (310) 988&hyph;5210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes was published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14800). That action proposed to require inspections to detect fatigue-related cracking in certain areas of the horizontal stabilizer; and repair of cracked parts. It also proposed to require the installation of certain terminating modifications that would eliminate the need for the repetitive inspections. Immediate Adoption of This Regulation Since issuance of the NPRM, one operator has reported finding a crack in the area of the forward spar upper cap on the horizontal stabilizer on a Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10 series airplane that had accumulated approximately 16,000 landings. This evidence indicates that fatigue cracking may begin in this area much earlier than what was previously considered. In light of this, the FAA has reconsidered the compliance time proposed for the initiation of inspections to detect cracking in this subject area on these airplanes. The FAA now has determined that the initiation of inspections of Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10 and &hyph;15 series airplanes must begin prior to the accumulation of 12,000 total landings or 90 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later. (The compliance time for this action that was proposed in the notice was 18,000 total landings.) The lowered threshold of 12,000 total landings is necessary to ensure that cracking is detected and corrected in a timely manner, and to prevent the loss of load-carrying and fail safe capability of the horizontal stabilizer due to the problems associated with fatigue cracking. The compliance time for the inspections specified in paragraph (a) of this final rule has been revised accordingly. In making this revision, the FAA finds that, with respect to the reduced compliance threshold, a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation. Therefore, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. Comments Invited Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ADDRESSES. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.
