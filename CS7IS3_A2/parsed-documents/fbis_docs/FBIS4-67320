DN [DIARIO DE NOTICIAS] was told this by George Stievenard, indicated as the future director of the European Observatory for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which held its first meeting in Lisbon today. The major task is to lend consistency to political decisions. In charge of the Drug Department of the Commission of European Communities' Secretariat General, he is viewed by the experts as the likely future director of the observatory. The commission has had a coordinating function since 1990, but it was not until after the Treaty of Maastricht went into effect that the dynamics for the creation of the European Observatory for Drugs, with headquarters in Lisbon, began to take shape. The Twelve want a coordinated action, based on the work of the observatory, which is due to begin operating this year. DN: What are the functions of the commission that you head? Stievenard: This commission analyzes the drug problem, and is associated with a dozen general directorates working on the issue. It also plans the commission's decisions and its participation in the European agencies. With coordinating functions since 1990, it resulted from the creation of the European Committee To Combat Drugs, a high-level political committee including the 12 national coordinators of the battle against drugs, and the commission's coordinator, who is a commissioner. DN: What is the principal objective? Stievenard: We want to determine the commission's orientation and the coordinated positions of the Twelve in the battle against drugs. We also want to pay attention to what is being done sectorially, on the public health level, and in the realm of foreign relations, specifically, involving cooperation with Third World countries, the central, Asian, and Latin American blocs, and the Mediterranean nations. It is important that a coordinated action be selected among the 12 countries, in the area of justice, according to the Treaty of Maastricht. DN: Do you think that it will be easy to find a global policy among the Twelve? Stievenard: That is the most important aspect. In the context of the political effort that we have made since 1990, the priority is to find a global strategy, in keeping with the two European plans for fighting drugs, adopted two years ago by the Council of Europe sessions held in Rome and Edinburgh. They are largely intergovernmental plans because, before the Treaty of Maastricht went into effect, there was no Community jurisdiction over the matter. It is a system for coordinating the national policies of the Twelve, dealing as consistently as possible with the issues of public health, foreign and international relations, and justice. DN: Some Community countries have small drug observatories. Will you seek in them the "know-how" for establishing this European observatory? Stievenard: The existing observatories have not advanced beyond an embryonic stage; but the experience is important. What was decided by the commission, quite concretely, was to explore the possibility of creating a European observatory for drugs and drug addiction. It all started there. Since 1990 we have traveled to various member countries, questioning them. We came face to face with the participants working in the drug field, asking them how they would view this observatory. On that basis, we made a technical study of the future observatory. Oddly enough, to our great satisfaction, we perceived that the position of the Twelve was no different. This enabled us to move to the next phase: the creation of an agency under Community law, and the regulations for creating the observatory, adopted in February 1993. In October, we decided that the headquarters would be in Lisbon; and we are now in contact with the Portuguese authorities to put this observatory into operation. DN: Will the European Observatory begin working this year? Stievenard: It should start operating in September, after the director is installed with an initial staff. At the first meeting, (to be held today) at the Belem Cultural Center, it will be decided who the members of the board of administration will be. The council will have one representative for each member state, chosen by each country (Portugal will be represented by Father Feytor Pinto), with two representatives from the commission in Brussels and two designated by the European Parliament. The next phase, with the holding of the first board of administration meeting, should consist of the naming of its chairman. The second stage will involve the designation of the director, but this will probably not occur until the second observatory meeting, due to take place in June. DN: The observatory already has regulations. Would you care to summarize them? Stievenard: They contain major objectives, with a twofold ambition. Relying on the national centers gathering information on drugs in each country, we shall obtain an overall view of the drug problem. In order to make political decisions, we must have reliable information on what is happening in each country, and in the Twelve as a whole. What is the status of drug addiction; how many drug addicts are there? We don't know that today. Every country has its own information system, but the systems are not compatible; the definitions applied are not the same. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a perspective on the Twelve. The observatory will have that role, but its particular aim will be to harmonize the criteria and definitions increasingly, so that the situations in the various countries can be compared. DN: The policy of the Community nations on repression, prevention, and treatment of drug addicts is like a patchwork quilt. Each one has gone its own way.... Stievenard: The different policies among the Twelve give us, besides the difficulty stemming from the divergence, the opportunity to view the multiplicity of experiences. This will be one of the basic functions of the observatory: in other words, to learn about these experiences, to compare them, and to take examples for a global strategy. It will help to determine the political objectives. DN: Will prevention be in the forefront of the activities? Stievenard: Prevention will be a priority of the plan, as well as the aspects of repression and international relations. The commission is preparing a draft plan of global action on drugs for the European Union, covering the next five years. The drug problem cannot be treated in a sectorialized or independent manner. DN: But there is an area of human rights between repression and treatment. Stievenard: It is a strategic and extremely difficult area. Dialogue must be facilitated between police authorities and health technicians. DN: How will the information be shared? Stievenard: The observatory has been created for this purpose: to organize the information and make it accessible to everyone, to all the technicians, whether they be in the justice or public health field. That dialogue is necessary. But we realize that this will be difficult to establish spontaneously between the ministries of health and internal administration in the respective countries. Dialogue is easier on the level of the Twelve. When there are difficult relations between ministries in the same country, it is better to facilitate dialogue among ministries of different countries. The Union can achieve this: by using the value of diplomacy in the service of a global strategy for the battle against drugs. DN: Are you confident about the observatory's future? Stievenard: Without any doubt; I don't see why it would not work. Its function is not to substitute for politics, but rather to treat the information in a technically sound manner, so that it will be useful for the political decisions. The politicians are working in this area without a network, without a real knowledge of the subject that is essential for making decisions, with an understanding of the cause. DN: Do you favor harmonization of the member states' laws? Stievenard: That is a long way ahead. We started with a situation, before the Treaty of Maastricht went into effect, wherein we had 12 countries with their own policies. We changed when the treaty took effect, allowing the member states to choose the policy, but obliging them to cooperate within the framework of the Union. What will happen within the next few years (and we want this project to be in effect for the next five years) is rapprochement and dialogue among the member states. They retain the opportunity for doing what they want on the national level, but they are obligated to cooperate; and the observatory will furnish technical resources for reinforcing the cooperation. They will make their selection by comparing experiences. It is necessary to "create" that path. I am confident. I believe in opening up dialogue among the states. It will make them eliminate the negative consequences of their individual choice, and they will be forced to include the dimensions of the others. It is progress. The future will tell whether it is necessary to go further.
