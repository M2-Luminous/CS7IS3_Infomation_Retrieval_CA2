The Kurdish leader earlier met Defense Minister Francois Leotard and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. This is not the first time Jalal al-Talabani has been received in Paris. If he was worried by the recent contacts between Paris and Baghdad, he must now feel reassured. More details now with Olivier Dalage: [Dalage] Jalal al-Talabani must be satisfied with his trip to France. The co-chairman of the self-governing Iraqi Kurdistan government -- a government self-proclaimed against the Baghdad government following the Gulf war -- was received by the most important French leaders. Alain Juppe expressed his support for respect of Kurdish rights, including respect of their political rights, in the framework of Iraq's territorial integrity. For his part, the Kurdish leader repeated his plan for a federation incorporating broad autonomy of Iraqi Kurdistan in the framework of the Iraqi state. The French foreign minister and his colleague Defense Minister Francois Leotard both gave assurances that France would continue its participation in Operation Provide Comfort to protect Iraqi Kurds north of the 62d parallel. If Jalal al-Talabani was somewhat apprehensive when he arrived following recent contacts between Paris and Baghdad, he was told by Juppe not take any notice of rumors because France will continue its embargo as long as Iraq will not observe all the UN Security Council resolutions.
