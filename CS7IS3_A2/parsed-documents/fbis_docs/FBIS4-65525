Scalfaro made no direct reference to the rally -- which spurred Interior Minister Roberto Maroni to ban repetitions and suspend the local police chief and prefect (top government representative) -- in a speech at Italy's oldest charity organisation, the Misericordia of Florence. But he did say, addressing the present members of the 750-year-old voluntary work organisation, that "you are a response to all this". Referring to present-day extremists' balaclavas and to the early members of the Misericordia's practice of wearing cowls to be able to do their good works anonymously, Scalfaro said "there has been a leap, over 750 years, from covering one's face so that no one might know who is doing good, to covering one's face in order to be able to do ill". In later remarks, Scalfaro referred to racist manifestations as "an expression of that terrible evil which is to think of oneself only, from which stem also wars, violence and the search for spasmodic wealth". The response to "all this evil", he said, is to solve "the fundamental crisis of today's world, a crisis of love". At the end of the ceremony at the Misericordia, Scalfaro walked to the Florence Prefecture for a luncheon with Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, with whom he will inaugurate the show Royal Treasures of Denmark at Palazzo Pitti this afternoon.
