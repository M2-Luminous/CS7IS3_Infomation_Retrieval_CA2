Although some progress was made, such as making procurement procedures transparent, Japanese and U.S. officials remained at odds as they failed to fill the gap between their basic views concerning the issue of objective criteria. The procurement of medical equipment is one of the priority sectors in the bilateral trade talks. Dispute over this sector must be settled before the 11 February Japan-U.S. summit meeting. Therefore, negotiators plan to resume talks as early as after mid-January. Concerning objective criteria, the United States demanded setting criteria to evaluate Japanese efforts "toward increasing imports to the level of other major industrialized nations." Japan, however, objected that "this idea would result in setting numerical targets." Thus, the two nations remained at odds, both refusing to compromise. Working-level meetings regarding the government procurement sector in the bilateral trade talks have been held continuously since 4 January. A high-ranking U.S. trade official expressed strong dissatisfaction, saying: "Although an agreement was made during the summit meeting last July to set up numerical targets, Japan is now objecting to it. No progress has been made in the discussions because of Japan's attitude."
