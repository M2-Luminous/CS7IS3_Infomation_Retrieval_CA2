The system, designed by the Internal Trade Ministry, aims to ensure supplies of vital consumer goods cover people's basic needs. The programme has been tested in Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin and in Liaoning, Hubei and Guangdong provinces since the start of the year . "Shanghai has done a very good job in setting up a municipal-level reserve system for important commodities including grain, edible oil, pork and sugar," said a ministry official. "And the reserve system is already helping to stabilize Shanghai's food market," he said, adding that the city's stocks of pork and sugar could meet the daily needs of its more than 13 million citizens for about two months. The system would also allow local governments to feed people and keep prices stable in the event of natural disasters or other "unexpected accidents," said the official. The central government has authorized provincial, regional and municipal governments to decide on the type and quantity of vital goods in local reserves, in line with the conditions they face and changes in market demand. Reserves are being built up by the various local governments and their commercial departments in line with policies laid down by the Internal Trade Ministry. The scheme is also seen as another arm of the government's economic controls, said the official. Meanwhile, the central government is moving to build up its own supplies of such essential goods as grain, cotton, edible oil and steel to ensure a steady market supply, the official said. He also revealed that the government is pressing ahead to establish a commodity market funding system across the country to develop production centres for consumer goods. The government has set crop targets of 450 million tons of grain, 4.85 million tons of cotton and 17 million tons of oil crops for this year. The total value of agricultural production is scheduled to grow by 4 per cent and its sales value and profits are to go up by 25 percent and 19 percent respectively.
