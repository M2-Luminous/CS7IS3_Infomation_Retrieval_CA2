The province's gross domestic product [GDP] totaled 68.6 billion yuan, an increase of 15.8 percent over the previous year if calculated by comparable prices. As far as this is concerned, primary industry increased by 4.5 percent, secondary industry increased by 31.2 percent, and tertiary industry increased by 12.5 percent. The province's per- capita GDP is expected to reach 1,742 yuan, a net increase of 307 yuan over the previous year. This growth was the highest annual growth since the introduction of reform and opening up. The province's comprehensive economic strength has obviously increased. The province's economic development trend over the past year bears the following characteristics: 1. The rural economy has been flourishing, and the basis of agriculture has been further intensified. Agricultural production increased comprehensively, and the optimization process of the agricultural structure continues. The total grain output overdid the target set in the beginning of the year despite a decrease in growing area and serious natural disasters. The output of industrial crops increased by a wide margin, with the outputs of cotton, oil-bearing crops, silkworm cocoons, tea, and flue-cured tobacco all hitting all time highs. Non-agricultural production sectors developed rapidly in rural areas, with township and town enterprises enjoying a 92.2 percent growth in their gross output value and emerging as the greatest growing sector of the economy in the province. 2. Industrial production grew rapidly, and both industrial production and its economic efficiency improved remarkably. The industrial growth pattern has gradually changed from the investment- pulled mode into the investment- and consumption-pulled mode. Light and heavy industries were tending to develop side by side in a more harmonious manner, collective-run and foreign-funded industrial enterprises kept booming, while large and medium-sized industrial enterprises played the role as an economic mainstay, and state-owned industrial enterprises enjoyed steady growth. 3. The province's performance has been prominent in project construction, with the construction of infrastructure further intensified. While a moderate investment scale was maintained, the investment structure has been further optimized. The remarkable increase in investment was mostly translated into an tremendous increase in investment in infrastructure. Smooth progress was made in key construction projects. Both the 10 key infrastructure projects and 18 key equipment updating and technological transformation projects which were to be completed by the end of the year as planned in the beginning of the year were all completed as scheduled. 4. The income of urban and rural residents continued to increase. The peasants' per-capita net annual income is expected to reach 870 yuan or more, an increase of 13.3 percent over the previous year. With the inflation factor taken into account, the actual increase will be 4.6 percent, the widest annual increase margin since the introduction of reform and opening up in the province. The staff and workers' average wage income was 2,500 yuan, an increase of 16.1 percent. The urban residents' per-capita income to be spent as living expenditure increased by 26.8 percent, or about 10 percent if with the inflation factor taken into account, the highest growth per year since reform and opening up. 5. The market was brisk and prosperous. The province's total volume of retail sales increased by 21.2 percent over the previous year, or actually about 10 percent if with the inflation factor is taken into account. The growth trend of the retail market showed a pattern of increasingly sharp increase, with the whole year's increase margin recorded at 3.4 percentage point above that for the first half of the year. The margin of price increase on the capital goods market was being narrowed, while the shortage in supply was being eased, and the end of the year saw ample supply. 6. The banking situation was stable, with the increase in the balance of deposits always higher than the increase in the balance of loans, and the financial revenue increasing pretty rapidly. The province's financial revenue totaled 6.56 billion yuan, an increase of 1.54 billion yuan or 30.8 percent over the previous year, the highest annual growth ever achieved by the province. The province's financial revenue overdid its financial expenditure in the year. 7. The reform was being intensified and the extent of opening up to the outside world was constantly being increased in the year. The foreign investment funds utilized in the year increased by 72 percent over the previous year. The above information shows that in 1993 the province's economy developed in a wholesome manner and along a good trend. The province did come across some difficulties and problems in the process of economic development. First, flood and waterlogging caused great losses; second, the margin of price increase was too wide for a while; third, bottlenecks that restrain economic growth have not been eased; and fourth, some enterprises are still facing great difficulties in business operation.
