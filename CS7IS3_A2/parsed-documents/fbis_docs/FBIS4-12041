The delegation represented various popular organizations and the families of the martyrs and wounded of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. It came to express thanks, appreciation, and gratitude for His Majesty King Husayn's noble and honorable pan-Arab and human stands on the kinsfolk in the occupied homeland and for his majesty's eagerness to stand on their side in all cases and under all circumstances. Speaking at this meeting, His Majesty King Husayn said: [Begin recording] Brothers, I am thankful to have this opportunity to meet with you today. This home is your home and this place is your place. No matter how I try, I cannot find the words to express my feelings toward the criminal massacre and toward the suffering of the kinsfolk and brothers in Hebron and everywhere in the occupied territories. You need not thank me. We and you are one. We support you to the best of our ability. With the help of God, we will continue to be as such as long as we are alive, and until rights are restored to their rightful owners--our kinsfolk, beloved ones, and brothers--in the Palestinian territories. Please convey to the kinsfolk all love and appreciation. I take pride in our kinsfolk and appreciate their patience and endurance in the face of ordeals, challenges, and sacrifices. Their sacrifices are made for the sake of the Arab nation and for a future of justice, wellbeing, and prosperity for the coming generations on their national soil. May God bless you. Please convey to everyone that we here are constantly for them and with them. We are confident that justice will eventually prevail. If there is any way that we can do anything, anytime, we beseech God to help us. I hope that my kinsfolk and brothers here will bring to my attention anything we can do to ease the suffering of the kinsfolk who were injured and suffered. As for the martyrs, they have preceded us down the path of martyrdom. They have fallen in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, near the forefather of the prophets [Abraham], in Ramadan, and at the dawn of a Friday. Thus, they have gone to heaven. I beseech God to make us among the righteous martyrs in defense of the Arab nation and its rights. I pray that God will inspire and help the revival of an imminent Arab awakening to restore to this nation its status among other nations, so that our nation, which is part of the Islamic nation, will become the best nation on earth, as God Almighty has wanted it to be. If we fail to do anything, significant or trivial, forgive us and alert us, because nobody matches us in our eagerness to be with you and on your side, as we have always been in all cases and under all circumstances. National unity is not just necessary, it is imperative; we are one small family within a larger family, which is the Arab family. It is our destiny to face challenges and dangers, to suffer, and to offer martyrs. All this is an honor to us. I pray that the time will come when everyone will appreciate the extent of what the kinsfolk in the occupied territories have offered by clinging to their land and rights, and by their steadfastness and endurance throughout the long march. I beseech God to help us to be always at their side. May God guide our steps and grant us success. Once again, I address every thanks, appreciation, and gratitude for you as you visit this home and place of yours, now and anytime. As long as we live, we will take pride in our being one family. Peace and blessings be upon you. [applause] [end recording] [passage omitted]
