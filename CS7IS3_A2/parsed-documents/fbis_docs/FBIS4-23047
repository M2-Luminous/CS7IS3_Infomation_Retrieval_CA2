The silicon dioxide was subjected to shock-wave treatment in steel and copper ampules containing an axially arranged charge of explosive. After the shock-wave treatment, the silicon dioxide was subjected to X-ray phase analysis and IR spectroscopy. The results demonstrated the existence of a new, previously unknown modification of silicon dioxide having a primitive cubic lattice (a = 7.78 angstroms). X-ray and IR data are presented.
