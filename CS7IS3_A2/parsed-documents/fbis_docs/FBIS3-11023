According to the official announcement made by President William Clinton himself, the meeting will be held in early December with the conspicuous absence of an invitation to the Cuban Government. The meeting will call for the creation of a mechanism capable of promoting George Bush's so-called Initiative for the Americas which seeks to open new inroads for U.S. capital and for filling the gap that -- for obvious reasons -- the United States cannot fill by way of the Ibero-American Summits. Through a consensus of the participants, the three Ibero-American Summits reached common stands on certain issues based on mutual respect and the sovereign rights of each nation. By virtue of its own right and by invitation of the organizers, Cuba has attended these Ibero-American Summits. This has disturbed the power brokers in the United States who insist on isolating the Cuban Government. The U.S. authorities are highlighting the fact that Cuba has been excluded from the Summit of the Americas guest list. No one should be deceived as to the not-so-secret purposes of giving the meeting a certain anti-Cuban flavor when economic issues of the utmost interest to Washington are scheduled to be discussed. We must not forget that challenges to maintaining the U.S. blockade against the island are growing in Congress, the executive branch, political institutions, the press, and other spheres of U.S. society. Those who advocate tightening the blockade do not like the steps taken by Cuba and its neighbors on the subcontinent to establish commercial ties that are mutually advantageous and encourage investments by Latin American entrepreneurs on the island. The venue for the so-called Summit of the Americas is very suggestive. Naturally, one becomes very suspicious of the fact that the city of Miami was selected, because this is a city where extreme right-wing Cuban immigrants still control powerful media outlets. We will wait and see what the definite agenda of the Miami meeting, which will be discussed when Vice President Al Gore visits the region, will be. It will not be easy for him to find support for anti-Cuban maneuvers, if this is one of his goals.
