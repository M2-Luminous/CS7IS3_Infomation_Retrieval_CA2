The move will further enhance the Indochinese country's integration into the six-member grouping. Already Vietnam has been accorded observer status to ASEAN meetings. Efforts are underway to increase its participation in ASEAN's activities leading to full membership. This was agreed upon by the grouping's six members at the ASEAN ministerial meeting in Singapore last July. American embargo on Vietnam is now history, thus setting the stage for expanded economic growth and investment. This augurs well for the speedy inclusion of Vietnam into ASEAN. ASEAN will do well, to speak things aloud. The grouping's own future has gone by leaps and bounds. Indeed, it is rapidly becoming the nucleus of Asian unity, the hub around which an increasing number of regional entities have been erected. Economic benefit, aside from membership in ASEAN will confer on it respectability in the international community. After all, the people have suffered wars and destruction for far too long. It is about time to take the rewards of peace with the accompanying economic development. Among factors in favor of the country in its ability to join up is that it has a market economy in the making. It is now already in place. With these, the country is poised to contributing much to the ASEAN Free Trade Area, AFTA. But membership is not automatic. Hanoi will have to work hard toward making its economic and political systems more compatible with its neighbors. If Vietnam shows genuine interest in adopting the grouping's broader principles, including pluralist politics and market economy, it should be made a member too. The member countries have agreed that the country should be given financial and technical aid to help its economic progress. A remarkable feature of ASEAN is that it is truly flexible and accommodating. The observer status remains deliberately undefined. Cambodia has been accorded special guest status. This has reflected the extent to which ASEAN can prime itself in order to accommodate political sensitivity in its dealings with third countries. Even without membership, Vietnam still has a lot to gain. This is because ASEAN can effectively cooperate with countries without having to formalize its relationship yet. This also goes for Laos and Cambodia. A widening of ASEAN from six to nine will refurbish its image internationally. At the same time, it will strengthen its bargaining position with its dialogue partners. Membership in ASEAN has represented a tempting proposition for all the Indochinese countries. Most importantly, the inclusion will ensure greater geopolitical stability and defuse regional tension. It will also be the catalyst for members to focus on economic pursuits with renewed vigor.
