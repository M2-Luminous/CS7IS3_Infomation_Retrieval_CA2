This was revealed by representatives of pro-Ukrainian organizations who arrived in Kiev in connection with such an extraordinary development of events. Representatives of Crimea's branches of URP [Ukrainian Republican Party], SOU [Union of Ukrainian Officers], SUS [Union of Ukrainian Students], Union of Ukrainian Women, the "Prosvita" Society, societies of political prisoners and the repressed, the Ukrainian Civil Congress of Crimea, Majlis of the Crimean Tatar People, and organizations of the Crimean-Tatar National Movement decided for the subsequent and probably the last time to demonstrate their position to the president and Ukraine's Supreme Council: "Crimea should be part of Ukraine." Mykola Porovskyy said, as people's deputy and leader of the Crimean branch of URP, that members of the delegation will picket the Supreme Council during the work of Ukraine's Supreme Council of the old convocation (from 22 April) "in order to show the Supreme Council what the voting on Crimea's autonomy has led to and what the consequences of the Ukrainian parliament's policy toward Crimea are." A warning hunger strike will be held during the picket. An appeal adopted by Crimea's pro-Ukrainian organizations and parties demands that Crimea's autonomy and the presidential institution be abrogated; direct presidential rule be introduced on its territory; the full return of Crimean Tatars and other deported peoples to their historic fatherland be facilitated; the rights of national autonomy be granted to them; the laws of Crimea be brought into line with Ukrainian legislation and that its implementation be guaranteed on the territory of the autonomy; Yuriy Meshkov and his supporters stop aggravating inter-ethnic hostility and anti-Ukrainian hysteria; Russian troops be withdrawn from the territory of Crimea; the problems of the Black Sea Fleet be resolved fairly; decisions of the Sevastopol town council concerning the Ukrainian Armed Forces be cancelled; and that presidential and local council elections be postponed being as they are too early. In the event of Ukraine's Supreme Council rejecting these demands, the appeal's authors retain the right to turn to international human rights organizations in the West and to resort to acts of civil disobedience.
