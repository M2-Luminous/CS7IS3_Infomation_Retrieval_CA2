Following the first round of talks this afternoon between'Arafat and Ross, which lasted for one and a half hours, Dennis Ross said the meeting was useful. However, he did not elaborate. We learned that the meeting focused on listening to the Palestinian viewpoint following the issuance of the Security Council resolution condemning the Hebron massacre. The Palestinian side said that what is required from Washington now -- in its capacity as one of the cosponsors -- is to intervene effectively to implement the provisions of Resolution 904, particularly regarding international protection for the Palestinian people under occupation. It cannot just be satisfied with listening to the Palestinian and Israeli viewpoints but must try to bring them closer. The Palestinian side underscored the need for an international security force in the occupied territory, not just observers. The Palestinian side also reiterated the need for reaching a clear solution to the issue of settlers in Hebron and for disarming them. Dennis Ross is expected to meet with the Israeli delegation led by Amnon Shahaq before resuming his talks with the Palestinian leadership this evening.
