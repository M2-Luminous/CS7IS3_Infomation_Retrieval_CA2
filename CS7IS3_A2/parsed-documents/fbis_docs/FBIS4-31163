FBIS4-31163 "dreeu107_p_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-107 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 POLAND Poll Shows Coalition Leads in Local Elections Poll Shows Coalition Leads in Local Elections WS0306111294 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 1-2 Jun 94 p 2 WS0306111294 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA Polish BFN [Report by "J.T.P.": "Coalition Leads; CBOS on Local Elections"] [Text] It can be concluded from a May poll conducted by the Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS] that about 41 percent of eligible voters will take part in the upcoming local elections. This would mean that this year's turnout will not be different from that of four years ago when 42 percent of the voters decided to vote. But because the poll was conducted a month before the elections, the situation may still change. According to responses given by respondents in the first half of May, the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] leads among the parties running in the elections, with 16 percent, followed by the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] (15 percent), the Freedom Union [UW] (12 percent), and the Union of Labor [UP] (10 percent). In the second half of May, 21 percent of those polled wanted to vote PSL, 12 percent for SLD, and 15 percent for UW. The remaining parties would gain fewer than 3 percent of the votes. But the largest group of respondents could not make up their minds regarding any party. When one compares that with results from the previous elections, one can conclude that UW and SLD have the most faithful electorates, with the Union for Real Politics and the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms having gained the greatest number of new supporters; from among the big parties, the highest number of new supporters was gained by UP, while the smallest number -- by UW. These results must however be approached with great caution since a big part will be played in the local elections by local election committees, with political parties being behind some of them. After taking into account the participation in the elections of local committees (for which many voters would prefer to vote instead of the parties), one can state that PSL should gain at least 10 percent in the elections, SLD -- 9 percent, UW -- 7 percent, UP -- 5 percent, while the coalition with the participation of the Christian-National Union -- 4 percent. So these results are different from some data on election preferences in parliamentary elections that were published in Tuesday's RZECZPOSPOLITA and that were collected by the Sopot-based Social Research Institute [Pracownia Badan Spolecznych]. If parliamentary elections were to take place today, they would be won by SLD, followed by UW, and PSL (which has the biggest chances for the local elections) coming third. It is obvious that both polls were conducted on different kinds of voters and they apply to different situations, and that is most probably how the differences came about. Forty-five percent of those polled evaluated the performance of the outgoing gmina councils very well or just well (during the May poll), while 29 percent said their assessment was "rather bad" or "very bad." Local authorities have for a long time been the authorities institutions gaining the best public assessments of all. In an April poll, their performance was positively evaluated by 57 percent of those polled. Despite that, the biggest group of the polled will tend to vote in favor of changes rather than in favor of a continuation when it comes to personnel composition of gmina councils. They do not have high praise for the importance of local elections, either. The poll was conducted during 7-10 and 19-23 May, using a representative random sample of adult residents of Poland.
