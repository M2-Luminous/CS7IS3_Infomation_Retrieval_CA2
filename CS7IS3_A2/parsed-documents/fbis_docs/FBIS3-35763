"Nothing is impossible in our world. A diplomat who says that something is impossible, in principle is not a diplomat," he said. He believes that the current Russian government is as reform-oriented as its predecessor. "The Cabinet has only been reorganized, so the current government is old, not new. That is why the Cabinet's membership will not be submitted to the State Duma for endorsement," said Kozyrev. He noted that some of the departments had been reorganized. "New appointments have been made and some of the Cabinet members have been given a new status, say, a deputy prime minister has become a minister. This does not mean, however, that the government is new," he said. Kozyrev emphasized that as before the Russian government would promote reforms and that Russia's foreign policy will definitely remain unchanged. He told journalists who accompanied him on his way from China to Moscow that from the beginning he had not considered Gaydar's resignation a necessity. "I had serious doubts about this. I told Gaydar right away that I respected his personal and political reasons. After all, everyone has the right to long-range tactical and strategic moves. However, taking into account prospects for the democratic movement and the results of the recent parliamentary elections, I thought that Gaydar should have stayed in the government to defend his views. The democratic potential should not have been weakened, particularly after a relative defeat during the elections," said Kozyrev. He pointed out that the "practice of resignation" would hardly strengthen the democratic movement. Precisely because of this, he has spoken out for a mediatory stance. "I consider both my co-thinkers," he said referring to Gaydar and Chernomyrdin. "Yegor Gaydar's resignation from Yeltsin's reformatory team was a shock for me," he said. To quote Kozyrev, disputes do occur in the government and a minister may find it difficult to defend his point of view. "But after set-backs, one may raise the same question once again. This is what I told Gaydar," said Kozyrev. He expressed hope that after Gaydar's resignation, the democrats would regroup their forces. "It is the democrats' duty to tell the people what happened during the elections and what they are going to do in connection with this. The type of reform based exclusively on Boris Yeltsin's popularity is no long viable. Reformers, particularly the democrats who intend to form up a government, must win a mandate of their own during elections," said Kozyrev. He said that the relative defeat during the recent elections would lead not only to a chain of dramatic resignations, but also to a dramatic self-analysis in the democratic camp.
