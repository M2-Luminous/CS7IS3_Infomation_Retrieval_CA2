When explaining the meaning of the document, Vladimir Isakov, chairman of the State Duma's committee for lawmaking and court and legal reform, said that "the chain of lawmaking has been broken". "There are facts when non-legislative bodies cancelled or suspended the laws, which disorganizes the work of the legal system," he said. The declaration is called on to put an end to these negative developments and designate the principles of legal continuity. According to Mikhail Mityukov, deputy chairman of the State Duma, individual provisions of the draft still "need to be substantially elaborated".
