On 15 May, deployed for mobile operations in the bases of the U.S. Air Force in South Korea were squadrons of nuclear-loaded F-16 and F-15 fighters-bombers, EA-20 observation aircraft flown in from U.S. Pacific bases. On 16 May, in accordance with the operational plans of the U.S. Pacific Air Force Command, these military aircraft ran wild in staging an aerial war exercise--centered on the skies over Chungju, Yongwol, and (?Kunwi)--aimed at launching a surprise strike against the facilities of the strategic in-depth areas of the northern part of the Republic. This war exercise was aimed at conducting a swift deployment of the overseas-based aircraft into the Korean Peninsula for mobile operations and at increasing the capabilities for an actual warfare between the U.S. Air Force in South Korea and the puppet air force for launching a joint strike for a northward invasion. In the meanwhile, flown into the U.S. Air Force bases in South Korea on 15 May were a succession of squadrons of C-141 and C-130 transport planes, including super-large C-5 transport aircraft, carrying numerous troops and lethal equipment from U.S. Pacific bases. All facts show that the U.S. imperialists' maneuvers of preparing a war of aggression are reaching a grave stage.
