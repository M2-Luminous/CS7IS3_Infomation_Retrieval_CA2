FR940407-0-00024 FR940407-0-00004 In addition, OSM notified Utah, by letter dated May 19, 1993, of its determination that paragraph II.1. of the September 4, 1992, agreement, which would have exempted certain Utah mine roads from regulation under SMCRA and the Utah program, is contrary to law and thus is not binding on OSM. The September 4, 1992, agreement was not reviewed, approved, or adopted by the court in Utah v. Lujan. Thus, it is nothing more than a contract between OSM and Utah. Under general contract law, a Federal agency cannot contract with a body it regulates in a manner contrary to its statutory authority or in a manner that does not give full effect to the intent of the Congress ( Board of Directors and Officers, Forbes Federal Credit Union v. National Credit Union Admin., 477 F.2d 777, 784 (10th Cir. 1973)). Contracts entered in violation of statutory or regulatory law are unenforceable if enforcement would ``offend the essential purpose of the enactment'' ( United States v. Mississippi Valley Co., 364 U.S. 520, 563 (1961). See also Quinn v. Gulf Western Corp., 644 F.2d 89, 93&hyph;94 (2d Cir. 1981); D.M. Yates, 74 IBLA 159, 161 (1983). See generally E. Farnsworth, Contracts sections 5.5&hyph;5.6 (2d ed. 1982); 15 S. Williston, Contracts section 1763 (3d ed. 1972)). In other words, OSM is free to enter into contracts or agreements with other parties, but when a provision of a contract or agreement conflicts with OSM's statutory responsibilities under SMCRA such that its enforcement would offend an essential purpose of SMCRA, that provision is unenforceable. Under paragraph II.1. of the September 4, 1992, agreement, Utah and OSM agreed to a blanket exemption from regulation under SMCRA and the Utah program of all unpermitted mine roads existing prior to September 4, 1992. SMCRA jurisdiction over mine roads derives from the statutory definition of the term ``surface coal mining operations'' at section 701(28). SMCRA defines this term, in pertinent part, to mean: (A) Activities conducted on the surface of lands in connection with a surface coal mine *␣*␣*; and (B) the areas upon which such activities occur or where such activities disturb the natural land surface. Such areas shall also include *␣*␣* all lands affected by the construction of new roads to gain access to the site of those activities and for haulage *␣*␣* (emphasis added). This definition of ``surface coal mining operations'' is substantively identical to the Federal regulatory definition of that term at 30 CFR 700.5 and Utah's statutory definition of that term at U.C.A. 40&hyph;10&hyph;3(18).
