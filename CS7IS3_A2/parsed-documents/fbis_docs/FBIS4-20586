Another BN with three-layered sequence ABCABC like rhombohedral graphite (rhombohedral boron nitride, rBN) has been known to be produced in coexistence with hBN under particular synthetic conditions. It has been found that the rBN structure was formed due to an effect of monovalent anions in such systems, and the synthetic method of pure rBN was established based on these findings.[.sup]1[/] In the present study, it will be shown that the effect of anions on the formation of rBN decreases systematically in an anion series, to offer an evidence of our proposed mechanism of rBN formation. Experiment An 1:1.1 (mol) mixture of sodium tetrahydroborate (NaBH[.sub]4[/]) and ammonium chloride (NH[.sub]4[/]Cl) was heated at 600�C in N[.sub]2[/] for 10 minutes, washed with water and methanol to remove coproduced NaCl after it had cooled down. The BN precursor thus obtained was mixed with a series of anions in the forms of NaF, NaCl, NaBr, NaI, and KCN, respectively, and heated at 900�C and 1000�C for 10 hours in N[.sub]2[/]. The recovered samples were examined by X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and IR and Raman spectroscopy after they were treated with water to remove salts. Results The precursor was composed of BN containing traces of NaCl, and obtained in 80% yield. It showed a typical diffraction pattern of turbostratic structure with broad 00l, and 10 peaks. The structure of the precursor was changed to rBN after it was heated with KCN, NaF or NaCl. The rBN peaks, 101 at 42.6� (2_th_ CuK_a_) and 012 at 45.5� other than 00l peaks relating to interlayer distances were clearly observed. The intensity and sharpness of these peaks decreased according to the above order of the three salts. Traces of those peaks were observed in the sample treated with NaBr, and could not in the case of Ani. It is concluded that the catalytic power to produce rBN decreases according to the order of the following anion series: CN, F, Cl, Br, I. The series coincides, with the well-known order of coordination strength of anions, and the fact strongly supports the formation mechanism of rBN based on the coordination of anions. References 1. T.
