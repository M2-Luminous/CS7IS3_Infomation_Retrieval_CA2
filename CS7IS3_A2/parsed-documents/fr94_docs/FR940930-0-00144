FR940930-0-00144 FR940930-0-00028 For gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles, NMHC and NMOG standards are equivalent since CARB has established a RAF of 1.0 for these fuels. In addition, since the methane fraction of the THC emissions from these vehicles is very low, 15 and since CARB's TLEV and LEV NMOG standards (.125 and .075 g/mile, respectively) are well below the federal THC standard (0.41 g/mile), vehicles designed to meet the CARB NMOG standard will not exceed the federal THC standard. Thus, for gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles, the CARB NMOG standards are at least as stringent as the federal THC and NMHC standards. 15 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Mobile Sources, ``Specifications for S.A.I. Runs,'' Memorandum from Chris Lindhjem, Penny Carey, and Joe Somers to the Record, April 24, 1992. CNG Fuel The equivalency of CARB's NMOG standard with the federal NMHC standards cannot be strictly determined at this point for natural gas vehicles since CARB has not finalized a RAF for natural gas. Indications are that CARB may enact a CNG RAF between 0.5 and 0.6. If CARB adopts a RAF of 0.5 or more, then EPA expects that the CARB TLEV NMOG standard of 0.125 grams/mile (representing the least stringent set of CARB standards) will be at least as stringent as the 0.25 grams/mile federal NMHC standard. A RAF of 0.3 or more would make the CARB LEV NMOG standard of 0.075 grams/mile equivalent to the federal NMHC standard. CNG vehicles being certified as CFVs for use in the CFF and Pilot program will not be subject to the federal THC standard, therefore, a comparison of the relative stringency between the federal THC and the CARB NMOG standard is not appropriate. In the Pilot program NPRM (58 FR 34727, June 29, 1993), EPA requested comment on the appropriateness of applying a THC standard to natural gas CFVs even though a THC standard is not applied to other natural gas vehicles. EPA believes that requiring CNG vehicles to meet the federal THC standard would exclude CNG vehicles from participating in the CFF and Pilot programs. CNG vehicles do produce high methane emissions; however, these emissions have a very low ozone reactivity and are therefore not a significant contributor to ozone formation, which is a primary objective of both programs. 16 In addition, CNG vehicles typically produce lower NMHC emissions than gasoline-fueled vehicles. Therefore, although a THC standard would strictly limit the amount of methane emissions a CNG vehicle could emit, this result would be contrary to the ozone-reduction goals of the programs when methane reactivity and lower NMHC emissions of CNG vehicles relative to gasoline-fueled vehicles are considered. A further consideration in deciding whether to apply a THC standard to CNG CFVs was the Agency's desire to maintain consistency with its Gaseous Fuels rule whenever possible; that rule also does not apply THC standards to CNG vehicles. Commenters were not supportive of CNG vehicles, including CFVs, being subject to a THC standard. 16 See CAA sections 246, 247, and 248. LPG Fuel CARB has not finalized a RAF for LPG fuel. Therefore, EPA cannot at this time strictly compare the CARB NMOG standard to the federal NMHC standard for LPG vehicles. However, as with CNG, if CARB adopts a RAF of at least 0.5, EPA expects that the CARB TLEV and LEV NMOG standard will be individually at least as stringent as the federal NMHC standard. Alcohol Fuels CARB has finalized a RAF of 0.41 for M85 vehicles and EPA's analysis indicates that the CARB NMOG standard is individually as protective as the federal NMHC equivalent standard for M85 fuel. However, CARB has not established a RAF for E85 and M100 fuel. EPA thus cannot determine at this time whether the CARB NMOG standards are individually as protective of public health and welfare as the federal NMHC equivalent standards for all alcohol-fueled vehicles. Regarding THC, methane emissions from alcohol-fueled vehicles, as with gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles, are generally low enough that vehicles meeting the CARB NMOG standards would also comply with the federal THC standards. Therefore, EPA concludes that the CARB NMOG standards are individually at least as stringent as the federal THC standard.
