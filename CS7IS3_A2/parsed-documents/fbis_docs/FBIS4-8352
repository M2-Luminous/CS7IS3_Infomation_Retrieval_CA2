Thus, they regard some parties as worthy of their votes and exclude others. However, at the end of this decision process, some kind of positive approach emerges in the actual voting, because voters do vote in favor of some party after all. According to the Szonda Ipsos opinion poll, 12 percent of the citizens only express their antipathy at the moment: They only name the parties for which they would definitely not vote, but they do not name the parties for which they might vote. We asked 3,000 people in February and March 1994, and we are only considering those of voting age now. The exclusivity of party aversion is mainly characteristic of high school and university graduates, and 15 percent of each group mentioned a party they would definitely not vote for, and these have not formulated a clear sympathy either. The higher the educational level, the more people can be listed among those with party aversion. The same applies to the positive approach: The more educated they are, the more probable it is that they are sympathetic toward a certain party. We also found another characteristic among those who expressed their lack of preference: They can be found mostly in the towns (15 percent in Budapest and 13 percent in provincial towns), rather than in the villages (8 percent). However, we could find no age differences: This attitude is equally characteristic of old people, middle-aged people, and young people. Some 29 percent of those who have a negative approach to the political parties regard the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] as the most disliked party. This list continues with the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP], with 21 percent of the people rejecting it. The fourth on this negative "top list" is the Labor Party with 13 percent, closely followed by the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] with 12 percent. Few show any definite antipathy toward the other parties: 7 percent mentioned the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], 6 percent the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP], 4 percent the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], and 2 percent the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. The negative preferences of the intelligentsia within this group slightly differ from the average: More intellectuals exclude the FGKP than the MDF. No one in this group has a party preference that he would vote for, but this does not mean that these people will renounce their right to vote. Their willingness to vote is above average: Some 69 percent of these regard themselves as certain voters if the elections were held today, and 18 percent said they would probably vote. This considerable desire to vote will probably mean actual participation in the elections in May. These people's election forecasts can provide some basis to the question of their actual voting preferences. Lacking a clear party preference, it is possible that they will vote for a party that they think will win the elections. Several people forecast the victory of two parties: Some 17 percent think that the SZDSZ will win, and 16 percent think that the MSZP will win. Only 7 percent think of the MDF and 5 percent the Fidesz as victors. As for the other parties, these give them minimal chances of victory. There is still a great deal of uncertainty in this group because 48 percent did not mention any party. Therefore, this group of people with party aversion is a politically active group, and the current opposition parties can count heavily on their votes; but not so the government coalition parties.
