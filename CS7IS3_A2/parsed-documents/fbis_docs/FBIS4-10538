On Sunday, Godoy Reyes and Daniel Ortega both said on local radio stations that street violence may erupt if the government implements the economic measures scheduled for this month. Godoy, however, did not say whether UNO [National Opposition Union] will support such protests. The Sandinist National Liberation Front, which has always supported violence, says it will support these events. Ortega and Godoy agreed the economic measures are very harsh and might prompt disturbances. The leadership of COSEP [Higher Council of Private Enterprise], through its president Ramiro Gurdian, said the measures should be implemented as the only real solution to Nicaragua's economic problems.
