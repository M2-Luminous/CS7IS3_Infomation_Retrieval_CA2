They point out that even if he was supported by President Blaise Compaore, he was not able to meet the demands of the trade unions. The workers were demanding better living conditions, a substantial salary increase and maintaining prices at a reasonable level. In spite of the signing on Saturday of a joint communique between the government and the unions which increased salaries, the trade unions are still threatening to strike because they consider the salary increases insufficient. Some of the trade union leaders who signed the accord later rejected it saying that concessions made by the government were not enough. Youssouf Ouedraogo, who resigned on Wednesday night, is portrayed in his country as a brilliant technocrat, with a solid academic, administrative and political experience in Burkina Faso. Nominated prime minister on 16 June 1992, Ouedraogo, an economist, has been a lecturer at the Economic Sciences Institute of the University of Ouagadougou. A member of the People's Assembly (ADP- Parliament) since the last general elections of 1992, Ouedraogo was planning and popular development minister (September 1984-August 1987), cooperation and planning minister (November 1987-April 1989) and president of the Economic and Social Council (April 1989-May 1992). During the general convention of the Organisation for Popular Democracy Labour Movement (ODP/MT), which has majority in Parliament with 79 seats Ouedraogo who was not an active political leader, was elected senior vice president of the party, on 19 April 1993. His nomination as prime minister raised many controversies in the ODP/MT. He reshuffled his government two times during his two year term. The first was on 3 September 1993 and the second on 19 January 1994.
