By yesterday, the Ministry of Economics had prepared as a minimum two documents aimed at attracting private capital to industry. A distinctive feature of them is that they are oriented toward capital from Russian investors, not foreign investors. The arsenal of funds at the government's disposal to stimulate investments is potentially quite extensive. First of all, there are the preferential investment credits, the various tax exemptions, the direct purchase of enterprises' securities and the issuance of state guarantees for the securities being issued. At the same time, experience shows that the first two methods prove to be ineffective--the credits (not reimbursable, as a rule) and tax exemptions are turned into a camouflaged form of state subsidies. The adherents of privatization see nationalization of enterprises in the purchase of stock shares by the government, and for this reason, the Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee on the Administration of State Property] reacts coolly toward such proposals. So the only real way at present is by granting state guarantees. In this connection, Ministry of Economics specalists have prepared draft government decrees "On Specialized Institutions to Implement State Investment Policy" and "On the Council for Structural and Investment Policy Attached to the Russian Government and Agreement with an Investment and Financial Consortium." In the words of Leonid Paydiyev, who authored the first document, there is practically nothing that is new in the concept being worked out to attract private capital--it was utilized to one degree or another by the tsarist government when it built the railroads. The concept being proposed essentially involves the creation of a state guarantee fund under the aegis of the Ministry of Economics. Special agents of the government will issue state guarantees on the securities for investment projects with shared participation by the state. Both state enterprises and investment companies (funds) may act in this role. In order to establish a broad network of agents, it was proposed to implement "measures to transform existing checking investment funds into investment companies, banks, and bank branches (with restrictions on commercial activity and clearing transactions)." If this concept is considered from the viewpoint of interdepartmental relationships, it is apparent that such a radical version of restructuring the state investment system can expect a lengthy period of coordination, during which many of its elements either will disappear altogether or undergo substantial modification. For this reason, it is more likely that agreements between the government and the special investment and financial consortium which is being established will make their appearance in the very near future. This was confirmed during a visit which Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin made to the KOMMERSANT Publishing House. In his words, the document should be signed as early as next week. Th government will put 500 billion rubles [R] into the consortium being created, and investment projects will be guaranteed. It is expected that establishment of the fund will help to attract private investments of R1.5 trillion. We note that in the event of "an insurance case," such as bankruptcy of an investment project, the funds to make up for an investor's losses will be transferred from the Federal Treasury in a procedure not requiring acceptance. They are saying that the basic reason for the nearly 2 weeks of coordinating the document draft in the Ministry of Finance is that the machinery for the consortium's responsibility to the government was not worked through sufficiently. In the meantime, the actions by the minister of economics, who is insisting on approval of this document as quickly as possible, are easily explained--the launching of this project should provide evidence that the Chernomyrdin government is prepared to devote attention to stimulation of investments not only in words and with the aid of budgetary funds, but by establishing efficient "market" mechanisms. * * * Requirements for the Legal Status of Government Agent The firm which controls the assets of a given investment company should be a separate juridical entity. Its founders should be physical persons who bear unlimited property responsibility for the debts of the company. State Support for Private Investors May be Provided in the Following form: - the purchase of part of the issuer's emission of securities; - the issuance of state guarantees for the securities issued; - the issuance of special-purpose credits; - the issuance of special preferential credits (through TsB [Central Bank] funds); - the issuance of guarantees for the payment of subventions after a facility is put into use; - the issuance of guarantees for enterprises' debts.
