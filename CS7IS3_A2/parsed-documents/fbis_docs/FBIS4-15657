The point is that the article, which speaks of the danger of an information war, contains a reference to a report by the agency's correspondent on Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy's flight to Crimea. The correspondent referred to information received at the Black Sea Staff. The information had not been confirmed, which fact ITAR-TASS at once reported, but the agency tape did not reach our observer's desk. It did not have time to. This is why, in denying the information on the Ukrainian defense minister's trip, he cites not ITAR-TASS but reports by our correspondent in Crimea and other sources. We know that ITAR-TASS staffers work to a rigid real-time regime. Information which is received is passed on instantly. The editorial office really did not wish to cast even a shadow of suspicion on the agency, whose materials it readily uses. Even without us there are enough people ready and willing to shift onto journalists the responsibility for inaccurate information received from trustworthy sources. For example, a "technical error" gets through in an official report, and they call journalists to account, although it was prepared by politicians. Meanwhile the agency was merely fulfilling one of its important functions -- that of acting as middle-man between the public and the organs of power.
