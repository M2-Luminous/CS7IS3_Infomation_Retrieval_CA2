Gratchev announced in Moscow on Friday [6 May] that Russia may keep its troops in Estonia indefinitely unless the issue of the retired military be settled according to Russia's demands. He added that the forces could be increased "in order to protect military sites in Estonia." Head of the Russian negotiations delegation Vasili Svirin declined from commenting the minister's threats. He had earlier assured that the troops stationed in Estonia will not be reinforced. President Meri attended an international meeting in Arrabida near Lisbon, dedicated to the prevention of conflicts by the UN and the NATO. "A threat by one UN member state to use military force against another member -- Estonia -- is a serious matter. For that reason I interrupted my visit, hurried back and discussed the ways of countering the threat on Saturday evening," Meri said in his speech held on Mother's Day. Tendencies of increasing reliance on force and attempts of realisation of the "near abroad" policy are evident in Russia's policy, Foreign Ministry Vice Chancellor Raul Malk commented the Russian defence minister's threats. Malk pointed out that the Gratchev statement contradicts the CSCE and the UN documents on the troops withdrawal from Estonia. "The Gratchev statement is a direct challenge to the authority of international demands. The Russian defence minister's threats of stopping the military withdrawal and reinforcement of present troops prove Moscow's increasing attempts to force its will on other states and international organisations," Malk commented. He also stressed the fact that Gratchev made his statement while the negotiations were still going on. This can be understood as a way of exerting pressure on Estonia, as well as a Russian decision to give up negotiations, Malk said. The states which remain indifferent witnesses of the tendencies in Russian politics will accept a grave responsibility, the vice-chancellor warned.
