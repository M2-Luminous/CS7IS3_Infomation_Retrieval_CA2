[Lukin] I would appraise this visit as a success. And its results as normal, predictable, and even inevitable. Of the entire package of documents signed, I would single out first and foremost the trilateral agreement on nuclear arms in Ukraine. Even taking into consideration the difficult political situation in that country, I think that President Kravchuk's actions will be met with understanding on the part of both the Ukrainian people and its parliament. So I believe that the agreement will be ratified by Kiev. As a last resort, history knows some instances when documents signed by presidents but never ratified by a legislative body of that country still were observed (for instance, the SALT treaty proposed by Jimmy Carter but rejected by the U.S. Congress). Another important event is the agreement on uranium. The American bureaucracy is one of the most talented in the world, and the fact that this agreement was pushed through is an unquestionable success of our diplomacy. In other words, the American market is being gradually opened for us, too. Another one--the Moscow Declaration. A statement aimed at a mature partnership without illusions. Practically for the first time we are saying that we can cooperate as equals in areas of mutual interest. [Molchanov] Does this mean that Russia finally has shed the demeaning image of "Mr. Yes" it has acquired over the past few years? [Lukin] I would even say that this was a "Mrs. Yes" image. In our desire to follow other people's advice, we went too far. Today there is an indication of a return to the normal practice of international relations. Some call it the "old mentality," some--"new thinking..." I believe that there can only be right and wrong thinking. The right thinking now is letting our neighbors that Russia is an elephant, not a yapping lapdog, and it should not be barked at as some do. Difficult times happen in the history of any country, when it suddenly finds itself at a crossroads. Our choice is a democratic civilized society, ready for full-fledged cooperation with its partners on an equal footing. Yes, we do have problems, but Russia is a great power, and it will resolve them. President Clinton showed sensitivity and tact in his grasp of our problems. And this is another important result of his visit.
