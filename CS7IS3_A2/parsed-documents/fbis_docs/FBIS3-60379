The creation of a scientific interest grouping [GIS] for the economic development of energy crops could provide the ADEME with fresh impetus. The multidisciplined vocations of the ADEME include backing and coordinating research projects. Hit by the 1994 budget which shaved some 30 percent off its research and development funding, the young agency will no longer be able to meet the aims of its research program for the 1992-1996 period. It will, however, maintain its effort to finance scientific theses and, in the agroindustrial field, it hopes to receive fresh impetus from the creation of a GIS for the economic development of energy crops. During the restructuring program carried out last year, the ADEME -- created in 1992 from the merger of the French Energy Use Agency [AFME], the National Agency for the Recovery and Elimination of Waste [ANRED], and the Air Quality Agency [AQA]--began to work in four major sectors: industry, the habitat and renewable energy sources, transport, and agriculture and bioenergy. Its research budget for 1994 took heavy cuts in the number of programs it could authorize from two of its parent ministries, Industry and Research (the Research Ministry cut its program authorizations by 30 percent while payment appropriation, abnormally low since 1991, rose by 20 percent). Globally, agency funding remained more or less stable, thanks to an increase in funds from the tax levied on waste products. This money, however, must be spent on research into household and normal industrial waste, and atmospheric pollution from large installations, leaving by the wayside certain of the priorities set out in the research and development program for 1992- 1996: energy use, the restoration of contaminated sites, and research into untaxed air pollution. These are all areas that are liable to suffer from the reduction in ADEME funding. Of the three bodies merged into the ADEME, only the AFME received research credits for the financing of its work, the creation of support networks, and enabling it to work with public and industrial research laboratories. In the biotechnology sector, the AFME was active in three main areas. Firstly, solar bioenergy, with the joint creation in 1982 with the Atomic Energy Commission [AEC] of the Association for Research into Solar Biotechnology [ARBS]. Participants from industry included Rhone-Poulenc, Total, and Elf. This association worked for six years researching into a way of producing hydrogen or hydrocarbons from plants and photosynthesizing bacteria. The ARBS was then integrated into an AEC laboratory. The second line of research was the methanization of industrial effluent, slurry, and household waste. One of the agency's functions in this area was to support the research and development stages of the Valorga process. The third line of research was in replacement fuel sources from the biomass. The AFME's finest achievement in this domain (and the most expensive) was the financing of the Soustons platform (southwestern France), originally designed around the "green refinery" concept and which is currently operated by an industrial company (SAF-Isis). Over the years, the changing socioeconomic context has altered the purpose of the work financed by the agency. Thus, research into methanization, which was commenced with the aim of achieving energy independence, now aims at environmental protection, for example with the treatment of food industry effluent. With the creation of the ADEME, biotechnology reasserted its role of serving the environment, already established with biomass and cellulolysis research. New avenues were explored, such as biomatter, food, and pharmaceutical constituents (flavorings, colorings, texturing agents, and enzymes), bioprocesses applied to effluent and solid waste treatment, etc. This clarification of issues is particularly well-defined in the ADEME policy on cofinancing thesis grants. Currently financed research is split equally between environmental protection and energy use. Given the severe cutback in funding, the ADEME has fallen back on the hard core project of cofinancing, with industrial companies or local communities, thesis students working in priority areas. Awarding thesis grants allows a certain freedom of action since it is thus possible to examine more adventurous subjects or subjects whose results are less certain. Between 1988 and 1993, the field of biological engineering, for example, was the subject of 21 theses. In 1993 these included work on the microbial production of surface active agents (cofinanced with the French Petroleum Institute [IFP]) and the enzymatic alteration of cellulosed materials (cofinanced with a laboratory of the National Scientific Research Center [CNRS]). Biological engineering does not completely dominate biotechnology work, however. In 1993, the Impact and Environment Research Service [SRIM] financed theses on the development of a biosensor for the prevention of accidental pollution (air and waste) and on the bioevaluation of polluted soil, researching toxicity biomarkers in rats (sentinel animals). Biotechnology still accounts for just 15 percent of the 80 thesis grants cofinanced by the ADEME each year. In the field of biotechnology, research could take off again thanks to the creation of the agency for the economic development of energy crops. Announced in December 1992 and confirmed by Hubert Curien at the Agricultural Show of March 1993, this agency should become operational in the first quarter of 1994. The project will initially take the form of a GIS controlled by the ADEME and based on a contractual agreement between different partners: the ADEME, the national agronomy research institute [INRA], and the IFP, working closely with the ministries of agriculture, research, and industry. The Industry Ministry would also like to involve industrial groups. The fields of operation of this national research and development project are fully in line with the recommendations of the Levy report on biofuels--to develop research to improve the competitiveness of biofuels. They are defined in terms of product lines. Under examination will be: lipidic plants (rape, proteaginous species) and their possibilities for producing oils and methylic esters; lignocellulose plants that are sources of biofuel; and carbohydrate plants (wheat, beetroot, corn, and sorghum), producing ethanol and ethyl tertiobutyl ether (ETBE). A fourth program will aim at finding new uses for agriculture producing neither food or energy, but biopolymers, biodegradable surface active agents, vegetable lipochemistry, etc.). A fifth, cross-disciplinary program will be dedicated to the economic aspects and environmental impact of new products being studied. The idea is to be able to one day make concrete proposals to farmers offering them a choice of production systems. The public expenditure set aside for the GIS should amount to some 40 million French francs in its first year. Current ADEME research projects therefore operate according to a double logic: stimulating protection of the environment and finding an answer to the problems posed by agricultural policy.
