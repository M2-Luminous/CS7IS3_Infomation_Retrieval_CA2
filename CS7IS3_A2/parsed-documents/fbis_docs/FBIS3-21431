Narasimha Rao, today defended his sweeping economic reforms, describing it as an idealistic striving tempered by practical thinking to ameliorate the lot of millions of Indians. Delivering a lecture at the historic Humboldt University here, Mr. Rao drew parallel with the renowned indologist, Max Mueller who encountered hurdles when he set out to translate vedic hymns as his detractors and Mueller was embarking on a task for the next century. Mr. Rao recalled the words of Mueller when he said in defence of his task: "No one feels this more strongly than I do. No one has been more willing to make even a beginning in this arduous undertaking. Yet a beginning has to be made and we have to advance step by step to make a breach in that apparently impregnable fortress. My principle, therefore, has always been, let us translate what we can, and thus reduce the untranslatable portion to narrower and narrower limits." Mr. Rao said in that endeavour, the restriction of the untranslatable with limits defined more and more sharply, the politician had no less difficult a task than a writer or scholar. In all that the politician or statesman did, his efforts must be to make the improbable possible, and to persuade his people, his adversaries and his friends, and above all himself that the impossible would so remain but need not affect, abridge or inhibit the immense possibilities that yearn to be realised. Mr. Rao asserted in an obvious answer to his detractors. The Prime Minister said currently India was passing through the most important transition in its economy as the policies of the last 45 years were being re-oriented and efforts were on to accomplish a market-led economy. 'Walls of prejudice must go': Mr. Rao described Berlin as a city "marbled in history and shaped by the ecstasy of achievement and the anguish of war where walls have been raised and walls have been razed." He said walls of ideology had made many intellectual endeavours counter-productive and asserted that "we have arrived at a time when truly, the walls of biases, of prejudice, of small identities have to be broken, to create a new humanism based on the absolute trust and respect for the other." Though schools of German studies in India were younger in comparison, there was nonetheless, a strong and vibrant tradition of German studies in India, he said. He also lauded the historic role played by Humboldt University in strengthening ties between India and Germany. Mr. Rao said the establishment of the Indian cultural centre here would promote the larger cause of Indo-German friendship. Earlier inaugurating the centre by lighting the traditional lamp, he said its establishment would provide a focal point for interaction between India and Germany in various aspects of "Indian art and culture." Rare honour for PM: Mr. Rao was accorded the rare honour of being received by federal President, Mr. Richard Von Weizsacker, in Berlin instead of Bonn when he called on him last evening. This is of great significance especially as Mr. Rao is the first Head of Government since World War II to be received by the federal President in Berlin. For the people of Berlin too, it is a confirmation of the fact that the city will soon become the capital of the reunited Germany as it was agreed upon by a parliamentary decision immediately following the reunification. An official spokesman described Mr. Rao's meeting with Mr. Weizsacker at Bellevue Palace as a courtesy call. Later in the evening, Mr. Rao walked through the Brandenburg Gate with the governing Mayor of Berlin, Mr. Ederhard Diepgen.--PTI
