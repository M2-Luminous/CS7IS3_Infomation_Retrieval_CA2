Dolgopolova, Division of Protection and Rational Utilization of Natural Resources, Academy of Sciences of Tadjikistan, under the rubric: BRIEF COMMUNICATIONS; UDC 575.11:502.7(575.3)] [Text] The Vakhsh River valley is a region of intense agricultural production, the base of which is cotton cultivation. The cultivation of the cotton plant over the last three decades has been accompanied by the intensive use of pesticides and mineral fertilizers. Some of the toxic agents have been carried away from the fields into natural ecosystems. Two large chemical enterprises are operating in the Vakhsh River basin, the Tadzhikkhimprom production association (TKP PA) and the Vakhsh nitrogenous fertilizer plant (VNFP), as well as many other industrial enterprises, the exhausts and effluents of whose production enter the environment. The level of chemical pollution of the Vakhsh River valley ecosystems has been studied quite actively; however, studies devoted to the real ecological consequences of pollution have been studied considerably less. The genetic aspects of chemical pollution of the Vakhsh River Valley ecosystems remain essentially unstudied. Some of the results obtained at the first stage of the resolution of this problem are presented in this paper. In all, 102 mice (Mus musculus) from 13 samples were studied. The number of animals in the samples ranged from three to eleven; the average size of the samples was eight. The sites the mice were trapped with indication of the sample number, corresponding to the number on the map (see figure), the number of animals trapped, the sex ratio (females : males), and the date of trapping are presented below. Diagrammatic map of trapping sites of animals. Explanations in text.

The cytogenetic preparations were made up from bone marrow cells (Lee, 1969), and stained with Romanowskys azure-eosin. Chromosome injuries were recorded in accordance with recommendations set forth in methodological studies (Nemtseva, 1970; Methods of Analysis..., 1975; Human ChromosomesS, 1985; Evans, 1976). The frequencies of chromosomal aberrations in the mice from natural populations were compared with the spontaneous frequency of aberrations in intact, random-bred laboratory mice. The statistical analysis of the data was carried out using the one-factor analysis of variance method (Glotov, et al., 1982). The investigation results are presented in the table. Chromosomal Aberrations in House Mice in Samples from Natural Populations of the Vakhsh Valley A large proportion of the samples of the wild mice was taken in agricultural fields. The statistical analysis of the results obtained suggests a high level of chromosomal disorders in the majority of these. In 11 samples out of 13 the frequency of chromosomal aberrations was statistically significantly higher than in the control at a significance level of 0.001, and in one, at 0.01. The chromosomal disorders in mice inhabiting the zone of the influence of the industrial discharges of the TKP PA were investigated in greater detail. This association produces caustic soda, liquid chlorine, hydrogen chloride and fluoride, calcium hypochlorite powder, and chlorinated lime. Seven sample were studied in this region (Nos. 1-7). In only one of these did the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in the somatic cells not exceed the control value; in the remaining cases the number of chromosomal aberrations was statistically significantly higher than in the control sample. Six samples were taken south of the Yavan region. In five of these the frequency of chromosomal aberrations was significantly higher than in the control. The sewer effluents from the cotton fields are discharged into many oxbow lakes located on the lower courses of Vakhsh. The sewer waters contain pesticides which are found in the water, the bottom deposits, and aquatic and near-shore vegetation in large quantities. It is entirely probable that the high frequency of chromosomal aberrations in the mice of samples nos. 8-10 is the result of intense pollution of the near-shore biotopes with pesticides. The fish-protective measures at the Kuybyshev fish farm have evidently also been reflected to some degree in the aberrations in the mice living along the shores of ponds; it is lower than in other samples, but at the same time statistically significantly higher than the spontaneous level of aberrations in the control. The animals of samples Nos. 12 and 13 were trapped in cotton fields after a period of intensive chemical treatments. Therefore the high frequency of aberrations in the mice is entirely understandable. In this context, the low frequency of aberrations in sample No. 11, also taken in a cotton field, is somewhat unexpected. We were unable to establish the intensity of the chemical treatments of the latter. It is possible that the low frequency of aberrations is the consequence of the introduction in particular farms of integrated and biological methods of combating cotton pests. The low frequency of disorders in sample No. 11 is probably the result of its small size. We were unable to increase the size of this sample. The data we obtained suggest that the intensity of the mutational process is significantly increased in wild rodents at the existing level of chemical pollution of the Vakhsh valley. Chromosomal aberrations probably arise with similar intensity in the cells of other mammals. Extrapolating the information obtained to the human population of the Vakhsh valley, the existence of a real danger of an increase in hereditary diseases among the population must be hypothesized. These data once again underscore the necessity of conducting constant genetic monitoring, both of natural populations of plants and animals, and of human populations as well, in the cotton-sowing regions of the republic. iterature Cited Evans, H.
