FR940216-0-00070 FR940216-0-00010 To better optimize the test program for the particular fuel parameter being evaluated, the Administrator may approve a request to waive certain pollutant measurement requirements contained in this section. Any such waiver would have to be obtained in advance of vehicle testing. A request for such a waiver must include an adequate justification for the requested change, including the rationale for the request and supporting data and information. Such a request must justify the reason that measurement of certain pollutants clearly is not necessary, and identify those pollutants for which additional testing may be warranted. For example, a petition might note that reducing the concentration of a specific high molecular weight aromatic decreased VOC emissions even though the overall concentration of similar aromatics remained unchanged. The petitioner may be able to justify a reduced need for toxics measurement based on the results of other studies which show that toxics are proportional to total aromatics rather than to individual aromatics species. In exchange, additional testing may be justified for VOC emissions to enable a greater degree of statistical confidence in the test results. As a result, the fuel supplier may be able to present EPA with sufficient justification to warrant increased testing for VOC emissions and decreased testing for toxics emissions. 3. Exhaust and Nonexhaust Testing VOC and air toxics emissions occur in both exhaust and nonexhaust emissions. However, EPA believes that the relationship between fuel characteristics and nonexhaust emissions is known with greater certainty and precision than the relationship between fuel characteristics and exhaust emissions. Nonexhaust emissions are a much simpler phenomenon to model than exhaust emissions. Nonexhaust emissions are driven primarily by well-understood principles of physical chemistry and are modified by devices such as charcoal canisters that are relatively easily modeled. Exhaust emissions, by contrast, involve combustion and catalysis reactions that are not as well understood theoretically and are much more difficult to model. In addition, exhaust emissions are estimated directly from the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) utilizing the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, while nonexhaust emissions are estimated from both FTP and non-FTP test cycles in a complex process. Finally, data on nonexhaust emissions is much more extensive and internally consistent than data for exhaust emissions. For these reasons, EPA is restricting testing to augment the model to exhaust emission testing. Vehicle testing of nonexhaust emissions will not be accepted by EPA as the basis for augmentations to the nonexhaust emission model promulgated in today's rulemaking. EPA reserves the right to revise the nonexhaust emission model in the future to reflect new data acquired by the Agency, with such revisions taking effect after the start of Phase II of the program. In particular, either a new MOBILE model or ongoing research aimed at modeling nonexhaust emissions as a function of true vapor pressure over a range of temperatures may provide the basis for a revised nonexhaust model. The nonexhaust complex model being promulgated today relies on the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) to characterize fuels' nonexhaust emission characteristics. However, RVP is measured at a fixed fuel temperature (100 ○F), while nonexhaust emissions occur over a wide range of fuel temperatures (80 ○F to 130 ○F). Since different oxygenates alter the relationship between RVP and true vapor pressure at a given temperature to different extents, EPA believes that a model based on true vapor pressure would be more accurate for fuels containing oxygenates than a model based solely on RVP. By permitting nonexhaust emissions from a given fuel to be estimated only from models and exhaust emissions to be estimated based in part on vehicle testing, EPA believes that the accuracy of fuel emission estimates will be enhanced. EPA also believes that this restriction will focus testing resources on those emission effects which the model predicts with the least degree of certainty (i.e., exhaust emissions), thereby improving the degree of certainty of emission predictions over the long run.
