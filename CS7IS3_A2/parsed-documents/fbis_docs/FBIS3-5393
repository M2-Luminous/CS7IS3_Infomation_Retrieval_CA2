It is widely believed the labor leader has embarked on creating a political environment that is favorable to his plan to appeal to the need to re-examine the ratio of direct to indirect taxes and approve a consumption tax hike. At the same time, Yamagishi apparently hopes to be in control of the regrouping of political parties which is expected to occur soon. To do this, Yamagishi plans to guide the ruling coalition parties in their discussions toward resolving the tax system reform issue by year's end and to reinforce the influence of the Social Democratic Party of Japan within the ruling coalition alliance by urging the party, which has a strong "consumption tax allergy," to shift its policy in line with a more realistic approach. In a lecture at the Japan National Press Club on 24 February, Yamagishi said: "In the process of tax system reform, it will inevitably be necessary to re-examine the traditional ratio of direct to indirect taxes. The ratio of indirect taxes must be increased. Should a source of revenue become necessary, even after the government has reformed the tax system and cut back on its spending, then it will inevitably become necessary to raise the (consumption) tax rate." He thus indicated that he plans to approve consumption tax hikes in the future. Yamagishi has been noted to make such remarks occasionally. He plans to propose as early as in April a Rengo-version of the tax reform and social welfare vision which will embrace his new stance.
