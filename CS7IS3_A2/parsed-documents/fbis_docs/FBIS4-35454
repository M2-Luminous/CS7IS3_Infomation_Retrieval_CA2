The ambassador informed English radio that the number of pilgrims who died this year reached 829 people. The JANA Islamic affairs editor commented on the Saudi ambassador's statements by saying: It seems that Saudi Arabia is incapable of fully carrying out its duties toward the pilgrims who come to it each year from all over the world. This has become clear this year, when a large number of pilgrims have died, a matter that has been confirmed by numerous observers who travelled to the place in question. The editor said that what happened to the pilgrims this year makes it incumbent on the Islamic countries to bear their responsibilities in securing the safety of the pilgrims to the holy Kaaba and carry out their duties in full toward this issue that concern all Muslims, and not only Saudi Arabia. [passage omitted] The Islamic affairs editor concluded his comment by saying: What the Saudi ambassador has said raises a logical question: If Saudi Arabia was incapable of dealing with the situation of defending itself, how could it offer its services to the other Gulf countries in connection with offering protection to these countries in the face of foreign dangers, as it called them?
