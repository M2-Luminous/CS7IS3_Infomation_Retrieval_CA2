Inside Angola, though, it is war that is uppermost on the minds of Eduardo dos Santos' men, the only career they have been able to follow. For Menongue, here in Cuando Cubango Province, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] chief has ordered his troops to attack FAPLA's defense lines around Menongue. However, the courageous Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] have responded. According to a senior officer on the Menongue Front, the FALA forces will continue to defend their gains and force the MPLA-PT to understand that it is no more than a paper tiger and that it will not achieve anything through the force of arms. Dino Jorge, the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel correspondent in Menongue, reports: [Begin Jorge recording] In addition to targeting UNITA-controlled areas, the principal aim of that MPLA-PT offensive is to take Cuchi District. The enemy had advanced along three lines, with other units supporting them. It also enjoys cover from the FAPLA air force, which has been flying in from Lubango to bomb indiscriminately districts, communes, and villages. [end recording] On 25 March, the FAPLA forces tried to attack Cuchi District, but they were halted by the glorious FALA forces, who kept them under intense fire when they tried to cross Chitato River, along the road between Menongue and Cuelei. One hour of intense fire was enough to put Eduardo dos Santos' military adventurers on hasty flight, leaving 77 soldiers killed on the ground, including Major Americo, commander of the 2d Battalion of FAPLA's 15th Regiment. Our forces also captured assorted war materiel. Dino Jorge reports: [Begin Jorge recording] Our forces captured 28 weapons, including 21 AK rifles, four PKM submachine guns, three RPG-7 rocket launchers, six RPG-7 shells, 4,000 rounds of ammunition for AK weapons, 1,000 rounds of ammunition for PKM submachine guns, and assorted documentation. We will be back with more details. [end recording]
