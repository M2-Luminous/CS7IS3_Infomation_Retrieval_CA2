A politician who at one time was acting prime minister; a military commander who until last May headed the Georgian Ministry of Defense; a man who has also dabbled in both sculpture and painting. In Tbilisi, though, he is known as A GEORGIAN OF PRO-RUSSIAN ORIENTATION. In personal contact, Tengiz Kalistratovich is a very friendly, albeit reserved and laconic interlocutor. He saw me in a modest room in a small hotel located on a quiet Moscow street. [Mironov] What capacity do you have now? [Kitovani] I am merely a deputy to the Supreme Council of Georgia. [Mironov] What is the purpose of your visit to Moscow? [Kitovani] After the Abkhazian events I decided to get some rest. I went to Germany, and from there to Moscow--to see my friends, move away from political affairs, relax. [Mironov] What is your appraisal of the recent meeting between Yeltsin and Shevardnadze? [Kitovani] I have been waiting for this meeting for a long time. It should have taken place earlier--then perhaps we would not have had tragedy in Abkhazia and perhaps the entire country of Georgia as well. Two years have been wasted in this respect. A meeting should have taken place as soon as Shevardnadze came--or, to be precise, returned--to power in Georgia. Now it is a very belated step. With Georgia on its knees and out of the ruble zone, this rendezvous will at best result in a formal warming in Russian-Georgian relations. It is impossible to refute the fact that currently Tbilisi has suffered a complete defeat in the domestic political arena and at the world level. [Mironov] Are there prospects for a final and mutually acceptable settlement in the Georgian-Abkhazian issue? [Kitovani] Resolution of this problem depends to a very great extent on Russia and its policy regarding its southern neighbor. The search for a solution to the problem should have been conducted not in Geneva but in Moscow, within the framework of a trilateral dialogue. I am afraid that Abkhazia is irretrievably lost for Tbilisi. But this is only half the trouble--next is the problem of the Tskhinvali region. [Mironov] Mr. Kitovani, what is your opinion of the Georgian leader's policy? [Kitovani] In his two years of rule Shevardnadze has made a great many mistakes. However, the roots of the fault lie in the period when he was still a party boss. This is when active steps should have been taken toward resolving overdue problems regarding both the Abkhazian and the Ossetian people. That is, these issues have been awaiting settlement for a long time--way back under the communist regime headed by Shevardnadze. The current Georgian leader is called a reformer, although no reforms came about during his time. His policy remains the same as it was when the USSR existed. In principle, it has not changed. Shevardnadze, in particular, maintains that he has become a Christian and has forsaken communist ideas. In reality, however, he remains the same communist he has been for a long time. A man who for 60 years believed in communist ideals and principles cannot suddenly change his mentality. [Mironov] Where do you see Georgia's political priorities at this difficult stage of its development? [Kitovani] Historical experience shows that Georgia as a Christian state always gravitated to Byzantium. After the disintegration of the Byzantine empire the banner of Orthodox faith was picked up by Russia. I think that instead of looking toward West Europe and the United States, Shevardnadze should have oriented himself toward Russia and walked in step with its political course. I myself have always believed in this, and therefore in Georgia I am frequently accused of being a man of pro-Russian orientation. But it is not accidental that our ancestors believed it necessary to maintain friendly relations with the Russian people. This is the policy Georgia should have conducted--seeing Russia as the main ally and friend of Georgia. [Mironov] Whom do you respect in the Georgian political establishment? [Kitovani] I very much like my namesake Tengiz Sigua. In my opinion he is a very smart economist and politician. [Mironov] And in Russia? [Kitovani] In response to this I can only express my deepest regret that Yegor Gaydar has left the Russian political scene for now.
