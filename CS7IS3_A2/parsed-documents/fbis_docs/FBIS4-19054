With his statement that he intends to continue the government alliance with the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] in Bonn after 16 October, he has given his party the chance to carry out an election campaign on its own behalf. Without constantly having to answer questions regarding the loyalty to the coalition, the FDP can now clearly and plainly express its position. Thus, Kinkel has stood up mainly to the critics from within his own camp, who have more than once requested a strong image for the party -- and quite rightly so, by the way. After all, the FDP has lost its traditional role as being the only party that can create a majority with another one. The outlines of what the FDP's new "public relations work" can look like became clear yesterday with the request that the solidarity surcharge be reexamined after three years. The rejection of a higher gasoline tax is also a move to create a distance from the CDU/CSU. The FDP's basically positive account also creates a challenge for the CDU/CSU. It is in the areas of economic and fiscal policy, in particular, where the junior partner will try to distinguish itself against its senior. Apart from the fact that the FDP has on principle defined the course for the continuation of the government alliance, the coalition statement has not yet been expressly formulated. And nobody must forget that it is intended to be an election statement "with conditions." Yesterday Kinkel said that those who want to prevent a coalition between the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and the Greens or a grand coalition now must vote for the FDP. He did not say anything about an SPD-FDP coalition.
