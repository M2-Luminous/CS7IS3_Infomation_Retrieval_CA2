Hata also indicated at a press conference after an extraordinary cabinet meeting, where the eight-month-old cabinet of prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned, that the changes in the new cabinet will be small to middle-scale. Hata said that "in general," it is better to have heads of coalition parties in the cabinet to reflect the parties' opinions, indicating he may ask Murayama to join the cabinet. There were six SDP cabinet ministers in the Hosokawa government but Murayama did not hold any cabinet post. Hata, who was also deputy premier in the Hosokawa administration, said that in principle, it is desirable for the ministers who helped compiled the fiscal 1994 budget bill to remain in the cabinet and respond to upcoming Diet interpellations on the budget. Reviewing his eight-month-long tenure as foreign minister, Hata said he felt the world expected Japan to speak up more on the international scene. Japan could make various proposals on problems such as population, environment, AIDS, disarmament and arms control, he said. Hata also said foreign ministers should not change so often and that he regrets he was only able to hold the post for eight months. He also said Japan should push ahead with deregulation.
