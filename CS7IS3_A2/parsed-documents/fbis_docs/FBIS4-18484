What do the Irish Republican Army [IRA] and Sinn Fein want to achieve with the limited cease-fire agreement? [Adams] The IRA initiative is basically an attempt to create room and to achieve a breakthrough. The point is clarification for Sinn Fein on the part of the British Government. [sentence as heard] Yet, when the Downing Street Declaration was published we did not get that clarification that we should have been given, and which everybody else received. [Christiansen] You have said that you want clarification. Are you not seeking direct negotiations with London? [Adams] No, no, we are currently not seeking negotiations, even though one day we will. All parties involved in this process wanted a negotiated peaceful settlement, but only later. At the moment our point is to have the British Government involve Sinn Fein and accept the legitimacy of our electorate and answers those questions that we would like to see answered. [Christiansen] Could the second step now not also lie in the IRA's commitment to non-aggression? After all, then the British Government would sit down at the negotiating table with you. [Adams] This is a question for the IRA. I am talking on behalf of Sinn Fein. The peace process must get started. We must not accept a standstill as a result of difficulties that John Major happens to have regarding his relations with the Unionists and his own right wing. At the same time, we must understand that he is a weakened prime minister, and that this is his reality. The worth of the IRA initiative is that it creates certain room, and that if John Major would like to achieve some progress on this issue that he could do so on this basis. [Christiansen] Mr. Adams, what will happen once the cease-fire expires if -- as signals from London indicate -- there will not be a positive reaction from there? [Adams] I assume that the British Army will continue its activities, and the same applies to the other side. The point is to give a very clear signal to the British. This signal will not be lost despite all gut reactions from Downing Street. The eminent advisers have certainly realized how significant this IRA attempt to show flexibility is. [Christiansen] Thank you very much.
