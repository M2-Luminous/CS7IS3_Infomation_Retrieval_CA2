He told a press conference at the White House this afternoon that it is "a decision of great moment for this country." It involves not only economic interests and human rights, but "enormous national security interests and international security considerations for a long time to come," he said. He refused to talk about the on-going discussions with China, saying that "anything I say about them until we have concluded them would be inappropriate." Clinton has until June 3 to decide whether to extend China's MFN for another year. In the past few years, opposition to unconditional renewal came mainly from the Democrats-dominated U.S. Congress. However, the mood has shifted dramatically this year. More and more lawmakers have come out in favor of separating trade from human rights issues. On Tuesday, 106 members of the House of Representatives, Republicans and Democrats, urged Clinton in a letter to renew China's MFN without conditions and set up a bilateral commission to deal with human rights issues as an alternative to the annual confrontation over MFN renewal. And on Wednesday, U.S. House Speaker Thomas Foley declared his support for not linking human rights with MFN. He said withdrawal of MFN for China would be self-defeating in advancing human rights. Senator Bill Bradley (D) told the Senate on Wednesday [18 May] that the link between human rights and China's trade status reflected "Cold War old-thinking" that had no place in a future U.S.-Chinese relationship. "A decision to revoke or continue to condition China's MFN status would be a blunder of historic proportions," he said. Senator Max Baucus (D) reiterated his opposition to MFN conditions, which he described as "the economic equivalent of a nuclear bomb." "We risk a Cold War with the biggest country in the world. It would be folly," he warned. Baucus also dismissed as unworkable the so-called "half measures" such as limited sanctions or partial withdrawal of MFN on certain categories of products entering the U.S. from China. It was reported that supporters of MFN conditions like Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell and Representative Nancy Pelosy are preparing legislation to place some sanctions on China if its MFN is retained.
