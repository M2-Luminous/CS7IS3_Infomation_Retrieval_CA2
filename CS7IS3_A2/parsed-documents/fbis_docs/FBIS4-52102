FBIS4-52102 "dreas088_d_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 South Korea Seoul, Japan Agree on `Information Superhighway' Seoul, Japan Agree on `Information Superhighway' SK0605084494 Seoul YONHAP in English 0659 GMT 6 May 94 SK0605084494 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Communications Minister Yun Tong-yun and his Japanese counterpart Hikasa Katsuyuki agreed Friday to establish a policy coordination committee to help construct an "Information Superhighway" linking the two countries, the Communications Ministry said. The two ministers also agreed to hold seminars on building an information superhighway and to exchange ministry officials to boost bilateral cooperation on the project. The agreements were reached during a meeting of the two ministers, the first of its kind, which South Korean President Kim Yong-sam and former Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had pledged to hold during a summit meeting last March. In a joint statement after the meeting, the two ministers stressed that the information and communications industry will supply the core technology which will decide national competitiveness in the 21st century and that building information infrastructure through cooperation between Seoul and Tokyo will contribute to the development of the world economy, culture and living standards. The ministers also said they had agreed to discuss further the possibility of allowing businesses from one country to participate in information infrastructure projects in the other, the development of communications satellites and the use of frequency resources. According to officials of the Communications Ministry who attended the meeting, the Korean side outlined Seoul's information superhighway projects including organizing and financing plans. The Japanese also explained plans to organize and finance such projects, the officials said. They introduced a model project in which the information superhighway network will be installed in the western Kansai region ahead of other regions. During the meeting, the Japanese proposed the establishment of the Asia Information Infrastructure (AII) to compete with the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) planned by the United States, the officials said. The Seoul side opposed the idea, however, citing the need to move gradually because the GII project remains in the planning stage and the AII project requires cooperation from China and Southeast Asian countries. The proposed policy coordination committee on the information superhighway consists of bureau-director-level officials from the two ministries who will co-chair committee meetings, officials from Korea Telecom, Korea Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, several other communications technology institutes and academics from both countries, according to the ministry officials. Katsuyuki, who arrived here Thursday at the invitation of South Korean Communications Minister Yun, is scheduled to fly back to Tokyo Saturday afternoon after winding up his three-day visit, the officials said.
