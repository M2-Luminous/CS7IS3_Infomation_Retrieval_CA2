In his reply, the Greek prime minister gave assurances that he will spare no effort in supporting the request of the Armenian Government, but at the same time he expressed the following view: Considering that most of the EU countries are concerned about safety in connection with the Armenian nuclear plant, Armenia needs to completely convince the international community that the opening of the nuclear plant will in no way pose a danger. I want to reiterate the Greek Government's determination to actively contribute to your country's economic reforms and democratic processes to which you and the friendly Armenian people remain dedicated, wrote Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou at the end of his letter.
