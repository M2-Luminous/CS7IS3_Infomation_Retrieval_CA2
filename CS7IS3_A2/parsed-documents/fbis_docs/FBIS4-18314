The move reflected progress made towards a negotiated settlement of the conflict, said a spokesman. It also underlined the Government's commitment to humanitarian aid as life returns to normal in the city after the UN-brokered peace. Britain first established diplomatic relations with Bosnia in April 1992, but the security situation was not thought safe enough until now to consider opening an embassy. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has appointed Robert Barnett as charge d'affaires at Sarajevo. He will take up his post next month. Mr. Barnett will initally work alone at the embassy but will be supported by British aid officials in the area and diplomats in Zagreb. Married with two sons, he was previously assistant head of the Eastern Adriatic Unit at the FO.
