ACTION: Notice of Proposed Information Collection Requests. SUMMARY: The Acting Director, Information Resources Management Service, invites comments on proposed information collection requests as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Dates: An expedited review has been requested in accordance with the Act, since allowing for the normal review period would adversely affect the public interest. Approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has been requested by October 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Attention: Dan Chenok, Desk Officer, Department of Education, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street NW., Room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Requests for copies of the proposed information collection request should be addressed to Patrick J.

Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 3517 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 3517) requires that the Director of OMB provide interested Federal agencies and persons an early opportunity to comment on information collection requests. OMB may amend or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation in the approval process would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State or Federal law, or substantially interfere with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations. The Act Director, Information Resources Management Service, publishes this notice with the attached proposed information collection request prior to submission of this request to OMB. This notice contains the following information: (1) Type of review requested, e.g., expedited; (2) Title; (3) Abstract; (4) Additional Information; (5) Frequency of collection; (6) Affected public; and (7) Reporting and/or Recordkeeping burden. Because an expedited review is requested, a description of the information to be collected is also included as an attachment to this notice. Dated: September 29, 1994. Ingrid Kolb, Acting Director, Information Resources Management Service. Office of Postsecondary Education Type of Review: Expedited. Title: Request for Designation as an Eligible Institution Under the Urban Community Service Program. Abstract: This information is needed to designate eligible institutions separately from the solicitation of grants under this program. In this way, institutions can be informed of their eligibility to participate in the program prior to undertaking the burden of developing a grant application. Also, the Secretary identifies those institutions that are eligible to join the legislatively mandated network of ``urban grant institutions''. Additional Information: ED is requesting, from OMB, an expedited review and approval by October 31, 1994. An expedited review is requested because ED will need time to conduct this review in addition to its review of project applications in FY 1995. It is estimated, based on calls of inquiry received by the Department, that as many as 500 eligibility applications may be submitted. The Department will need time to process these applications and notify respondents of the results before undertaking the grant solicitation process. In addition, grant applicants will need adequate time to prepare their proposals after being informed of their eligibility. If sufficient time is not allowed, the Department will not be able to conduct both reviews effectively and the Secretary's statutory obligation to publish a list of urban grant institutions will be further delayed. Frequency: Annually. Affected Public: Non-profit institutions. Reporting Burden: Responses: 500. Burden Hours: 5,500. Recordkeeping Burden: Recordkeepers: 0. Burden Hours: 0. Office of Postsecondary Education Type of Review: Expedited. Title: Income Contingent Repayment Plan Consent to Disclosure of Tax Information. Abstract: The Student Loan Reform Act of 1993 (P.L. 103&hyph;66) authorized the Federal Direct Student Loan (Direct Loan) Program to make loans beginning July 1, 1994. On July 1, 1994 the regulations implementing the Income Contingent Repayment Plan, as a repayment option under the Direct Loan Program, was published in the Federal Register . In order to participate in the Income Contingent Repayment Plan, a borrower must give written consent for the Internal Revenue Service to disclose certain tax information to the Department of Education. The Consent to Disclosure to Tax Information (consent to disclosure form) will provide that consent. Additional Information : ED is requesting, from OBM, an expedited review and approval by October 31, 1994. An expedited review is requested because the consent to disclosure from must be available in order for these borrowers to choose to repay under the Income Contingent Repayment Plan. Having the consent to disclosure form approved by October 31 will allow the Servicer to pre-print forms for borrowers and allow borrowers to participate in the Income Contingent Repayment Plan which is an important feature of the President's initiative to implement the Direct Loan Program. Frequency : One time. Affected Public : Individuals or households. Reporting Burden: Responses : 12,350. Burdent Hours : 2,470. Responses : 0. Burdent Hours : 0.
