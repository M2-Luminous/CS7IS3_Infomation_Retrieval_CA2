Yi Chung-kuk said that currently North Korea has facilities that produce biochemical weapons and storage bases under the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces in various places. He also exposed that the chemical weapons are the most poisonous in the world. He said he heard on several occasions beginning in 1991 from high-ranking military cadres and his senior officers that North Korea has already completed nuclear weapons development. When North Korea was receiving a special [tukpyol] inspection in March 1993 from the International Atomic Energy Agency, he said he heard from his senior officer that it will be of no use to inspect Yongbyon because nuclear weapons are being produced at another place.
