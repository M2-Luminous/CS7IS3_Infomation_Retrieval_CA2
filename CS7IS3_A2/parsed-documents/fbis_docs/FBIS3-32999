As the new Workers Parliament Assemblies (approximately 80,000 meetings in which workers study ways to reduce expenses, increase income, achieve profitability, and mend finances) are being held, the editorial writes, the workers who attend them learn about terms such as efficiency, economy, and effectiveness. The editorial encourages workers not to look for macroeconomic solutions to national problems at those meetings, rather, to concentrate on the internal problems of each center, because this will allow for the reinstatement of the centers' productive capabilities and the achievement of optimal development. "We need to produce more of everything with current resources to be able to produce the many products we lack," the article writes, adding it is vital for workers to concentrate on how to reduce costs, to take advantage of production potentials, to make the best use of raw materials, and to obtain quality products and services." It is a matter of achieving economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in all business and budgeted activities, be it in the production of products or in services, it adds. The Workers Parliament Assemblies are enhancing the country's true potential to overcome the severe economic crisis that developed after the downfall of the socialist bloc and the intensification of the U.S. blockade, the editorial stresses. After attending those assemblies, Cubans know the significance of budgets, costs, subsidies, profitability, excessive circulation, income, expenses, prices, taxes, losses, and profits to the island's future. Thus, the assemblies are an excellent education mechanism for the union movement, it comments. The Cuban economy is showing a growing gap between the monetary liquidity in the hands of the population and the offer of goods and services, and that is why we need to decrease substantially the budget deficit, the editorial emphasizes.
