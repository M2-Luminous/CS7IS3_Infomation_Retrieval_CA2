FR941117-0-00038 FR941117-0-00009 NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION 48 CFR Part 1871 Modification of Test of MidRange Procurement Procedures AGENCY: Office of Procurement, NASA. ACTION: Temporary rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Federal Procurement Policy approved a test of NASA's MidRange Procurement Procedures in 1993. This modification of the procedures is a result of OFPP's approval to expand the test to all NASA centers and addresses other editorial and substantive changes. EFFECTIVE DATES: This regulation is effective November 17, 1994, and expires June 30, 1997. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. T. Deback, (202) 358&hyph;0431. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The MidRange Procurement Procedures were published in 58 FR 54300, October 21, 1993. Comments on the test procedure had been requested in 57 FR 57845, December 7, 1992. The following substantive changes are being made to the MidRange Procurement Procedures: (1) Authority to utilize these procedures at all NASA centers is provided, (2) construction and A&E contracts may now be done under MidRange, (3) the Best Value Selection procedures have been simplified to limit the value characteristics, and (4) the Electronic Bulletin Board aspects of MidRange have been clarified since we will be using Internet in lieu of a separate bulletin board. The use of the Electronic Bulletin Board was approved as part of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act. NASA is in the process of developing the Bulletin Board and will provide industry notice of its use through the Commerce Business Daily. NASA will continue publishing synopses in the Commerce Business Daily until that notice is provided. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 1871 Government Procurement. Thomas S.
