ANC representative in Zambia Japhet Ndhlovu confirmed on Thursday [14 April] that his organisation had requested the training, but the plan could not be implemented immediately because it had not been budgeted for in the 1993 year. ANC President Nelson Mandela had formally made the request when he last visited Zambia in 1992. Confirming the plan, Zambian Government spokesman Kelly Walubita said: "That is a bilateral issue and will be implemented this year."
