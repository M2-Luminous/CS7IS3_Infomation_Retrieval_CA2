FR940429-0-00028 FR940429-0-00009 (b) Purpose. (1) The program under this part provides for minimal supportive services to the frail elderly, persons with disabilities and temporarily disabled individuals as a means of preventing unnecessary institutionalization and encouraging deinstitutionalization. The program also provides management with the capacity to assess the service needs of eligible residents and to locate and arrange for the delivery of community based supportive services. The program is implemented in a manner that both respects the dignity of the participants and encourages their independence. The provision of supportive services allows for a continuum of care on a long term basis and offers another option in supportive living arrangements. The program functions as an active proponent of community based care and affords an opportunity for housing projects to become an additional source for supportive service delivery in the local area. (2) The program is additionally designed to: (i) Improve the quality of life of older Americans living in federally assisted housing; (ii) Preserve the viability of existing affordable housing projects for low income older residents who are aging in place by assisting managers of housing with the difficulties and challenges created by serving older residents; (iii) Develop partnerships between the Federal Government and State governments in providing services to the frail elderly and persons with disabilities and the temporarily disabled, and (iv) Utilize Federal and State funds in a more cost-effective and humane way in serving the needs of older adults. (c) Applicability. This part applies to: (1) Public housing as that term is defined in section 3(b) of the United States Housing Act of 1937; (2) Low income housing developed or operated under a contract between the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and an Indian housing authority under title II of the United States Housing Act of 1937; (3) Housing assisted under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 with a contract that is attached to the structure under section 8(d)(2) or with new construction or substantial rehabilitation of the structure under section 8(b)(2), as that section existed before October 1, 1983; (4) Housing assisted under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959; (5) Housing assisted under section 221(d) or 236 of the National Housing Act, with respect to which the owner has made a binding commitment to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development not to prepay the mortgage or terminate the insurance contract under section 229 of the National Housing Act (unless the binding commitments have been made to extend the low-income use restriction relating to the housing); (6) Housing assisted under section 514 or 515 of the Housing Act of 1949, with respect to which the owner has made a binding commitment to the Secretary of Agriculture not to prepay or refinance the mortgage (unless the binding commitments have been made to extend the low income use restrictions relating to the housing for not less than the 20-year period under section 502(c)(4) of the Housing Act of 1949); and (7) Housing assisted under section 516 of the Housing Act of 1949. ยง XXX .105 Definitions. As used in this part_ Act means section 802 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act. Activity of Daily Living (ADL) means an activity regularly necessary for personal care and includes eating (may need assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food, but must be able to feed self); dressing (must be able to dress self, but may need occasional assistance); bathing (may need assistance in getting in and out of the shower or tub, but must be able to wash self; grooming (may need assistance in washing hair, but must be able to take care of personal appearance); getting in and out of bed and chairs, walking, going outdoors, using the toilet; and household management activities (may need assistance in doing housework, grocery shopping or laundry, or getting to and from one location to another for activities such as going to the doctor and shopping, but must be mobile. The mobility requirement does not exclude persons in wheelchairs or those requiring mobility devices). Each of the Activities of Daily Living noted above includes a requirement that a person must be deficient in his or her ability to perform at a specified minimal level (e.g., to satisfy the eating ADL, the person must be able to feed him/herself). The determination of whether a person is deficient in this minimal level of performance must include consideration of those services that will be performed by a person's spouse, relatives or other attendants to be provided by the individual. For example, if a person requires assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food plus assistance in feeding him/herself, the individual would meet the minimal performance level and thus satisfy the eating ADL, if a spouse, relative or attendant provides assistance with feeding the person. Should such assistance become unavailable at any time, the Owner is not obligated at any time to provide individualized services beyond those offered to the resident population in general. The Activities of Daily Living analysis is relevant only with regard to determination of a person's eligibility to receive supportive services paid for by CHSP and is not a determination of eligibility for occupancy. Adjusted income means adjusted income as defined in 24 CFR part 813 or 913.
