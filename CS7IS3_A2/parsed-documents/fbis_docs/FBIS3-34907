He said that that "falls under the powers of the court, to which all publication issues are referred." Expressing his eagerness not to disturb relations between Kuwait and Arab states by publishing reports insulting them, Shaykh Sa'ud al-Sabah, who is visiting London today, said: "Just as we do not accept the publication of articles or topics insulting Kuwait and its people, it is natural for us to appreciate the position of the states which are not satisfied with what our newspapers are publishing about them." Shaykh Sa'id, who was Kuwait's ambassador to London and Washington before his appointment as information minister in the current Kuwaiti Government, said that "the Gulf region is experiencing critical conditions caused by the Iraqi regime." He stressed "the need to reorganize our Gulf priorities and seek to unite the Gulf Cooperation Council states, including the military strategy." Speaking about Iran's role, the Kuwaiti information minister said that Iran is one of the states which should "join us in safeguarding Gulf security and stability." Shaykh Sa'ud stressed that "we are thinking about the region's conditions now but are working and planning for posterity." He emphasized that "Kuwait is ready for all possibilities that may arise from a change of conditions in Iraq and the downfall of Saddam Husayn's regime."
