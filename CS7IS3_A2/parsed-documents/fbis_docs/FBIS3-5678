Stevens is the lone parliamentarian of the Nagriamel peasant movement which was started by his father. Government spokesperson Yvette Sam told AFP it was "highly probable" that Stevens could be offered one of the two parliamentary posts currently vacant, either deputy speaker of parliament or leader of government business. The government received a letter Wednesday from Stevens which said he wanted to join the government's side, Following Stevens' defection from the opposition, the governing coalition led by the Union of Moderate Parties (UMP), controls 25 of the 46 seats in parliament. In May 1979, only two months before Vanuatu became independent, Jimmy Stevens -- who died on February 28 -- launched a secessionist movement in Espiritu Santo island which was eventually put down with the aid of Papua New Guinea forces. When the UMP was originally formed more than 20 years ago, the Nagriamel movement was one of its member parties.
