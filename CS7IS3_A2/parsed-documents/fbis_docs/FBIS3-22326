This deadline was subsequently put back to 10 October that same year. The plant continues to operate and to add to the gigantic mounds of radioactive waste.... Since after the collapse of the USSR the plant was left as the only one of its kind in Russia, they are thinking about expanding production. Three years ago, having learned of the situation at the plant, specialists from Gossanepidnadzor and environmental protection departments were dispatched there. They were horrified by the picture that emerged -- with natural background radiation of 15-18 microroentgen per hour, in some parts workplaces were "polluted" to the level of up to 500-700 microroentgen per hour, and radiation from the thousands of tonnes of actual waste reached 1500 microroentgen per hour -- and the defenders of people's health and the environment sounded the alarm. Certain measures were taken immediately. Decontamination procedures were carried out at workplaces and on parts of the plant territory, showers were installed, and constant radiological monitoring was set up. But all this failed to attack the root problems. So in the end the chief medic at the Kray Gossanepidnadzor Center submitted a decree on closing the plant down.... We stood with Vitaliy Tereshchenko, the enterprise's chief engineer and expert physicist from the Kray Gossanepidnadzor Center Department of Radiological Hygiene, at the edge of the compound where the plant has started to store sacks full of waste -- for dispatch to Rostov-Na-Donu, to "Radon," the nearest specialist combine. Some 4,000 sacks have already been filled here, but the work has been "in vain" -- "Radon" has refused to accept even a portion of the waste. Further into the compound the waste has been neatly placed in sacks, while nearer to us it has just been dumped willy-nilly. Screw nozzles, on which a white salt containing radioactive substances is visible, are like snakes "guarding" the approaches. V. Tereshchenko moves an instrument toward the "snakes." It's really bad -- over 800 microroentgen per hour. The sand a couple of meters from the compound is also very "dirty" -- 575 microroentgen per hour. Nearby there is a kind of lake into which water is dumped after the production cycle. At the bottom are thousands of tonnes of radioactive sediment. Some of the water leaks onto the flats. The radiometric device indicates that the water packs a "punch" of 70 microroentgen per hour. "We have already drawn up several options for setting up controlled waste burial sites on the territory of the plant itself," Oleg Anisimov, deputy chief project engineer of the Russian Federation Atomic Energy Ministry All-Russia Planning and Design Research and Technological Association, says. As it turns out, setting up a burial site on the plant's territory would take around two years and cost roughly 1 billion rubles. The buried waste will remain radioactive for approximately 1.5 million years. So would we not thereby be planting a kind of "ecological time bomb"? Plant Director Valeriy Kaygorodov claims that workers at the enterprise have not suffered any particular illness in all these years. However, when the conversation turn to the fact that even world science has made little study of the effects on the human body not of huge but of low doses of radiation, they fall silent and appeal to other experts, saying: We are merely technicians.
