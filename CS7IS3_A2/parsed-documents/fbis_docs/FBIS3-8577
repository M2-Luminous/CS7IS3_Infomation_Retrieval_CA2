"I will accept the Sejm's decision with full understanding and respect, and with the hope that the tribunal will be impartial, honest and just," said the general who introduced martial law in Poland on 13 December, 1981 after 16 months of a political showdown between the solidarity trade union and the communist authorities. Today's session of the Sejm Committee for Constitutional Accountability was the first in a series of sessions during which Jaruzelski and other former politicians accused of implementing martial law will answer questions from MP's.
