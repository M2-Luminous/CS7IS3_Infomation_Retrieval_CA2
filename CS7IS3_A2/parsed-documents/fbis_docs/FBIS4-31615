[passage omitted] Since early this morning the members of Abdic's rebel paramilitary have been shelling the areas of Pecigrad, Skokovi, Todorovo, Golubovici, (Pljanici), and (Krivaja). They have attempted several infantry breakthroughs, thus proving that their warmongers are not giving up on further conflicts regardless of the means and human cost. Since yesterday they have destroyed dozens of houses and inflicted several casualties. This is why they obviously do not want to carry out the agreed exchange of the bodies of killed soldiers. Karadzic's chetniks have been abundantly helping out the Kladusa paramilitary as they have been firing with antiaircraft weapons and small arms throughout the night and this morning on the (Bihac) and Bosanska Krupa fronts. They have also intensified their activities on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau. Our defenders have not been responding to these attacks in compliance with the arranged cease-fire.
