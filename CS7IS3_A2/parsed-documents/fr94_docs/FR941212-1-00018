FR941212-1-00018 FR941212-1-00011 San Francisco Bay RNA The proposed San Francisco Bay RNA will consist of the water area in the Golden Gate east of the COLREGS Demarcation Line (33 CFR 80.1142), the Central Bay including Raccoon Strait, and the existing charted precautionary area east of Alcatraz Island. Because of the large number of vessels entering and departing San Francisco Bay, traffic lanes will be established in the Golden Gate and the Central Bay to separate opposing traffic and reduce vessel congestion. The proposed lanes are located where voluntary traffic lanes now exist. Use of these lanes and adherence to the indicated direction of travel will be required for vessels of 1600 or more gross tons, or tugs with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons, and recommended for all other vessels. Due to the presence of shoals and rocks in the Central Bay, the Central Bay Two-way Deep Water Traffic Lane (DWTL), located north of Harding Rock, provides the best water depth safety margin for inbound vessels with a draft of 45 feet or greater, and for outbound vessels with a draft of 28 feet or greater. These deep draft vessels will be required to use the DWTL. It is recommended that all other vessels use the Central Bay Traffic Lanes so that vessel traffic in the DWTL is kept to a minimum. The DWTL is sufficiently narrow that meeting, crossing and overtaking restrictions are necessary to reduce the likelihood of collision. The regulation provides that a power-driven vessel of 1600 or more gross tons, or a tug with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons, shall not enter the DWTL when another power-driven vessel of 1600 or more gross tons, or tug with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons, is navigating therein when either vessel is carrying certain dangerous cargo (as defined in 33 CFR 160.203), or bulk petroleum products, or is a tank vessel in ballast, if such entry could result in meeting, crossing or overtaking the other vessel. Since vessels are converging or crossing in such a manner that one-way traffic flow patterns, although desired, cannot be established, two precautionary areas will be established in this RNA. They are: (1) The Golden Gate Precautionary Area, which encompasses the waters around the Golden Gate Bridge between the Golden Gate and the Central Traffic Lanes; and (2) the Central Bay Precautionary Area, which encompasses the large portion of the Central Bay and part of the Lower Bay. It is recommended that all vessels navigating in these precautionary areas be aware of the joining traffic lanes and DWTL so as to anticipate the movements of other vessels. North Ship Channel RNA and San Pablo Strait Channel RNA The North Ship Channel and San Pablo Strait Channel consist of the existing charted channels and delineate the only areas where the depths of water are sufficient to allow the safe transit of vessels of 1600 or more gross tons, or a tug with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons. The existence of strong tidal currents in these channels severely restrict the ability of vessels of 1600 or more gross tons, or a tug with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons, to safely maneuver to avoid smaller vessels. These conditions create the need to apply the general regulations to these areas. Implementation of special regulations in these RNAs would have only a minimal impact on safety and is not justified at this time. Pinole Shoal Channel RNA The Pinole Shoal Channel RNA is a constricted waterway the use of which is currently restricted to vessels with a draft greater than 20 feet, or towboats with tows drawing more than 20 feet, as set forth in 33 CFR 162.205(a). Because of the narrow width of the channel and the draft of vessels using the channel, further meeting, crossing and overtaking restrictions are necessary to reduce the likelihood of collision. The proposed regulation provides that a power-driven vessel of 1600 or more gross tons, or a tug with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons, shall not enter the Pinole Shoal Channel RNA, which extends from approximately Light 7 to Light 13 of the Pinole Shoal Channel, when another power-driven vessel of 1600 or more gross tons, or tug with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons, is navigating therein when either vessel is carrying certain dangerous cargo (as defined in 33 CFR 160.203) or bulk petroleum products, or is a tank vessel in ballast, if such entry would result in meeting, crossing or overtaking the other vessel. Southern Pacific Railroad Bridge RNA The Southern Pacific Railroad Bridge RNA consists of a small circular area, 200 yards in radius, centered on the middle of the channel under the Southern Pacific Railroad bridge. The limited horizontal clearance results in a greater chance of vessel allisions with the bridge. This risk of allision is significantly increased when poor visibility conditions exist. The regulation will preclude a power-driven vessel of 1600 or more gross tons, or a tug with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons, from transiting the Southern Pacific Railroad Bridge RNA when visibility is less than 1000 yards. Southampton Shoal/Richmond Harbor RNA Southampton Shoal/Richmond Harbor RNA encompasses Southampton Shoal Channel, the Richmond Long Wharf Maneuvering Area, the Richmond Harbor Entrance Channel and Point Potrero Reach. These are dredged channels and areas within which maneuvering room is severely limited. Close-quarters situations between deep-draft vessels in these channels need to be eliminated to reduce the risk of groundings and collisions. In addition, the Southampton Shoal Channel is transited by a high number of laden tank vessels and vessels carrying certain dangerous cargo (as defined in 33 CFR 160.203), or bulk petroleum. Because of the potential for loss of life or serious environmental consequences in a collision involving one or more of these vessels, control of traffic flow is necessary. The Richmond Long Wharf Maneuvering Area, between the Richmond Harbor Entrance Channel and Southampton Shoal Channel, often has vessels operating at low speeds where maneuverability is restricted. The regulation will preclude vessels of 1600 or more gross tons, or tugs with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons, from entering the RNA if meeting, crossing or overtaking another vessel of 1600 or more gross tons, or a tug with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons, could result. Oakland Harbor RNA The Oakland Harbor RNA encompasses the Oakland Bar Channel, Oakland Outer Harbor Entrance, Middle Harbor and Inner Harbor Entrance Channels. The currently charted Limited Traffic Area (LTA), which recommends that vessels of 300 or more gross tons transit at one time to avoid crossing or meeting situations, will be replaced by the Oakland Harbor RNA. The northern boundary of the Oakland Harbor RNA differs slightly from the LTA in that it follows the northern boundary of the Oakland Bar and Outer Harbor Entrance channels and extends to the ``E'' tower of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. This proposed regulation will restrict vessels of 1600 or more gross tons, or tugs with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons, from entering the RNA if meeting, crossing or overtaking another vessel of 1600 or more gross tons, or a tug with a tow of 1600 or more gross tons, could result.
