FBIS4-26701 "drchi123_v_94010" FBIS-CHI-94-123 Daily Report 25 Jun 1994 TAIWAN Four Taiwan Drug Traffickers Executed on Mainland Four Taiwan Drug Traffickers Executed on Mainland OW2606144994 Taipei China Broadcasting Corporation News Network in Mandarin 2300 GMT 25 Jun 94 OW2606144994 Taipei China Broadcasting Corporation News Network Mandarin BFN [From the "Hookup" program] [Text] Lu Yu-chun, director-general of the National Police Administration, yesterday [25 June] said: The Chinese Communists executed four Taiwan nationals on charges of drug smuggling, but the Chinese Communists have not informed Taiwan's police of the arrests, investigations, trials, or executions of the four persons. The National Police Administration currently has no way of knowing how many, if any, Taiwan nationals are still being detained by the Chinese Communists for involvement in drug cases. Lu Yu-chun added: Because talks concerning criminals between the two sides have not yielded practical results, and because of the lack of established procedures, the two sides currently still follow precedents in repatriating criminals. Because no felony criminals from the mainland are currently in Taiwan or are being detained by Taiwan's police, the Chinese Communists are not likely to inform us of the number of Taiwan nationals currently detained by them. The Chinese Communists did not inform us before executing the four Taiwan nationals on drug smuggling charges, and we do not know if there are any Taiwan nationals currently being detained by them on drug smuggling charges. Responding to a report by Chinese Communist official media about the execution of four Taiwan nationals yesterday in Xiamen for drug trafficking, Lin Kui-mei, head of the legal service department of the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF], said: There has been more than one case in which Taiwan residents were executed on the mainland for committing crimes but we have never been officially informed. We learned of those cases through media reports or after people asked us for assistance. The Chinese Communists have judicial rights to punish Taiwan residents committing offenses on the mainland. The SEF has been told that some Taiwan residents were executed on the mainland for drug trafficking or for counterfeiting renminbi. An official of the Mainland Affairs Committee said the Chinese Communists should inform us through the SEF of any Taiwan residents executed on the mainland, for courtesy and respect purposes. He said this matter can be discussed at future general affairs consultations between the two sides.
