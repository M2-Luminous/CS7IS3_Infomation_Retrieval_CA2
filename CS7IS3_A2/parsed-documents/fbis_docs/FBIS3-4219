The tendering "strike" has thrown more than 100 other bids due in the next few months into doubt. The move threatens a Chek Lap Kok construction timetable already under severe pressure, and could further increase the cost of the multibillion-dollar project. Failing to respond to a noon deadline yesterday for construction of a temporary ferry pier, builders said new contract conditions imposed on contractors by the PAA "collectively push us over the line". The PAA hit back later in the day, saying that similar conditions had been accepted previously by other contractors, and that builders' organisations had been briefed last year on PAA demands. "All of them who prequalified (to tenders bids) have come in knowing the conditions for the contracts," a PAA spokeswoman, Norma Fung, said. Peter Lam, president of the Hong Kong Construction Association, representing the builders in the dispute, argued the latest PAA documents were the first examined by his organisation, and that it had subsequently recommended its 350 members "not take up" the terms sought by the PAA. He hoped that the airport authority might agree to a compromise in the near future. "They'll have to decide," he said. "They set out conditions in which there are areas that are beyond our control. Time is pressing, and we have suggested that it would be best if we can come to some agreement." The dispute centres on a series of potentially costly obligations that make builders responsible for delays, design changes, price rises in labour and materials and any damage resulting from events such as ground settlement. Payments may be withheld if the PAA judges work to be inadequate, the right to arbitration is limited and project managers, normally independent, will be paid by the authority. Builders say such responsibilities are usually shared with the client, and that without changes in the PAA's terms, tens of billions of dollars in construction work could be stymied. "The result (of yesterday's tender) speaks for itself," a construction-industry source said. "The PAA has said they are not going to change the terms," the source said. We'll just have to wait and see." The next deadline is Thursday, when bids are due for construction of temporary accommodation for workers at the Chek Lap Kok site. "Some of these contracts can be delayed and some cannot. Some are more important than others," Lam said. He said that disruptions in early projects would affect later, larger ones. He said it was "quite true" that without a temporary ferry pier, materials and labour for the airport terminal foundations could not be moved onto the island, and that construction would be impeded without workers' accommodation. "You'll have to ask the PAA about any delays," Lam said. "I'm sure it will boost costs, but if no one is going to work for them, then the airport won't get built at all, and if the airport has to be built, then something has to happen." The PAA's Fung said that construction remained on schedule for the moment. Both Lam and Fung denied the situation was a stalemate. "They said that some of the things made sense and that they would be happy to look at them," Lam said. Fung said the authority would seek talks with other airport employers. "As the authority's conditions are generally consistent with those of other airport core programme employers such as the government and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation, it will be talking to them before taking a final decision on the way forward," she said.
