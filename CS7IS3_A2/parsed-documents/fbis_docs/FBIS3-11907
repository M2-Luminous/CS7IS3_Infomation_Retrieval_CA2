On Friday, EL TIEMPO published a report quoting a denial by the head of military intelligence, statements by the Cuban ambassador, and Caracol's version of an alleged telephone call from the Cuban president to [Colombian] Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin. EL TIEMPO has been publishing reports, without any evidence, of an alleged meeting in Havana of Colombian guerrilla leaders and Bishop Nel Beltran, which both the Cuban Government and the bishop have denied. EL ESPECTADOR newspaper's front page headline read "Nel On Fantasy Island." An article, covered on an inside page, reports the Disney Reservation Center in Florida confirmed that Monsignor Beltran stayed there between 24-25 January. This newspaper also publishes on its front page a poll taken by the National Consulting Center, which shows that most of the 440 people asked favor maintaining diplomatic relations with Cuba even if it turns out that the guerrilla summit in Havana was held. Of the people polled, 51 percent replied that diplomatic ties should not be severed, 30 percent said yes they should, and 19 percent said they did not know.
