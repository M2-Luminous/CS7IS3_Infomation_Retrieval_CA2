Ambassador Chu Chang-chun said economic sanctions against Pyongyang would be taken as "a declaration of war" and "the DPRK (North Korea) will survive economic sanctions and will achieve victory in this struggle." Chu laid out the contents of a package solution that his government hopes to put forward if and when the third round of talks with the U.S. takes place. "Firstly we will accept the routine and ad hoc inspections to the safeguards agreement, secondly we will reenter the NPT (Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty) and thirdly when the (clarified) modulated reactor is replaced by the light water reactor we will abolish the (higher) chemical laboratory," he said. Chu said that in the second round of talks early last summer the U.S. offered to replace the present reactor with a light water reactor which does not produce plutonium waste. He further accused the U.S. of wanting to prolong its "occupation" of South Korea by first creating the "so-called nuclear issue" and then by refusing to supply the light water reactor, which would end suspicions of plutonium diversion. North Korea has special status in the NPT, Chu said, due to the suspension of its declaration in March last year to withdraw from the organization. Chu also ruled out North Korean participation in a Russian-proposed international conference, saying the nuclear issue can be solved only through talks between the U.S. and North Korea. The administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton has been seeking widespread support for U.N. Security Council sanctions against the North. The 16-month-long standoff reached a new level last weekend when the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog body, said Thursday it will not be able to determine whether North Korea has diverted nuclear material for a bomb after Pyongyang refused agency inspectors from supervising the refueling of its 5-megawatt experimental nuclear reactor a nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. North Korea denies allegations by the U.S., South Korea and other Western-bloc nations that it is building nuclear weapons.
