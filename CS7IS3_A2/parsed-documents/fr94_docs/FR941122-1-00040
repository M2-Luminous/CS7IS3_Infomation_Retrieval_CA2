FR941122-1-00040 FR941122-1-00009 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 63 [AD&hyph;FRL&hyph;5110&hyph;9] RIN 2060&hyph;AE02 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Categories: Aerospace Manufacturing and Rework; Reopening of the Public Comment Period AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Reopening of the public comment period. SUMMARY: On June 6, 1994, EPA proposed standards to regulate the emissions of certain organic hazardous air pollutants from aerospace manufacturing and rework facilities which are part of major sources under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990. The period for receiving public comment on the proposed rule ended on September 15, 1994. This action announces the reopening of the comment period to take comments on several amendments to the proposed rulemaking and other issues raised during the original comment period; clarification of the intent of a proposed requirement; and a correction of a typographical error. DATES: Comments: Comments must be received on or before January 6, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments: Comments should be submitted (in duplicate, if possible) to: Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center (6102), Attn: Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;20, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW, Washington, DC 20460. Docket: All information used in the development of this action is contained or referenced in the preamble below. Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;20 contains the supporting information for the original NESHAP and is available for public inspection and copying between 8:30 am and 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday, at the EPA's Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, Waterside Mall, Room M&hyph;1500, 1st floor, 401 M Street SW, Washington, DC 20460, or by calling (202) 260&hyph;7548 or FAX (202) 260&hyph;4400. A reasonable fee may be charged for copying. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Mary Tom Kissell at (919) 541&hyph;4516, Standards Development Branch, Emission Standards Division (MD&hyph;13), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On June 6, 1994 (59 FR 29216), national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for the aerospace manufacturing and rework source category were proposed. Since that time, the EPA has received information on several aspects of the proposed rule which has led to the amendments being proposed in this notice for the following sections of the proposed subpart GG of 40 CFR part 63: §§63.742, 63.745, 63.747, 63.749, 63.751, and 63.752. These sections deal with definitions, standards for primer and topcoat application operations, standards for chemical milling maskant application operations, compliance determinations, monitoring requirements, and recordkeeping requirements, respectively, for the NESHAP for aerospace manufacturing and rework facilities. This notice announces the reopening of the comment period for the aerospace NESHAP. However, only comments limited to the subjects listed below will be considered. (1) Correction of a typographical error regarding a request for comments for commercial exterior primers; (2) Proposal of a more stringent inorganic HAP emission control requirement for new primer and topcoat application operations and proposal of definition of high efficiency particulate air filter; (3) Proposal to eliminate the exemption for chemical milling maskant application operations for use with Type I chemical milling etchants; (4) Clarification of the intent of the proposed requirement for control devices used to control emissions from coating application operations; (5) Proposal of reduced recordkeeping requirements to encourage the use of a low VOC primer; (6) Request for comment on depainting for private, corporate, and small commuter aircraft; (7) Request for comment on use and efficiency of control devices for depainting operations using HAP-containing chemicals; and (8) Request for comment on determining the appropriate length of the rolling material balance period for liquid-liquid material balances for carbon adsorbers used as control devices for solvent recovery systems. These actions are further discussed in Part III of this preamble. As indicated in the preamble to the proposed rule at 59 FR 29217, the EPA traditionally issues a draft CTG containing recommended control levels for public comment. Rather than issue a separate draft CTG in this case, the EPA used the notice of proposed rulemaking to request public comment on draft best available control measures (BACM), which is the same as the proposed maximum achievable control technology (MACT) for coatings and solvents. Comments on the proposed rule and on the proposed amendments in this document will also be considered in formulating a final BACM. The proposed regulatory text is not included in this Federal Register notice, but is available in Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;20 or by written or telephone request from the Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center (see ADDRESSES ). This notice with the proposed regulatory language is also available on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN), one of EPA's electronic bulletin boards. The TTN provides information and technology exchange in various areas of air pollution control. The service is free, except for the cost of a phone call. Dial (919) 541&hyph;5742 for up to a 14,400 bps modem. If more information on TTN is needed, call the HELP line at (919) 541&hyph;5384. II. Summary of and Rationale for Changes to the Proposed Rule and Request for Public Comments A. Correction: Request for Comments on Commercial Exterior Primers Section II.B.2.a of the preamble to the proposed rule requested comments concerning whether the proposed organic HAP and VOC limits for commercial exterior topcoats represents demonstrated technology. This section should have referenced commercial exterior primers rather than topcoats. Consequently, the specific paragraph in this section (see 59 FR 29224, middle column) should read as follows: The EPA has received information indicating that the organic HAP and VOC content limits for primers do not represent demonstrated technology for exterior commercial primers. Consequently, the EPA is soliciting comments on whether a separate category should be developed for exterior commercial primers with organic HAP and VOC content levels higher than the proposed levels for primers. These comments should provide a technical justification for a higher limit, including why currently available commercial primers cannot be used by all sources.
