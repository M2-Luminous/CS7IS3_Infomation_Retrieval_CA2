A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev discussed the situation in Gorazde, eastern part of Bosnia. Juppe urged Russia and the United States to consult with the European Union and the United Nations as soon as possible so that a common position on Bosnia will be worked out and the peace talks be resumed. He said Kozyrev was positive toward a French proposal on renewed diplomatic efforts and its draft resolution to be presented to UN Security Council. The French draft calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gorazde, a withdrawal of Serb forces from the region and a deployment of UN peacekeeping forces there. The draft reportedly received the support of 11 countries at the EU foreign ministerial meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. Official sources in Paris said that as both the Russian contact with the Serbs and the U.S. contact with the Muslims failed to end the fighting in Gorazde, only a united mediation effort could bring all the Bosnian warring factions back to the negotiating table. The spokesman quoted Kozyrev as saying that Russia will continue to persuade the Serbs to accept the demand of the international community.
