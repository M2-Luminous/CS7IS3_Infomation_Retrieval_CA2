But by mid-afternoon calm had returned to the strife-torn East Rand township as the SA [South African] Defence Force [SADF] helped the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] restore order. In the morning, groups of African National Congress supporters, some armed and others waving party posters, led several charges on the hostel but were rebuffed by handgun and automatic fire. SAPA reporters on the scene saw at least five vehicles ferry wounded victims to Natalspruit Hospital. Hospital officials told SAPA that by 6PM five people had died. Police said four people had been killed and reported on Tuesday morning they had found the bodies of two people in East Rand townships. Wits Command spokesman Maj Christo Visser said the army was lending "limited support" to the peacekeepers at the NPKF's request. At least a dozen SADF troop carriers rolled down lower Khumalo Street -- the centre of Tuesday's fighting near the "Angola" Hostel -- around lunchtime. [passage omitted] Referring to the IFP's decision to participate in the election, Mr [Tokyo] Sexwale [ANC official] said it was regrettable that only after all the deaths in East Rand townships, Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi had finally "capitulated". Mr Sexwale said he did not think violence would end instantly. "He (Mr Buthelezi) started something that will take a long time to control." He also accused Mr Buthelezi of misleading the Zulu people by telling them they could now participate in the elections after maintaining the opposite for so long. Hostel dwellers should take note of that. Mr Sexwale vowed to turn the hostels into family units. "There is seven days left and then we will come to power and turn them into places where human beings can live." After his address late on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Sexwale went to the NPKF headquarters in Thokoza to put forward the ANC's demands. After more than two hours of negotiations with NPKF officials he addressed about 300 residents, calling on them to support the peacekeeping force in the township. The IFP -- whose supporters dominate the hostels -- had called for the NPKF's withdrawal from the East Rand townships by 5PM on Tuesday. [passage omitted]
