These composites were fabricated by hot-pressing the homogeneous mixtures of B[.sub]4[/]C, SiC and TiC powders in Ar atmosphere at 1900� to 2200�C. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the TiB[.sub]2[/] was formed by reacting the TiC with B[.sub]4[/]C during sintering. Scanning and high resolution transmission electron microscopic observation revealed that the finer SiC and TiB[.sub]2[/] grains less than 100nm were mainly dispersed within the B[.sub]4[/]C matrix grains, although the larger grains were, of course, located at the grain boundaries of B[.sub]4[/]C grains. It is well known that the intragranular nanosized grains improved remarkably the mechanical properties, in particular, the fracture strength even at high temperatures in the composite systems such as Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/SiC, Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/], MgO/SiC, mullite/SiC, Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/TiC and Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]/SiC. As expected from the results reported for these composites, the nanosized TiB[.sub]2[/] and SiC strongly improved the mechanical properties of B[.sub]4[/]C. The fracture toughness and strength were over two times improved as compared with those of monolithic B[.sub]4[/]C. And the improved strength and toughness did not degradate up to the temperatures of 1200� to 1300�C even in the air atmosphere. In this presentation, the processes micro- and nanostructure mechanical properties relationship will be discussed in detail. Special emphasis will be placed on the understanding of the nanosized dispersion effects.
