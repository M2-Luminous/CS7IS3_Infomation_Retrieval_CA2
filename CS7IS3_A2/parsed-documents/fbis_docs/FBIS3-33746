The PRDS of Mauritanian President Maaouiya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya is expected to retain the majority in 160 communes while UFD is expected to win in at least 32 communes, an official source stated. Independent candidates have won about 20 towns, with the rate of participation at around 60 percent. The second round is slated for 4 February. Final results should be known tomorrow. PRDS, UFD, and the Union for Democracy and Progress (UDP), the second opposition party, will be contesting the second ballot in about 10 communes including Nouakchott, the political capital, and Nouadhibou, the economic capital. In Nouakchott, PRDS obtained 44.77 percent of votes as against 42 percent for UFD. According to partial results, the two parties obtained identical percentages in Nouadhibou. The PRDS will also be contesting the second ballot at Nema and Aoun, two eastern towns where it had absolute majority. The UDP, which was legalized in 1993, has already called on its voters to cast their votes for the UFD during the second round in areas where it came third. The municipal elections are being held two years after the first pluralist elections (March 1992 presidential and legislative elections) and three years after the introduction of multiparty democracy into Mauritania.
