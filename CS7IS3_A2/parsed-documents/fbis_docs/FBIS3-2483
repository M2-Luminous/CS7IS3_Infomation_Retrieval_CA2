Huang Li, a law professor at Taiwan National Chengchi University, who has been involved in drafting the "Regulations on Taiwan Relations with Hong Kong and Macao," believes that though the Hong Kong Legislative Council yesterday passed the partial political reform package tabled by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, Hong Kong's basic political setup will not undergo great changes when it returns to Beijing rule. Unless Beijing plans to recover sovereignty over Hong Kong ahead of schedule, the passage of the partial bill will not produce too great an impact on the Taiwan-Hong Kong relationship, he said. However, he maintained that the Chinese side is unlikely to recover sovereignty over Hong Kong ahead of time. Yeh Ming-te, a researcher at Taiwan National Chengchi University International Relations Research Center, said that the dispute between China and Britain does not mean Hong Kong will be in a precarious state and the principle of "one country, two systems" will go down the drain. Beijing will not give in on political matters and political principles because this is where the essentials of "one country" lie, he said, adding that on economic matters, including the mode of production, it will adopt a flexible attitude to give expression to the "two systems." Commenting on the possible change in Hong Kong and on the establishment of new "Taiwan-Hong Kong relations" after 1997, Yeh maintained that Chinese in Taiwan should expand their cooperation and exchanges with Hong Kong in social and economic fields with the purpose of deriving Hong Kong's experience in "internationalizing management" and bringing benefit to the Chinese nation. According to Wu Hsin-hsing, an associate professor at National Cheng Kung University Political and Economic Research Institute and a member of the Mainland Committee Consultative Committee, the strained Sino-British relations will have direct and indirect influences on the following: The negotiations on the renewal of the agreement on navigation rights between Hong Kong and Taiwan, which expires in 1995, because Taiwan may not be able to find its counterpart for entering into the negotiations at that time; over 3,000 Taiwan companies which are registered in Hong Kong but do business on the mainland; the entrepot trade between Taiwan and the mainland via Hong Kong; and Taiwan's economy, because Hong Kong and Taiwan have established close economic and trade relations and Hong Kong businessmen have invested heavily in Taiwan's stock market. Wu said that how great the impact will be remains to be seen. Chen Fei-lung, convener of the Committee for Development of Economic and Trade Relations between Taipei and Hong Kong under the Taiwan Federation for Industrial and Commercial Enterprises, and Chang Ping-chao, chairman of the Foundation for Development of Across-Strait Commercial Affairs, believes that Hong Kong's political situation will affect Taiwan business in Hong Kong and on the mainland for a short time. However, they are optimistic about Hong Kong's long-term situation. Chen stressed that since the focus of the world's economic development has been shifted to Asia, many people throughout the world are upbeat about the outlook for economic development on the mainland. When Hong Kong returns to Chinese rule in future, he said, China will continue to export its commodities through Hong Kong. Taiwan will have more close contacts with Hong Kong because of progress in cross-strait economic relations and trade, he added. Chang believed that though Hong Kong's current political row has led to conflicts between the Chinese and British Hong Kong Governments, it has had limited impact on Taiwan businessmen because, though Taiwan businessmen are developing economic relations and trade with the mainland through Hong Kong, they only go through the necessary procedures for the entrepot trade in Hong Kong rather than relying on the Chinese and Hong Kong Government to do business. In addition, Beijing will try its best to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, he added. However, Chang did not deny that Hong Kong's political row will affect the stock market and property development, both of which are very sensitive to political changes.
