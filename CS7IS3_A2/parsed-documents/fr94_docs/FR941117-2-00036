FR941117-2-00036 FR941117-2-00031 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY [FRI&hyph;5107&hyph;3] Public Water System Supervision Program Revision for the State of West Virginia AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given in accordance with the provisions of ยง1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. 300f et seq., and 40 CFR part 142 that the State of West Virginia is revising its approved State Public Water System Supervision Primacy Program. West Virginia has adopted drinking water regulations for Volatile Organic Chemicals, Synthetic Organic Chemicals, and Inorganic Chemicals (Known as Phase II, IIB, and V) that correspond to the National Primary Drinking Water regulations promulgated by EPA on January 30, 1991 (56 FR 3526), July 1, 1991 (56 FR 30266), and July 17, 1992 (57 FR 31776). EPA has determined that these State program revisions are no less stringent than the corresponding federal regulations. Therefore, EPA has tentatively decided to approve these State program revisions. All interested parties may request a public hearing. A request for a public hearing must be submitted by December 19, 1994, to the Regional Administrator at the address shown below. Frivolous or insubstantial requests for a hearing may be denied by the Regional Administrator. However, if a substantial request for a public request is made by December 19, 1994, a public hearing will be held. If no timely and appropriate request for a hearing is received and the Regional Administrator does not elect to hold a hearing on his own motion, this determination shall become effective on December 19, 1994. Any request for a public hearing shall include the following: (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the individual, organization, or other entity requesting a hearing; (2) a brief statement of the requesting person's interest in the Regional Administrator's determination and a brief statement of the information that the requesting person intends to submit at such a hearing; and (3) the signature of the individual making the request; or, if the request is made on behalf of an organization or other entity, the signature of a responsible official of the organization or other entity.
