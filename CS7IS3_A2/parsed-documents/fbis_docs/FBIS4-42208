This is also a measure of China's newly acquired strength -- and what a distance it has travelled since June '89 when its government was the pariah among nations. Although the decision to renew this clause was taken some months ago -- rumors on this issue were too loud to mean anything else -- it also seemed probable that the White House would limit the effect of this clause for the benefit of China, allowing it to reap the lion's share of a bilateral trade worth 32 billion dollars in 1993. Last year Bill Clinton even stated that in 1994 MFN status would only be granted in return for specific improvements in the human rights situation. The very least that can be said is that such improvements are far from evident. The government has released the half dozen most famous dissidents (such as Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan) and has refrained from locking them up again when they have made statements or had meetings of which they disapprove. And that is about it. At the same time, other arrests are continuing throughout the country, in Tibet, and in the major cities. Most significantly, the police blanket is weighing more heavily than ever on those who are considered suspect, the foreign press included. Eavesdropping on telephone conversations, surveillance, pressure, and warnings are all part of everyday life -- this very day a number of Asian journalists had their residence permits withdrawn and were escorted to the airport. The reasons for this "soft expulsion" are not known. Close negotiations continued for several months, interrupted by mutual visits, as if the White House were asking China whether it would accept the "proposed" sanctions and Beijing just was not interested. Last Thursday [26 May] this same ambiguity was still to be found. It was learned from the White House that the clause would be renewed, but in order to save face Bill Clinton would set up a "human rights secretariat" headed by his predecessor Jimmy Carter and charged -- without having any actual powers -- with monitoring the situation in China. And then, immediately afterwards, a very confident Chinese spokesman informed the press that China "would accept no condition attached to its (sic) status as most favorable nation" and "also rejects the proposal for a joint committee to look at human rights problems together." The message was relayed from Beijing to Washington and these cosmetic concessions disappeared: Clinton purely and simply gave in. But why? First of all, although China sells much more to the United States than it buys from it, the products it does buy are vital to the survival of U.S. high-tech companies -- companies which are in competition with Europe, such as Boeing, China's leading civil aviation supplier. Beijing, in the position of arbiter, can count on a powerful industrial lobby to defend its interest in the United States and in Europe. China and the United States are also "competing" on the important matter of stability in the Far East. With many interests in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore, Clinton feels that good relations with China as a growing power are necessary to maintain its influence in the region. Finally, initial reactions by dissidents to the announcement of the MFN clause renewal show differences depending on whether they are speaking from China or from abroad. Li Lu, a prominent leader during the Beijing spring who is now exiled in the United States, says he is discouraged and disappointed by the news. The same opinion is shared by professor Wang Lizhi, also living in exile. But inside the country, dissidents can be heard who welcome the abandoning of any economic pressure. Such as Mrs. Ding Ziling, a teacher, who feels that pressure of this kind has been ineffective. Her views are all the more surprising when you consider that her own son died under a hail of soldiers' bullets during the night of 3 June 1989. But we must not deceive ourselves, there are others in China who deplore the U.S. retreat. It is just that they are not now in a position to speak out -- such as the most famous of all the dissidents, Wei Jingsheng, a notable opponent of the clause renewal.
