This is to enable the military to be in a better position to quickly respond to future conflict situations in the area. The minister of defense, Alhaji Mahama Iddrisu, announced this in Parliament today, during a brief on the inter-ethnic conflict in the Northern Region. Alhaji Mahama, who is also the chairman of the National Emergency Committee, said it is the view of the committee that the stationing of such a battalion will ensure the traditional presence of the Army in this conflict-prone area. As a temporary measure, the defense minister said, even though the military will hand over to the police in the conflict zone, it will continue to maintain a limited presence at places it considers as priority areas. These include Salaga, Yendi, Krachi, and Saboba districts. The House approved the appointments of Major Emmanuel Tetteh as the Eastern Regional minister and Mr. Sam P. Yalley as deputy minister of environment, science, and technology.
