FR940927-0-00015 FR940927-0-00002 Comment: One comment expressed concerns regarding changes that will be required in underwriting and loss procedure since the new policy allows both grain and silage to be insured. The comment stated that procedure should be developed concurrently with policy language to avoid major confusion. Specifically, underwriting procedure should clearly address how grain and silage types are to be reported and insured, how production can or cannot be converted for APH purposes and whether appraisals are required if there is no loss, but the crop is harvested in a manner other than as reported. The comment also requested that FCIC consider previously submitted information when developing the procedure. Response: FCIC agrees with the comment and has begun drafting procedure to address underwriting and loss issues. Previously submitted correspondence will be considered in procedural development. Comment: One comment stated that a definition of ``silage variety'' is necessary. The comment stated that subparagraph 6.(b)(2)(ii) refers to ``a variety of corn adapted for silage use only,'' but that their understanding is that there are no varieties adapted strictly for use as silage. The comment asked if FCIC intends to designate silage varieties on the Special Provisions. Response: There is no uniform agreement regarding the existence or definition of a ``silage variety.'' However, due to ongoing attempts to develop new ``silage varieties,'' FCIC believes that language should remain in these crop provisions to prevent insuring corn on a grain basis for a variety of corn adapted for silage use only. Since there is no uniform agreement regarding the existence of silage varieties, a definition will not be added. FCIC has modified subparagraph 6.(b)(2)(ii) to delete the term ``silage variety.'' If research succeeds in developing silage varieties, FCIC will evaluate placing specific silage variety restrictions in the Special Provisions. Comment: One comment suggested subsection 1.(m) conflicts with subsection 10.(a), stating that: (1) Subsection 1.(m) specifies that it may be considered practical to replant after the end of the late planting period if replanting is generally occurring in the area; and (2) subection 10.(a) specifies that a replant payment may be made if replanting occurs no later than 25 days after the final planting date. The comment further stated that if it is determined to be practical to replant after the late planting period, a replanting payment must be made and subsection 10.(a) should indicate the same. Response: FCIC agrees with the comment and has removed the provision in subsection 10.(a) that requires replanting within 25 days after the final planting date. Comment: One comment stated that subsections 10.(b) and 10.(c) are confusing because: (1) Subsection 10.(c) allows a replant payment, based on the total insured shares, to be made to one party if an agreement exists to that effect between the insured persons; and (2) subsection 10.(b) uses ``your share'' in calculating the maximum replant payment. The comment suggested that a qualifier should be added to subsection 10.(b) to reflect paying a replant payment based on the total insured share if 10.(c) applies. The comment also asked which company pays the entire replant payment when persons sharing in the crop are insured with different companies. Response: FCIC agreed that a replant payment should be calculated using the insured share or the share determined in subsection 10.(c), if applicable and has modified subsection 10.(b) accordingly. The proposed language contained in subsection 10.(c) would have required the company insuring the person given the right to the replant payment to pay the entire amount due. Upon further review, FCIC has determined it is not appropriate to require an insurer to pay replant payments based on a share in excess of the share they actually insure. Therefore, subsection 10.(c) has been revised to allow replant payments based on the total shares insured with the insurer. Comment: One comment questioned whether FCIC intends to incorporate language contained in subsection 10.(d) into every crop provision that provides for a replant payment. This language requires that when the crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable as an original planting, the liability for the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment which is attributable to the insured's share and that the premium amount will not be reduced. Response: As policies are revised, this provision will be added if appropriate for the specific crop. Comment: One comment questioned whether a person who insured grain and silage within one unit, but did not discover damage until after the beginning of grain harvest, could give timely notice of damage more than 15 days after the end of the insurance period for silage but within the period timely notice could be given for grain. Response: Notice would be considered timely as long as the silage acreage within the unit was not damaged. If the silage acreage within the unit was damaged, notice would be required within 72 hours of the insured's initial discovery of damage to the silage acreage (but not later than 15 days after the end of the insurance period for silage). FCIC has clarified paragraph 11.(b)(1). Comment: One comment recommended that subparagraph 12.(b)(2)(ii) be revised to read ``Multiplying each result by the price election for that type;'' because the phrase ``price election for each type'' indicates multiplying by both grain and silage price elections. Response: FCIC agrees with the comment and has modified the provision. Comment: One comment recommended either revising or deleting provisions that allow the inured to leave representative samples if they disagree with the insurer's appraisal. In the event the provision cannot be deleted the comment recommended changing the provision so that the insurer can decide when using representative samples is appropriate. In many situations, samples are more susceptible to loss and do not accurately represent what the entire unit would have produced. Response: FCIC agrees that there are situations in which it may not be reasonable to leave representative strips from which production to count would ultimately be determined. The samples could be more vulnerable to damage than an entire field, or the insurer may be confident that the appraisal made accurately reflects production potential. However, the entire provision should not be removed. The provision has been changed to allow the insurer to determine those situations in which it is reasonable to leave representative samples to determine the amount of production to be counted. In cases where it is necessary to defer determinations, the insured must be advised how production to count will ultimately be determined and the consequences of failure to leave or care for the samples. Comment: One comment recommended amending subsection 12.(e) by specifically stating that moisture adjustment, if applicable, will be made prior to any adjustment for quality.
