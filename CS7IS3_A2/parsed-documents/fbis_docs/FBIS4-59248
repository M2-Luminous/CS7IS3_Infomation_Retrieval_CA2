He added that 7,000 Palestinian policemen will enter Gaza over the next three weeks, including the 'Ayn Jalut Forces from Egypt, the forces now in Yemen who will travel via Saudi Arabia, and later the forces currently stationed in Libya and Sudan. He explained that at the same time the Badr Forces, currently in Jordan, and al-Aqsa Forces, currently in Iraq, will enter the West Bank via the Allenby Bridge, where they will join 2,000 policemen already residing in Gaza and Jericho. The director general of the Palestinian National Security Forces affirmed that there is a sufficient number of policemen involved to deploy them in the autonomy area and maintain security there. He noted, however, that the Palestinian police apparatus needs international assistance to cover the cost of equipment. Maj. Gen. Yusuf said that the role of these policemen is to maintain peace and order, guarantee democratic freedoms, and protect people of all political affiliations, taking into account the need to use methods of persuasion, discussion, dialogue, and democracy. Marwan Kanafani, official spokesman for Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, announced that several Palestinian, Israeli, Egyptian, and Jordanian joint committees are discussing the return of the Palestinians who left their homes after the 1967 war, as outlined in the Oslo Agreement. Kanafani urged that all Palestinian detainees, regardless of their political affiliations or whether they support or oppose the autonomy agreement, be released. He called for the repatriation of all Palestinian deportees. He pointed out that a Palestinian passport will be issued to every citizen to be used when entering of leaving the country. Kanafani explained that the delay in the entry of some Palestinian police forces was caused by the Yemeni civil war, the air blockade of Libya, and several procedural problems connected with the size of the forces, their equipment and weapons, and the need to sort out all political, military, financial, and administrative arrangements pertaining to the deployment of these forces. He said many of these problems had been solved with the help of the Egyptian brothers. He urged all Arab countries to facilitate transportation for these forces. He added that the families of the Palestinian policemen will enter the self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho in several stages after this issue is discussed with the Israeli authorities and after amenities such as housing and schools are provided for them.
