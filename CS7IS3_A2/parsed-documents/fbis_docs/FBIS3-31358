At the end, the Commission adopted the proposal for a law for the forming of an Intelligence Agency. The representatives of the Interior Ministry pointed out that the law defines the control at three levels: "The president of the state appoints and dismisses the director, the government can demand responsibility from the director for the activities of the Agency, and there will also be parliamentary supervision." A couple of members of the commission emphasized the conceptual inconsistency that the director answers to organs which did not elect him. To this, the Interior Ministry representatives replied that the strengthened control is introduced in order to prevent the autonomous activities of the agency, but also not to allow involvement in the daily political interests. In relation to this law, also two amendments were submitted. The first one specifies that the employees in the agency cannot carry out other activities and functions, and the second, that both the employees in the agency and the Interior Ministry have the right a 30 percent increase.
