Lambeck: "Turn of Tides for Kohl in Opinion Polls"] [Text] Bonn -- Almost all recent opinion polls indicate that the mood in the population is changing in favor of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In various inquiries, Kohl is also catching up in the direct comparison with his contender, Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping. The recent figures received by the Chancellor's Office in Bonn also reveal that the situation has improved in the new laender. This includes a survey carried out by the Allensbach Opinion Research Institute, according to which as many as 52 percent of those asked in all of Germany believe that there will soon be "flourishing landscapes" in eastern Germany. The question that was put to 1,036 citizens was: "Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1990 said that there would soon be flourishing landscapes in the eastern laender. He was laughed at for this statement and exposed to a lot of criticism. What do you think, will there be flourishing landscapes in the eastern laender before long or can this not be expected?" Only 34 percent of those asked stated that one could not expect it, with 14 percent saying neither yes nor no. In a survey carried out by the Forsa-Institute, for the first time 33 percent preferred Kohl to Scharping, who received only 29 percent. In an Emnid survey carried out last week among 1,500 citizens, the CDU/CSU for the first time stands at 40 percent again and the SPD only at 39 percent. In the Emnid survey, 48 percent preferred Scharping to Kohl in the direct comparison. Compared to the previous Emnid survey, the SPD challenger dropped 6 percent from 54 percent, while Kohl scored 44 percent this time. The most recent Infas survey sees support for the CDU/CSU at 38 percent and the SPD at 39 percent. One pollster explained: "In the Lower Saxony election of March, the SPD had gone across the top in the polls by reaching 40 percent. Ever since, it has remained beneath the 40-percent level in all Infas surveys. The CDU/CSU, however, has increased its popularity virtually one percentage point each month since mid-February (35.5 percent)."
