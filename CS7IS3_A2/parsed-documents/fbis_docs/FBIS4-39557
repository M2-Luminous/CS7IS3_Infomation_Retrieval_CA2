Before the meeting, Russia did not comment on any possible results whereas the Lithuanian side said it expects to make progress in a number of issues, including Russian transit through Lithuania and implementation of bilateral economic treaties that have been signed earlier. But according to unofficial reports from the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry, the number of issues on the meeting's agenda was considerably reduced and primary attention is paid only to several most important problems. On Tuesday, Lithuanian and Russian negotiators initialed an agreement on contract employees. The accord mainly deals with social guarantees to people temporarily employed in one of the two countries. The Russian delegation refused to discuss a draft agreement on additional border crossings between Lithuania and the Kaliningrad region, saying it has no such authorizations. The Lithuanian side once again suggested to clear up the region's status in the process of Lithuanian-Russian talks. Russian negotiators said the problem can be resolved by a special Russian law.
