According to our information, the new nuclear test focused on experiments with new types of short-range nuclear missiles and other technological weapons and equipment. An Israeli technical committee chose the site of the new nuclear test, preparations for which lasted approximately four months. The same information indicates that the test aimed to check the efficiency of three secret Israeli bases that control the launch of nuclear missiles and weapons. Israel spent over $30 million on the test and part of the money was used to buy advanced technological equipment. Some Arab governments reportedly received important political reports on the details of the test. The reports urged these governments to intervene directly with the United States and European states to keep the Mediterranean safe from nuclear tests. This is Israel's second nuclear test this year.
