FR940628-0-00017 FR940628-0-00014 40 CFR Part 763 [OPPTS&hyph;62114B; FRL&hyph;4776&hyph;7] Technical Amendment in Response to Court Decision on Asbestos; Manufacture, Importation, Processing and Distribution Prohibitions AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Technical amendment. SUMMARY: EPA is revising the language of the Prohibition of the Manufacture, Importation, Processing, and Distribution in Commerce of Certain Asbestos-containing Products; Labeling Requirements Rule (also known as the Asbestos Ban and Phase Out or ABPO Rule) in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to conform to a court decision that vacated and remanded part of the ABPO Rule and to an EPA factfinding conducted in accordance with the court's decision. The ABPO Rule prohibited the manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in commerce of most asbestos-containing products in three stages over 7 years beginning in 1990. On October 18, 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the court) vacated and remanded most of the ABPO Rule. In a subsequent clarification, the court said the rule continued to govern asbestos-containing products that were not being manufactured, imported, or processed on July 12, 1989. EPA conducted a factfinding and concluded that six asbestos-containing product categories in the ABPO Rule were not being manufactured, processed, or imported on July 12, 1989, and thus are still subject to the rule. This document revises the CFR to conform to the findings of EPA in accordance with the court decision, and requires no notice and public comment. EFFECTIVE DATE: This document is effective on June 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 554&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of July 12, 1989 (54 FR 29460), EPA issued a final rule under section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)(15 U.S.C. 2605) that prohibited the manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in commerce of most asbestos-containing products in three stages over 7 years (40 CFR 763.160 through 763.179). Stage 1 of the ban went into effect in August 1990. Stages 2 and 3 were scheduled to go into effect in 1993 and 1996 respectively. On October 18, 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated and remanded most of the ABPO Rule. Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA , 947 F.2d 1201 (5th Cir., 1991). In a latter clarification, the court stated that product categories in the ABPO Rule that were no longer being manufactured, imported, or processed on July 12, 1989, when the ABPO Rule was issued were still subject to the rule. Id . at 1230. The court left it to EPA to resolve any factual disputes about which product categories in the ABPO Rule were no longer in commerce on July 12, 1989. As a result, in order to determine which product categories in the ABPO Rule were still subject to the rule, EPA published a document in the Federal Register of April 2, 1992 (57 FR 11364), that requested information on the commercial status on July 12, 1989, of 14 product categories in the rule that may no longer have been manufactured, processed, or imported when the rule was published on July 12, 1989. In addition, EPA solicited information on the commercial status of any other product category in the ABPO Rule that also may no longer have been manufactured, processed, or imported on July 12, 1989. EPA supplemented the original information in the RIA with the comments received in response to the Federal Register notice and with additional research. EPA published a document in the Federal Register of November 5, 1993 (58 FR 58964), that announced its findings concerning the regulatory status of the product categories in the ABPO Rule. EPA concluded that six asbestos-containing product categories were not being manufactured, processed, or imported on July 12, 1989, and thus are still subject to the rule. The remaining product categories were being manufactured, processed, or imported on July 12, 1989, and are no longer subject to the rule. Accordingly, EPA is issuing this document to revise the language of the ABPO Rule in the CFR to conform to the October 1991 court decision that remanded the rule and to the November 1992 factual findings of EPA, in accordance with the court decision.

Persons whose exemption applications are approved by the Agency may manufacture, import, process, or distribute in commerce the banned product as specified in the Agency's approval of the application. No applicant for an exemption may continue the banned activity that is the subject of an exemption application after the effective date of the ban unless the Agency has granted the exemption or the applicant receives an extension under paragraph (b)(4) or (5) of this section. (b) Application filing dates. (1) Applications for products affected by the prohibitions under 763.165(a) and 763.167(a) may be submitted at any time and will be either granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible. (2) Applications for products affected by the ban under 763.169(a) may be submitted at any time and will be either granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible. (3) Applications for products affected by the ban under 763.165(b) and 763.167(b) may not be submitted prior to February 27, 1995. Complete applications received after that date, but before August 25, 1995, will be either granted or denied by the Agency prior to the effective date of the ban for the product. Applications received after August 25, 1995, will be either granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible.

Applications received after August 26, 1996, will be either granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible. (5) The Agency will consider an application for an exemption from a ban under §763.169 for a product at the same time the applicant submits an application for an exemption from a ban under §763.165 or §763.167 for that product. EPA will grant an exemption at that time from a ban under §763.169 if the Agency determines it appropriate to do so. (6) If the Agency denies an application less than 30 days before the effective date of a ban for a product, the applicant can continue the activity for 30 days after receipt of the denial from the Agency. (7) If the Agency fails to meet the deadlines stated in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section for granting or denying a complete application in instances in which the deadline is before the effective date of the ban to which the application applies, the applicant will be granted an extension of 1 year from the Agency's deadline date. During this extension period the applicant may continue the activity that is the subject of the exemption application. The Agency will either grant or deny the application during the extension period. The extension period will terminate either on the date the Agency grants the application or 30 days after the applicant receives the Agency's denial of the application.
