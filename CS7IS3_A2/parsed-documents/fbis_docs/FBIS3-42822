Many people attributed this sharp drop in the exchange rate to the collusion of currency speculators who "are making billions from this game." However, in reality the intercession, or currency intervention, of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation was the actual reason for the drop in the exchange rate. Why is such currency intervention needed? What is the mechanism used? How much does it cost us? Our correspondent, Pavel Lukyanchenko, asked Aleksandr Khandruyev, deputy chairman of the Bank of Russia, to answer these and other questions. [Khandruyev] The essence of currency interventions that are undertaken by the central banks of all countries of the world is as follows: to keep the exchange rate of the national currency within certain limits. To this end, the central state bank either buys foreign currency on the currency exchange, thus lowering the exchange rate of its national currency, or sells foreign currency--as a result of which the exchange rate of the national currency grows. The currency reserves of central banks are far from always sufficient to support the exchange rate of the national monetary unit, and in this case a devaluation is effected, that is, it becomes cheaper compared to the dollar, the deutsche mark, and so on. [Lukyanchenko] How large are the currency reserves of the Central Bank of Russia? [Khandruyev] As of the end of the year they came to $4.4 billion. [Lukyanchenko] What is the specific mechanism of currency intervention? [Khandruyev] If the demand for dollars on the exchange exceeds supply, for example, if on a specific day demand comes to $100 million while only $20 million is for sale, the Central Bank puts up for sale the lacking $80 million. Therefore, on this day the exchange rate of the ruble against the dollar does not change compared to the previous trading session. This is what artificial support for the ruble is all about; its meaning is to prevent abrupt changes in the exchange rate, which always have a detrimental effect on the condition of the economy and price levels. However, since production continues to slump and prices to grow in our country, we lower the exchange rate of the ruble little by little. Of course, for a certain period of time it is possible to sustain a greatly overstated exchange rate of the ruble against the dollar. However, more currency needs to be unloaded on the market in this case. Where does the currency go? As a rule it is deposited in the accounts of the banks' clients, and later often moved abroad. This is why your readers should understand that it is not necessarily bad for the exchange rate of the ruble to fall. [Lukyanchenko] What is the specific size of currency interventions by the Central Bank? [Khandruyev] We do not divulge this in order not to whet the appetites of currency speculators. [Lukyanchenko] As I understand it, the currency reserves of the Central Bank are virtually a dead weight. Why not make them work actively for Russia? They say that at present $1 million can be turned into $1.5 million in our country within one month. [Khandruyev] Naturally, the currency reserve of the Central Bank is placed abroad in the accounts of high-class banks, at 3-5 percent annual rates of interest. Only swindlers get 50 percent in our country. I strongly advise citizens against getting involved with companies engaging in speculative operations. High rates of profit are always accompanied by the colossal risk of never recouping the invested funds. [Lukyanchenko] They say that some Swiss banks exchange our rubles into [hard] currency. [Khandruyev] It is possible. There are various interests, for example, to maintain our embassy staff in Moscow--it is cheaper to pay for outlays in rubles. Possibly they need money for intelligence, too. However, in either case Western banks exchange money at a rate that is not advantageous for the ruble. [Lukyanchenko] My final question. Is it true that the Central Bank still exchanges even "Pavlov's" R50 bills? [Khandruyev] It is. If an old woman comes to us and says: "Boys, yesterday I found three bills in the pocket of the pants of my late husband, and you know what kind of retirement benefits I get...." Of course, for an old woman like this we will exchange both "Pavlov's" and the recently withdrawn Russian rubles. However, had she come to us with the same words and O.5 million of the old bills, this conversation would not have taken place. Rumor Has It Commercial circles are seriously concerned about leaked information that a redenomination of the bills currently in use at a ratio of 1,000:1 will be carried out soon, with the exchange rate of the dollar against the ruble being simultaneously set at 1:1, and that all private banks will have their licenses to perform exchange operations with currency revoked; these operations will become the prerogative of only the Central Bank of Russia. A highly placed government official whom we asked to comment on the rumor answered unambiguously: "This is quite possible."
