In the beginning of 1995, the National Institute of Space Research (INPE) in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo State, will put a second Data Gathering Satellite (SCD) into orbit. If everything runs smoothly, it will launch the first Brazilian communications satellite in 1996. Thus, Brazil will be the Latin American leader in a scarcely exploited field: cellular telephone systems supported by satellites. The INPE is an island of prosperity in a country where investment in science and technology has been decreasing each year. With a budget of only $1 billion and the promise of $180 million in supplementary credit, the Science and Technology Ministry has to define priorities. The space race is one of these priorities. The ministry's budget represents only 0.7 percent of the Brazilian GDP. This is very little in the face of Brazil's needs."We had to define priorities and one of them will undoubtedly be the space program," said engineer Oskar Klingl, Science and Technology Minister Jose Israel Vargas' chief of staff. On 19 May, INPE Director General Marcio Barbosa, engineer, exhibited in Cachoeira Paulista, in interior Sao Paulo State, INPE's main achievement: a NEC SX3/12R supercomputer. It was purchased for $20 million and can process 3.2 billion operations per second. This supercomputer will be used in the weather forecast complex. "We will be able to forecast the metereological conditions five days ahead with 70 percent accuracy," Marcio Barbosa reported. He said the current system only forecasts the metereological conditions 24 hours ahead. According to Barbosa, the supercomputor will have a great impact on agriculture, civil defense, recreational activities, and tourism. Not everything is positive, however. At the national level, Klingl admits that the ministry has been losing experts, who join private companies as a result of the low salaries being paid to scientists. He added that there should be more investment in science and technology, particularly, by the private sector.
