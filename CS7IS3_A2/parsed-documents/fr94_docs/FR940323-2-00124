Vertac Chemical Corporation, et al., Civil Action No. LR&hyph;C&hyph;80&hyph;109 and Arkansas Department of Pollution Control & Ecology v. Vertac Chemical Corporation, et al., Civil Action No. LR&hyph;C&hyph;80&hyph;110 (E.D. Ark.), was lodged with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas on February 15, 1994. The proposed Consent Decree concerns alleged violations of section 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9607, as a result of the release or threatened release of hazardous substances at the Vertac Superfund Site in Jacksonville, Pulaski County, Arkansas. Both suits involve allegations that the United States, on behalf of the Department of Defense, is liable for a portion of the response costs incurred in connection with the Site by the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Arkansas. The Consent Decree requires the United States, on behalf of the Department of Defense, to pay a total of $1,900,000 as reimbursement of past and future response costs. Of that amount, $1,000,000 will be paid into the EPA Hazardous Substances Superfund, $400,000 will be paid to the State of Arkansas, and $500,000 will be paid to the Vertac Chemical Company. The $1,000,000 to be paid into the Superfund will be paid on behalf of the State of Arkansas and shall constitute a credit for the State's share of response costs at the Site if, pursuant to CERCLA section 104(c)(3), 42 U.S.C. 9604(c)(3), the State is required to pay or assure payment of at least 10 percent of the government-conducted remedial action at the Site. If the State is not responsible for 10 percent of the costs, the funds, or any portion thereof remaining, shall be retained by the Superfund. The Department of Justice will receive written comments relating to the Consent Decree for a period of 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. Comments should be addressed to John A. Sheehan, Esquire, U.S. Department of Justice, Environmental Defense Section, P.O. Box 23986, Washington, DC 20026&hyph;3986, and should refer to United States v. Vertac Chemical Corporation, et al., Civil Action No. LR&hyph;C&hyph;80&hyph;109 (E.D. Ark.) (and consolidated case). The Consent Decree may be examined at the Clerk's Office, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas (Western Division), United States Courthouse and Post Office, 600 West Capitol Street, Little Rock, Arkansas 72201.
