FR941103-0-00111 FR941103-0-00016 Based on a letter from TTMA stating that the regulations provide no distinction between a ``100 percent rebarrel'' and the manufacture of a new cargo tank, RSPA proposed to clarify the rebarrelling requirements and to differentiate between ``rebarrelling a cargo tank'' and ``manufacturing a cargo tank''. It was never RSPA's intent to imply that a repair facility holding only a National Board ``R'' stamp would be allowed to manufacture a new cargo tank or to perform a ``100 percent rebarrel'' of a cargo tank. Such work can be performed only by a manufacturer who is registered with DOT and holds an ASME ``U'' stamp. RSPA proposed adding a provision disallowing a repair facility from replacing an entire cargo tank by performing a ``100 percent rebarrel.'' However, based on comments received in the proposed clarification, the reference to a ``100 percent rebarrelled cargo tank'' has also caused confusion. Therefore, the proposed change is not adopted in this final rule, but RSPA will seek to clarify this provision in a future rulemaking. CGA urged RSPA to add a new paragraph (e)(3)(v) specifying that modifications of MC 338 cargo tanks must conform to the specification in effect at the time of manufacture or at the time of modification. CGA pointed out that many cryogenic cargo tanks were operating under DOT exemption prior to adoption of the MC 338 cargo tank specification. Some of these units do not conform to the design criteria in §§178.338&hyph;3 and 178.338&hyph;10. CGA stated that engineering and manufacturing costs to upgrade these cargo tanks to this new design criteria would be too restrictive. Yet, CGA also stated that ``to encourage continuous modification and improvement, modifications to MC 338 cargo tanks must be performed in accordance with the specifications in effect at the time of manufacture or at the time of modification.'' Proposed §180.413 provides for a cargo tank to be modified in accordance with a current specification in effect at the time the work is done. For example, a feature on an MC 305 cargo tank may be modified in accordance with the MC 306 specification until August 31, 1995, and after that date in accordance with the DOT 406 specification; an MC 330 cargo tank may be modified in accordance with the MC 331 specification. Similarly, a cargo tank authorized under an exemption issued before October 1, 1984 for transportation of a cryogenic liquid must be marked as a ``DOT MC 338'' cargo tank in accordance with §180.405(d). The only cryogenic cargo tank specification is the MC 338. Thus, no feature of an MC 338 cryogenic cargo tank can be modified in accordance with any other specification. However, an MC 338 cryogenic cargo tank may be repaired in accordance with either its original design specified in the exemption under which it was manufactured or the MC 338 specification requirements in effect at the time of the repair. Therefore, CGA's suggested change is not adopted in this final rule. CGA recommended a revision to paragraph (e)(6) to clarify that a cargo tank manufacturer who welds attachments and appurtenances which have no affect on the structural integrity or lading retention capability of a tank is not required to have a National Board ``R'' or ASME ``U'' stamp. CGA also suggested a revision to paragraph (e)(7) to clarify that mounting specifications should be governed by welding to the cargo tank ``shell and head'' rather than the cargo tank ``wall''. RSPA agrees and paragraphs (e)(6) and (e)(7) are revised for clarity.
