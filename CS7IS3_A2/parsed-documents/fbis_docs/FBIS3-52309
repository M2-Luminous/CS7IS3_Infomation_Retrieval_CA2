He told our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling that the government will not announce its intentions with regard to the Golan in advance, but neither will it avoid difficult decisions, and when required to decide whether and how much to cede, it will do so. He asserted that the Golan was conquered because of security considerations alone and that the government will not negotiate on it until Syria realizes that our security and very existence constitute the essence of our presence on the Golan. The construction and housing minister inaugurated a new housing project in Qatzrin today. The project consists of 500 housing units, most of which have been sold. Replying to reporters questions, Minister Ben-Eli'ezer said the inauguration of the project and his tour of the Golan 10 days before the Clinton-al-Asad summit have no political significance. He noted that the tour was planned three months ago and that the government will continue to aid in the development and expansion of the Golan settlements.
