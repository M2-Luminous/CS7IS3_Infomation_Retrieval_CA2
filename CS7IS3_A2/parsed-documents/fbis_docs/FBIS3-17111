As a plant spokesman has reported to Interfax, the reactor disconnected after the safety system was effected by the separation of two circular pumps, supplying water to cool off a turbine capacitor. In his words, to bring down pressure, steam was released into the atmosphere from pipelines, and the discharge was accompanied by persistent noise. He described the incident as not being dangerous for the plant's personnel or the environment. An investigation is underway. The level of radiation at the nuclear plant has not changed. As has been reported, the station's third reactor was switched off at 13:37 local time on Monday by the warning safety device but was switched on again five hours later.
