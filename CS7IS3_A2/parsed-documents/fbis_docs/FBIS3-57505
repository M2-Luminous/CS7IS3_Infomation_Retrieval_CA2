Zh. Looks Closer at Tundra"] [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is true to himself. As soon as journalists switched their attention to Yegor Gaydar following his unexpected resignation, Zhirinovskiy immediately tried to regain the initiative. He has succeeded in doing so to a certain extent -- there was no room to swing a cat, as the saying goes, at the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] chief's news conference yesterday. Those who expected yet more scandalous statements from the LDPR leader, however, were clearly disappointed. Neither Zhirinovskiy, nor Gerhard Frey, leader of the German National Union [GNU], said anything new; they only spoke over and over again about the interparty cooperation between the LDPR and the GNU and the prospects for friendly relations between the Russian Federation and the FRG. Zhirinovskiy even expressed his hope that in the near future a new Berlin-Koenigsberg-Moscow-Urals-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok highway will make it possible to transport peaceful freight from Japan to Germany. Russia will benefit from that and will become a great power once again. V.V. Zh. also dreams about Russian becoming Germany's second language. With regard to domestic policy, Zhirinovskiy promised that as soon as next fall he would form his one-party government (the current one, he said, will break up soon), which will lead the country along a special path and will be able to lift Russia out of the crisis. As a matter of fact, Zhirinovskiy dismissed all charges regarding the propaganda of war: "The prosecutor's office has not brought and will never bring charges against me," he said, "Whereas my book, "The Last Dash to the South" will soon become a mandatory textbook for all higher educational establishments of the country." As for V.V. Zh.'s next masterpiece, it will be entitled "Last Train Car to the North; Last Stop, Taymyr; Residence Permit, the Tundra." The hint is ambiguous: either Zhirinovskiy is going to send all his ill-wishers to Siberia, or he plans to obtain a residence permit in the tundra himself. Under a court ruling, one may assume. For the time being, however, Zhirinovskiy "has to leave for a number of Balkan countries for a couple of days and to address a 2- million-strong rally in Belgrade." On his way back, V.V. Zh. plans to spend a few hours in Warsaw.
