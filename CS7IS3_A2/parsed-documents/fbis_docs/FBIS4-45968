In a review of French defence strategy Thursday evening, Mitterrand told defence chiefs the current moratorium on testing nuclear warheads would remain as long as he was president. Mitterrand's mandate ends next May. Throwing a defiant challenge to any successor, almost certain to be a right-winger, he said future presidents would not dare to resume testing for fear of offending the whole world by relaunching the nuclear arms race, and urged them to move to computer-simulated tests. Juppe, responding on France-Inter radio, said the issue was "a major point of disagreement" with the government, which wants to keep its options open. No one questioned Mitterrand's authority as head of the armed forces until the end of the mandate, but "he cannot anticipate what his successor will do," the minister commented. "It is for the future president (...) to explain his vision to the French people." As for computer-generated tests, "most experts think further nuclear tests are needed" before this was possible," he added. A conservative member of parliament's defence committee used stronger language, saying Friday that Mitterrand was making a "vain testament, a farewell to arms" rather than showing a "vision of the future." The president "remains strangely faithful to an outmoded vision of the bipolar world of the Cold War, without taking account of the new unpredictable dangers which we should defend ourselves against," said Jacques Baumel, from the ruling coalition party Rassemblement pour la Republique (RPR). Juppe said he agreed with the broad thrust of the president's arguments. This was that it was vital to French interests to maintain an independent nuclear deterrent and keep out of NATO's military command, to allocate more money to computer research and strengthen overall disarmament, he said. "There is no question today of rejoining the military organisation" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, said Juppe, who said development of computer simulation "will allow us to move on from nuclear tests one day." Mitterrand, speaking to military and civilian defence chiefs at his Elysee palace after the adoption of a bill setting out France's defence strategy for the next six years, had said French nuclear weapons would remain "under sole French control." He said he stood by the late president Charles de Guaulle's 1966 decision to pull out of NATO's military command. "I firmly maintain this decision. Nothing will make me change it," he said. Mitterrand also gave the first-ever official details of his country's nuclear arsenal, saying France had some 500 nuclear warheads. The deterrent relied mainly on five nuclear-powered submarines which each carried 16 missiles with six independently targeted warheads. The number in service at any one time was 64 missiles, carrying a total of 384 warheads, each of 150 kilotonnes yield, Mitterrand said.
