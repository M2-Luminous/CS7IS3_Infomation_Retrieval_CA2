FBIS3-54406 "drnes017_m_94010" FBIS-NES-94-017 Document Type:Daily Report 26 Jan 1994 JORDAN Cabinet Discusses Food, Medicines, Forms Committees JN2501180294 Amman Radio Jordan Network in Arabic 1600 GMT 25 Jan 94 JN2501180294 Amman Radio Jordan Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] Out of the government's concern for the citizen's health and safety and the security of his food and medicine supply, the Council of Ministers, which held a session under acting Prime Minister Dr. Ma'n Abu-Nuwar, devoted a considerable part of its morning session to discussing the food and medicine issue in detail. It heard two detailed reports by the supply and health ministers. In light of this and in reply to a question posed by the JORDAN NEWS AGENCY on this issue, the acting prime minister said that the government, since it was formed, has been working to serve the citizen and to provide him with the best health, food, and environmental conditions. He added: The food and medicine control process has always been continuous and active. However, there are some gaps and complications, and some times there are conflicts between powers that encouraged certain people to exploit this control process. Some time ago, the Health Ministry began work to achieve the highest degree of health and preventive guarantees. The health minister's remarks fall within this framework. Dr. Abu-Nuwar added: Redressing the health and medicine situation and checking for negligence and attempts to tamper with this situation is a basic issue. The government will accept no violation or negligence in this regard. The government will not excuse anyone and will take every possible measure to deter violators. To guarantee this, the Council of Ministers has decided to form two ministerial committees. The first committee will discuss food affairs and is chaired by the supply minister. Specialized experts will be included as members of this committee, whose task is to discuss the food issue, including importing, transporting, storing, distributing, and pricing foodstuffs. The second committee will discuss medicine affairs and is chaired by the health minister. It will discuss the medicine issue, including its fitness for human consumption, as well as importing, controlling, and pricing medicines. The two ministerial committees will submit their report to the Council of Ministers as soon as possible. The acting prime minister stressed that Jordan is a country that attaches great importance to safeguarding the citizen's health and preventing all exports that do not meet Jordanian and international food and medicine standards and specifications. The acting prime minister said: The government appreciates the concern of the majority of our honest merchants for the interests of the citizen and the homeland, as well as that of the majority of workers in the health field. However, it will never tolerate any violation, exploitation, or any attempt to tamper with the citizen's health, food, and medicine security, which is happening among a very limited segment of workers in this important field. The government has already begun work on a host of legal and administrative measures to meet and achieve these important objectives in order to upgrade the level of health control on food and medicine in the service of the citizen and the homeland.
