FBIS4-47674 "drafr084_c_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-084 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Names of AWB Members Charged in Bombings Reported Names of AWB Members Charged in Bombings Reported MB2904154394 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1509 GMT 29 Apr 94 MB2904154394 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [By Angela Quintal] [Text] Johannesburg March 29 SAPA -- Three senior Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance] officials were among 33 right-wingers who appeared in the Johannesburg regional court on Friday [29 April] in connection with bomb attacks in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region since Sunday. AWB chief-of-staff Josias Alexander van Cruywagen, Ystergaarde [Iron Guard] Commander Leon van der Merwe and the organisation's executive secretary Nico Prinsloo were among the accused. Assistant Police Constable Hercules Jacobus Coetsee and police reservist Andreas Coetzee also face charges ranging from 19 counts of murder, 191 counts of attempted murder, vehicle theft, malicious damage to property and charges under the arms and ammunition and explosives acts. A 34th accused, Mr P Koekemoer, could not attend the hearing because he was in a Rustenburg hospital after being shot in a foot. The accused packed the courtroom, dressed casually rather than in AWB uniforms, and occupied benches brought in to expand the dock. The group included a father and son, both named Cornelius Johannes Botha. Relatives and friends, including AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche's brother Andries, sat in the public gallery and a large contingent of local and foreign media jammed the courtroom. The men, many in their late teens and early 20s, were not asked to plead and State Advocate Brink Ferreira requested that they be remanded in custody until July 10. Counsel for the defence, represented by Advocates H L Prinsloo and H van der Walt and Attorney Fanie van Vuuren, argued that proper consultation with their clients for a bail application was impossible because the charge sheet did not provide sufficient detail. They submitted that according to the interim constitution every person had the right to information in the possession of the state or its agents to protect their rights. They also submitted that because bail was a fundamental right protected by the constitution, the accused were entitled to bail unless the state could prove on a balance of probabilities that the granting of bail was not in the interests of justice. Mr Ferreira argued that the constitutional provisions to the right to information applied only to accused on trial. As they had yet to plead to charges the provision could not apply. Magistrate C J van Heerden ordered the state to provide additional information so the defence could prepare for the bail application. He added that, according to the constitution, the state had the burden of convincing the court on a balance of probabilities why bail should not be granted. After a short adjournment the state expanded on the charge sheet, saying six of the murder charges related to the Bree Street, Johannesburg, car bombing on March 24, a further eight murder charges related to the bomb in Germiston on March 25 and the rest to a bombing in Bloed Street, Pretoria, later the same day. The vehicle theft charges related to cars used in the three bombings. Details of the identity of the deceased would be given to the defence once the information became available, Mr Brink said. The 34 accused were facing charges in their personal capacity and as part of a conspiracy. Mr van Heerden then ruled the bail application should be heard in the Johannesburg regional court on May 16 and that the accused be remanded in custody until then. Another of the accused, who cannot be named because he is a minor, appeared briefly in court after the main hearing. He was released into the care of his mother and was warned to report twice a day to the Rustenburg police station. The other accused, from Randfontein, Carletonville, Ventersdrop, Rustenburg and Pretoria, include: Clint Ellish, Abraham Liebenberg Myburg, Pieter Daniel van der Merwe, Nicolaas Clifton Barnard, Jan Antonie Oelofse, Serge Marie Joseph Dabbabie, Douglas Pieter Taylor, Gerhard William Antonius Elbers, Dirk Jacobus Coetzee Meyer, Marthinus Albertus Deysel, Nelson George Woutberg, Gustav Woutberg, Gert Kruger Jacobus Albert, Louis Johannes Fouri, Hermanus Steyn Luyt, Theunis van Schalkwyk, Andries Wilhemus Nel, Milestone Sharp, Zacharius Johannes Beneke, Willem Frans Johannes Hattingh, J P Olivier, Jacobus Petrus Nel, Johannes Coenraad Smit, Pieter Duvenhage and Roelof Johannes Fouche.
