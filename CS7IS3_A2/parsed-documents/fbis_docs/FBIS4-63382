Two transport aircraft -- an Il-76 and an An-124 "Ruslan" -- delivered 10 "KamAZ" trucks, spares, and communications systems to the African continent. According to figures from the World Food Program, there are already more than 320,000 refugees in Tanzania from neighboring Rwanda -- where an interethnic war still rages. Every day more than 1,500 people are arriving in the quest to escape. The United Nations is so far succeeding in supplying food to the world's largest refugee camp at Benako [name as transliterated]. Within the framework of the recently concluded agreement to support the humanitarian aid operations, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has appealed to its partner -- the Russian Ministry for Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Elimination of Natural Disasters -- asking it to take part in transporting international humanitarian cargo to Rwandan refugee camps. Following this request an advance party from the Ministry for Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Elimination of Natural Disasters went to Tanzania to arrange the routes for the delivery of the cargo and look at security problems, the conditions under which Russian drivers would be living, and funding issues. Our participation in this action will be effected on the basis of the United Nations reimbursing our transport costs, detachment members' pay, and certain other expenses.... Meanwhile the Ministry for Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Elimination of Natural Disasters is already installing a special communications system which will make it possible to monitor the Russian convoy's progress all along the route.
