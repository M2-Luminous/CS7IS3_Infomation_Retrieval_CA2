The delegation stopped at Colombia Municipality where Raul and his companions talked with Manuel Quesada, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC]. First, the good news: The sugar harvest is progressing at 101 percent of the plan and 40 percent of the production plan has been completed. The Colombia Mill, which has meet every production plan in the last 20 years, expects to do so again. The mill is engaged in the sugar recovery program and to this end will contribute the 16 recently created Basic Cooperative Production Units, in addition to the state farm managed by the Youth Labor Army [EJT], which has increased the yield of its sugarfields by 10,000 arrobas per caballeria, and the Leningrad Farming Cooperative with its 112 caballerias. During a visit to cattle ranches, Raul points out the negative aspect of extensive marabu weeds, saying that a solution has to be found so that the 25,000 head of cattle yield more milk and meat. [Politburo member Alfredo] Jordan explains that a nationwide machete campaign is being waged against marabu with the double goal of preserving the pastures and collecting kitchen firewood for workers' dining halls and homes. The report on defense is very encouraging. Colombia was the first municipality of the Eastern Army area to achieve Ready for Defense in the Second Phase status and its 17 defense zones are attaining higher levels of readiness. In Jobabo, we meet with Norge Rodriguez, first secretary of the PCC. We proceed directly to the pride of the locals: the Loma Alta state farm. This farm has 200 workers mobilized for two years from the municipality -- population 50,000 -- and the provincial capital. The 60 narrow-furrow caballerias of plantain yielded 253,000 quintals in 1993. This year they expect to surpass the 300,000 mark. The production of this, another state farm, and eight farming cooperatives is enough to distribute 40 pounds of vegetables per capita a month to every person in the municipality. The goal is to attain 1 million tubers, vegetables, and grains in 1995 to meet the people's needs and help supply the provincial capital. Rodriguez, proud of the accomplishments of the municipality, shows us the local wine factory which produced 189,000 bottles in 1993 and plans to produce 300,000 in 1994. He spoke with enthusiasm of the local food production and its highly diverse service facilities. On the outskirts of Las Tunas City is something new: modest minidairy farms -- perfect to supply milk for children and the elderly of nearby communities. There are 45 of these farms on the periphery of the city. Horse-drawn carts distribute the milk early in the morning. Housewives boil the milk as was customary before the widespread implementation of centralized pasteurization. Raul congratulated Misael Enamorado, first secretary of Las Tunas Municipality, for this accomplishment, trusting that shortly the other five communities will have their own minidairy farms. Windmills are becoming a common feature in the profile of Las Tunas City. The goal is to supply water, without using electricity, to the organic gardens of various sizes appearing in empty lots in the city. Because of the lack of resources to build every windmill needed, locals have made use of old-fashioned wells to draw water and irrigate the gardens by hand. These lots provide fresh vegetables and direct sales to the neighbors at standard prices. The vendor estimates the weight, since they lack scales. This is a practical antibureaucratic measure by the masses and for the masses. In light of this fact, as well as the minidairy farms and other efforts, Raul states with delight that this is a blow to bureaucracy which is sometimes removed from reality and the interests of the masses; a bureaucracy may be well-intentioned but capable of destroying a revolution, as has unfortunately already happened in other countries. Raul stressed that this is not a fatalist statement because in the case of Cuba we are lucky to have a commander in chief like Fidel, a sworn enemy of bureaucracy and more aware than anyone else of the masses' morale, hopes, and needs, and who trusts more than anyone else the revolutionary spirit of his people. There is no sign of disenchantment in Raul as he recalls some of the mistakes made in agriculture. He affirms with optimism that the only positive aspect of errors is the possibility of learning from them to avoid repeating them. Raul is accompanied by Central Committee members Julian Lopez, first secretary of the PCC in Las Tunas, and Vilma Espin, president of the Federation of Cuban Women, among others.
