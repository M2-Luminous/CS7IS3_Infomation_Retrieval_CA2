In his opinion, representatives of the Russia's Choice bloc "cannot come to ourselves" after the large defeat at the December 12 elections. Zyuganov believes that Russia's Choice does not understand that its influence in the parliament, in contrast to executive power bodies, is not a dominating one and it "will have to take into account" other political forces as well. In Zyuganov's words, in the course of the negotiations the Communist Party will defend interests of all factions, including the Russia's Choice. Zyuganov called a compromise variant which was considered at the negotiations, namely when representatives of each of eight factions will head one key parliamentary committee (there are correspondingly eight committees).
