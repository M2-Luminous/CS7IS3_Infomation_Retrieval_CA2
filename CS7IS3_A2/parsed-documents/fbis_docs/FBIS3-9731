"They can accelerate elections and in elections the winner will be obvious anyway," Walesa told journalists Sunday before his departure from Gdansk to Warsaw. Walesa confirmed that the rejection of the candidature of Dariusz Rosati for the post of finance minister and deputy prime minister is final and the decision will not be changed even after a potential meeting on the matter with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak takes place. "FOZZ (the Foreign Debt Servicing Fund) case was a great theft and there were people responsible for FOZZ and this candidate was one of the responsible. I am not saying whether he was guilty or not but he was on the spot where the crime was committed," said the president. "Rosati was absent from the country for three years and therefore it is difficult to determine whether he has the knowledge of things and reality in the country," added Walesa. Asked whether Leslaw Paga, the chairman of the Securities Commission, would be a good candidate for the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister, the president said, "I know this candidature and I would really have nothing against but it is not me who proposes candidates." The president expressed his indignation at a statement by leader of the SLD parliamentary floor group Aleksander Kwasniewski -- related to him by one of journalists -- who, during a break in the Sunday meeting of the main council of the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SDRP), allegedly said, commenting on the conflict with the Belvedere on Rosati's nomination, "Enough of this circus." Walesa said, "We have had enough of the circus with Kwasniewski and the like for 50 years and this circus will really not be put on. Mr Kwasniewski will not be putting it on, he may be sure of that. I will not allow him to do that." "There was a circus even with the constitution, with my initiative, which was rejected and now it has been approved. So that is the circus presented by Mr Kwasniewski and company," added the president. (When one of journalists suggested during the break in the SDRP meeting that maybe the prime minister is not sure whether he wants to cooperate with Rosati either, Kwasniewski said, "I realize we live in the country where every question might be asked, even the most crazy one. If the prime minister is not sure and signs the motion (to nominate Rosati as finance minister), how do you imagine that ... maybe it is not Rosati but Keynes that is at stake (John Maynard Keynes British Economist 1883-1946). There are limits to the circus in which we may participate. You, as journalists, I, as a politician, Mr President, the prime minister, candidates ... I think that there is more circus and playing the state than the true state in this whole affair.") Lech Walesa did not confirm whether he will sign the 1994 budget law. "I am still collecting opinions, for the time being I have serious doubts but it is not determined yet what my decision will be like." According to the president, the decision might be reached during the coming week. Asked to comment on the corruption affair in the police, Walesa said, "There is a great reconstruction in Poland, one has to blame it (corruption) on reform and on big transformations. It has to be fought with and I will be doing that."
