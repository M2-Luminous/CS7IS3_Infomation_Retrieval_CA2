What is your party's basic position? [Yonezawa] The coalition has turned into a minority government. We are in a difficult situation. The ruling and opposition parties may hold differing views on the issues of economic, administrative, and political reform, but they have a common understanding that these issues need to be addressed. Some people are talking about introducing in the Diet of a motion of no-confidence in the cabinet, but the thinking that "you must quit because you are a minority" is absurd. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] came up with the idea of forming the parliamentary group "Kaishin" which consequently caused the coalition to be driven into a minority. Don't you feel responsible for it? [Yonezawa] During the eight-month-long Hosokawa government, we came to see the importance of all coalition parties being unified as colleagues in the same coalition. That is how we came to present the idea. We thought the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] did not object to the idea. Timing, or maybe the procedure for presenting it, could have been wrong. Anyway, it is regrettable that the idea caused displeasure. We thought only simply, "New Party Sakigake [Harbinger], the SDPJ, and Komeito can join us as they please." We had not anticipated this reaction. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] We see your party is moving toward cooperating with the Japan New Party [JNP]. [Yonezawa] It is reported that the voices calling for dissolution of "Kaishin" are pouring out even in the Japan New Party. Meanwhile, relations between that party and the DSP are fairly good. I think it would be good for the two parties to build trust between them through regular policy discussions and other events. If it develops into a possibility of forming a new party, that will have to be dealt with only in a party congress. So, the relationship can develop into a sort of joint floor group. All this needs to be discussed further, and I don't know what will happen. But anyway the JNP is a partner with which friendly relations will be maintained. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It is said that the departure of the SDPJ from the coalition has resulted in a tripolar political structure [the political world divided into "Kaishin, the Liberal Democratic Party, and the SDPJ]. But what do you think about the liberals in the SDPJ and the DSP? [Yonezawa] Regarding the political world reorganization, some people talk about the two-party system, some about a tripolar system, and some about a multiparty system. That is something which only the people should decide. But if a single-seat district electoral system were to be adopted, normally what would happen is that the politicians choose and fight for one of two political axes. I wonder if the framework of the SDPJ and the DSP is sufficient to be one of the two axes. I can understand the ongoing political current that shows the people who have opposed the LDP now want to develop into a policy-oriented force. But I still don't see what kind of political reorganization the liberals have in their minds or what policy lines they want to follow. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] How does your party plan to deal with the issues of tax reform and the DPRK (North Korea) nuclear development program? [Yonezawa] To fix and retain tax reductions as a permanent thing and to expand domestic demand in this country can be said to be our international commitment. If we do not carry out tax reform, that will impact the world economy adversely, too. On the other hand, indirect taxes are a kind of costs for participating in society. Without the indirect taxes, we cannot make the ends of national treasury meet. As far as the North Korean question is concerned, the government's responsibility is to do thorough work on rules and laws. The expression -- legislation for emergencies -- may not be appropriate, but we need to have discussions completed. I have no choice but to object to the view that not even discussions are necessary. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What is your stand on the manner in which the next election should be conducted? [Yonezawa] It is only natural that the next general election should be conducted under the new system. SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama suggested holding talks to see whether the next election should be held under the medium electoral district system. That is a most conservative view. Holding an election under the medium electoral system means destroying the political reform altogether, and the people of the nation will not permit such a thing to happen. The bill on electoral district zoning should be discussed without delay. Fighting the next general election under the small district system -- even if it means shortening the duration of public announcement -- is the only way to complete political reform. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the voices of criticism raised against Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa? [Yonezawa] I have never felt they were high-handed or pushy. There may be problems with the mass news media which are playing up stories on the so-called "Ichi-Ichi duo"? [ASAHI SHIMBUN] We sometimes see differences of view in remarks made by DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi and you, the secretary general. [Yonezawa] The DSP is a party where there are so many views. If the two people spoke the same words on every issue, I don't think you would like it at all.
