During a meeting at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in St. Augustin near Bonn, Kanther stressed today that the overall number of registered criminal offenses rose to 6.7 million last year. In 1992, the number was approximately 6.3 million. The citizens "feel very insecure and are very worried." The citizens' feeling of security is greatly impaired. Kanther mentioned particularly street crime, burglaries, and offenses involving cars. In addition, "thefts are rising fast and organized crime is spreading in a disquieting manner." Criminal organizations with rigid and hierarchical structures that are based on the division of labor increasingly infiltrate Germany's economic and social system. Because of the enormous profits, this development takes place at an "alarming speed," the minister pointed out. Cross-border crime also plays an increasingly dangerous role. As a result of the collapse of communism in East Europe, the international embezzlement of motor vehicles has risen considerably. According to the findings of the investigating authorities, around 40 percent of the cars registered as stolen are never found. Cooperation with the police in the East European states must be intensified. The protection of the external borders and the fight against smuggling refugees is assuming increasing significance, Kanther stressed. Last year, over 54,000 foreigners were caught crossing the border illegally. Europe's desired integration must not have the effect that borders fall for the criminals but continue to exist for the investigating authorities, the minister emphasized. Europe needs a common asylum policy. By shifting personnel within the Federal Border Police (BGS) and through flexible deployment concepts, the BGS units should be used for the protection of the borders to a greater extent than in the past, Kanther announced. The 1994 law on the fight against crime will probably be adopted by the Bundestag before the end of this week. The law on the BGS and the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation are also designed to enhance internal security.
