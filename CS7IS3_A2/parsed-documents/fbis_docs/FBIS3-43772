Zimbabwe's biggest daily newspaper, THE HERALD, has warned that other African states may follow Tanzania's lead. Tanzania this week barred the PAC from using its Dar es Salaam headquarters as a launching pad for violence attacks against South Africa. As Lawrence Bartlett reports, THE HERALD newspaper often reflects the thinking of President Robert Mugabe's government: THE HERALD's criticism of the PAC is especially significant because Mugabe and Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African National Union -- Patriotic Front] party have historically had closer links to the PAC than to the ANC [African National Congress]. THE HERALD takes the line that what is calls the PAC's senseless violence threatens to disrupt South Africa's move toward democracy at a time when the goal of the liberation movements is within their grasp. It accuses the PAC of a misguided attempt to gain lost ground against the ANC in the run up to the election in April, saying its actions put it on much the same level as the militant extreme right wing in South Africa. The newspaper calls on the PAC to choose the ballot and not the bullet, or face the possibility of other former friends also taking action against it.
