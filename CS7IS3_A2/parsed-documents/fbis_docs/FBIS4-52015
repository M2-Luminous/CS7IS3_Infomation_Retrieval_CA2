FBIS4-52015 "dreas087_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-087 Daily Report 4 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA North Korea ROK Accused of `Disturbing' Talks With U.S. ROK Accused of `Disturbing' Talks With U.S. SK0505105694 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 4 May 94 SK0505105694 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 4 May 94 Korean BFN [Commentary by station commentator Kim Ho-sam: "Unjust and Unreasonable Act"] [Text] The insurance of durable peace on the Korean peninsula has been raised as a vital issue which should not be delayed any longer. The DPRK Foreign Ministry on 28 April announced a statement pertaining to this issue, and proposed to the U.S. side that negotiations be held between the DPRK and the United States in order to replace the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement and to provide a new peace insurance system, replacing the present Korean armistice organization which cannot play any role in preventing a war. This is a most reasonable proposal for preventing a new war from occurring on the Korean peninsula on which the situation is strained to an extreme pitch [kuktoro kinjangdoeo innun] and for insuring durable peace. Therefore, fair public opinion of the world actively welcomed this. Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities, interfering in our reasonable proposal, are attempting to disturb it. According to a report, the South Korean authorities on 3 May said that our proposal for DPRK-U.S. negotiations on replacing the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement should be discussed by the North and the South through direct talks after the nuclear problem of the North is completely resolved. They noted that they will reveal the government position at a meeting of the unification and security policy adjustment council and will inform the United Nations and the United States of the position. In an informal talk with reporters that day, the puppet foreign minister, claiming that the issue of a peace agreement is not the issue to be negotiated between our Republic and the United States, said that even if this issue is discussed at a third round of DPRK- U.S. talks, it will not be adopted as an agenda item. Such remarks by the South Korean authorities reveal their insidious attempt to hinder negotiations between us and the United States over the issue of insuring everlasting peace on the Korean peninsula from being realized and to interfere in and disturb the negotiations. As everyone knows, the armistice status has lasted over 40 years in Korea. This is indeed an abnormal situation. During this period, our Republic put forward various reasonable proposals and initiatives with a view to preventing a new war by all means from occurring in Korea, and made all efforts to achieve them. However, the United States, going counter to this, systematically abrogated [chegyejoguro pagihaewatta] what were agreed on in the Armistice Agreement. The United States brought modern lethal weapons into South Korea in a concealed manner in the past. However, it is now openly introducing new missiles in broad daylight. Because of this, the Korean Armistice Agreement has been reduced to a scrap of paper incapable of insuring peace on the Korean peninsula, and the Military Armistice Commission [MAC] has become only a nominal organization practically with no masters. Under this very situation, our Republic proposed this time for negotiations with the United States with a view to establishing a new peace insurance system on the Korean peninsula. However, the South Korean puppets are attempting to interfere in this presumptuously. This is a totally unreasonable act not only in view of international laws but also from the standpoint of the very parties that signed the Armistice Agreement. As everyone knows, in view of international laws, the armistice means a temporary suspension of combat action, not a total peace. Therefore, a peace agreement should be concluded between the parties in hostilities so that unstable peace be turned into total peace. Only our Republic and the U.S. side are eligible to conclude a peace agreement in our country. This is because the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed between the two parties with the Korean People's Army [KPA] and the Chinese People's Volunteers [CPV] as one side and the UN Forces as the other. In addition, who represented the side of the KPA and CPV at that time was our Republic and who represented the UN Forces side was the United States. The very parties that concluded the Korean Armistice Agreement are our Republic and the United States and those who signed the Agreement are none other than our Republic and the United States. Thus, it is not necessary even to mention that the South Korean authorities have no justification whatsoever to interfere in this. Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities are raving about the issue of measures for a peace agreement on the Korean peninsula, and so forth. This is indeed a laughable act going counter to common sense. Such an unreasonable act by the South Korean puppets again proves that they are not interested in peace on the Korean peninsula and reunification of the nation even to a slightest degree but are pursuing only division and war by disturbing DPRK-U.S. negotiations and talks. The South Korean authorities should not run wild without sensing where they can stand and where they can sit but act with discretion. Their reckless act will only invoke denunciation and mockery of fair public opinion of the world.
