Speakers at the meeting, sponsored by the State Council Religious Affairs Office and Legal Daily, saluted the Regulations for Management of Religious Sites and Regulations for the Management of Religious Activities of Aliens in the Territory of the People's Republic of China, signed by Premier Li Peng on January 31. They said the laws demonstrate China's respect for the religious freedom of foreigners. The rules guarantee foreigners the right to participate in religious activities and meet with Chinese religious personnel. But they also stipulate that foreigners should not interfere with Chinese religious groups or affairs. Zhao Puchu, chairman of the China Buddhist Association, said authorities constantly solicited opinions from religious associations while drafting the regulations. He also urged the State Council to speed up drafting its basic law on religion. The first article of the law on religious sites protects holy activities and spiritual areas, Zhao said. Ding Guangxun, chairman of the China Christian Council, said the two laws will not cause any big changes in religious practice. "They will not affect religion, for they add nothing new nor detract from anything we now have," he said. "Foreigners must not recruit religious followers, appoint religious teachers, or conduct any other proselytizing activities among the Chinese people," Ding said quoting the eighth article of the law. But, he added, Christians may continue to go to Chinese churches and lectures and exchange ideas. Ding stressed the two laws must be translated properly to avoid misunderstandings. Zhang Jiyu, deputy secretary-general of the China Taoist Association, said he hoped the laws will help prevent some local governments from infringing upon the rights of Taoist temples. Shu Huaide, chairman of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, said the regulations will ensure the integrity of the church and promote understanding between believers and others. Zhang Shengzuo, director of the Bureau of Religious Affairs, urged government officials and religious leaders to study the laws. Those attending the meeting also offered suggestions on how to implement them. Zhao Puchu said officials should carefully register religious sites. The government, he said, should not only register authorized temples, but also those where monks and nuns live and hold regular religious services. Furthermore, authorities should clearly define what is considered "other religious activities" in the eighth article of the law pertaining to foreigners, he added. An Shiwei, chairman of the China Islamic Association, pointed out that several mosques have been moved in the past 10 years during urban reconstruction. "We should make sure that their property rights are not violated." he said. China has 16 million Muslims, 6.5 million Protestants, 3.8 million Catholics and 6 million Tibetan Buddhists. More than 60.000 religious sites have been approved. China also has 200,000 clergymen and 47 colleges for religious studies.
