Hata, 58, will formally succeed Morihiro Hosokawa as Japan's 51st prime minister and inaugurate his own cabinet, the second coalition cabinet since last August, this evening. The leader of the coalition's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) faces mounting political and economic problems both at home and abroad. He will have to undertake the tax system reform, pass the overdue fiscal 1994 budget, reactivate the sluggish economy, intensify deregulation, and ease Japan's trade friction with the United States and the suspected nuclear issue on the korean peninsula. Policies on two key issues -- the tax system reform and Japan's response to the alleged nuclear development program in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- had been the focus of heated negotiations among the coalition partners over the past two weeks, causing turmoil in Japanese politics and delaying the inauguration of a new government. Analyst Jiro Yamaguchi said it is very likely that fighting within the coalition will emerge and political confusion reappear in June, when the Hata administration has to hammer out an agreement on the tax system reform centering around an increase in consumption tax. "If this (intro-coalition battle) happens... an early general election will seem necessary in order to let the people judge over tax and foreign policy," the professor of political science at Hokkaido University wrote in the mass-circulated ASAHI SHIMBUN newspaper. The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the coalition's largest contingent, had first demanded the abolition of the current three percent consumption tax and then insisted on the inclusion of the need for "national consensus" in the platform as a prerequisite for the hike. The coalition agreement, which was reached after the party made a compromise, calls on the coalition to carry out full- scale tax system reform "while seeking people's understanding." Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, touted as the behind-the-scene strategist for the coalition's agenda-setting, has warned that the new cabinet may face future crises as the policy platform does not adequately address upcoming problems. Columnist Minoru Morita also voiced skepticism about Hata's ability to tide over difficulties when political uncertainties arise, although the "good man" who has few enemies has vowed to strive for the unity of the coalition and "serve as glue for the coalition." "He is a very likable person indeed," Morita said. "But even so, frankly, I still doubt that Mr. Hata is a person who can go through a very tough, cold-blooded battle (to push through a tax increase)." The eight-month-old seven-party alliance is poised to split into two camps -- one led by Shinseito and the other by the SDP. The past two weeks has seen intense internal bickering over policy following Hosokawa's bombshell resignation announcement on April 8. Coupled with the increasing polarization of the political parties, some analysts have feared that the rifts over policy revealed during the hard bargaining might make Hata's cabinet short-lived. Although the coalition finally managed to paper over disputes over the major issues, the all-night, on-and-off policy meetings became a bitter reminder of immense difficulties awaiting the new cabinet, they said. "The coalition's framework has been maintained and the Hata administration is going to be formed at the end of the turbulence, but moves towards political realignment won't come to an end," said political commentator Kotaro Akiyama. Unlike hosokawa, who formed an administration last August with a pledge to achieve political reform, Hata is not able to find such a common and foremost goal to bind the coalition, which had been on the brink of collapse during the past two weeks, the commentator said. "Therefore, the coalition parties will be soon flung into political realignment and another political turmoil will follow," he added. The new party Sakigake (Harbinger), whose head Masayoshi Takemura served in the key post of chief cabinet secretary in the Hosokawa administration, left the governing alliance to "cooperate from outside." Public attention is now focused on when and how the rifts over coalition composition within the coalition will widen again -- a permanent division of the alliance that will eventually change Japan's political structure. "A power struggle structure has already surfaced to take the place of the one featuring confrontation between the LDP and non-LDP camp," Akiyama said.
