The aircraft, which are meant to emit exceptionally little exhaust fumes, consume less fuel, and be very quiet in operation, are privately referred to as "Eco-Jumbos." This assistance is to form part of an aviation research and technology program that is in the planning stage. However, the financial aspects of this program are a subject of dispute. At a meeting with Friedrich Bohl, minister in the Chancellery, the chiefs of the state and senate chancelleries failed to reach agreement with each other on this subject. The laender are demanding at least 1 billion marks [DM] worth of support for the suffering aviation industry for 1994-98. The Ministry of Research supports this demand, but stipulates a new time period for the program, 1995-99. The ministry wishes to administer the program. Reinhard Goehner, the government's air and space coordinator, told HANDELSBLATT that the size of financial assistance would be decided later, during financial consultations. But among government circles there is talk of a maximum of DM750 million, or DM150 per year. In addition, strong participation by the laender is called for.
