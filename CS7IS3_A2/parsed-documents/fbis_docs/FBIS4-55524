Interior Ministry spokesman Subrt said this yesterday. It was his reply to the question of whether the Interior Ministry is preparing some measures after the comments by Vladimir Zhirinovkiy about an "entirely new regime" in Russia before the fall. According to Subrt, our side must wait for the official comments and conduct of the legitimate Russian Government. "We are all aware of Mr. Zhirinovkiy making very strong statements now and then," Subrt said and added that "at the moment, there is no threat."
