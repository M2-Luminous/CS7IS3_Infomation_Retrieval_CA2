It is best of all to verify the facts of that kind of `sensation'. We in fact did this. But, probably, it makes sense to take the opportunity to tell the readers about BZhRK [Combat Rail-based (Ballistic) Missile Systems] such as that. It is a combat railroad missile system, currently in the inventory of the Strategic Missile Troops. It is equipped with an RS-22 (SS-24) missile. Its throw-weight is more than 4 tonnes. The BZhRKs are attached to railroad stations in large oblast centers of Russia. In peacetime they stand in well-protected zones in readiness to launch a missile or to move out on the railroad main line. When there is a threat of attack they may be switched to mobile status. The idea of positioning a missile system on a railroad platform has a long history. The Americans came closest to it at the beginning of the 1970's. However, they did not go all the way to the actual repositioning in rail cars of their `Minuteman' intercontinental ballistic missiles. Too many problems were encountered along the way. The government entrusted the creation of our BZhRK to the cooperation of industrial enterprises headed by the `Yuzhnoye' scientific-production association. The general designer of this system was B.F. Utkin. The railroad system was placed in operational service in 1984. Among the missile troops the modest name `poyezd' [train] was attached to it. And in fact, when viewing the components with refrigerator or passenger cars, it was difficult to distinguish it from the common ones. True, you do not see people around the `missile train'. They are inside, on combat alert duty. The duty combat team serves under continuous technical control of the launch systems and the missile's on-board systems. The train is provided with modern communications, and automated security and defensive equipment. What occurs, if the `Launch' command is received on board the `missile' train? The BZhRK is fixed in place [?], fastened fast to the rails. Having started the launch covers fold to the side and a twenty meter cylindrical tower containing the missile rises above the car... ...And there, according to the assertion of people in Perm, of Moscow journalists, that train appears to have been dropped. In actuality that is not the case. As we have already explained, the missile system [Kompleks] -- this is the total of functionally connected equipment and systems [Sistem] , intended for the launch of a missile, flight control and the fulfillment of other tasks. It includes the missile and ground equipment. According to their designations there are combat, research and training systems [kompleksy]. Thus, in the case of the one named in the news reports, only portions [elementy] were actually there, and those were only of a research rail system [kompleks]. In this object there was neither a missile, nor missile fuel, nor will there be. Planned firing range tests were conducted on it up till 1990. The Perm journalists' `find' was not lost, but rather was transfered in this very year to the Perm VVKUY RV [Higher Military Command Engineer School of the Missile Troops], where it was used as part of the instructional equipment. The object was written off on 22 October 1993, and all secret and valuable equipment was removed from it. In essence, the discussion is about scrap metal. In a word, the rail-cars, intended for dismantling, were preserved. That is the whole truth about the pseudo-sensation. It is understood that competent readers, without much effort, can note the `ears' [i.e. cover-up] in the publications about the `lost armored train'. The rest need not be concerned: The question concerns only the next `falsehood'. Certainly no `armored train' of the Strategic Missile Troops has been lost. One may complain only about another thing -- the fact that readers, including journalists, know little about the various missile systems and the hard work of those who serve them.
