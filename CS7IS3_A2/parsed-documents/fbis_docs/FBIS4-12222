FBIS4-12222 "drnes067dd_94004" FBIS-NES-94-067 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Palestinian Officials Comment on 'Afula Attack Palestinian Officials Comment on 'Afula Attack TA0704100894 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 7 Apr 94 p A5 TA0704100894 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by Gay Bekhor, 'Amira Hess, and news agencies] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, head of Fatah in the Gaza Strip, expressed his sorrow yesterday over the attack in 'Afula. "We regret the death of every innocent person, be he a Jew, a Christian, or a Muslim. We hope such deeds will stop as soon as the peace process succeeds." [HA'ARETZ] Do you not consider it an attempt on the part of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] to sabotage the peace process? Hamas has claimed responsibility for the attack. [Al-Agha] We heard about it on Israel Radio, but I do not know exactly who perpetrated the deed or is responsible for it. After all, it was also reported that the Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for it. Anybody can claim responsibility. [HA'ARETZ] Was it not a message to Fatah by the opponents of the agreement with Israel? [Al-Agha] Our objections and denunciations notwithstanding, the attack came in the wake of the Hebron massacre and was to be expected. When people start feeling a change in the field, there will be no such deeds. [HA'ARETZ] But this will have no effect on people who object to such actions. [Al-Agha] Any such attack, be it in Hebron or in 'Afula, is meant to harm the peace process. There are opponents on both sides. Support for the agreement will grow, however, and the opponents will be pushed to the sidelines when results are evident. Attorney Furayh Abu-Middayn, formerly a member of the Palestinian delegation to the Madrid and Washington talks, also does not consider the attack a direct message against Fatah and the path it has chosen. "It was to be expected. The Hebron massacre was a turning point, and the attack yesterday was an act of revenge. Reports that thousands of Israelis consider Barukh Goldstein a hero increased the pain." The negotiating process, Abu-Middayn said, has brought the Palestinians prolonged humiliation and has led them to the realization that it is not a fair agreement. "This is the time for talks about a permanent arrangement based on UN Resolutions 242 and 338, which recognize the national rights of the Palestinians, if they want to prevent what happened in 'Afula and what will happen tomorrow elsewhere." Abu-Middayn added that the Americans and the French were driven out of Lebanon in the same way. "Admittedly, the attack did not take place in the occupied territories, but Israel should expect the unexpectable," he said. [Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew on 7 April carries a report by Pe'erli Shahar on page 4, adding that Jad Ishaq, the PLO representative to the multilateral talks on the environment currently being held in The Hague, last night "expressed his regret over the terrorist incident in 'Afula and the loss of human life in tragic events in the region."]
