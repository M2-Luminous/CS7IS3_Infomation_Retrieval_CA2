FR940920-1-00105 FR940920-1-00008 As shown in table 6, the EU guidelines cover many of the same pollutants as the EPA emission guidelines proposed in today's notice. There are differences between the EPA and the EU guidelines with regard to regulatory flexibility for demonstrating compliance, as well as the test methods used to measure emissions. Factors like these should be considered when comparing emission requirements. The EPA and EU both have set standards for PM, HCl, SO 2 , and CO. For these pollutants, the allowable emission levels proposed by the EPA for large MWC plants are more restrictive than the EU guidelines. For small MWC plants, the proposed EPA emission guidelines are more restrictive for CO. No EU limits exist for NO x or dioxins/furans, and the EU metals emission limits are for combined metals (e.g., Hg+Cd). As shown in table 6, the proposed EPA guidelines for both large and small plants for Hg and Cd, if combined, are lower than the EU Hg+Cd limit. Some of the EU countries have adopted limits that are more stringent than the general EU guidelines. For example, The Netherlands has recently adopted standards for new and existing MWC's that are considered to be some of the most stringent in the world. For example, the Dutch Hg limit of 0.065 mg/dscm for existing MWC's (corrected to 7 percent O 2 ) is lower than both the EU limit and the EPA's proposed Hg guidelines of 0.080 mg/dscm. The Dutch dioxin/furan limit for existing MWC's ranges from 0.13 to 0.52 ng/dscm TEQ (the limit varies depending on site-specific economics of the MWC). These limits are more restrictive than the EPA's proposed guidelines (0.5 ng/dscm TEQ or 30 ng/dscm total dioxins/furans for large MWC plants and 1.0 ng/dscm TEQ or 60 ng/dscm total dioxins/furans for small MWC plants). As noted, the EU has no dioxin/furan guideline. It is difficult to compare the Dutch standards directly to the EPA emission guidelines or to the performance of U.S. MWC's because the test methods used in The Netherlands to measure emissions are different from those used in the United States. Also, many Dutch MWC's are currently completing retrofits in order to meet the Dutch standards by January 1995. The actual performance level of the MWC units will be unknown until that time. As with some of the EU countries, some of the individual States are establishing more stringent emissions standards than those in today's proposed guidelines. Brief descriptions of the regulations under consideration in Florida, Minnesota, and New Jersey are presented below. The State of Florida has promulgated a regulation that would set an Hg emission limit of 0.070 mg/dscm (corrected to 7 percent O 2 ), or an 80-percent Hg reduction, for facilities that install Hg control equipment (e.g., activated carbon injection) and that are equipped with acid gas control equipment. This limit must be met by July 1, 1995, and compliance must be demonstrated annually using EPA Reference Method 101A. For facilities equipped with acid gas control equipment that choose to control Hg exclusively through the use of an Hg waste separation program, Hg emissions would be limited to 0.14 mg/dscm after July 1, 1995 and to 0.070 mg/dscm after July 1, 1997. Compliance must be demonstrated semiannually using EPA Reference Method 101A. Facilities not currently equipped with acid gas controls will be required to meet the proposed Hg emission limits when the facility is required to demonstrate compliance with the acid gas limits included in the EPA's proposal. Florida's rulemaking procedures to develop SO 2 and HCl emission limits will be initiated by December 1, 1994 unless the Federal emission guidelines (today's action) have been proposed by that date. The State of Minnesota has also promulgated Hg requirements for MWC's. For mass burn MWC's with acid gas control, the quarterly Hg emission limit (one three-test run average) is 0.10 mg/dscm (corrected to 7 percent O 2 ). However, the annual average Hg emissions limit (average of the four most recent quarterly tests) is 0.060 mg/dscm. Measurements must be made using EPA Reference Method 29. The Minnesota requirement also allows MWC's to demonstrate compliance with the quarterly and annual limits by achieving an alternative 85-percent reduction in Hg emissions. Similar to the Florida regulations, the Minnesota regulation provides less stringent standards for MWC's without acid gas control until the time that acid gas control is required.
