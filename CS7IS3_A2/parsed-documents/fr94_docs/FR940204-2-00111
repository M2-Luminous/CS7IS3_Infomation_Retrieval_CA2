FR940204-2-00111 FR940204-2-00080 Each year the maximum charges allowed by 20 CFR 655.102(b)(4) and 655.202(b)(4) are changed by the same percentage as the twelve-month percent change in the CPI for all Urban Consumers for Food (CPI&hyph;U for Food) between December of the year just past and December of the year prior to that. Those regulations and 20 CFR 655.111(a) and 655.211(a) provide that the appropriate Regional Administrator (RA), Employment and Training Administration, may permit an employer to charge workers no more than a higher maximum amount for providing them with three meals a day, if justified and sufficiently documented. Each year, the higher maximum amounts permitted by 20 CFR 655.111(a) and 655.211(a) are changed by the same percentage as the twelve-month percent change in the CPI&hyph;U for Food between December of the year just past and December of the year prior to that. The regulations require the Director, U.S. Employment Service, to make the annual adjustments and to cause a notice to be published in the Federal Register each calendar year, announcing annual adjustments in allowable charges that may be made by covered agricultural and logging employers for providing three meals daily to their U.S. and alien workers. The 1993 rates were published in a notice on February 1, 1993 at 58 FR 6643. DOL has determined the percentage change between December of 1992 and December of 1993 for the CPI&hyph;U for Food was 2.2 percent. Accordingly, the maximum allowable charges under 20 CFR 655.102(b)(4), 655.202(b)(4), 655.111, and 655.211 were adjusted using this percentage change, and the new permissible charges for 1994 are as follows: (1) For 20 CFR 655.102(b)(4) and 655.202(b)(4), the charge, if any, shall be no more than $6.81 per day, unless the RA has approved a higher charge pursuant to 20 CFR 655.111 or 655.211(b); for 20 CFR 655.111 and 655.211, the RA may permit an employer to charge workers up to $8.51 per day for providing them with three meals per day, if the employer justifies the charge and submits to the RA the documentation required to support the higher charge. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 25th day of January, 1994. Robert A. Schaerfl, Director, U.S. Employment Service.
