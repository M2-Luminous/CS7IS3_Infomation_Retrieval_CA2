Officials in the Russian Defense Ministry's press and information service told Interfax that Joulwan would meet with National Security Council secretary Oleg Lobov, First Deputy Minister Oleg Soskovets, Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff, and MPs on June 27. Joulwan's meeting with Army General Pavel Grachev, the Russian Defense Minister, and a joint news conference with him are scheduled for Tuesday. Other plans for his stay in Russia include a meeting with ambassadors of NATO member nations in Moscow and a visit to the 27th Separate Motorized Brigade stationed in Teplyy Stan, a southern neighborhood of Moscow. Observers believe that the Joulwan visit reflects closer ties between Russia and NATO. Russian diplomats told Interfax that the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had signed a protocol on working out a Russia-NATO cooperation program simultaneously with the Partnership for Peace framework program. The two sides are said in the protocol to have agreed to continue broad Russian-NATO cooperation both inside and outside the Partnership for Peace program. Russia and NATO also agreed to continue a dialog on both political and security problems in Europe, political consultations and cooperation on security. Russian diplomats pointed out that the very fact of signing the protocol implied the existence of special relations between the North Atlantic Alliance and Russia.
