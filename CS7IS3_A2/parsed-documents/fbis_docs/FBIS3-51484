"The meeting organized by President Aristide is a positive step in the search for a solution to the crisis but should be followed up with a national conference to take place in the country," explained Monde, a well-known neo-Duvalarist legislator. In December President Aristide rejected a national conference in Haiti, citing inadequate security for participants. This was one of the most conflictive topics between Aristide and his prime minister, Robert Malval. The Haitian conference held this weekend in Miami, Florida, to search for ways out of the political crisis in Haiti, concluded Sunday night with a call by deposed President Jean-Bertrand Artistide for the unity of the Haitian people. The proposal by the Chamber of Deputies leader received the support of former Haitian President General Prosper Avril, who broke his long silence to ask that a national conference be held. Avril, who had refused to summon elections during his term, was forced to leave power in 1989 due to U.S. pressures. One of the recommendations of the Miami meeting that concluded last night is that the president should organize a national conference once he returns to the country. Meanwhile, oil sent by the international community to Haiti last week has not yet began to be distributed. The oil is intended to allow humanitarian organizations to distribute medical attention to the most vulnerable citizens in the crisis. Political observers in Haiti believe this situation is due to pressures exerted by the military and opposition sectors so that the international community will lift the oil embargo. According to sources close to the military, the international community and the U.S. Embassy in particular are seeking an agreement with the military that could include the concession of part of the cargo. The State Department and the United Nations have supplied different figures on the oil carried by the tanker. The State Department mentions 400,000 gallons of oil, while a UN spokesman has announced that the cargo amounts to 300,000 gallons. "Indeed, 400,000 gallons of oil had been requested, but after evaporation, less the oil burned during the voyage and during operation in port, the remaining oil could well be only 300,000 gallons," explained Erick Falt. Some observers believe that the 100,000 gallons that "evaporated" have been given to Police chief Michel Francois, to ensure his "cooperation" in the distribution of fuel to humanitarian organizations.
