In an interview with Interfax-Ukraine, he said the institution of presidency for Ukraine was both alien and ineffective because of historical traditions and polarization between the eastern and western parts of the country. He said the communist party had won more than ten million votes in the recent elections, an indication that "the left-wing forces are back in the country's political life for good." At the same time, Golub said the left groups which had not counted on winning a third of parliamentary seats were seeing their success as a sign of credibility on the ground. Communist deputies will be working hard to try to stabilize the economy and carry out tax and price reforms, he said. Golub blamed the country's economic and cultural setbacks on policies carried out by the regime of President Kravchuk propped up by nationalist-minded democrats and aimed to build up a capitalist society run by bureaucrats and criminal circles. He described the new parliament as a body of seasoned technocrats and politicians rather than that of saviours of the nation or backyard prophets.
