FR941116-0-00021 FR941116-0-00004 14 CFR Part 25 [Docket No. NM&hyph;100; Final Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;90] Special Conditions; Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 2000 Airplane, High Altitude Operation AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final special conditions; request for comments. SUMMARY: These special conditions are issued for the Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 2000 airplane. This new airplane will have an unusual design feature associated with an unusually high operating altitude (47,000 feet), for which the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards. DATES: The effective date of these special conditions is November 4, 1994. Comments must be received on or before January 2, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments on these final special conditions; request for comments, may be mailed in duplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attn.: Rules Docket (ANM&hyph;7), Docket No. NM&hyph;100, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056; or delivered in duplicate to the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel at the above address. Comments must be marked ``Docket No. NM&hyph;100.'' Comments may be inspected in the Rules Docket weekdays, except Federal holidays, between 7:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Slotte, FAA, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056, telephone (206) 227&hyph;2797. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited The FAA has determined that good cause exists for making these special conditions effective upon issuance; however, interested persons are invited to submit such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the regulatory docket and special conditions number and be submitted in duplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered by the Administrator. These special conditions may be changed in light of the comments received. All comments submitted will be available in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons, both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerning this rulemaking will be filed in the docket. Persons wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this request must submit with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. NM&hyph;100.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Background On September 13, 1989, Dassault Aviation, B.P. 24, 33701 Mérignac Cédex, France, applied for a new type certificate in the transport airplane category for the Model Falcon 2000 airplane. The Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 2000 is a medium-sized transcontinental business jet powered by two General Electric/Garrett CFE 738 turbofan engines mounted on pylons extending from the aft fuselage. Each engine will be capable of delivering 5,600 lbs. thrust. The airplane will be capable of operating with two flight crewmembers and eight passengers. The type design of the Model Falcon 2000 contains a number of novel and unusual design features for an airplane type certificated under the applicable provisions of part 25 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). Those features include the relatively small passenger cabin volume and a high maximum operating altitude. The applicable airworthiness requirements do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Falcon 2000; therefore, special conditions are necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. Type Certification Basis Under the provisions of §21.17 of the FAR, Dassault Aviation must show that the Falcon 2000 meets the applicable provisions of part 25, effective February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25&hyph;1 through 25&hyph;69. The certification basis may also include later amendments to part 25 that are not relevant to these special conditions. In addition, the certification basis for the Falcon 2000 includes part 34, effective September 10, 1990, plus any amendments in effect at the time of certification; and part 36, effective December 1, 1969, as amended by Amendments 36&hyph;1 through the amendment in effect at the time of certification. These special conditions form an additional part of the type certification basis. In addition, the certification basis may include other special conditions that are not relevant to these special conditions. If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Falcon 2000 because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of §21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.
