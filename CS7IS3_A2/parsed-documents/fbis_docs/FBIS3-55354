"Since Estonia and Latvia have established a visa-free regime between the two countries, erroneous references to several western countries that also don't require entrance visas are made," Helme said. "People who do so confuse the different functions of a border -- the political, the juridical, and the security ones. "This is detrimental to the de facto restoration of the Republic of Estonia as an independent state," Helme claimed. A Foreign Ministry official told BNS that Vello Saatpalu, the chairman of the parliamentary Foreign Commission, made a proposal to the government to stop designating the boundary between Estonia and Latvia, since it is "a waste of the taxpayers' money." Under the Estonian-Latvian agreement on restoring the boundary concluded in March 1992, Estonia is to mark off the border from the Pededze River in the east to the town of Valga, and Latvia, from Valga to Ikla in the west. Estonia has until now marked off an 82-kilometer stretch of the border out of a total of 158 kilometers. The cost of the work was originally estimated at 9.2 million kroons, of which 2.3 million has been spent. A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told BNS that, if the work is suspended, resuming it will cost Estonia an additional 4 million to 4.5 million kroons. Denmark's aid to the amount of 2.4 million Danish kroner will in this case also stop. "Thus, it is most doubtful if stopping the construction saves the taxpayers' money," the official told BNS. Under the agreement, the demarcation of the border should be completed by the end of 1995.
