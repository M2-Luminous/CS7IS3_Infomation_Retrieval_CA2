This was announced by the 5th Corps of the Moslem army loyal to Izetbegovic, which also said that Abdic's forces had launched an offensive along the entire front line and that the heaviest fighting was reported around Todorovo, Pecigrad, Skokovi, Culumak, Jabukovac and Buzim. There was no immediate information on casualties and on whether the front line had been moved. In the autumn of 1993, Cazin Krajina Moslems voted for autonomy of their province in protest against Izetbegovic's radical policy. They favored negotiations with Serbs and Croats, with whom they subsequently signed peace agreements. Izetbegovic then ordered his troops to crush the autonomy. Radio Velkaton in Abdic's stronghold, Velika Kladusa, reported a split between the local authorities, the command of the Bosnian Moslem 5th Corps and the Bosnian Croat command in Bihac, a town held by Izetbegovic's forces. The radio did not elaborate. The Moslem media in the Bihac region say the commissions for prisoner exchanges of followers of Izetbegovic and Abdic have met three times in the Cazin Krajina region without any success.
