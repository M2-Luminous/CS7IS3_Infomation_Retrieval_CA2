However, Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Manuel Yan said the Philippine Government will wait for Jakarta's advice on the date when it could be held. The talks were scheduled to be held yesterday, however the Indonesian Government asked the Philippine Government panel to wait for further advice as to when the formal talks could be resumed in Jakarta. The Indonesian Government called off the second round of talks without giving any official excuse. Observers say however, Jakarta is angry because a Philippine nongovernment organization is hosting a conference on reported human rights violations in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in 1976.
