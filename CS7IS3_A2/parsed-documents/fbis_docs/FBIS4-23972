The RPF recalls that the French Government supported by diplomatic and financial means the dictatorial power in Kigali which planned and implemented the genocide and massacres of several hundred thousand Rwandans. The same French Government through its instructors and intelligence agents trained and armed the killer militias of the progovernment Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for the Defense of the Republic and the presidential guards who perpetrated the massacres in April and May 1994. 2. The RPF recalls that during previous massacres French troops operated closely with Rwandan troops who played an active role in the same massacres in Bugesera, Bogogwe, Kibilira, and Mutara. It also recalls that during the resumption of hostilities in April, the French forces intervened only in order to evacuate French and foreign nationals, abandoning a large part of the Rwandan people to genocide and massacres. By taking part in adopting resolution (?1918) of the Security Council, France preferred to allow the continuation of the genocide and criminal massacres, while hiding its so called humanitarian rescue plan, which it reveals today. 3. The RPF recalls that France is a permanent member of the Security Council and that it actively took part in defining and implementing the intervention plan of UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda-II [UNAMIR-II] which was adopted by the Security Council on 16 May. 4. The RPF recognizes Resolution Number (?1918) which sets up the UNAMIR-II and will not recognize any other resolution, even an intermediary one, which authorizes intervention in Rwanda by French troops. In view of France's past, the RPF believes that the new plan for French intervention is indeed dangerous, as it is meant to protect the killers of the Rwandan people. Therefore, the RPF publicly condemns the new project of cynical and Machiavellian intervention. It will oppose its implementation by all means. The RPF once again invites the national community within the country and in the Diaspora to mobilize to torpedo the French plan, for which the Rwandan people may pay the cost. Finally, the RPF urges the international community in general and African countries in particular to dissociate themselves from the planned aggression against the Rwandan people. It asks the Security Council to weigh the consequences which the French aggression, even with the Security Council's agreement, may have for the people of the subregion.
