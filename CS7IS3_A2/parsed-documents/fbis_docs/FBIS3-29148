Some 1,000 people including Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura attended a government-sponsored ceremony at the National Education Center in Tokyo's Chiyoda ward. Takemura read out a congratulatory message from Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who is currently in Washington for talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton. "To gain more trust from the international community, we have to go the limits to fulfill our responsibilities," the message said. Also present at the ceremony were House of Councillors President Bumpei Hara and House of Representatives Vice Speaker Hyosuke Kujiraoka. However, lower house Speaker Takako Doi, who has been criticizing the February 11 national holiday as an attempt to revive the Meiji- era empire day, celebrated until the end of World War II, missed the ceremonies due to other commitments. A rally organized by the Social Democratic Party and citizens backing the country's pacifist Constitution criticized that Japan almost 50 years after the war has not "correctly" recognized its war responsibilities nor paid compensation to victims of Japanese occupation. None of the six SDP cabinet members nor SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama was present at the meeting. Some 450 people demonstrated in Shinjuku ward against the emperor and empress's use of a Self-Defense Forces aircraft to visit the Ogasawara islands from Saturday to pay respect to the souls of fallen Imperial Japanese Army troops.
