Sources revealed yesterday the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office asked China's de facto embassy in Hong Kong--the Xinhua News Agency--to start preparing a list of possible candidates late last year. Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) members have suggested the candidate could be a man or woman, should be an experienced civil servant, and not have a strong political background. The chief executive will be Hong Kong's most powerful person after 1997, replacing Britain's colonial Governor as the territory's top official. It is also believed members of China's advisory body on transitional matters, the PWC, proposed to put the issue to its government and administration sub-group at a meeting last Thursday [6 January]. But members disagreed on the issue and postponed discussions until a later date. Sources said nominations for the chief executive would be based on three principles; the candidate needed to have the approval of the mainland's Central Peoples Government, he or she must have high prestige amongst civil servants, and must be acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. Nominees will also have to satisfy some basic criteria, outlined in the Basic Law. The Basic Law says the chief executive must be a Chinese citizen of not less than 40 who is a permanent resident of Hong Kong. He or she must have no right of abode in any foreign country and have lived in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than 20 years. The Basic Law says the chief executive will be selected by "elections or local consultations". The chief executive must serve a five-year term and cannot serve for more than two consecutive terms. PWC member and former executive councillor Rita Fan said the chief executive must be "someone who is strong, outstanding, able and a very good communicator". In a recent interview with The Standard, Fan said the first chief executive after the transfer of sovereignty would have one of the most difficult jobs in Hong Kong's history. Fan, who resigned from the Executive Council shortly after Governor Chris Patten arrived in the territory, is herself tipped to be one of the candidates. But Fan said she would never take on the job. "Personally I am not interested and I don't have the ability to do it," she said. PWC member Raymond Wu said the chief executive should be an existing civil servant, have a non-political background, and have an "unconfrontational" relationship with China. He also said the PWC was not the appropriate place to talk about candidates for the chief executive, although the PWC would have a say in the formation of the selection committee which appoints the chief executive. With 1997 still three-and-a-half years away there has been little speculation on possible candidates for the top job. A number of senior civil servants in the Patten administration known to be sympathetic towards China are also likely to be on the list of candidates. Names that could be floated from the PWC itself include Fan, chairman of the pro-China Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, Tsang Yok-sing, member of the PWC's government and administration sub-group, and Chinese University professor Lau Siu-kai. Former secretary for home affairs Peter Tsao could also be in the running. Chinese officials such as Hong Kong and Macao Office Affairs director Lu Ping are out of the race because they do not fit the Basic Law criteria of being permanent residents of Hong Kong.
