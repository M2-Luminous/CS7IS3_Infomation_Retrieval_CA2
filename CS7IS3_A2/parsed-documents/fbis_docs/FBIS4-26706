An official of Gansu Foreign Funds Management Commission said that the province has introduced 1.25 billion U.S. dollars from international organizations and foreign countries and regions in the world, including the World Bank, World Food Program, the United Nations Development Program, Asian Development Bank, Canada, the United States, Japan and Germany, as well as Hong Kong and Japan. Gansu has rich resources in its vast area. Due to natural conditions, until the mid-1980s about 75 percent of its people were living in poverty-stricken areas. In the 1980s, Gansu introduced foreign funds into its agricultural development projects to improve the harnessing of water resources and irrigation. The World Bank, Asian Development Bank and Japanese and German Governments also offered loans to Gansu for the development of its rural industry and technological transformation of state enterprises. With the deepening of the reforms and expansion of opening-up, the province began to introduce foreign-funded enterprises. Before 1992, the province had only 39 foreign-funded enterprises, with total investment of about 30 million U.S. dollars. In 1992 and 1993, the province approved 823 foreign-funded enterprises, with total investment of 480 million U.S. dollars. The province also used 580 million U.S. dollars worth of foreign loans. Last year, more than 320 foreign-funded enterprises went into operation, and their export value reached more than 30 million U.S. dollars.
