"That's uncivilized and brutal act. It not only violates but also shrugs off human rights," said Theo Sambuaga, who is the deputy chairman of the House Commission I overseeing foreign affairs, information and defence and security. Witnesses said a Jewish settler firing an automatic riffle killed at least 48 Palestinians and wounded dozens at prayer in Ibrahimi mosque on Friday. But the PLO claimed the death toll reached 103 and 270 people were wounded. Sambuaga said all communities elsewhere in the world, including the United States, should condemn the masacre which was the biggest single killing of Palestinians since Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza strip in 1967. "The world community should thoroughly investigate Israel and should openly announce the result of the investigation to the world community," Sambuaga said. The mass killing of innocent Palestinians became cause for deep concern and apparently gave a blow to the peace accord reached by the two conflicting countries, he said. In fact, the peace accord had been the hope of the international community, he said. Meanwhile, Agus Tagor, another member of the House's Commission I, is of the opinion that such tragic events have been occurring in the conflict involving the two countries so far. "However, we are hopeful for the peace process because the key for the solution is peace," he said. "We condemn the massacre. However, all sides must control themselves, moreover during the fasting month of Ramadan," he added. Theo Sambuaga said he did not understand what Israel actually wants because every time there is a peace initiative, criminal acts which are contradictive to peace, always prevail. "Israel should be honest in dealing with the problem," He stated, adding that all countries including the United States should pressure Israel to open the case fairly. He is of the view that it is naive if the Israeli Government said that those should be responsible are individuals. A spokesman of the PLO in Tunis said that the massacre was led by an Israeli army captain.
