"According to us, the premiers' meeting should produce some positive result, not only improve the atmosphere. The meeting did not promise it, and therefore was not feasible," Kukan said. The meeting was canceled after Budapest had rejected Slovakia's demand that a joint communique on the inviolability of the Slovak-Hungarian border be released after the talks. It is inappropriate to dramatise the situation and "get scared", Kukan said. "I think we will find other ways of further strengthening the improving atmosphere," he added. Nevertheless, he said he did not suppose he would meet with his Hungarian counterpart, Geza Jeszenszky, before the Hungarian elections to be held in May. Asked if he did not consider the opening of a new border crossing between the two countries, Kukan said that concessions and accommodating attitudes were necessary on both sides. Referring to another case of omission of Slovakia as an applicant for membership of NATO and the European Union by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, this time during his visit to Budapest, Kukan said that in the nearest future he would meet with his German counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, to discuss the issue. Kukan also confirmed he would meet with Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock, who was to attend Saturday's [23 April] conference of the Christian Trade Unions in Casta-Papiernicka near Bratislava. It will be an introductory meeting focusing on bilateral relations, he said.
