However, Ciskei told the meeting it was withdrawing from the five-member negotiating forum to join the Transitional Executive Council. Participants in the talks hope to break the political impasse with the Freedom Alliance. The three sides, after two rounds of trilateral talks at the end of last year, gave themselves until January 24 to broker an inclusive political deal. "The leaders of the Freedom Alliance...recommitted themselves to the negotiation process, with the aim of finding an all-inclusive political settlement for southern Africa," they said in a statement on Friday. A new round of talks had provisionally been set for next Wednesday, they said. The decision by Ciskei to withdraw its membership was announced at the end of the five-hour meeting at the Bophuthatswana Embassy. The remaining Alliance leaders were at pains to stress Ciskei's withdrawal in no way affected Bisho's "commitment to the position of the Freedom Alliance and its demands for an improved constitution". "Ciskei will continue to uphold these positions in its future political activities." The leaders expressed "deep understanding" of Ciskei's position, but regretted they felt obliged to accept the withdrawal. "Since the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), Ciskei has been subjected to destabilisation action by the ANC, and the vulnerability of Ciskei to further destabilisation and pressure from the Transitional Executive Council is very unfortunate." Present at Friday's meeting were, among others, Inkatha Freedom Party president Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Conservative Party leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg, Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] leaders Gen Constand Viljoen and Gen Tienie Groenewald, Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope, Bophuthatswana chief negotiator and Alliance Chairman Rowan Cronje, deputy chairman of Ciskei's Council of State Col Simons Pita and Ciskei chief negotiator Mickey Webb.
