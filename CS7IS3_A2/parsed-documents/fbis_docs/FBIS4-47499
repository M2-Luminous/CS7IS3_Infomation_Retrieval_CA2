Ordzhonikidze, Moscow] [Abstract] Algorithms for determining (recognizing) types of service objects have been shown to contain three levels. At the first level of recognition (i.e., selecting or sorting images), a set of lines of sight corresponding to one service object is isolated at each moment of observation. In view of the inexactness of information about the positions of the information spacecrafts' own positions, the presence of random errors in on-board measurements, and the density of service objects in space, the problem of isolating this set of lines of sight is not trivial. At the second level of recognition, a correspondence must be established between the spatial positions of the service objects determined in the first stage of observation at each moment in the observation process and the trajectories of the service objects plotted on the basis of results of previous observations and representing a set of spatial positions of the service object in the previous moments of the observation process. Thus, at the second level of recognition, a spatiotemporal picture of the motion of a set of service objects is formed that encompasses a time interval culminating at the moment of the last observation. The third level of recognition entails determining the type of service object represented by a set of observed points along its trajectory in accordance with the respective probability criteria. In other words, the third level of recognition requires determining whether an object (trajectory) belongs to a given class. The characteristic features of the algorithms required for performing each of these three levels of the object recognition process are discussed. The next stages in the process of predicting the motion of service objects involves estimating the vector of the initial conditions of their motion and then predicting their future position under conditions of random disturbances based on angular optical stereo observations. The algorithms required for making such predictions are based on the use of proximity functions and the least squares method and are constructed in accordance with mathematical models and singular criteria. The problem of determining the error in predicting a service object's movement is solved by using information about typical profiles of service objects' trajectories and by hypothesizing that a service object's movement after the last observation made proceeds along that typical trajectory that best conforms to all existing observations of the given service object's movement. The problem of predicting the service object's future movement is thus reduced to modeling its reference motion by using input data to solve the least squares problem presented. The operability of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated through statistical modeling of the process of the information interaction of groups of service objects and information spacecraft. After analyzing the example presented, the authors concluded that by decomposing the problem under consideration and using very simple geometric relationships and determinate threshold algorithms, it is indeed possible to recognize types of service objects with a frequency of at least 0.7 based on data from angular optical measurements or 0.99 when integral radiation density is used. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms permit recognition of service objects with acceptable reliability and speed by using general-purpose computers. The algorithms presented are recommended as a methodological foundation for creating an information service subsystem for use in detection systems and in the event of accidental, unauthorized, provocative, and terrorist launches of objects with space-based components.
