FBIS4-2230 "drchi068_b_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 United States & Canada `United Technology Company' To Invest in Aircraft Industry `United Technology Company' To Invest in Aircraft Industry OW0704164994 Beijing XINHUA in English 1312 GMT 7 Apr 94 OW0704164994 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Ten years of successful cooperation between the United Technology Company (UTC) and its Chinese partners led the company to decide to expand its presence in China by entering into the country's aircraft industry. George David, president of UTC, made the statement here on a recent visit to sign an agreement with China. According to the agreement, UTC will invest another 12 million U.S. dollars in the Tianjin Otis Elevator Company -- one of UTC's ten joint ventures with China established ten years ago. "The step indicates that UTC is not only satisfied with the operation of this joint venture, but also confident in expanding its business in China," David said, adding that all ten UTC-China joint ventures producing elevators and air conditioners are doing very well. Their total sales last year reached 500 million U.S. dollars, and orders for Tianjin Otis stood at 300 million U.S. dollars in volume. "The success of the companies shows that our prospect in China is very bright, and we should take root here," he said. Since China will further its development of the transportation industry including aircraft manufacturing to conform to its rapidly- developing economy, UTC would positively take part in China's development in this regard, said the president, whose company ranked 16th in 1992. He recalled that the company exported turbines to China in 1986 and bought components of jet engines from the country. UTC will not only expand its business in this field, but also hope to set up joint ventures, David said. Commenting on China's investment environment, David, who has visited China many times over the last ten years, said that what impressed him most is that many Chinese officials, especially high- ranking officials, handle affairs in a decisive manner, and are very far-sighted. They are able to set foreign investors' minds at ease. The president attributed the success of the joint ventures between UTC and the cities of Tianjin and Shanghai to the support of Li Ruihuan and Zhu Rongji, former mayors of the two cities when the companies were established. The improving legal system in China has also made foreign investors feel safer, he said, adding that China's reform approach this year is designed to make conditions more favorable to foreign investors.
