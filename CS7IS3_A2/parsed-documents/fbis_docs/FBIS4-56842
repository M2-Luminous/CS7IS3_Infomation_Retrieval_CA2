[Carles] I have no personal interest in participating in any government. As president, I would have had the opportunity and the authority to do the things that we had proposed, and that we had planned, [words indistinct] I do not believe I could transfer those goals, that vision, and that determination to any group. Political problems will have to be resolved in another manner, not through my individual participation. That is another issue altogether. We are going to have to unite as Panamanians to safeguard justice, liberty, and democracy in this country. I invite Ruben Blades to stay here in Panama to fight for Panamanians. This is why Blades said as a candidate that: This is the time to face problems and to struggle for justice, freedom, and democracy... [pauses] and for all those other things that were not very clear in his speeches.
