Kostunica recalled that everyone had succumbed to Germany's ultimatum in 1992 and had wished to preserve the unity of the European Community and the spirit of Maastricht, which resulted in the dismemberment of the sovereign Yugoslav state. According to him, the fact is being overlooked that the absence of resolve sometimes does not have to be such a bad thing in politics. Apart from resolve for war, he added, people should display resolve for peace, and this was lacking. The DSS leader believes that NATO's threat was based on the naive assumption that air strikes could be carried out without a response. Kostunica pointed to the dilemma faced by the Bosnian Serb leadership. On the one hand, he said, the Serbs are determined to do everything to avoid the attacks, but on the other they cannot leave their own people unprotected. In his opinion, the NATO decision was linked with the Sarajevo market place event, no matter how much this was being covered up. This, Kostunica said, is a familiar three-act performance, where it all starts with a provocation -- coming mostly from the Muslim side -- followed by threats to the Serbs, and in the final act the Bosnian Serbs are expected to make further concessions. Answering a reporter's question, the DSS leader stressed there was nothing that could justify Serbia's and Yugoslavia's silence over the ultimatum. Commenting on the frequent visits by foreign diplomats to Belgrade, Kostunica said that according to the [federal] Constitution, decisions on war and peace were within the jurisdiction of the assembly, that the Serbian president was not authorized to conduct such talks and that he ought to explain to the people what he was doing. Speaking about certain inconsistencies in statements by [Bosnian Serb commander] General Ratko Mladic and [Bosnian Serb president] Radovan Karadzic on the withdrawal of the artillery and its placing under UN supervision, Kostunica said he could not judge this from here [Belgrade], that he was certain there was more unanimity than discord, and stressed that politicians and soldiers spoke different languages.
