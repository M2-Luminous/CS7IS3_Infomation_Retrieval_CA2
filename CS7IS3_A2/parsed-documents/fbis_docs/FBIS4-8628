The journal, although edited by Ferenc Koszeg and other prominent SZDSZ politicians, treated the two parties even-handedly and urged both of them to resolve their differences before it is too late. In the first article, political commentator Peter Kende said that the conflict between the two parties discourages voters from seeing the liberals as a viable alternative either to the present right-of-center government--led by the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF)--or to the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), whose popularity has been growing "like an avalanche." Although "in principle" Hungarian popular opinion favors the "liberal center," liberal infighting has created a political climate in which most voters think that their only real choice is between the left and the right, Kende said. The SZDSZ and Fidesz are going into the campaign with an agreement not to attack each other, but in Kende's view this is "not enough to give their campaign momentum." Voters have gotten the impression that "the two main forces in the liberal camp are in a cold-blooded competition with each other and are in fact pulling in two different directions." Kende indicated that this perception is essentially valid. Because it considers the right "the greatest evil," the SZDSZ formed a "united front" with significant "intellectual" elements of the leftist MSZP when it became alarmed by the emergence of an extreme right faction from the ranks of the government parties in 1992; Fidesz, in contrast, "true to its pragmatic profile," did not want to "overdramatize the right-wing danger" and considered it a "mistake" to put too much stock in the purported democratic transformation of the MSZP, the successor of the previously ruling communist party. In fact, in Fidesz's view, Kende said, by agreeing to a rapprochement with the MSZP, the SZDSZ fell into a "trap" set by right-wing extremist Istvan Csurka. In any case, according to Kende, the break between the two liberal parties has put both their futures in jeopardy. "The two most probable outcomes of the May elections could both be fatal to the liberals. If the left wins, the SZDSZ will be forced to play second fiddle in a government dominated by the MSZP, while if the right wins, Fidesz will have to play second fiddle in a government dominated by the MDF--unless they choose the thankless task of forcing new elections by completely refusing to participate" in the government. The two liberal parties "can only reverse" these downward developments if they "radically" change their approach in the weeks remaining before the elections, Kende said. They must do three things, he argued: first, produce a "joint program" for the voters; second, stress in their campaign, even when their nominees are campaigning against each other, that any candidate within the "liberal bloc" is "preferable" to any candidate of the right or left; and third, announce that "neither of them is willing to take part without the other in any kind of government coalition" after the election. This would make clear to the voters, Kende said, that the liberals are not willing to join a government in a subordinate position. "The voter then could decide, on the basis of this knowledge, whom he should vote for." The author of the second BESZELO article, Attila Weber, agreed with Kende that the liberals are in a weak position because of interparty tensions, which he suggested were partially the responsibility of both sides. Like Kende, he wrote that the central problem is disagreement over Fidesz's conviction that the left is a greater threat than the far right. "Even if the party did not move to the right, in any case it became more open toward the right-leaning or national Christian parties," which Fidesz--unlike the SZDSZ--considered to be essentially different from the extreme right. A scandal involving the MDF and Fidesz, both of which were accused of irregularities in selling a building assigned to them as part of a postelection agreement on the allocation of party property, also helped "sweep Fidesz into the Democratic Forum camp," along with Fidesz's decision to emphasize its "commitment to national values"--as opposed to the internationalist orientation of the SZDSZ. It was a "significant consequence" of these developments, Weber said, that Fidesz's relations with Budapest intellectuals, especially those "who dominate the [print] media, turned ugly." Hinting that the print media were instrumental in clouding the image of Fidesz--which has "steadily lost popularity" since November 1992--Weber wrote that the popular perception of Fidesz was "embellished with new lines" during published "polemics with the intellectuals." Weber held out even less hope than Kende that these tensions can be resolved in time to have a positive effect on the election chances of the SZDSZ and Fidesz. In recent months "the conflict between the liberal parties has increased" so much that during the election campaign "there can be only limited cooperation" between them. Consequently, he said, the liberals' ability to attract votes has drastically decreased, creating a situation that can "easily lead to the polarization of the political system" between the left and right, with no significant liberal camp to bridge the gap dividing them.
