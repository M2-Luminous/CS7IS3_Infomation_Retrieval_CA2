In a statement to our radio by telephone, the official in charge of the Information Bureau of the Conquest Vanguards Organization [tanzim tala'i al-fatah] condemned, on behalf of the organization, the warning issued three days ago by the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah to foreigners and its threats to strike at foreign investors and their projects in Egypt. He said: [Begin recording] The Islamic masses and the whole nation know that Islam -- as all scholars have always been unanimous -- has forbidden any act that harms the Muslims. Thus, striking at the Egyptian economy and at legal investments will harm the Muslim masses there. [end recording] The statement notes that this will isolate the Islamists and provide excuses to uproot them. The statement calls on the Egyptian leadership to apply the Islamic law and wipe out hotbeds of corruption to end armed confrontation and improve the situation.
