Therefore, Mr. President, we call on you to resign." The president: "It would have been easy, and in keeping with my character, which is hotblooded in spite of my years, to walk out of a job for which I asked no one, for which I never lifted a finger, for which my name has never figured in any conceivable political listing, slamming the door behind me at the first rustlings in the undergrowth! But in my conscience I felt it my duty not to walk out for so little, as it would have prevented the dissolution of parliament and prevented the elections." It would have been easy, but .... says Scalfaro: "Look, I found myself in a situation where, for reasons that I cannot go into here, they tried everything, at the political level, at the personal level, everything to stop me signing the dissolution of parliament. They tried everything." This denunciation of maneuvers against the early elections is an unexpected outburst on the president's part in front of the teaching staff and students of the Third University of Rome. He is replying to the girl who, departing from the initial script of an address describing Scalfaro as one of the "role models" and examples of steadfastness of which youth today is in such great need, replaced this passage with another in which the figure of the role model disappears behind that of a president who ought to resign ...., immediately creating a political furore. Is the head of state offended, is he angry? The cabinet, with an excess of zeal bordering on the ridiculous, "deplores" the "lamentable" episode that has involved Scalfaro, to whom it reaffirms "its gratitude for his valuable work in defending our institutions at a sensitive time in the life of the republic." Will Francesca be "punished" for her outrageous speech? "There is a thirst for truth," she said, "there are former state officials, self-confessed criminals, making allegations against you, Mr. President, incredible allegations." But reason of state must not have its way, and, "We hope that you ... will want to see the truth established, as the true first citizen of Italy." The audience in the great hall, just officially opened, at Rome's latest university is taken aback. Scalfaro rises. "I had intended to hold my peace, but .... I will dwell for a moment on what Francesca Maresco has so wisely said." And the president speaks, recounting, in his somewhat antiquated style, what has been happening over the previous few days and weeks. "We need ideals, examples to follow." His story is that he has found himself up against people who did everything they could to prevent the dissolution of parliament. But the president's duty is to respect the will of the people. "And the overwhelming majority of voters in the referendum imposed a principle that made for a total change in the electoral system: total! .... But there were too many interests determined to prevent the dissolution of parliament. I took the job on," says Scalfaro in vindication of his role, "and I thank God that he has allowed me to carry it through. It has not been easy, it has not been pleasant to remain at my post." It is an account of a dramatic period in his life at the Quirinale, fighting the temptation to resign, and of the immunity that seems to be a prerogative that "renders a person untouchable but puts him into a mincing machine, preventing him from exercising his rights." "Crazy" allegations, against which he cannot "yet" defend himself. Not a heroic act, but the performance of a duty. The head of state had never before linked the allegations made against him by the Sisde [secret service] officers so forcibly with the political will to keep the paliamentary term going. He had never spoken so directly in public about resigning. There are those who see this as a sign: Did he mean that he may resign after the elections? There has been no lack of maneuvering, even as regards the choice of date. Scalfaro explains that he had let it be known as early as Sunday morning that he was willing to sign a government decision permitting voting on 27 and 28 [March] until 2200. But Rabbi Toaff, "probably owing to a misunderstanding," said on the television news that "voting on the Monday was of no interest." And this issue, too, has been the subject of speculation and protest on the part of "an unquantified number of politicians, and I must say that some bishops, too, have taken the Old Testament to heart with a quite fascinating vehemence." So Francesca's more or less spontaneous words gave Scalfaro a valuable opportunity, which he seized with both hands, only complaining that there had been an element of "underhandedness": He would have preferred that the paragraph containing the call for his resignation had been in the written version. "I assure you I should have been twice as eager to come. At the present time, I am surrounded by a small number of straightforward people and I do not say a large number, I say too many underhanded people."
