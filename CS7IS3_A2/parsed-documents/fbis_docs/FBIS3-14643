If the U.S. president really made this statement, and there are indications that he did, this means that the current U.S. Administration has adopted a stance contrary to official U.S. positions on Jerusalem advocated by previous administrations. In addition such a stance is a flagrant violation of international legitimacy and resolutions relating to the Arab-Israeli conflict. This stance also affirms that the U.S. Administration cannot play the role of honest broker in the peace talks, especially when the Palestinian-Israeli accord has clearly specified that the status of Jerusalem will be at the top of the list of issues to be discussed during the final stage talks between the Palestinian and Israeli sides. This position, attributed to Clinton, was preceded by the U.S. abstention in the Security Council vote on a clause affirming that Jerusalem was part of the occupied Palestinian territories. The vote was within context of a resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. On this basis, Clinton's recent statement is not separate from the U.S. position's farce in the Security Council during the deliberations over the massacre and from what he stated during his election campaign. Therefore, those voices which considered Clinton's statements during the election campaign as being mere lip service to gain the American Jewish vote in the elections should now realize their mistake. They should also realize that what is happening now is a clear shift in the U.S. position -- one that seeks to be in harmony with the Israeli position and that ignores and denies the rights of the Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic nations in Jerusalem. In sum, a U.S. stance that is so clear and grave on a central problem in the Arab-Israeli conflict calls for a serious assessment of the U.S. role in the peace talks. The U.S. Administration's continued fulfillment of the sponsor's role in the peace talks while adopting Israel's positions means that it has lost any credibility in playing such a role and that it has lost the legitimacy of intervening in the talks, especially as it has defied international legitimacy and its resolutions, on which the foundations of the peace process are based.
