This statement was made in a Monday [16 May] interview with INTERFAX-UKRAINE by the leader of the Ukrainian RUKh (Movement) Vyacheslav Chornovil. According to him, on 20 May the Crimean parliament intends to return to the question of restoring the 1992 Crimean constitution which actually proclaims Crimea an independent state. Chornovil thinks that after deciding on dual citizenship all key posts and control over processes in Crimea would be given over to Russian teams. He was also alarmed by the fact that high-ranking officials from Russia are taking part in the work of the Crimean parliament. He stressed that in their speeches at plenary sessions of the Crimean parliament the head of the CIS committee of the Russian State Duma Konstantin Zatulin and a member of the Russian presidential council Andronik Migranian supported the idea of the new Crimean constitution and even promised all-round assistance in drafting it by several Russian MP's. Chornovil claimed that Russia has set up a constitutional development foundation which is involved in drafting the new Crimean constitution. According to the RUKh leader, Russian high-ranking officials are prompting to Crimean leaders the idea of Crimean membership in the CIS and joint command as an independent member and suggesting that Crimea raise the question of the withdrawal of Ukrainian armed forces from its territory. Chornovil said RUKh is planning to appeal to the UN Security Council, the CSCE as well as the president, parliament and Supreme Court of Ukraine to take immediate resolute steps following the attempts of the Crimean leadership to violate Helsinki accords.
