FBIS4-27288 "dreas105_c_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-105 Daily Report 28 May 1994 North Korea Pomminnyon Protests ROK Police Search Pomminnyon Protests ROK Police Search SK2805061694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0558 GMT 28 May 94 SK2805061694 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The preparatory committee for the formation of the South side headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon) published a statement on May 26 under the title "We Denounce in the Name of the 70 Million Fellow Countrymen Such Outrages as Confiscation, Search and Telephone Cutoff on the Office of the South Side Headquarters of Pomminnyon Committed by the United States and the Kim Yong-sam `Regime' To Foil the Second Meeting of the Joint Presidium of Pomminnyon". The statement said the meeting was due to be held on May 26 with the headquarters of the North, the South and overseas dispatching their views on the agenda to the joint secretariat in Tokyo, Japan, by using telephone and fax and the joint secretariat coordinating it. But the United States and the Kim Yong-sam regime sent ten odd policemen to the office of the South side headquarters of Pomminnyon on the morning of the day of the meeting to cut off the telephone, search and seize all documents, and illegally kept the telephone line cut off till 13:00, It noted, and went on: Such outrage could not be seen even under the preceding No Tae-u military regime. When the first meeting of the joint presidium of Pomminnyon was held in 1992, even the No Tae-u military regime dared not commit such outrage. Thus, the violence this time fully revealed the anti-reunification nature of the Kim Yong-sam regime styling itself a "civilian government." It does not make sense at all for the Kim Yong-sam regime to hold sway over the reunification question. Moreover, the United States, a chief culprit in the division of the Korean peninsula and which is raking in profits from it, can neither bring nor want an independent and peaceful reunification of our country, and the Kim Yong-sam regime wholly dependent on the United States, as clearly seen in the "Uruguay Round negotiations" and in the countermove over the "nuclear issue" of the North, cannot bring an independent and peaceful reunification of the country. If the Kim Yong-sam regime repent of its crimes in the past and take progressive steps for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country, though belatedly, it can be pardoned in the spirit of the great national unity, but if it continue committing anti-reunification, anti-national acts, we will fight against it together with the 70 million fellow countrymen.
