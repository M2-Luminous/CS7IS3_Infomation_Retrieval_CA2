Canadian Captain George Petrokeleas said in Visoko, 40 kilometres (25 miles) northwest of Sarajevo, that the convoy's arrival meant that "a long and frustrating time is now over." The infantry troops are to help monitor a Croat-Moslem ceasefire in central Bosnia. "We've needed them here for a long time. We didn't have enough infantry," he said. The convoy of the Royal 22nd Regiment was to pick up 69 Canadian UN troops and their equipment and take them to Visoko. Serb forces have for months blocked the rotation out of Srebrenica, a UN-declared safe haven. The Serbs said the number of UN troops in the enclave, at full strength 160 Canadians before they started leaving last week, should not be increased. But some 350 Dutch troops arrived in Srebrenica last week to relieve the Canadians. The Dutch UN force there is eventually to number about 600. The Canadian convoy was held up at a Serb checkpoint about 25 kilometres (15 miles) northwest of Sarajevo for 30 hours before continuing its trek on Tuesday. The Serbs said they did not want tracked vehicles on their roads anymore. The convoy included five Cougar tanks and 15 trucks.
