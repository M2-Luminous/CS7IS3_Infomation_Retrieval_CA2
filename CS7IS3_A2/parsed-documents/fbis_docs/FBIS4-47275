It therefore seemed expedient to prepare and study the spectral-luminescent and photochemical properties of complexes of rare earth elements with polymers. Only a few works on this problem have been published. In the present work a study was made of spectral-luminescent and photochemical properties of Eu(III) complexes with copolymers of acrylic acid and esters of methacrylic acid. The photochemical behavior of the macromolecular complexes was observed to be markedly different from the properties of the low molecular analogs, e.g. during photo-decomposition the luminescent intensity of Eu[.sup]3+[/] does not diminish, but rather increases noticeably. The effectiveness of Eu[.sup]3+[/] luminescent glow is a function of the composition and structure of the initial macromolecular complex. A low metal concentration, low acrylic acid content, and an increase in the length of the alkyl radical on the methacrylate facilitate intensification of the effectiveness of luminescent glow of the rare earth ion.
