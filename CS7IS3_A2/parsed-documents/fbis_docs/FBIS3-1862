As a result, the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources reported 134 sites where industrial deposits of minerals were discovered or confirmed. The raw materials are oil, natural gas, uranium, coal, gold, lead and zinc, copper and bauxite. In the meantime, a major breakthrough was made in prospecting for 56 known deposits of gold, copper, lead and zinc, tin, silver, uranium, oil and natural gas. An official with the ministry's geological exploration department disclosed big increases in the proven reserves of 31 kinds of minerals. Last year's oil and gas prospecting plan was fulfilled. Also, 800 million tons of coal reserves were verified, 150 million tons of iron ore, 20 million tons of manganese ore, 2.5 million tons of copper, 76 million tons of bauxite and 20,000 tons of antimony. The results of the oil and gas survey sharpened China's picture of its energy resources, the official said. The prospecting teams evaluated a legion of oil traps in the remote Tarim and Junggar basins in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region where many wells are highly productive. In the East China Sea, offshore oil departments drilled a high- yield well that can extract 646 cubic metres of crude oil and 226,600 cubic metres of natural gas a day. A 30-kilometre-long copper belt was uncovered in Yunnan Province in Southwestern China while a batch of gold mines was found in Northeast and Northwest China. In addition, geological workers have prospected eight groundwater sources in Tianjin, Shandong, Guangxi, Sichuan and Shaanxi with total explorable reserves of 600,000 tons. And the discovery of huge water sources in coal-rich Shanxi Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also allayed acute water shortages in these energy bases and permitted further development. In the Tibet Autonomous Region, a 262-centigrade geothermal well was dug to a depth of 2,006 metres. The well, the hottest of China's high-temperature geothermal wells, lays a solid foundation for installation of lO,OOO-kilowatt electricity generators.
