And so, merely to refresh memory, I recall the main point: A mountain woman was supposed to come visit the young king "neither on foot nor riding in a cart, neither naked nor dressed, and bring him a gift--which was not a gift." From the Czech viewpoint, this is somehow what even the election program for the currently governing HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia] looks like, according to which a sovereign Slovakia with independent international standing was to be a component of Czechoslovakia in a common state. It would seem that certain circles even visualize the functioning of the customs union in a similar manner. This includes not only the attempt by Ministers Ducky and Toth to limit the importation of Czech foodstuffs to Slovakia with the help of introducing special certificates to verify quality (although more than 99 percent of all products are produced in the Czech Republic as well as in Slovakia according to identical standards, and a Czech certification would thus have to suffice), but also the populist criticism by Petr Weiss, who accused the Meciar government, this time absolutely unjustifiably, of having signed the customs union agreement and having thus made it possible for the Czech Republic to export its unemployment to Slovakia, thus depriving the state of $90 million (see PRACE, 17 February 1994). Translated into intelligible language: Slovak economic circles would like to have such a customs union that would give them access to Czech markets but that would, at the same time, make it impossible for cheaper Czech agricultural production to gain access to Slovakia. As can be seen, this is a project that is similar to the notion that Slovakia can, simultaneously, make use of the advantages of a common state with the Czechs, as well as the advantages of independence. It is interesting that, although developments in 1992 clearly showed that this is impossible, some politicians continue to try to square this circle. It is time to state some things openly. Customs union means the elimination of all of the quantitative obstacles to mutual trade. The Czech Republic enjoys better conditions for agriculture, and, therefore, its production is and will be cheaper than Slovakia's. Because it does not lie within human capabilities to transform the Tatra Mountains into a fertile Hana [Moravian plain], there is no choice but to come to terms with the given status and to see what the possibilities for solving the problem are. Because the unfavorable balance of mutual trade would soon exhaust the Slovak preserves of foreign exchange, given a clearing type of accounting (as is well known, the debtor must settle any excess in the marginal credit range in freely convertible currency), there are, essentially, only two possibilities: Either Slovakia disbands the customs union and introduces customs duties and import surcharges at its borders, a move by which it would protect its domestic market, or it will devalue its currency, which will make Czech products more expensive in Slovakia and Slovak products less expensive in the Czech Republic, so that Czech production will no longer be capable of competing on the Slovak market. In the first case, this means the introduction of reciprocal measures by the Czech Customs Administration because the Czech Republic has no reason, on the basis of some kind of philanthropic purposes, to permit Slovak goods to enter its market when it cannot export its products to Slovakia. The second possibility is, of course, a politically sensitive matter because it means devaluing the savings of the citizenry, a rise in prices, and inflation. In contrast to what it is possible to read occasionally in various periodicals, the Czech side would not benefit from devaluation, but this would obviously be the cleanest solution to bring about the recovery of Czech-Slovak trade. In no event do the Czechs desire to counsel Slovakia on what to do. The decision lies fully on the Slovak side, although one thing is clear: The notion that the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic will be exchanging, free of customs duties, only the production that the other republic is lacking is absolutely incompatible with the principles of free trade. It was a similar principle, which we did away with with such great pomp, upon which CEMA functioned under communism. The development of the European Economic Area and the successful termination of the negotiations of the Uruguay round of GATT clearly show that the road to Europe does not lead via protectionist measures. The would-be clever mountain woman is, therefore, proceeding very foolishly this time.
