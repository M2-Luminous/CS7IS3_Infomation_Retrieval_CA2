This was revealed during a recent visit to Xining by Liu Zhicheng, vice-president of the China Association of Enterprises Using Foreign Investment. China's foreign-funded enterprises already in operation have reached 50,000 nationwide and created an export trade volume of 16 billion U.S. dollars-worth from January to September last year, accounting for 26 percent of the country's total. Liu said a marked increase occurred in the number of investing countries and regions. Among the investors from 117 countries and regions, those from Hong Kong and Macao are still holding the first place in number and the amount of investment. Investment in China from Taiwan, the United States, Japan and Singapore have also seen a rapid growth last year. In 1993, more foreign investment was poured into the interior areas than the coastal regions of the country for the first time, mainly due to the operation of the Eurasian Continental Bridge which can greatly reduce transport distance, time and costs from Asia to Europe, compared with marine transport. The range of overseas investment has also been expanded from the solely manufacturing industry to such fields as real estate, finance, insurance, accounting and infrastructure constructions. Along with the booming of enterprises with foreign investment, associations of these enterprises have been established in most provinces and regions in China, with the aim of providing services to and protect the interests of the foreign-funded firms and to play the role of a bridge between them and local governments.
