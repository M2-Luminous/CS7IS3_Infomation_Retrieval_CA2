Khamidov: ``Infection Gathers a Generous Harvest''] [Text] The incidence of brucellosis among people nearly tripled in recent years in Osh Oblast. Three hundred sixty-four cases of infection by this extremely serious ailment, which often leads to disability, were registered last year. The especially dangerous infection is gathering its terrible harvest in Alayskiy, Chon-Alayskiy, Uzgenskiy, Kara-Kuldzhinskiy and Kara-Suyskiy rayons. The economic damages from brucellosis have exceeded 2 million rubles. Over 10,000 man-days have been lost. The main cause of the misfortune is poor sheepherding practices. Attention to public health and veterinary measures recently dropped abruptly. Moreover the veterinary service is experiencing the most acute shortage of everything. According to data from specialists of the oblast epidemiological station, the availability of individual equipment protecting against brucellosis infection and of detergents and disinfectants to livestock breeders barely covers 30 percent of the need. Ten annual salaries (one-time assistance) plus the monthly salary--such is the amount of the pension paid to a shepherd deemed to be group 1 disabled. But wouldn't it be better to spend this money to eliminate the cause of the misfortune--to improve the condition of the herd and upgrade the quality of the sector's management?
