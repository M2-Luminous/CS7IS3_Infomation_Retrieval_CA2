The meeting was held in the Hall of Awards of the White House, which, according to the organizers' idea, was supposed to reward the press for the lack of timely comments by the country's government on the package of the president's six edicts. At a meeting with journalists Vice-Premier and Minister of Economics Aleksandr Shokhin announced that the recent signing of the package of edicts in no way attests to disagreements between the government and the president's apparatus. The documents were prepared jointly. From the vice-premier's speech it was apparent that the sluggishness of the legislative process carried out by the parliament forced the government and the president to "push on" by means of edicts the development of reforms in the country in order to stimulate deputies to adopt changes in legislation before the beginning of vacations. The minister admitted that the president's recent edict on reform of state enterprises contains only part of the measures worked out by the government in this direction. Apparently, an edict on the procedure for the sale of insolvent enterprises will be signed soon. (On 20 May the government issued decree No 498 "On Some Measures for the Realization of Legislation on the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Enterprises," which contains clear-cut criteria for placing enterprises in the category of insolvent ones on the basis of balance indicators). According to Mr. Shokhin, the evaluation of bankrupt enterprises will be made as of 1 January 1994. The client will have to pay 20 percent of the selling price right away. These funds will be assigned for the liquidation of debts to creditors. Subsequently, 50 percent of the cost is to be assigned for the upkeep of the social sphere of the sold enterprise. The minister added that negotiations on granting credits to Russia for the maintenance of the social sphere of enterprises, which were bankrupt during the transitional period, are now being conducted with the G-7. The World Bank gave its preliminary consent to the granting of such tied credits. Aleksandr Shokhin admitted that the approach to the bankruptcy procedure should be noted for special care, because it is very expensive. (According to estimates by some directors of administrations, it is cheaper to continue paying wages to workers during a complete shutdown of an enterprise than to fully carry out its bankruptcy process, where they "work"). In this connection the minister called upon the Federal Administration for Insolvency of Enterprises under the State Committee on the Administration of State Property not to make long lists of candidates for bankruptcy as long as the problem of the funds, with which their recovery will be carried out, is not solved. He referred to his own experience gained by him when he was chairman of the Commission on Problems of Coal Mining Enterprises. According to Aleksandr Shokhin, at that time the management of a number of mines openly insisted on the closure of production facilities in the hope of obtaining substantial monetary injections guaranteed during the conduct of bankruptcies by the state. The vice-premier was unable to mention the amount of funds provided by the federal budget in 1994 for bankruptcy procedures. (The number of enterprises officially declared bankrupt on the list reaches thousands. Moreover, the budget has not yet been approved by items). However, nor does the government agree with the proposals of the Ministry of Labor to the effect that an "active ousting of manpower" will soon begin in the economy. (The latest data on the rise in unemployment are presented in the survey of consumer prices on pages 53-55. In our opinion, in general, it is too late to make proposals and to debate them). Judging by the words of the minister of economics, the state intends to examine the property belonging to it without delay and, to begin with, to take an inventory of enterprises. Right now it is quite obvious that an enterprise based on full economic management, to put it mildly, is a form not profitable for the state. It presupposes a distribution of roles, under which the management of an enterprise adopts decisions independently, but bears no responsibility for their consequences. Aleksandr Shokhin believes that the right of labor collectives (according to the Law on Enterprises and Entrepreneurial Activity) to choose the production manager as they wish will also contribute to such an infringement of state rights. It seems that from now on the state will try to more strictly control the system of management of state enterprises. For example, Aleksandr Shokhin concluded, there is an urgent question concerning the personal responsibility of the representatives of state interests in joint-stock companies, the shares of which it owns. An appropriate certificate will be handed to the authorized representative. It will enable him to participate in voting with due regard for the number of votes falling to the share of the state. For now, however, according to the testimony of the minister of economics, several representatives of ministries and departments often defend state interests in joint-stock companies at the same time and, ultimately, those guilty and responsible for adopted decisions are not found. Commenting on the government decision on a reduction in export duties on petroleum, Aleksandr Shokhin assured those gathered that this measure "levels out the situation of petroleum exporters, because it is supplemented by the abolition of unsubstantiated privileges for some of them." Thus, a reduction in duties on oil is balanced out by the receipt of payments on the part of former "recipients of privileges" and the effect of the adopted measures on the state of the state treasury will prove to be neutral. True, the vice-premier added, the decree on the abolition of privileges for exporters has not yet been signed, because it will apply to an entire list of licensed goods and provides for the preparation of a list of exceptions--goods for which licensing is to be preserved (for example, narcotic substances, weapons, and so forth). In his speech Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko also set forth the position of his department on the matter of export privileges. "The Ministry of Finance fundamentally opposes the granting of privileges," he declared. Mr. Aleksashenko did not confirm the rumors on a rise in tax rates, which have agitated the market recently. In his opinion, although legislative initiative in the revision of tax rates belongs to the parliament, such changes hardly await the economy in the current year. "Budget revenues for 1994 have been determined and, consequently, a revision of rates before 1995 is impossible." Vladimir Gusev, director of the State Tax Service, responding to the question of KOMMERSANT, declared that, in fact, the state fails to collect substantial sums in the form of tax deductions. Among the reasons for the reduction in tax budget revenues Mr. Gusev mentioned not only the evasion of tax payment, but also the nonpayment crisis, which has gripped the national economy. According to his information, total arrears now amount to 8 trillion rubles. Funds reported by enterprises for payment, but in reality absent in payers' accounts, account for 28 percent of them. However, the state, Mr. Gusev reported, took a number of steps to toughen the tax collection procedure. Tax bodies received the right to levy execution upon debtors' current and deposit accounts and the possibility of levying execution upon their property is now being examined. (We present Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko's point of view of the recovery of funds from the deposit account on page 11). At the meeting with journalists government representatives paid special attention to a discussion of the problem concerning the activity of foreign banks in Russia's territory. We will recall that the history of the "movement of resistance" to the penetration of foreign banks into the country had already begun under the previous parliament. When passions were inflamed properly, in Russia about a dozen foreign banks either had already received a bank license for the performance of operations, or awaited this. Deputies of the former parliament tried to make a number of changes in banking legislation, which would introduce a moratorium on the receipt of licenses by new claimants from the international banking community. Foreign banks, which already had a general license of the Central Bank of Russia, were offered, in essence, to switch over to the offshore regime of work (with the right to service nonresidents and with a ban on operations with rubles). The parliament decree on the implementation of the mentioned amendments was disputed by the government and immediately fell under the president's veto. However, the history with foreign banks received a sudden and an extremely unexpected continuation. The president's edict, which refuted his own veto, was issued on 17 November 1993 on the threshold of the elections. It followed from the text of the document that foreign banks (as well as joint ones, where more than 50 percent of the shares belong to foreign participants) operating in Russia's territory... will be transferred to the offshore regime until 1996 if they do not manage to acquire Russian clients until 15 November 1993. Representatives of the international banking community, obviously, did not like the Russian saying "he who is not on time is late." This precisely was gently pointed out to the Russian President during his visit to Brussels. Representatives of the European Union perceived the edict on foreign banks as a measure worsening the banking climate in Russia, which, obviously, contradicted the agreement with the European Community signed by our country. The American Senate warned Russia that the barriers established for U.S. banks would involve American retaliatory measures. Then the biggest Russian commercial banks, which decided to enter the European market, felt a vague opposition on the part of local authorities. The latter felt that they were entitled to this: What can the applicants expect if they themselves have just slammed the door in the face of their foreign colleagues? The government and the Central Bank were instructed to rectify the situation until 8 June of this year. The draft of the president's edict, which lifts the restrictions on the activity of foreign banks in Russia, has already been prepared and, as Viktor Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank, reported, "will be published any day now." According to Aleksandr Shokhin, Russia signed an additional agreement with the European Community "on encouragement and protection of investments." The prime minister also reported that a 12-percent barrier on the amount of authorized capital is retained for foreign banks in Russia. (This means that the combined authorized capital of foreign banks operating in the country's territory should not exceed 12 percent of the total authorized capital of all the registered Russian commercial banks). Furthermore, for several years foreign banks have been prohibited from working with Russian securities. The next technical restriction for subsidiary banks (also temporary) concerns balances in clients' accounts. According to the draft document, they cannot be less than 50,000 ECU (58,600 dollars). This measure, according to its developers' idea, will not enable foreign banks to actively work with private individuals. The government decision to rectify the situation with foreign banks was given a hostile reception by the Association of Russian Banks. Sergey Yegorov, its president, speaking at a press conference on 1 June, spoke in favor of a time-out in the admission of foreign banks into Russia. He again repeated the well-known argument of the fighters against the penetration of foreign banks into Russia: The need to introduce a preferential period for the development of Russian commercial banks. In the opinion of representatives of the Association of Russian Banks, the resistance to the opening of affiliates and departments of Russian banks in the territory of other states should be overcome by means of ultimatums. Apparently, this type of agreement presupposes a scheme similar to the procedure for the exchange of hostages: A permit for the opening of an affiliate of a Russian bank in a respective country should correspond to a permit for the opening of a foreign bank in Russia. In the opinion of KOMMERSANT, this cannot be, because this can never be. Even if foreign bankers agreed to communicate in the language of ultimatums, the question of the criteria of an "equivalent exchange" would arise then and there. It is unlikely that any of Russia's most promising commercial banks will be able to honorably withstand such a competition. Upon the conclusion of the government press conference KOMMESANT experts got the impression that the second batch of presidential edicts would be much more substantive and, apparently, more intelligible than the first, which consisted of six edicts and was represented in the notorious "reformer" package of 23 May.
