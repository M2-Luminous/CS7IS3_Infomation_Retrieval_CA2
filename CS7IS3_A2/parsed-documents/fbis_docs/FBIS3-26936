The increase in investment in houses of commercial value declined compared with the previous year. But its investment in infrastructural construction including energy, transportation, and telecommunications increased by a wide margin over the previous year. Last year the province's total investment in transportation, energy, telecommunications, urban roads, water and power supply, and other basic facilities amounted to 8.959 billion yuan, an increase of more than 100 percent over the previous year. To speed up basic facilities construction, Hainan has introduced a preferential policy to encourage people in all social circles to invest in key construction projects, thus expediting energy, traffic, and telecommunications construction. The completion of a number of infrastructural projects last year greatly improved the province's investment environment. [words indistinct] Newly built expressways totaled 129 km, newly formed port handling capacity totaled 800,000 metric tons, 4,320 long-distance electric transmission lines were installed, 105,000 gates of program control telephone exchange equipment were installed, and the popularization of telephone sets in the province outstripped the country's average. Telephone subscription rate in Haikou was 16.6 percent in the previous year and rose to 27 percent last year, ranking first among provincial capital cities throughout the country.
