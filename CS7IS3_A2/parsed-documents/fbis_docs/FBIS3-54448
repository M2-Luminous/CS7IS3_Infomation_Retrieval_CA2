Minister for Interior Maj-Gen (rtd) Nasirullah Khan Babar told the National Assembly on Sunday [23 Jan] that the government has decided to remove all illegal immigrants who were allegedly engaged in terrorist activities. "We will not allow anyone to use our soil for carrying out terrorist activities against any country", he maintained. Mr Mehmood Khan Achakzai had raised the issue in the House and demanded of the government to remove all illegal immigrants. He was of the view that their (immigrants) activities were creating tremendous problems for Pakistan. Maulana Fazlur Rahman, Secretary-General of JUI(F) [Jamiat-i- Ulema-i-Islam] however defended them and said today those who were being branded as terrorists were once declared freedom fighters. He said that the government was taking action against Arab dissidents on the pressure of the US and demanded not to take any action against them. But the Minister for Interior said there was no question of being lenient on the question. In this regard, he particularly mentioned Egypt and said Cairo was Pakistan's very good friend and it has raised the issue of Egyptian dissidents who were operating from Pakistan against Husni Mubarak government. "Our government believes that these illegal immigrants are undesirable elements who could not be allowed to live on our soil", the Minister said. He said Afghan Jihad was over and nobody would now be allowed to live in Pakistan without having legal documents. "These people should go to Afghanistan as we will not be offering them any refuge." He further said hundreds of illegal outsiders have already been removed from the country and others would soon be expelled.
