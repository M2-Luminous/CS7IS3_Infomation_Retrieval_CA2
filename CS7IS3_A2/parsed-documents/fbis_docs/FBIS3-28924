In a meeting with the leaders of the government and ruling coalition parties, Hosokawa said, "Japan considers the best plan is through dialogue, no matter what the situation is." In Washington over the weekend, however, the prime minister told reporters that Japan will take all possible measures to the extent of Japanese law if the United Nations Security Council proposes sanctions against Pyongyang. Meanwhile, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party, told reporters Monday that imposing sanctions against North Korea would be counterproductive. Kubo proposed that a resolution be sought through the friendly connections between the North Korean Workers' Party and the Chinese Communist Party. He stressed further that there is no way of knowing what kind of ill effects sanctions would have on both North Korea and Japan. "Even though negotiations for establishing diplomatic relations between Japan and North Korea have broken down, efforts to improve relations would open the path" to resolving the nuclear issue, Kubo said.
