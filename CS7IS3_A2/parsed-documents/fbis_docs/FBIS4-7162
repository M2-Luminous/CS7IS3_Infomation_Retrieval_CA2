The senior officials agreed that Burma should come as a guest of Thailand and not of the Asean Standing Committee (ASC) as proposed by Thailand. Their rationale was that the country was still administered by a military junta and had yet to show enough "positive gestures" to justify an invitation from the ASC. But if Burma has yet to show enough "positive gestures" to deserve an invitation from the ASC, why is it being allowed to attend as a guest of Thailand? Why the double standard? Disappointingly, the Asean governments best positioned to persuade the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) to return democracy to the people have been far from helpful. Only constructive engagement, these nations say, will slowly persuade the Slorc to soften its harsh rule and join the ranks of civilized nations. The latest Asean leader to visit Burma was Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong who was accompanied by 24 businessmen, all eyeing contracts with the despised junta. If trading with the Slorc through Asean's constructive engagement policy has made the Rangoon military junta less of a monster, then why is it that international human rights organizations still maintain there is a climate of fear and repression in Burma? If constructive engagement is working, then why does the military regime continue to refuse to hold talks with its democratic opponents? Last month, the Slorc chief, Lt Gen [Lieutenant General] Khin Nyunt told THE NEW YORK TIMES that he would not meet or grant any political standing to Aung San Suu Kyi, the democracy leader and Nobel Peace laureate who has been under house arrest in Rangoon since 1989. That flat statement dashed the hopes of many who thought the Slorc might be easing its iron grip. For the first time since her arrest, Suu Kyi had recently been allowed to see a non-family visitor, US Congressman Bill Richardson of the House Intelligence Committee. It seems that Khin Nyunt, also head of Burmese military intelligence, seems determined to keep her under arrest. "There are 42 million people here," he told THE NEW YORK TIMES' Philip Shenon, "and they are not bothered by Aung San Suu Kyi." As far as Suu Kyi is concerned, Asean leaders consider her an "internal matter" of Burma and not a major issue related to the return of democracy. This is indeed sad and unfortunate as it clearly shows the regional grouping is adhering to a blinkered Burma policy when world leaders are standing up for the Nobel laureate. The administration of US President Bill Clinton for instance has reviewed American policy towards Burma and reportedly decided to increase pressure on the Slorc. Washington is also pressuring other nations to stop sending arms to the brutal military regime. Under a system of representative democracy only those who are elected by the people have a right to represent them. Only they have the right to write a constitution and make the rules by which the people will be governed. The charade of a national convention going on in Rangoon to draft a constitution is a shadow play with Slorc moving its handpicked puppets. Economists within the junta boast they have created an economic miracle in a few years, adding that a certain amount of authoritarian rule is beneficial to development. And Asean leaders too have been parroting this Slorc phrase. If this is true, why then are Burmese factories operating at less than 40 per cent capacity? And why has Slorc decided to print new money in larger denominations and appealed to the World Bank to draw on its gold reserves? The ruling Burmese military junta has no regard for the will of the people, is answerable to no authority and has no responsibility to explain its behaviour. For Asean to reward the Slorc generals with better trade and diplomatic relations and allow Burma to be present at the regional grouping's July meeting as a guest of Thailand, is indeed a slap in the face of democracy.
