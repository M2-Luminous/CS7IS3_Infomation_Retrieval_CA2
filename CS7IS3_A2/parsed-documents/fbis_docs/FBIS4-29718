Crown Prince Dipendra Bin Brikram Shadey, 22, arrived in Thailand on Sunday to attend a four-day geography course until June 23 at the AIT before beginning his official visit from June 24-27. The two suspects, identified as Mohamad Javet and Shakil Ammad, on Sunday allegedly hired a passenger pick-up truck to the AIT where they told the reception office they were the prince's guests. Security officers asked the suspects to show their passports. Javet claimed he did not have it with him and left in a car parked nearby purportedly to get his passport. The security officers became suspicious and contacted Khlong Luang District police to come and arrest the remaining suspect, Shakil Ammad. Ammad was taken for questioning at the district police station. Ammad claimed to be an engineer with a well-known construction company. But the company when contacted by police investigators, denied the suspect's name was on its list of employees. Ammad was intensively interrogated throughout yesterday after the Police Department ordered Khlong Luang police to urgently investigate the case. Police manning checkpoints have been ordered to be on the alert to prevent the other suspect still at large from fleeing. Police said they had "hard evidence" to support their belief that the two suspects were involved in a plot to harm the Nepalese Crown Prince. According to police information, Javet had been in Thailand for several days while Ammad arrived in Bangkok on Saturday.
