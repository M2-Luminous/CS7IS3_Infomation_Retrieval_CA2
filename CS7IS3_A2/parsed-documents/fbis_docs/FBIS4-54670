The ministry also says it is surprised by the insinuation, which links the ministry with the incident. We condemn all forms of violence and firmly deny any association with the events the HSP leadership is trying to use to compromise the state leadership of the Republic of Croatia and its Defense Ministry. The short time that it took the HSP to present the incident as an attack on the Washington agreement and to say who is to blame -- without any evidence -- clearly shows that this media campaign is politically motivated, aimed at presenting the Croatian policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina as war-mongering and duplicituous. We hope that the implementation, in the near future, of the agreement signed between the Croat and Bosniak-Muslim people in Bosnia-Herzegovina will most effectively contradict all insinuation and slanders recently used to try to compromise the Defense Ministry and the Croatian leadership's policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement says. The HSP claims in a statement issued today that the authorities in Herzegovina have banned an HSP promotional event in Capljina. As it now expects the other scheduled events to be banned, the HSP tour in Herzegovina is now cancelled, the statement says among other things.
