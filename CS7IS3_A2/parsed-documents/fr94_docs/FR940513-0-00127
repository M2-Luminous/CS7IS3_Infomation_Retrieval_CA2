FR940513-0-00127 FR940513-0-00034 II. Background A. Overview of the Appliance Labeling Rule EPCA, enacted in 1975, is generally designed to promote improved energy efficiency of consumer products. 42 U.S.C. 6201 (1988). As amended by EPA 92, it establishes energy consumption standards or water use standards for certain categories of major home appliances and other products, 42 U.S.C.A. 6295 (West Supp. 1993), and directs the U.S. Department of Energy (``DOE'') to prescribe test procedures to measure the energy consumption or water use of those products. 42 U.S.C.A. 6293 (West Supp. 1993). EPCA also directs the Commission to prescribe, or in some cases to consider prescribing, rules requiring appliances and other products to be labeled with disclosures of estimated annual energy cost, another useful measure of energy usage or efficiency, or of water use rates. 42 U.S.C.A. 6294 (West Supp. 1993). Following enactment of EPCA in 1975, the Commission adopted the Appliance Labeling Rule. 6 The Rule requires that certain major home appliances, including furnaces, refrigerators and air conditioners, be labeled with EnergyGuides. 7 In addition, the Rule requires fluorescent lamp ballasts to be labeled or marked with the symbol ``E'' enclosed in a circle, to denote that the ballast meets an energy efficiency standard established under EPCA. 8 The Rule, as recently amended, also requires showerheads, faucets, water closets and urinals to be marked permanently and/or labeled with certain disclosures about their water use. 9 6 44 FR 66466 (1979). The Commission has amended the Rule on several occasions to add labeling requirements for additional product categories. 52 FR 46888 (1987) (adding a new product category of central air conditioners and heat pumps and two additional subcategories of furnaces, pulse combustion furnaces and condensing furnaces); 54 FR 28031 (1989) (adding a new product category of fluorescent lamp ballasts); and 58 FR 54955 (1993) (adding new product categories of showerheads, faucets, water closets and urinals). 7 For example, labels for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, freezers, clothes washers, dishwashers, and water heaters must disclose the estimated annual operating cost ( e.g., ``$240.00''). 16 CFR 305.11(a)(5)(i)(E). Labels for room air conditioners, central air conditioners, heat pumps, and fact sheets for furnaces, by contrast, must disclose the energy efficiency rating ( e.g., ``10.5'' for a central air conditioner or ``96.5'' for a furnace). 16 CFR 305.11(a)(5)(i)(E), 305.11(a)(5)(iii)(C), 305.11(b)(3)(v). In two separate proceedings, the Commission is considering proposals to amend the current disclosure requirements for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, freezers, clothes washers, dishwashers, water heaters and room air conditioners, 53 FR 22106 (1988) and 58 FR 12818 (1993), and to issue labeling rules for pool heaters, instantaneous water heaters, and heat pump water heaters, 58 FR 7852 (1993). 8 16 CFR 305.11(d). A fluorescent lamp ballast is a device that is used to start and operate fluorescent lamps by providing a starting voltage and current and limiting the current during normal operations. 16 CFR 305.3(j). 9 58 FR at 54965&hyph;66; to be codified at 16 CFR 305.11(e). Except for fluorescent lamp ballasts, the Rule requires catalogs and point-of-sale promotional materials for products covered by the Rule to contain disclosures of required energy consumption and efficiency information or water use information. 10 Further, the Rule requires, for furnaces, disclosure of energy usage information on fact sheets, 16 CFR 305.11(b), and, for central air conditioners and heat pumps, similar disclosures on fact sheets or in industry directories, 16 CFR 305.11(c). For fluorescent lamp ballasts, the Rule requires catalogs and point-of-sale promotional materials to contain the same symbol that is required on labels. 16 CFR 305.13(c), 305.14(c). 10 58 FR at 54964; to be codified at 16 CFR 305.13(a), .14(a)&hyph;(b), (d). EPCA authorizes the Commission to assess monetary civil penalties for violations of the Rule. 42 U.S.C. 6303(a), (d) (1988). The Rule provides that manufacturers or private labelers who knowingly distribute products covered by the Rule that are not properly labeled are subject to a penalty of not more than $100 for each unit. 16 CFR 305.4(a)(1). Manufacturers, distributors, or retailers who knowingly remove or make illegible a required label similarly are subject to a penalty of not more than $100 for each unit. 16 CFR 305.4(a)(2). Manufacturers or private labelers who fail to include required disclosures in their catalog advertising are subject to a penalty of not more than $100 per day. 16 CFR 305.4(b)(5). Manufacturers or private labelers who fail to keep records or provide reports or product samples as specified by the Rule also are subject to a penalty of not more than $100 per day. 16 CFR 305.4(b)(2). EPCA also grants to the U.S. District Courts authority to issue injunctions against such violations. 42 U.S.C. 6304 (1988). B. Lamp Labeling Amendments to Appliance Labeling Rule Required by EPA 92 Amendments to EPCA The EPA 92 amendments to EPCA require that the Commission issue labeling rules no later than April 25, 1994, for ``general service fluorescent lamps,'' ``medium base compact fluorescent lamps,'' and ``general service incandescent lamps,'' as those terms are defined in EPCA. 42 U.S.C.A. 6294(a)(2)(C)(i) (West Supp. 1993). These are the lamps used in the majority of household and commercial settings. See Part IV.A.1.&hyph;3, below. The lamp labeling rules must require conspicuous disclosure on the packaging of the lamp of ``such information as the Commission deems necessary to enable consumers to select the most energy efficient lamps which meet their requirements.'' Id. The rules must apply to lamp products manufactured after the twelve month period beginning on the date of publication of the rule. Id. The Commission also is requiring disclosures in catalogs from which these lamp products can be ordered.
