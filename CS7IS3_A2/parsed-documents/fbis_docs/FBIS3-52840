U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that the United States attaches great importance to the meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton due to Syria's basic role in the peace process and to the expected results of the meeting in terms of pushing the Middle East peace process forward. The Americans, in general, think it likely there will be substantive progress after the summit. However, we do not want to prejudge things or express excessive optimism due to Israel's history of destroying peace opportunities and creating obstacles. Progress in the peace process ultimately hinges on a change in the Israeli policy toward implementing UN Security Council resolutions and recognizing the formula of a just and comprehensive peace in the region. No one sensed this so far. Moreover, observers agree that Israel will not submit to the resolutions of international legitimacy and will not put aside the policy of prevarication and procrastination without an effective and decisive U.S. role that puts an end to Israel's evasion of these resolutions. Syria has dealt with the issue of peace in the Middle East with absolute sincerity and positiveness. Syria's contribution has been effective and fruitful, as the world, including the United States, attests. Syria facilitated the convocation of the Madrid conference when Israel closed all doors. And since the sixth round of talks, Syria has presented constructive and balanced proposals. Syria also twice helped the United States save the peace process from collapse. The first time was when Rabin's government sent large forces to southern Lebanon and committed a wicked barbarian aggression that led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese civilians. The second time was when the Washington talks were halted as a result of the separate deal in Oslo and when Israel overtly declared that it is not concerned with the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, thus obstructing the peace talks in Washington. The Oslo deal reveals an ambiguous and incomplete agreement, for which its two sides; that is, the Palestinian and Israeli sides, have conflicting interpretations. This agreement was rejected by the Palestinian people in the occupied territories and the diaspora since it contradicts the Security Council resolutions and does not meet the minimum level of rights and ambitions. It was not to be nice that Warren Christopher visited the region and held lengthy talks with President Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus; talks that were crowned by the arrangement of a summit in Geneva. The United Stated realizes that separate deals cannot achieve peace and that there is no alternative to returning to the basics of the Madrid conference, the Security Council resolutions, and the formula for a just and comprehensive peace which Syria continues to call for. Out of the above comes this not-so-optimistic outlook expressed by Damascus and other Arab capitals. The United States' reaffirmation of the formula of a just and comprehensive peace and of the need to implement Security Council resolutions is a positive factor that helps put the peace process on the right and beneficial track. However, one must not forget that Israel has a long record of striking at the peace opportunities, aborting the peace efforts, and containing the U.S. stands. It is no coincidence that Israeli officials expect the situation to heat up in southern Lebanon on the eve of the Syrian-U.S. summit. In most cases, Israel has resorted to escalation whenever there are signs of real progress. Throughout the past, Israel sought to diminish Syria's role, cast doubts on Lebanon's effectiveness, and convince the United States to concentrate its efforts on the Gaza-Jericho agreement. However, the events revealed to the public that only a just and comprehensive peace can save the Middle East from the whirlpool of conflicts and wars and that separate deals do not lead to peace but add more to the serious tension in the region. President Clinton, who will begin a tour of Russia and many European countries today, will surely listen to statements that will reinforce the United States' conviction of the need to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East based on Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. President Clinton will find out that President al-Asad is completely willing to push the peace process forward and achieve tangible results based on Security Council resolutions. Syria is eager to achieve peace inasmuch as it is eager to restore its territories and end the Israeli occupation of all Arab territories. Peace is synonymous with justice. Justice stipulates the removal of the Israeli occupation so every party can restore its rights.
