The announcement came in response to a statement by the spokesman of the Yemeni Embassy in Beirut in which it was said that since the beginning of February the central government in Sanaa had stopped paying salaries to the Yemeni diplomats abroad who are originally from the southern governorates. The spokesman noted that this is a step toward division by influential parties in Sanaa.
