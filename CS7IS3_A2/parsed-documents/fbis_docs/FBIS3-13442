FBIS3-13442 "drnes049_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-049 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Mar 1994 SYRIA Knesset Member Darawshah on Prospects for Peace JN1103104894 Damascus Syrian Arab Television Network in Arabic 1930 GMT 10 Mar 94 JN1103104894 Damascus Syrian Arab Television Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Interview with 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, member of the Israeli Knesset and head of the Israeli Arab delegation, by unidentified Syrian Arab Television correspondent in Damascus on 10 March--recorded] [Text] [Reporter] Syrian Arab Television is pleased to host 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, who has led a delegation of Arabs of Palestine to offer condolences to their kinsfolk in Syria. Syrian Arab Television welcomes you to your homeland Syria. [Darawshah] Thank you. I also thank all our kinsfolk in Syria, this sisterly country. We are proud of this country, of its president, of its steadfastness, and of its continuous struggle. [Reporter] Let us begin with the following issue: Syria and the Syrian stand, vis-a-vis the Palestine question and the Palestinians themselves, have a special place among our kinsfolk in Palestine. How do you explain this feeling which prompted you to come to Syria to offer condolences to your people here? [Darawshah] As part of the Arab nation and the Palestinian people, we are linked with our Arab nation through strong ties of Arabism, blood, and sincere friendship, as well as through the desire to achieve a just and comprehensive peace. We are closely following all developments related to the peace issue within the framework of the Arab-Israeli talks, as well as the distinguished Syrian stand and the true peace adopted by President al-Asad and the Syrian Government and largely supported by the Syrians. We are following these matters with satisfaction and with support. At the same time, we feel that this stand represents Arab dignity and pride. There is a desire to achieve a just and comprehensive peace, but without relinquishing any Arab rights. Therefore, when we heard about the loss of martyr Basil al-Asad we, the sons of this nation, were stricken by the event and felt it to be the tragedy of all of us. We felt that we were dutybound to come to offer condolences to the president, to his family, to the Syrian Government, and to the fraternal Syrian people. I am very grateful and greatly appreciate the fact that His Excellency President al-Asad agreed to allow the delegation to come to Syria to offer condolences. We were pleased with this because we, the Palestinians inside Israel, have suffered from the long siege not only by the Israeli Government but also by the Arab world which has not treated us fairly. We had been prevented from entering the Arab world. This is a good beginning and a positive step which we truly praise. We also thank President Hafiz al-Asad for this. [Reporter] You have spoken in your answer about peace and the desire to achieve just and comprehensive peace. You are up-to-date on the stands of Israel vis-a-vis the peace process. Does peace have a chance? What are the obstacles to peace? Is Israel serious in its efforts? [Darawshah] I would like to say that the stand of this Israeli Government is better than the stand of the Shamir government. However, although the Rabin government has created better circumstances at the negotiating table, it has not made the required concessions to give a momentum to the peace process. The abstruse obstacle lies in the fact that the Israeli Government has thus far not declared openly that it is ready to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to recognize the Palestinian people's right to self- determination, one they deserve just like any other people under the sun. Therefore, we call for the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace and for Israeli withdrawal from all ccupied Arab territories, from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, southern Lebanon, the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, and the occupied Jordanian territories. Only then could a true atmosphere be created to push the peace process forward and to achieve full peace. This is what we are trying to make the Israeli Government understand. We say this from Damascus, and we also say the same thing in the Knesset in Jerusalem. We say it in Washington, in Paris, in Cairo, and everywhere. This is because the cause of right and justice is indivisible. [Reporter] Mr. Darawshah, you know that the peace process, from the very beginning, was based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the land for peace principle; namely, full Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories in return for full peace. Can either of the two parts of this equation be implemented without the other? [Darawshah] There will be no peace under occupation. The continuation of occupation means the continuation of war, massacres, suppression, and repression. Furthermore, peace cannot be achieved with the continuation of settlements. What does settlement mean? It is a form of colonialism that occupies land, deprives people of their rights, and establishes settlements of the colonialist settlers who occupy the Arab land. Based on this, we say that there is an essential contradiction between peace and occupation, and between peace and settlements. The Israeli Government should announce its readiness to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories, dismantle settlements, and return all settlers to Israel within the 1967 border. There should be no negotiations, wrangling, and stubbornness over gaining land or over keeping settlements in the occupied Arab territories. [Reporter] I wanted to ask you about settlements, and about this Israeli policy, whose results we are seeing now, and the best proof of this is the recent Ibrahimi Mosque massacre? Can settlements and peace, which Israel claims it wants, go together? [Darawshah] We have always said, and I repeat that settlements constitute an unsurmountable obstacle to peace. Peace will never be achieved with the continuation of settlements, especially since we are talking about an extremist group of settlers most of whom came from the United States or Russia. Those who came from the United States are really extremists. Most of them are affiliated with fascist rightist forces such as the racist Kakh movement, the Kahane movement, and the security on roads movement which carry out daily hostile acts against the sons of our Palestinian people in terms of killing, massacres, terrorism, demolishing houses, and indiscriminate firing. Regrettably, the Israeli Army forces and other security forces protect them, but they do not protect the Palestinians. They also supply them with arms and with all that they need. Even if they carry out barbaric and brutal acts against the Palestinians, they do not stand trial and they will not be arrested. We believe that the continuation of settlements conflicts with peace. The Israeli Government should openly announce that it is ready to evacuate the settlements. [Reporter] Let us talk about the Israeli political structure with which you are in contact. What is your assessment of the stands of the government or the opposition regarding the peace process? [Darawshah] So far the government coalition is narrow. It consists of 56 members of the Knesset -- the Labor and Meretz Parties. It is supported by the Arab parties -- the Arab Democratic Party and the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality. Together they form the so-called buffer [al-mani'ah] bloc which consists of 61 members of the Knesset. Yitzhaq Rabin is attempting to expand his government. It seems that he has succeeded in this and he is expected to announce at the Knesset on Monday the return of SHAS, the religious Eastern Jewish party, to the government coalition. This party has six members. Thus, the coalition government will consist of 62 members. If the government continues to receive the support of the Arab parties the government will win a big majority, 67 members of the Knesset. This majority would enable the government to continue the peace process and to make concessions that will respond to the true Arab demands; that is, the demands of the Palestinian people and the regional states -- Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. Therefore, the government will have more parliamentary support than today. However, despite this ... [Reporter, interrupting] Excuse me Mr. Darawshah, Rabin's attempts to expand the coalition by including Tzomet and others have specific objectives and repercussions. In addition to making decisions, which you called concessions, but we do not, the expansion of the coalition will have specific repercussions, because these groups have objectives and demands. How will Rabin's objective match the objectives of these groups? [Darawshah] Before I came to Syria, when I was asked about including Tzomet or Mafdal, I said that this is a maneuver by Yitzhaq Rabin to return the Shas to the government and to weaken the effect of the left-wing movement Meretz and the Arab parties within the buffer block. He wants to enjoy more support within the Knesset. He does not want the Arab members of the Knesset to have a larger effect. At the same time, he wants to go to Washington with a broader government and coalition. I also believe that if he wants to take certain steps against the settlers -- something which he is required to do -- he needs more support from the Knesset. He does not want others to say that he is taking these steps or embarking on these peaceful operations with a government that depends on Arab votes in the Knesset. He wants to say -- and he said it publicly -- that he seeks to embark on steps through a government coalition, depending on Jewish votes. We say this is a racist approach. He cannot end our existence in this method. At the same time, we support expanding the coalition if Shas joins the coalition. If Rabin agrees to let Tzomet or Mafdal, two extremist parties hostile to the Arabs inside and to the whole Arab nation, join the coalition, we will withdraw our support for the government and present a no-confidence motion in an attempt to topple the government. We have always been part of the buffer block to prevent the right-wing parties from reaching the government, not for supporting the right wing inside the government. I think that the peace process will continue despite the existing difficulties. But Yitzhaq Rabin is required first to state that he is prepared to accept the formula which President Hafiz al-Asad stated yesterday during his meeting with us. He stated -- frankly, publicly, and in a courageous and dignified manner -- that we support the complete peace in return for complete withdrawal and the land-for-peace formula. This clarity, this clear strategic view of peace, dictates that the Israeli Government should take a stand. [Reporter] Mr. Darawshah, your statements are very precise on Israel's attempts to avoid Syria's position, especially what happened in Geneva. Before Geneva, Israel tried to circumvent what would happen in Geneva because it sensed Syria's courageous and clear position. Can you explain the future strategies in the light of what happened in Geneva and Syria's stands? [Darawshah] In his meeting with President Clinton in Geneva, President al-Asad in fact represented the Arab nation. He represented its aspirations and the position that reflects the will of this nation and its aspirations to secure a better future and achieve a just and comprehensive peace, as well as Arab dignity. Therefore, we were all happy to see the president speaking in Geneva and meeting with the president of the most powerful country in the world, the United States, and representing with dignity and pride this nation, this deep-rooted nation, the Arab nation, of which we are proud to be part. I believe he was clear and forthright when he stated the Arab nation's stand on peace and the peace position of the Syrian people and government. But, Israel attempted to conceal this position and avoid making a positive stand that corresponds to that position. Therefore, they tried to undervalue the president's statements. The Israeli foreign minister's reaction today to President Hafiz al-Asad's statements yesterday on the peace strategy and the complete withdrawal in return for complete peace was lukewarm because he does not want to show the Israeli people the crystal-clear fact that Syria wants peace, a just and comprehensive peace, a peace of the brave, a peace that was publicly stated by President Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva and yesterday during his meeting with the delegation that came to offer condolences to him. [Reporter] Mr. Darawshah, let us return to the Zionist political structure and Zionist thought. Zionism, as you well know, is standing at a crossroads. This does not mean abandoning Zionism. Old Zionism is known, but what is new in the Zionist thought and direction? [Darawshah] There is a split today inside Zionism and inside the Israeli political structure, and even inside the world's Jewish and Zionist movements. There is a rational trend that says we must achieve peace with the Arab world and we must end occupation. Some people affiliated with this trend -- a strong segment indeed -- support the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside the state of Israel in the West bank and Gaza Strip. They also oppose settlement activities. The demonstrations staged by tens of thousands of people last Saturday was a joint demonstration by the Arab and Jewish peace-advocating forces, and we participated in it. That demonstration raised clear slogans: No to the horrendous massacres by settlers against the Palestinian people and no to the policy of suppression and repression. It also demanded the evacuation of settlements and the recognition of the just and comprehensive peace that would end occupation and guarantee the establishment of the independent Palestinian state. On the other hand, there is a significant trend in the Israeli opposition today. This represents the right-wing Israeli parties, led by the Likud. It also includes the Mafdal, Tzomet, and the extremist fascist party, Moledet, which advocates the transfer and the expulsion of Arabs. These parties still raise the slogan of the integral land of Israel, from the sea to the river, and some of them say from the river to the river [from the Nile to the Euphrates]. These people do not want peace, and they only talk about peace for peace. This is a big camp within the Israeli political spectrum, but it is now in the opposition. Yitzhaq Rabin oscillates between the two wings: the left wing which calls for a just and comprehensive peace, and the extremist rightist wing which wants to keep all the occupied Arab territories, and does not want to concede an inch of land, as they say. What they want is the integral land of Israel. The Israeli Government's stand is linked with the pressures exerted by each camp. Rabin is for the coalition and for the left, but he himself has rightist trends. It is known that he is a hawk within the Labor Party, while the dove's wing is now led by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and his deputy Yosi Beilin, and some other ministers like Yosi Sarid, 'Uzi Bar'am, and others. [Reporter] Mr. Darawshah, I, as an Arab citizen, along with the Arab citizen who is watching us now, cannot imagine that there are hawks and doves, or that there is any difference between Yosi Sarid, Yosi Beilin, Rabin, Shamir, Kahane, or even Begin. This is because we cannot distinguish between these people, especially since the Arab citizen is persecuted by all of them. Some citizens believe that a solution is impossible in light of Israel's policy of trying cancel out the other party [Palestinian people]. What is your comment? [Darawshah] Despite all the criticism of Israeli policy, which I also criticize, I can understand Arab sentiments and feelings concerning everything that is related to the Israeli position. As an Arab, I also feel this inside me. However, I do not generalize. In politics, we must put facts down and work with the surgeon's scalpel. We must cut things and analyze them with our own Arab scalpel. We must examine things very carefully. There is a panoramic view, which I do not dismiss, but, in order to establish this general approach for the Arab nation, we must be aware of the details. Concerning the details, there is a difference between an Israeli Jew who believes in peace, wants peace, and demonstrates for peace, and calls for evacuating the settlements and the occupied Arab territories, and works for this, and an Israeli Jew who adheres to occupation, who does not offer anything in return for a peace agreement, and believes in the integral land of Israel. These differences do exist. [Reporter] It could be the difference between one who murders brutally and another who murders with dexterity. Any way, let us hear from you Mr. Darawshah about our people in the occupied territories who suffer from discrimination. What do they say, how are they doing? [Darawshah] The sons of our Palestinian people inside Israel, who number approximately 800,000 Palestinians, live mainly in the Galilee, the Triangle, and Negev, or in the mixed cities such as 'Akko, Haifa, Yafo, Lod, and al-Ramlah. We are the owners of the homeland, of the land. We did not leave our homeland, and we do not want to achieve the objective of the extremist Jews and settlers, that is transfer or expel Arabs. Therefore, our slogan has been, and will continue to be: We will remain here, for as long as olives and thyme remain. We stick to our land, our homeland, with roots deep in our national soil. We also want to improve our quality and increase our number to be able to stand up against the major challenges facing us. We have suffered from racial discrimination and the military occupation policy and a military rule that was imposed on us until 1966. After the military rule ended, we began to struggle for civil and national rights. We were not recognized and most of our land was confiscated. We suffer from a flagrant policy of racial discrimination in all fields of life. I do not say this only here in Damascus. We say it also from every rostrum; that the racial discrimination policy is directed against any non-Jewish person inside Israel and we resist this racial policy. Despite all this, we continue our struggle to gain further rights. At the same time, we do not relinquish our right to a dignified, free life and the right of our Palestinian people to gain their independence, freedom, and get rid of occupation. [Reporter] You have mentioned the land and said you are the owners of the land. Mr. Darawshah, the anniversary of Land Day, 30 March, is approaching. What has happened to the Yisra'el Koenig Document, and much is it being implemented? And, what do you have to say about land and Land Day? [Darawshah] So far, it has not been officially announced that the Koenig Document has been annulled. Even recently, it was announced that there are plans to build 26 new Jewish settlements in Galilee. The current Israeli Government says it stopped the confiscation of land. However, we fear another type of land confiscation, the confiscation of land for the so-called public interest; large highways, for example, the 300-meter wide inter-Israel highway which passes mostly in Arab land. This, therefore, is a new type of confiscation. At the same time, over 50 percent of the Arab lands that are owned by Palestinian Arab citizens have been confiscated since the establishment of Israel under feeble excuses, under various excuses and justifications -- security, settlements, or the so-called public interest. Therefore, we call for the return of this land because most of it has not been utilized yet. The land must be returned to its rightful owners. In our struggle to stick to our land, or what remained of the land because most of the land has very unfortunately been confiscated, we want to stick to our homeland. Any attempt to detach us from our land means an attempt to detach us from our homeland. Therefore, we stick to the land in order to survive. So, sticking to our land is a principal part of our steadfastness inside our homeland. The Land Day anniversary -- this immortal day-- comes to remind us that the land is still threatened and that land means honor. Therefore, we want to defend the land and the honor and the dignity of this nation. [Reporter] Mr. Darawshah: During this visit, you visited al-Qunaytirah and met with President Hafiz al-Asad. Can you tell us what you have heard and seen. Let us start with your visit to al-Qunaytirah. What did al-Qunaytirah tell you? [Darawshah] The destroyed, and at the same time, liberated, al-Qunaytirah, left a major, and, equally, a painful, impression on me. So did the destroyed houses, in which more than 50,000 Syrian Arabs citizens, who were forced to flee their homes, lived. This was a horrendous crime which is unacceptable to anyone. I condemned this hideous crime and said: Peace and good-neighborly relations cannot be established in this way. Such an act will not produce positive results because it is a terrorist, aggressive, barbaric act against the Syrian people and the Arab nation. Israeli media organs asked me: How can you criticize the Israeli policy on this issue in al-Qunaytirah? Why do you not say this in Jerusalem? I told them that I said this in Jerusalem and criticized the demolition of Arab villages. I am criticizing the demolition of al-Qunaytirah because this is a barbaric act which is not accepted at all. I believe that the policy which prompted the Israeli Government to demolish al-Qunaytirah is an aggressive policy. I hope this will not be repeated in the future. This does not only mean occupying land; it also means obliterating Arab features. [Reporter] As takes place in Palestine. [Darawshah] As took place and is taking place in Palestine. Many Arab villages were demolished. In Galilee, in the village of (?Itsal) in Marj Ibn 'Amir, where I live, many houses are demolished. Many other Arab villages in the area remind us of the terrible tragedy. When I came and visited al-Qunaytirah, which was destroyed, I cried and was pained because this reminded me also of our Palestinian villages which were destroyed. [Reporter] About your meeting with the president. [Darawshah] The meeting gave us a feeling of the pride of affiliation with this nation, the genuine Arab nation of which we are proud. Despite all circumstances, we did not kneel down, we did not bow, and we were not humiliated. We adhered to our Palestinian and Arab identity and to our lofty pan-Arabism. Our meeting with the president reminded us of Arab loftiness, dignity, and free will. We were in front of a great man who has a strategic view and enlightened thinking. He is gentle and modest. In fact, all members of the delegation felt these positive characteristics during the meeting with President al-Asad. He increased our pride of our affiliation and our love for al-Asad's Syria and President al-Asad. We came to offer our condolences to his excellency and to our Syrian people. After offering our condolences we emerged from the meeting full of the feelings of faithful brotherly relations and genuine pan-Arabism, loftiness, and dignity represented by President al-Asad. On this occasion, I would like to greet President Hafiz al-Asad, may God preserve him, the heroic fraternal Syrian people, our Palestinian people living in Syria in solidarity with the Syrian people. The Palestinians living in al-Yarmuk Camp and in other places told us they feel that Syria is their homeland and that they are given their rights like the Syrian citizens. Therefore, the delegation came on behalf of the Palestinian masses to offer condolences on the death of Basil al-Asad, martyr of the Arab nation. We heard and read a great deal about Basil's views, nationalism, and struggle. Again, we greatly appreciate President al-Asad, the Syrian Government, and the fraternal Syrian people. We are proud that we and the Syrian people are affiliated with this Arab nation. We wish Syria, this country of brave, and al-Asad, every progress. [Reporter] Mr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah. You are welcome again in Syrian Arab Television and in your country Syria. Thank you. [Darawshah] Thank you.
