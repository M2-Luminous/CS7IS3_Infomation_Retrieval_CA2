Interior Minister Major General Hasan al-Alfi worked hard to conclude the agreements with these countries during a recent Arab interior ministers' conference in Tunisia. The countries with whom agreements were signed include a neighboring country, a non-neighboring country that is suffering internal conflicts, and a major Gulf country, which set the condition that the agreement must not be made public in order to avoid terrorist reprisals! Following security negotiations with Egypt, Denmark arrested Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim, the most prominent al-Jihad leader abroad, and several other leading figures of that organization. Some Danish parliamentarians are opposing their being handed over to Egypt, however, on the grounds that Egyptian law provides for the death penalty, which these parliamentarians regard as violating human rights. Egyptian security departments have sent high-level delegations to Afghanistan and Pakistan to sign similar agreements. Domestic events in Afghanistan have held up talks with that country.
