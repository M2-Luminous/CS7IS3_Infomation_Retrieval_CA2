Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs told a briefing that the government would make an official announcement next Tuesday. At the recent round of the bilateral talks the two sides initialed the drafts of three out of four documents -- the main treaty setting the withdrawal date of August 31, 1994; agreements on the social protection of servicemen during the troop withdrawal; and on pensioners of the Russian Defense Ministry living in Latvia. In the draft agreement on the status of the Russian radar station in Skrunda, according to which the strategic base may continue for 5.5 years to come, the provision on the lease payment remains uncoordinated. At the briefing Birkavs admitted that Latvia is proposed to agree to a compromise under pressure of the presence of the Russian troops. The prime Minister noted that the signing of an agreement will be advantageous for Latvia. First, Russia will assume international commitments to withdraw troops before the end of summer, while representatives of international authoritative organizations will monitor the radar dismantling. If the treaty is not signed, Latvia will be internationally isolated since it will acquire an image as an unreliable partner. No doubt, in this case the Russian troop withdrawal will be suspended and would be unlikely to be completed this year, said Birkavs. He believes the documents may be signed later in April in Moscow at the meeting of presidents Boris Yeltsin and Guntis Ulmanis.
