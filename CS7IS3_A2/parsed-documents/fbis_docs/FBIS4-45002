In less than two days, the new head of government has conferred with officials in two sectors where the alarm bells are already ringing. Mr. Mokdad Sifi intends to make the health and housing sectors important policy areas. The housing issue was discussed yesterday at Government House, at the prime minister's meeting with several members of the government and officials in concerned departments. The meeting afforded an opportunity for a diagnosis of ills plaguing the sector. It was disclosed there is a shortage of 1.2 million housing units, while the rate of construction is at best 40,000 units per year, though the pace was as high as 90,000 in the early 1980's. Also, it was reported that the productive plant as a whole is in sad shape, as a result of swollen personnel ranks and a deficit equal to 130 percent of annual turnover. Emphasis was placed on the inadequacy and irregularity that plague provisioning of construction materials, a commercial sector where 55 billion centimes are siphoned off by various intermediaries. Also raised was the issue of insufficient land on which to build, owing to cumbersome regulations, confusion regarding the roles played by various administrative offices, and inconsistent financing practices. This review of the state of affairs led several meeting participants to advance a number of suggestions to facilitate implementation of the current housing program and rapid completion of urban development plans for all urban concentrations of more than 50,000 inhabitants. It was decided to establish intersectoral working groups with a view to resolving, on an urgent basis and within a specific timeframe, the diverse bottlenecks in land availability, financing, construction materials, and production plant. At the end of the meeting, the head of government also pledged to organize a second meeting to evaluate the work accomplished and take the most appropriate practical steps to revive the housing sector. Several initiatives need to be approved--and implemented--to get the sector out of its present quagmire. These include easing financial constraints that weigh on housing enterprises, reforming the said enterprises, reviewing construction standards, and--before anything else--establishing a genuine national development policy. Health, the other sector to which the new head of government plans to give priority attention, was also discussed; the sector is weighed down by innumerable problems having to do with both human and material resources, and it undeniably suffers from poor management of what resources are available. The prime minister's laudable initiative to deal with two such thorny issues as health and housing will unquestionably need to be followed up by monitoring in the field. The alarm has been sounded.
