Is it too early to give us a balance sheet? [Speroni] No, I would like to say that at the next Council of Ministers I will present a bill aimed at revising the constitution and which would allow the regions to establish their own electoral laws. [De Scalzi] What other powers have you promised to the local authorities? [Speroni] I have promised the regional authorities that there will be a revision of the Constitution in order to make it more federal. We are already in the process of setting up a committee to look at this. Afterwards, with the procedures laid out under Article 138 of the Constitution, we will go toward a revision which, on the basis of federalism, will hand more to the local authorities. [De Scalzi] Are there any administrative measures in the bill? [Speroni] Administrative measures are not the responsibility of the Ministry for Institutional Reform but are the responsibility of the Civil Service Ministry
