FR940628-1-00007 FR940628-1-00001 Interstate Movement of Eggs Other Than Hatching Eggs The regulations currently require table eggs to be washed and sanitized for processing before they are moved interstate from an area quarantined because of END. (See current §82.4(b).) We propose to clarify this requirement in several ways. First, we propose in proposed §82.8 to amend the requirement so that it refers to eggs, other than hatching eggs, from birds and poultry in a quarantined area that are not known to be infected with END. Second, we propose to require that the eggs be cleaned and sanitized in accordance with regulations issued by the Agricultural Marketing Service, as set forth in 7 CFR part 59. These provisions are clearer and more specific than our current requirement that the eggs be ``washed and sanitized.'' They are the industry standard for cleaning eggs, and are suitable for eggs from quarantined areas. Also, the provisions in 7 CFR part 59 include a requirement that the eggs be sanitized using a solution containing available chlorine of between 100 and 200 ppm. This solution would kill any END virus. We would also require that the eggs that are being moved be packed either in flats or cases that have not been used before, or used plastic flats or cases that were cleaned and disinfected, since last being used, in accordance with the cleaning and disinfection provisions set forth in 9 CFR part 71. Additionally, we are proposing to require that any containers intended for reuse after arriving at a facility be cleaned and sanitized before being returned to premises where birds or poultry are kept. Interstate Movement of Equipment Current §82.4(d) allows the movement of metal and hard plastic coops interstate from a quarantined area if those items are first cleaned and disinfected under the supervision of a Federal or State inspector. Based on our experience enforcing the regulations, we believe it is necessary to enhance our monitoring and tracking capabilities by expanding the criteria that would have to be met before metal and hard plastic coops may be moved interstate from a quarantined area. We would set forth these criteria in proposed §82.10. Additionally, in proposed §82.10 we would extend these requirements to cages, containers, troughs, vehicles, and other equipment used for birds, poultry, eggs, manure, and litter from a quarantined area. These items can be cleaned and disinfected to destroy the END virus as effectively as can metal and hard plastic coops, using the same cleaning and disinfecting methods. For such items to be moved interstate, they would have to be accompanied by a permit; they would have to be cleaned and disinfected in accordance with 9 CFR part 71; the equipment would have to be inspected by a Federal or State representative after it was cleaned but before it was disinfected; and it would have to be disinfected in the presence of a Federal or State representative with a disinfectant listed in 9 CFR part 71. We are proposing to add like requirements for cleaning and disinfecting these items after they have been used to move birds, poultry, eggs, manure, or litter interstate from a quarantined area. Proposed §82.10(b)(1) would require that the equipment be cleaned and disinfected at the place where it is unloaded or otherwise used, within 2 hours after unloading or use. This 2 hour time limit is proposed to provide a person with a reasonable time in which to complete the cleaning and disinfection. We recognize that in some cases such locations may not have the facilities necessary to readily carry out the required cleaning and disinfection. Therefore, we would provide in proposed §82.10(d), that if the place where cleaning and disinfection would otherwise be required has no facilities for cleaning and disinfecting, the items may be moved to a place where facilities are available for cleaning and disinfection, provided a Federal representative or State representative has determined that such movement would not cause a risk of the spread of END. Under our proposal, the requirements described in the preceding paragraph would not apply to equipment used by or to move pet birds moved interstate. We believe that the proposed conditions governing the movement of pet birds interstate would be adequate to ensure that the pet birds so moved pose an insignificant risk of being infected with END. Other Interstate Movements The current regulations provide, at §82.4(f), that the Deputy Administrator may allow, under special conditions, the interstate movement of any poultry not known to be infected with END, even if they could not otherwise be moved under the regulations. However, the current regulations do not allow for similar movement of articles other than poultry. We believe that the regulations should allow for the movement of articles other than poultry that could be moved without risk of spreading END, but that would otherwise be prohibited movement under the regulations. Therefore, we are proposing to expand this provision to provide for the interstate movement of any restricted articles, if the Administrator determines that the articles can be moved without spreading END. (See proposed §82.12. See also discussion in this document under ``Internal Agency Policy.'') For these articles to be moved interstate, they would have to be accompanied by a special permit, as we explain below under the heading ``Permits and Special Permits.'' Current §82.4(f) also contains material pertaining to agency management that the Administrative Procedure Act does not require us to publish in our regulations. We are therefore proposing to delete the statement that the Deputy Administrator will notify State officials when a permit is granted.
