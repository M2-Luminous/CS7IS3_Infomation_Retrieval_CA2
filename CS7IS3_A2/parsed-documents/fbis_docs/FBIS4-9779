FBIS4-9779 "drlat064_a_94009" FBIS-LAT-93-064 Daily Report 4 April 1993 CARIBBEAN Cuba Agricultural Antitheft Measures Discussed Agricultural Antitheft Measures Discussed FL0104215994 FL0104215994 BFN [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 1700 GMT on 1 April carries its "Straight Talk" program live, with host Osvaldo Rodriguez and his guest, reporter Eloy Concepcion. Rodriguez begins the program by commenting on the Agro-94 program: "We are taking up the topic of Agro-94 to discuss embezzlement and the theft of vegetables and tubers and many different kinds of agricultural products. Eloy, I believe the measures taken to prevent theft have had some results and more products can be found in the Havana City marketplaces. I believe a good many products are reaching those marketplaces, not fabulous amounts, but enough to complement the availability of food." On this, Concepcion remarks: "Yes, the measures adopted in Havana were at the demand of the population. This is something we must point out. There was a certain generalized lack of social discipline manifested in the theft and embezzlement of products. Many areas and streets of the capital were turning into marketplaces for products obtained through the black market." Concepcion goes on to say: "I believe these measures are part of a cause that I would call noble: First, to curtail this embezzlement, if not completely, at least enough to establish the necessary order by which all products produced by the Basic Cooperative Production Units, the Agricultural-Livestock Cooperatives, and the state farms reach the population. This should be their final destination, for which the state and government have invested so many resources." Regarding the marketplaces, Rodriguez states: "I recently heard of some situations where a delegate of the people's government is at the marketplace. The phenomenon between the farms and the marketplaces was one, but there was a separate network of dishonest people who would steal from the marketplaces. Of course, this was not at all of the marketplaces. It would happen in only a few of them. But there was a network of dishonest people who would embezzle vegetables and agricultural products to later sell on the black market and who formed part of this illegal trade in vegetables. I believe this has been stopped." Regarding the distribution of agricultural products, Rodriguez goes on to say: I believe the collection centers [Acopio] must solve their problems now. Right now, in the midst of the Agro-94 movement, Acopio must solve the problem of transporting products to the marketplaces. To this, Concepcion responds: I do not agree with you on Acopio solving its problem. I believe Acopio, as it exists today, must be abolished. I do not believe there is any other solution or condition than for Acopio to disappear, from the point of view of its current structure, which is inefficient. Acopio has demonstrated its inefficiency and that it is responsible for this whole problem of theft, embezzlement, and misappropriation because the product goes through an infinite number of hands and through an infinite number of structures and paperwork that no one tracks or controls, and which cannot be controlled by anyone." Straight Talk concludes at 1715 GMT.
