FR940912-1-00017 FR940912-1-00009 40 CFR Part 52 [WA17&hyph;1&hyph;5867b and WA16&hyph;1&hyph;5866b; FRL&hyph;5065&hyph;4] Approval and Promulgation of State Implementation Plans: Washington AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Washington for the purpose of implementing an emission statement program for stationary sources within the Vancouver Air Quality Maintenance Area and the Central Puget Sound Ozone Nonattainment Area. The SIP revision was submitted by the State to satisfy certain Federal Clean Air Act requirements for an emission statement program as part of the SIP for Washington State. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received in writing by October 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to Montel Livingston, Environmental Protection Specialist (AT&hyph;082), Air Programs Section, at the EPA Regional Office listed below. Copies of the documents relevant to this proposed rule are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following locations.
