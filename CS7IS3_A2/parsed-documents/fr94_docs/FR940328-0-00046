ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations to make safe handling instructions mandatory on all raw meat and poultry product labeling. The handling instructions include a rationale statement and address safe storage of raw product, prevention of cross-contamination, cooking of raw product, and handling of leftovers. The rule provides additional safeguards to protect consumers from exposure to possible bacterial contaminants found in raw meat and poultry products. This action is being taken in an effort to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. DATES: This regulation is effective May 27, 1994. The compliance date for comminuted meat and poultry products is May 27, 1994, and the compliance date for all other meat and poultry products is July 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patrick J. Clerkin, Director, Evaluation and Enforcement Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, (202) 254&hyph;2537. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 In publishing the proposal on November 4, 1993 (58 FR 58922), the Agency stated that it had determined that the proposed rule was a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 because the action would likely raise policy issues arising out of the principles set forth in the Executive Order. The proposal advocated a significant new policy direction that would require safe handling instructions on raw and partially cooked meat and poultry products to further combat foodborne illness. The Agency published an economic analysis for comment in the preamble to the proposed rule. That analysis incorporated comments received in response to an earlier interim rule (58 FR 43478). As discussed in the proposal, a preliminary economic analysis was published for comment in the preamble of that interim rule. Most comments addressed the cost of the rule. In contrast to the earlier interim rule, the proposal generated relatively few comments that criticized the analysis and the assumptions behind the analysis. Presumably, the fewer critical comments reflected the modifications that were made in response to data supplied in comments on the preliminary analysis published with the interim rule. Comments on the modified analysis published with the proposal are discussed in the following paragraphs.
