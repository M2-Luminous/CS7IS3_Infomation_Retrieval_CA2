Boris Kakubava, who had been elected to the Georgian parliament by the population of the Abkhaz region, said that the Union of Liberation of Abkhazia, headed by him, did not wish to confront the current Georgian authorities. That was why the union was not planning protest rallies on the eve of the official visit to Georgia by the Russian President Boris Yeltsin; although, after Boris Yeltsin's departure these rallies would undoubtedly be held if Georgian authorities failed to meet the following demands worked out by the union: a. By no means should Russian or any other country's armed formations be brought into the territory of the Abkhaz region. b. Russian armed formations currently stationed in the Abkhaz region should leave the territory of the Georgian Republic. c. The Russian-Georgian border on the river Psou should be restored. d. Russia should admit her participation in the war against Georgia and repent for the crime. e. Beginning of the negotiations with the Gudauta authorities should be considered as a serious mistake by the Georgian authorities, and a vote of no confidence should be passed in the entire Georgian delegation at the Geneva talks. f. The status of Abkhazia within the composition of Georgia should be decided in the process of working out Georgia's new constitution.
