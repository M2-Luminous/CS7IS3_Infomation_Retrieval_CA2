The advanced party of almost 1,000 technicians from former Yugoslavia are repairing old machinery in the Libyan desert, building factories, and carrying out maintenance work on Libyan bombers. However, Saleh Ferjani, head of Libyan Arab Airlines, has grander plans. The manager is thinking of forming a Serbian-Libyan air company, as well as a joint fleet, and of closer military cooperation. Leader of the revolution Mu'ammar Qadhdhafi is pleased with the cooperation. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is fond of recalling the historic friendship between the two peoples -- an axis is being established between the two pariahs of the international community. Both regimes are internationally disdained: That is the case with Belgrade, because of its aggression in the Balkans and with Tripoli, because of its support for Arab terrorist organizations. Because unlike Libya, rump Yugoslavia has lost its UN seat, it does not feel bound by the Security Council's sanctions catalogue and can at least conduct trade freely in one direction. Belgrade has found a useful loophole: Serbian companies are investing millions, flight capital from arms sales and smuggling is flowing into Colonel Qadhdhafi's country. From Libya, Serbian trading activities are being extended to other countries in the Middle East and the entire world: from Cairo to Nicosia and via New York and Ottawa, as far as the Caribbean Cayman Islands. Succeeding the largest Yugoslav foreign trade concern, General-Export, which was dissolved in 1989, the Serbian syndicate now operates under the name of Genex. Acting in a manner that is a combination of gangsterism and secret service activities, 45 department heads and 200 former Communist Party functionaries are organizing the worldwide transfer of booty from the war in Bosnia and the laundering of money from criminal business transactions -- it is the main lifeline for the regime of Greater Serbian warlord Slobodan Milosevic. "Only this network of deals permits the financing of the war in Bosnia," reports a Belgrade agent who is tired of taking risks, "the secret reserves have been used up and the economy is on its knees." There is no doubt that the Serbian military apparatus consumes huge sums every month, the domestic defense industry lacks spare parts as well as electronic logistics, and the generals also are becoming increasingly worried about troop morale. With earnings of under $10 a month, there are fewer and fewer troops going to war voluntarily. Since the beginning of the year, most wages in Milosevic's poor house are being paid out in goods. Wage packets usually consists of 10 kilos of potatoes, as well as bread and milk coupons -- four-fifths of families live below the official poverty line. Inflation, which reached the surreal level of 1 million percent in December, has eliminated the last savings that people had. Milosevic was aware of what was happening at the beginning of the war: In view of the UN sanctions, the regime could only survive on dollars earned abroad through trade. Above all, Arab states that were founders of the nonaligned movement along with Tito's communist Yugoslavia, became important centers of activity for the Serbian leader. "We are running around there, the way the Italians used to in Chicago," says the Genex dissident. One important Genex center is on Cairo's Nile island Gasira. Retired Colonel D. Dragan Petronjevic, who represents the import-export company Direkcija za Robe Rezerve, a company that deals solely in parts for defense machinery lives there in a luxurious residence. Vladimir Jovanovic, military attache at rump Yugoslavia's Cairo embassy, is behind all the deals and transfers money to accounts in the Greek part of Cyprus. There, his aide, Miodrag Savicevic, who only recently turned his back on Milan, his home town of choice, because of the general anticorruption drive in Italy, sees to the laundering of money and looks for new investment possibilities in the Middle East. Some of the assets also flow into dozens of Belgrade trading company branches that have addresses on the Mediterranean island. The jungle of about 500 Serbian subsidiaries is coordinated by Vladimir Delic, Petronjevic's predecessor in Cairo, who also looks after the construction of retirement homes and refuges for a select few: Thus, Serbian Tsar Slobodan Milosevic has bought a luxurious villa close to Larnaka where members of his clan already reside, protected by an army of bodyguards. However, the days when these Balkan friends could conduct large-scale business deals on Aphrodite's island without attracting attention are over. The Cypriot Government increasingly is coming under pressure from the European Union and the United States to investigate the rapid growth of these branches of companies and to uncover the illegal machinations of the gangster cartels. The World Bank estimates that, in the past three years alone, $20 billion have been transferred from states formerly belonging to the Soviet Union via Cyprus, a further $10 billion came from East Europe, and possibly as much as $5 billion from Serbia. Genex bosses already talk of Cyprus being a "financial parking place" that should be used, but with caution. That is because there are agents of all political colors there, from the CIA to pro-Bosnian Arab circles. That does not discourage Israeli arms dealers from also getting involved in Serbian business on the island. Jezdimir Vasiljevic, a Belgrade banker resident in Tel Aviv, has been running a lucrative deal benefiting both sides for over a year. Jewish firms have received prospecting rights for several gold mines in Serbia, and, in return, the Israelis are providing electronic equipment for military purposes. The bank accounts are being administered by Daniel Roman, president of the Serbian-Jewish Friendship Society based in the Cypriot capital Nicosia. Sofia, Bucharest, and Budapest also serve as centers for such activity. Genex trade representatives used the Bulgarian capital to arrange the purchase of Russian T-55 tanks worth $360 million, forged documents in Bucharest for the transportation of goods via the Danube, and in Budapest, they negotiated a long term contract, one that will extend until the year 2013, for the supply of 3.3 billion cubic meters of Siberian natural gas at a price of $270 million. However, the Genex traders nevertheless prefer business in the Arab world. It is easier to pull things off there and the profits are better. Thus, the weapons dealer Bekir Trhulij (whose nickname is Georgy) outbid the Russian and Slovakian competition to obtain handguns worth $290 million from the Lebanese Kataib Christian militia. Military equipment can be sold at a high price to buyers in Latin America and black Africa -- some items get back to the old country by way of the Danube. There was a second coup a few weeks ago: Along with his friend Copa Babic, nicknamed Peg Leg, Georgy supplied electronic equipment manufactured in Serbia under U.S. and Swiss licenses, worth $100 million to Saudi Arabia. During the Gulf War, he supplied 40 M-84 tanks, based on the Russian T-84, to the Saudis and thus gained their confidence. Through Riyad, he has thus been able to set up arms deals in all the regions of the world. That was at a time when official Belgrade was helping out Iraqi leader Sadam Husayn with the same equipment: It was a double game that the Iraqi leader still holds against his Serbian friends. Relations between the two nonaligned states are strained. The visit that Zivota Panic, the former head of the general staff, paid in March of last year did not produce the fundamental change that had been hoped for. The Iraqis maintained their reserve vis-a-vis Belgrade, and Milosevic's wish to acquire Scud missiles and the know-how for long-range missile systems remained unfulfilled. Only by acquiring such weapons would Milosevic have been in a clear position to win the war in Bosnia -- Colonel Qadhdhafi in the role of mediator is Belgrade's new hope now. Time is running out. Research carried out by U.S. secret services indicates that Bosnian Muslims, Croats, and Albanians are trying to develop international criminal syndicates. Milosevic's opponent in the war, Alija Izetbegovic, is organizing the supply of weapons through Pakistan, Malaysia, and the Algerian military government with apparent success. That, at least, is what the Muslim president has been suggesting. Over the last few weeks, his troops stopped the Serbian advance and gained substantial territory from the Croats. Izetbegovic's optimism provides some puzzles: "We will shortly succeed in beating back the Serbs on all fronts and regain the territories inhabited by Muslims."
