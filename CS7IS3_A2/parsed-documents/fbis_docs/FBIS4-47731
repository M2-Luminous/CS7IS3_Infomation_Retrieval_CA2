FBIS4-47731 "drafr085_b_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-085 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 EAST AFRICA Somalia Former Somaliland President Urges Reunification Former Somaliland President Urges Reunification AB2904194294 Paris AFP in English 1903 GMT 29 Apr 94 AB2904194294 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Addis Ababa, April 29 (AFP) -- Separatist Somaliland's former president called here Friday [29 April] for the country to rejoin its southern neighbour Somalia, from which it seceded unilaterally in May 1991. Abdulrahman Ahmed Ali, the first head of state after secession, told journalists in the Ethiopian capital: "It is time our people understood clearly that the international community does not intend to recognise Somaliland." He added that Somalis in the north and south "should sit down together to sort out their problems." Ahmed Ali, who was joined at a press conference by warlord General Mohamed Farah Aidid, heads the Somali National Movement (SNM), instrumental in overthrowing Somali president Mohamed Siad Barre in January 1991. Ahmed Ali and Aidid are key players in ongoing efforts to secure a stable political future for the factionally-riven Horn of Africa nation following the withdrawal last month of the US contingent and other western troops from the United Nations peacekeeping force in Somalia. Ahmed Ali said the SNM, which is reportedly riven by internal strife, would attend a meeting of the main Somali factions scheduled for May 10 in Nairobi. The UN-brokered meeting has been called to pave the way for a national reconciliation conference. Aidid, who has been absent from Mogadishu for five months, welcomed Ahmed Ali's declaration on Somaliland. But the current president of Somaliland, Mohamed Egal, said Ahmed Ali's remarks amounted to "treason." He told AFP by telephone from Hargeysa: "Mr Ahmed Ali only speaks for himself. He is an individual and does not represent Somaliland." Somaliland's self-declared independence was "irrevocable," he added.
