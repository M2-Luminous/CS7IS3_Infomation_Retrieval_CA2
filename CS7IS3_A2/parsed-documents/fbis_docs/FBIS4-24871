He expressed the hope that more business people from U.S. securities circles will become involved in China's infrastructure construction and invest in more sectors. Rong Yiren said: The Chinese and U.S. economies are mutually complementary to a great extent. China has a huge market, and its investment environment is improving. From both the present and long-term points of view, the prospects for trade and cooperation in the economy and technology between the two countries is promising. Rong Yiren expressed his belief that President Clinton was wise to recently declare the extension of China's MFN [most-favored nation] status and the termination of linking the MFN issue to human rights, saying that this decision is in line with the fundamental interests of the two peoples and is beneficial to promoting Sino-U.S. trade and improving and developing the two countries' relations. Rong Yiren expressed his thanks for the work that the Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities Corporation had done in extending China's MFN status. Briefing the visitors on the situation of China's reform and opening up in the last decade and more, Rong Yiren said: During the course of accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic structure this year, the measures that China has adopted in reforming finance, taxes, planning, investment, and foreign trade are going smoothly. The state's revenues have increased, and the currency exchange rate is stable. Although prices have risen, the government has taken effective measures to control prices. Rong Yiren pointed out: We are very prudent in the implementation of various concrete reform measures, and prudence is conducive to bringing about an even more coordinated type of economic development. He said: The current work of the government remains to focus on handling well the relations between reform, development, and stability. Chalsty said that because of his firm's extremely great interest in the Chinese market, they held successful talks with the State Planning Commission and other relevant Chinese departments on strengthening Sino-U.S. cooperation in various fields. To our knowledge, the Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities Corporation is one of the powerful securities and investment firms in the United States. The current visit is mainly for the purpose of seeking the opportunity of promoting or expanding cooperation in the power, chemical, telecommunications, iron and steel, aviation, and automobile industries.
