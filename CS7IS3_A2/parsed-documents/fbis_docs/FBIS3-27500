In his indictment, the prosecutor recommended a 12-year sentence for Luo Changhua, 38, and eight years for his wife Wang Yuying, 34, for violations of the Civil Aviation Law. The couple, along with their 11-year-old child Luo Wanghuan, hijacked a Fujian Airlines airliner to Taiwan on its way from Ganzhou to Chengdu on Dec. 28, 1993. The child was placed in the care of Luo's relatives in Taiwan. The prosecutor said he recommended shorter sentences because they had surrendered themselves upon landing at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. Ten civil air flights from Mainland China were hijacked to Taiwan in 1993.
