The official from the region's Forestry Department said that, since 1986, the region has planted a total of 3.2 million ha [hectare] of trees on farms, pastures, barren mountains and deserts. These trees are now protecting 65 percent of the 1.53 million ha of farmland in the region's major cereal-producing area from sandstorms. The forest coverage of these areas has risen from 5.5 percent to 20.8 percent. More than 667,000 ha of pastures in the region are now also under the protection of windbreaks. Even in Horqin and Mu Us, the region's two largest deserts, the forest coverage has gone up to 20 percent. Since 1986, the regional government has invested 633.73 million yuan and 136.72 labor days in the greening campaign, which forms part of a national program to build a shelterbelt in northern China. The region will go on greening mountains and deserts that are farther from human inhabitation. Meanwhile, the region will plant more orchards, which promise greater short-term benefits and can help local farmers prosper faster and in a more direct way.
