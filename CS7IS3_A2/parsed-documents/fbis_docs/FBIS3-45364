Bentsen arrived here this afternoon for a four-day official visit at the invitation of Chinese Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli. During Bentsen's visit, he and Liu Zhongli will cochair the eighth meeting of the Sino-U.S. joint economic commission, which last met in 1987. Li, calling Bentsen "an important member of the U.S. cabinet and a senior statesman," said his visit will strongly promote the development of Sino-U.S. relations. "From a realistic as well as a long-term perspective, a wide range of common interests exists between China and the United States, who should maintain a healthy and good relationship and enhance mutually beneficial cooperation in all fields," Li said. China and the United States should seize the opportunity created by the meeting between President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton last November, and do something in a practical and down-to-earth manner, so as to push Sino-U.S. relations back onto a normal track of development at an early date, Li said. While differences exist between the two countries, this should not affect the expansion of bilateral ties, which has overall importance, and the differences should be handled through dialogue and consultations, Li said, noting that emphasis should be placed more on the common points. As for differences in ideologies and concepts of values, the two countries should seek common ground while reserving differences, in the spirit of mutual respect, he added. After a brief account of China's economic development, reform and opening-up, Li noted that China has a huge potential market and takes interest in American technology and equipment which are advanced in many fields. With strongly complementary economies, the two countries will be able to greatly expand their economic and trade relations, he said. Bentsen said that as he was dispatched by President Clinton on this visit, it showed the importance the U.S. Administration attaches to developing relations with China. Bentsen expressed the wish to seek ways to further U.S.-China ties, especially economic and trade ties, through the visit, according to a Chinese official. As the biggest developed country and the biggest developing nation, the United States and China can cooperate in many fields, Bentsen said. The U.S. Treasury secretary, who visited China in 1978, observed that the Chinese Government has done a lot to improve people's welfare. The United States believes that a strong and prosperous China will do good to the United States and the world in general, the Chinese source quoted Bentsen as saying. Also, Bentsen said that the Clinton administration "strongly feels" that the United States should be involved in the economic growth and development of Asia, particularly China. Li, voicing agreement, said a strong and prosperous China will pose no threat to any country. "We only want to take good care of our 1.2 billion people and our land of 9.6 million square kilometers. We are constantly willing to contribute to world peace and development," he said. Earlier this afternoon, Bentsen and Liu Zhongli had a 30-minute meeting.
