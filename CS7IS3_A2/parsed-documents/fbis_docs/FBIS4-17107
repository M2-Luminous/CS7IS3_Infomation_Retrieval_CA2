At a news conference in Kiev, Leonid Kravchuk confirmed that he has invited Boris Yeltsin to come to Ukraine on an official visit. This visit will take place after a large-scale treaty on friendship and cooperation has been prepared. The next round of negotiations on the division of the Black Sea Fleet is scheduled for 22 April in Moscow. Admiral (Ret.) Aleksey Kalinin, former Black Sea Fleet commander, expressed his discontent with the agreements reached in Moscow on the Black Sea Fleet problem. He stated that none of the decisions made in Moscow will satisfy the Black Sea Fleet servicemen: "People will relate to it negatively because the presidents treat the fleet not an instrument to protect the people's interests but as an instrument in political games."
