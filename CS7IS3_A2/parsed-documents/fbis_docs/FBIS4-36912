Our neighbors, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, are the closest to us and, with their help and cooperation, we can achieve a satisfactory solution to the Yemeni crisis." In a telephone statement to AL-HAYAH which called him from London, 'Ali Salih, when asked why there has been no adherence to the cease-fire, said: "They are the ones violating the cease-fire and they want international monitoring of it." Asked what was the solution, he replied: "Dialogue is the solution." He was then asked: Dialogue with whom? He replied: "With the elements not included in the public prosecutor's decision on people who are now legally wanted on the charge of committing crimes against the homeland. We are willing to reach understanding with those elements and to hold a dialogue in the context of the Constitution of the Yemeni Republic and the constant national principles." It is known that the public prosecutor's decision includes the names of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the Presidential Council of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], and a number of YSP leaders including southern Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and Defense Minister Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir. AL-HAYAH has learned that a parliamentary delegation consisting of representatives of popular and political sectors is making contacts to pave the way for a visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next few days. The delegation is expected to be headed by Yemeni House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar. Another delegation is making arrangements for a tour of the rest of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states. Meanwhile, there were reports yesterday of more military pressure on Aden. Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general, announced yesterday in Abu-Dhabi that he was discussing with the Yemeni leaders a compromise solution providing for the participation of foreign observers in supervising the cease-fire in Yemen. Brahimi told AFP that supervision of the cease-fire could be done "by a joint Yemeni committee with the participation of foreign observers." The Algerian diplomat, who is scheduled to visit Qatar and Jordan later on, said that the plan currently under discussion would provide "common grounds" that would lead to the cessation of the battles which have been raging in Yemen for 40 days. He described the plan as a "positive step" in his mission aimed at implementation of Security Council Resolution 924. He added that the plan was a compromise between the positions of Sanaa and Aden. The Yemeni Government yesterday informed Brahimi that "the deployment of international observers between the government forces and the secessionist forces could not be discussed at international level as demanded by the YSP's secessionists, and that there was a presence of international observers in the framework of the Yemeni Joint Military Committee which had the task of stopping the military deterioration which occurred during the political crisis before the outbreak of the battles and which, in addition to Yemeni military commanders, included Jordanian and Omani officers as well as the U.S. and French charges d'affaires in Sanaa." A government source in Sanaa has stated that the Yemeni Republic conveyed to Brahimi its acceptance of the plan for the formation of a Yemeni joint military committee from the two warring parties to supervise the cease-fire with the participation of foreign observers. The government source explained that the military committee proposed by the UN envoy was already in existence and had been formed with the participation of observers from Jordan and the Sultanate of Oman and some foreign attaches to embassies in Sanaa, such as the French and U.S. attaches. The source said that urgent contacts held with Brahimi yesterday afternoon resulted in agreement that Sanaa would send representatives to a meeting with representatives of the other side and that Brahimi suggested Geneva or Cairo as a possible venue for the meeting. Sanaa is expected to name two representatives in the next few hours who would leave as soon as agreement is reached on a venue for the meeting, which would be held under the UN envoy's supervision. The source added that, because of that agreement, Brahimi decided that there was no need for him to visit Sanaa again as suggested by the Yemeni capital yesterday morning. There was increasing talk in Sanaa yesterday about a political solution to the crisis. Responsible sources had expressed the view that an agreement on the principle of dialogue between the two parties to the conflict on the basis of the proposals submitted to Envoy Brahimi when he visited Sanaa last week, a dialogue based on recognition of unity and constitutional legitimacy, would lead to an effective and practical cease-fire, but it seems that Brahimi insisted that there should first be a cease-fire before anything else. As a result, Sanaa responded to his request and agreed to the formation of the proposed cease-fire committee. It seems that some elements in the Yemeni leadership are in favor of facilitating dialogue with the YSP leaderships without insistence on any conditions except that the dialogue should be within the framework of unity. A high-ranking responsible source in Sanaa yesterday told AL-HAYAH that "the Yemeni Government's clarification of that matter, which was conveyed to the UN secretary general's envoy, stemmed from the decision issued by the Yemeni president on forming the Military Committee during the political crisis before the outbreak of fighting between the government forces and the misled forces under the command of the secessionist wing of the YSP." The source added: "The Yemeni Government has, from the first weeks of the Yemeni crisis, been interested in the participation of military observers from fraternal and friendly states along with the Military Committee consisting of a number of military commanders from the Yemeni armed forces, because of the Yemeni Government's awareness of the real situation, since developments have demonstrated that the secessionists in the YSP had a premeditated plan for a bloody conflict to undermine the unity, security, and stability of the country." In conclusion, the source said: "The Yemeni Government's acceptance of the presence of international observers is conditional on the international team being from the Joint Military Committee formed by a decision of Yemeni Armed Forces Commander in Chief President Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and in the context of joint cooperation between the Yemeni Government and the Security Council for the implementation of Resolution 924 on the current situation in Yemen, in a way that would not prejudice the Yemeni Republic's sovereignty, unity, and democracy, and with commitment to constitutional legitimacy and the results of the elections held on 27 April, 1993 as a basis of any dialogue between the Yemeni Government and the YSP."
