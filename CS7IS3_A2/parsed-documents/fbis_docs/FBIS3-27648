Central Bank of China officials said that it's necessary for Taiwan to ink such agreements with contracting parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, to pave the way for Taiwan's admission into the world body. They said that the proposed ROC [Republic of China]-U.S. agreement will follow rules set by the International Monetary Fund, which requires members to avoid payment restrictions on current account trade and discriminative currency practices, to provide exchange information, to allow the exchange of national currency held in foreign countries, and to hold consultations with other contracting parties on existing international pacts. Peng Fai-nan, general manager of the Central Bank's foreign exchange department, will sign the agreement with the United States on behalf of Taiwan. Central bank officials said that Peng and U.S. negotiators will not discuss the U.S. request that Taiwan further ease restrictions on the flow of foreign capital, although they said future negotiations on the issue are possible.
