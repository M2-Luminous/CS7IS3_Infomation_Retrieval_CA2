He will meet with his Cuban counterpart, Roberto Robaina, and other Cuban leaders. Qatar, a desert peninsula of 11,000 square km, borders on Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Persian Gulf. Doha, the capital, groups almost half of the almost 400,000 Qataris who live on the exports of petroleum and its byproducts. Before the discovery of oil deposits in the 1940's, the basic activities were fishing and pearl cultivation. Qatar was under the rule of the British and the Ottoman Empire until its independence in 1971. The following year, Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani assumed power. He nationalized the oil in 1977 and has kept the 1970 provisional constitution which does not allow political parties or elections. Despite its different system, this Arab absolute monarchy has had good diplomatic relations with Cuba since their establishment in December 1989.
