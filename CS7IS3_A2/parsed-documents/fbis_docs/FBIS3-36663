This was said by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev before his departure to Tashkent on Monday evening. However, the Russian foreign minister admitted that there might be an attack if the UN peacekeeping forces were attacked. "In this case, the UN forces' command in Bosnia must make a proposal on military support, including one by air forces, to the UN Secretary-General who is to conduct consultations with the Security Council's permanent member-states, including Russia," the foreign minister clarified. In his words, it was "absolutely necessary" to defend the UN peacekeeping forces stationed in the areas of conflicts. "If Bosnian Serbs, Moslems or Croats launch an attack, in response the international community may apply the appropriate measures against them," the Russian foreign minister said. He pointed out that "there was no way to speak about attacks only against Serbs in the specific situation which has emerged in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Only the defense from an attack committed by any party can be discussed," Kozyrev emphasized. In his words, the current situation is "very unfavorable for any kind of air attacks." "We will examine all the details. Russian President Boris Yeltsin will make decisions on all specific situations. However, in principle, counting on force is not the most successful way out," the foreign minister pointed out. Kozyrev regretted that "some of our western partners were in a hurry and did not study the Russian program of a settlement in Bosnia properly." "Our initiative provided for convening the Security Council, reinforcing the security zones around Sarajevo and elsewhere, putting that city under UN control, and demilitarizing Sarajevo and its surroundings by both sides. If the initiative had taken effect, the latest tragedy in that city could have been avoided. No one can say who caused such a huge toll of lives. Unfortunately, as long as Moslems and Serbs are amassing their artillery guns, similar tragedies cannot be avoided," Kozyrev said. He urged the need for effective measures "not to get caught in a trap." "It was a well-placed trap and possibly a provocation by one of the sides. The incident must be investigated, and concrete measures must be taken, he said. The minister recalled that "the death of Prince Ferdinand through a provocation in Sarajevo in 1913 triggered off a global tragedy." "That tragedy did not solve the Balkan issue, still facing us today. For this reason, the escalation of violence in the form of air strikes or any other foreign intervention except that by the UN would most likely lead to a repetition of that notorious tragic scenario," Kozyrev said. In his words, "no one wants it." "That is why I think that the international community will be guided (with all the heated discussion and the indignation that we fully share) by common sense and political reason rather than by emotions," he remarked. Kozyrev believes that "time has come for our western partners in the Security Council to take a closer look at the Russian proposals. It is possible to adopt effective measures on Sarajevo by disengaging the troops to avoid violence rather than by air strikes that would escalate it," the foreign minister declared. He disclosed that he had discussed the problem with his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher Sunday night. He noted that a map to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina "was agreed to in principle. There may be only 5 percent that remains for the sides to agree on. Their argument can last endlessly. But there is a way out for them through international arbitration at the level of the UN Security Council, the Hague Court, or any other authoritative body," he said. Asked by an Interfax correspondent whether Russia would back up sanctions against Croatia, Kozyrev replied: "Sanctions are not the best way. Once agreements on a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina are signed and concrete steps to implement them are taken, the best thing would be to lift sanctions even against Yugoslavia rather than to impose new ones." However, he noted, "if Croatia continues outright interference, sends troops to Bosnia and becomes directly involved in the conflict there, the imposition of sanctions on Zagreb may be considered. Would we like that? Of course not. Because Croatian civilians would suffer as a result. Whether such a turn of events is avoided will depend on how restrained the Croatian authorities will be," the minister stressed. The decision to bomb Serb positions in Bosnia must not be taken until an unbiased international commission evaluates the circumstances of the tragic explosion in Sarajevo, the head of the State Duma committee for international affairs, Vladimir Lukin, told journalists on Monday. According to him, such a commission must include neither Europarliament representatives nor Mr. Zhirinovskiy. As Lukin said, the UN Secretary-General, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, displayed "some prejudice," when he suggested that NATO structures should consider the possibility of bombing Serb positions. According to the Russian parliamentarian, the UN Security Council should convene all its members to discuss the situation, and "it would be odd if Russia were excluded from this process." The State Duma, Lukin said, has already issued a statement on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, and it continues to believe that "intensified military actions will not lead to slackening hostilities, and bombardments with greater outside military interference will not yield positive results." Lukin pointed out that he himself does not share "the extremist circles' opinion that the Serbs, or, on the contrary, the Muslims, are presumed to be right." According to him, there is a need to "find out objectively what is the best way to reach a political solution" to the conflict in Yugoslavia.
