Before 1992, Haiphong displayed four shortcomings, namely street litter, insufficient power supply, serious budget deficit, and poor public security and order maintenance. The situation now has been improved. City streets are cleaner thanks to more budget allocations to public sanitation work. The application of resolute and uniform measures helped reduce waste or theft of electricity. The situation concerning public security and order maintenance has been markedly improved. The budget deficit has also been significantly reduced. Noteworthy is the fact that Haiphong has scored fine external economic achievements. In 1991, the city had only two foreign investment projects. Nowadays, as many as 27 joint ventures valued at nearly 650 million dollars are being implemented. Considerable progress has also been made by the agro-forestry-fishery, trade, and service sectors. "The concrete figures of the above-mentioned activities are reflected in a report presented by the 10th Executive Committee of the Haiphong City party organization at a recent midterm party conference. Generally speaking, over the past three years, far from lagging behind, Haiphong has made good progress on the economic development front. Some areas of economic activities have displayed fast growth rates and fulfilled or overfulfilled many targets for the 1991-95 period. The external economic sector has played an important role in overall local economic life." Nonetheless, based on the report of the city party organization's executive committee as well as on the delegates' views, there is still room for improvement. For example, the value of 1993 industrial production reached only 211 billion dong. A number of new products has already been marketed. Nonetheless, the volume of products of high economic value remains low and the export index is even lower. The volume of export products in transit through Haiphong Port comes chiefly from the northern provinces whereas that of the port city of Haiphong itself only accounts for a modest percentage. Haiphong's sea-based economy displays great potential, but the actual performance ratio is very low. Slow efforts have been made to effect economic restructuring and job development to benefit the countryside. The ratio of the city's participation in foreign-funded investment projects is also low. The performance of the import-export and tourist sectors is not on par with the city's advantages and potential. Furthermore, the city still displays shortcomings on the cultural and social fronts. It could be said that Haiphong's most serious drawback rests with its failure to formulate an effective human resources development strategy. There is not enough cadres to meet the requirements of the new situation and new mechanism, especially to handle external economic affairs. "Prompted by a positive attitude and spirit of self-sufficiency and self-help, the Haiphong City party organization set forth many major policies and solutions for the period from now until the year 1995 as follows: It is necessary to promote production, business, and service industries as well as bring into full play the roles of different economic sectors. Special efforts must be made to step up external economic activities, build socioeconomic infrastructure, implement social welfare programs, consolidate national defense and security capabilities, renovate and revamp party organizations, enhance the leadership skills of cadres and party members, and combine the administrative reform program with the activities of mass societies. Given the fact that Haiphong is an industrial center with a large force of manual workers, special attention must be paid to the role of trade-union organizations." Based on past achievements and experiences, there is every reason to believe that Haiphong will make the above-mentioned goals come true. To this end, efforts must be made to define practical tasks and work out harmonious and effective operating procedures.
