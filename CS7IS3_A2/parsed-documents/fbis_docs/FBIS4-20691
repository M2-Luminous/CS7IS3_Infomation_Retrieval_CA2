Inc., 1 Goikaigan, Ichihara City, Chiba, Japan] [Text] Introduction In TEPCO, as the share of nuclear power generation increases, adjusting capability of thermal power plants to meet the variation in demand of electricity has become important. In particular, medium capacity units such as the Goi Thermal Power Station, which consists of six units, are needed to carry out frequent start-ups and shut-downs. In order to fulfill the requirement, the Goi No. 2 unit has been refreshed and modified for DSS (Daily Start-up and Shut-down) operation in 1988. Since it is necessary to clean up and improve quality of feed water to the boiler more quickly in DSS operation than in conventional operation, the existing auxiliary precoat filters (PCF) were replaced with hollow fiber filters (HFF), which have been used in TEPCO's nuclear power stations. This paper describes the results of our four year operation of HFF as its effectiveness has been confirmed. 1. Background to Development 1.1 Water Processing Technology Using Filters Filter processing technology has seen rapid progress in recent years, with focus mainly on the manufacture of semi-conductors and the medical sector. Although its main objective in these fields is efficiently achieving water quality of ultra-high purity, the scale of processing has been small until now and the filters have generally been of the disposable type. Since condensate filters for use in thermal power plants are required to produce feed water which is stable over the long term as well as being of high purity, TEPCO has installed PCFs and electro-magnetic filters (EMFs) until now. Meanwhile, in nuclear power plants, the demand for high-purity water quality has led to the development of the HFF for condensate processing, and this is currently being operated satisfactorily. 1.2 The State of Scale Damage in Once-Through Boilers and the Need Arising From DSS Modification In recent years, scale damage such as that described below has gradually become apparent in base-load once-through UP boilers, caused for example by an increase in stop-start operations. (Examples of scale damage) a. Blocked strainer at the boiler feed pump inlet b. Reduced efficiency in the high-pressure feed water heater c. Boiler pressure loss d. Malfunction in superheater temperature control caused by scale accumulation on the spray valve Therefore, for the last few years we have been working on research into the relative efficiency and merits of various types of filters used for condensate purification. Moreover, in modifying to DSS operation, it has become necessary to remove impurities efficiently and in a short space of time. Thus, as a step towards solving these issues, we have decided to proceed with studies based on the hollow fiber filter, which is being used successfully for condensate purification in TEPCO nuclear power stations, considering the water quality in thermal power stations and the characteristics of operating methods. 2. The Hollow Fiber Filter 2.1 The Principles and Properties of the Hollow Fiber Filter As shown in Figure 1 [not reproduced], the hollow fiber filter can filter substances down to the coloid-range size. The fibers are hollow and macaroni-shaped, as shown in Figure 2 [not reproduced], with microscopic slit-shaped filtration holes of 0.1 �m or less in the outer surface. The filtration principle, as shown in Figure 3 [not reproduced], is that condensate is passed from the outside to the inside of the hollow fibers, and non-solvent solids (referred to below as ``clad'') are extracted onto the surface of the hollow fibers. The properties are as shown below. 1) Compared to conventional precoat filters, there is no need for an auxiliary precoating of the filter, and operation can be simplified thanks to the simple composition of the equipment and remote automatic control. 2) With a large number of fine-pore hollow fibers bunched together in module fashion, a large filter area can be secured, thus large volumes of condensate can be filtered even though the device itself is compact in size. It is particularly effective in cases where installation space is limited, such as in existing plants in which operation is underway. 3) Since it can remove all clad sized 0.1 �m or more, outlet water quality of 1 ppb of clad or less can be ensured at all times regardless of the quality of water at the inlet, and this has a major effect on reducing the clean-up time when starting the unit. In addition, during normal operation high purity boiler feed water can be ensured. 2.2 The Economic Feasibility of Hollow Fibers The hollow fiber was first developed for nuclear power plant, and in applying it to thermal power plant, there have been some problems in economic feasibility caused by differences in safety design rationale. Thus there was some doubt initially as to whether it would be feasible in terms of cost. However, given the requirement for rigorous water quality conditions, if the hollow fiber filter is adopted after the modification of No. 2 unit to DSS it is forecast that the costs would be recovered in 4-5 years, with the effects and merits calculated as shown in Table 1. Therefore we decided to proceed with the development of HFF for thermal power plants. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

The Development and Deployment of Hollow Fiber Filters for Thermal Power Plants 3.1 Development for Use in Thermal Power Plants Because of differences in the conditions of nuclear power plants and water quality control, development was carried out with a mini-module to confirm points that needed particular care when designing hollow fiber filters for thermal power plants. 3.1.1 Agreement Between Filter Hole Bore and Filtration Speed From condensate analysis results of Goi Thermal Power Station Unit No. 6 and test results of the HFF mini-module, it was confirmed that the undissolved matter was mainly composed of magnetite (Fe[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]4[/]), which has a peak of 5 �m as shown in Figure 4 [not reproduced], and that if this is permeated through filtration holes of 0.1 �m or less at a filtration speed of about 0.1 m/h, there will be no blockage and all undissolved matter including magnetite can be removed while still retaining an extremely small slow rise in differential pressure. As well as the above, we considered the effect of oil contained in the condensate directly after periodical inspections and at other times, and confirmed that, as this was an artificial undissolved substance that only occurred in microscopic amounts when a new hollow fiber filter was installed, it could be effectively managed by covering the outer surface of the hollow fiber filter in advance with a film membrane. 3.1.2 Improving the Alkali Resistance of Module Material Since the condensate has a pH of 9.0-9.6 and thus a weak alkalinity, we checked the alkali resistance of the hollow fibers (polyethylene resin) and module structure elements known as the potting and coupling sections. As a result, we confirmed that the polyethylene resin does not degenerate even under alkaline conditions, while for the module structure elements we decided to use a high polymer material whose strength is not affected by an alkaline environment. 3.2 Application to Thermal Power Plants Condensate filters for nuclear power plants are designed for 30 percent efficiency for purification operation, but in view of the horizontal development across to thermal power plants, we applied it with a 50 percent efficiency design for the rated flow of condensate in the Goi Unit No. 2, the main objective being to clear the water quality for DSS or WES operation, considering the demands of the role of load regulation. 3.2.1 Condensate Purifiers The PCF in the No. 2 unit is composed of three parallel auxiliary precoat filters, and has a capacity to process a total condensate rated flow of about 700 t/h. This device is located between the condensate pump and condensate demineralizer, and purifies the condensate in the sequence shown in Figure 5 [not reproduced]. 3.2.2 The Hollow Fiber Filter Device The HFF has been installed in place of one of the existing PCFs. One of these devices has the capacity to process 50 percent (350 t/h) of the rated condensate flow. Its composition and specifications are as shown in Figure 6 [not reproduced] and Table 2. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

Operating Conditions and Evaluation Continuous operation in the No. 2 unit was started on March 29th 1988. In Table 2 we show the figures for approximately four years of operation since then, as well as evaluations. Meanwhile, Table 3 shows a comparison of the methods of operating condensate purifiers accompanying the change to HFF equipment. Table 3.

With the existing PCF, if the inlet impurity concentration is high the outlet concentration is also high and a long time has been required until the economizer inlet water quality standard has been satisfied. But with HFF we confirmed that high-concentration impurities during start-up can be removed in a short time, as shown in Figure 7 [not reproduced], and thus that the HFF makes a great contribution to both DSS and WES operation in thermal power units. As a result, a target time of 150 minutes was achieved between ignition and full load when during DSS of unit No. 2. 4.2 Restoring Pressure Differential by Reverse Condensing As a result of approximately 4 years of operation with reverse condensing whenever processed water amounted to 800,000 m[.sup]3[/] or pressure differential rose 0.3 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] above the initial value, we are now operating with a normal 0.8 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] change in pressure differential, as shown in Figure 8 [not reproduced]. With a reverse condensor cycle (800,000 m[.sup]3[/]/cycle) in which an HFF clad trapping load of 10 g/cm[.sup]2[/] is assumed, after about three years of operation the rise in pressure differential per reverse condensor cycle has now flattened out at a low 0.1 kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. From this we can hypothesize that we may extend the cycle to 1-1.5 million m[.sup]3[/]/cycle in future. 4.3 Verification of the Filter Design Capacity The iron concentration at the HFF outlet is stable at 1 ppb, regardless of the operating condition of the unit or the inlet concentration. Moreover, the total iron removal rate from start-up to full load is a high 98 percent, as shown in Figure 9 [not reproduced]. From these facts we confirmed that we were correct to design for a maximum condensate flow of 1/2 (350 t/h). 4.4 Simplification of Operation and Maintenance 4.4.1 Operability While with PCF approximately 50 on-site reverse condensor cycles are needed per year, with HFF it is possible to carry out around three per year, all by remote control from a central control room. 4.4.2 Reverse Condensing Time While a single cycle of reverse condensing and precoating took 240 minutes with PCF, with HFF we have been able to aim for a reverse condensing time of 40 minutes, or a reduction of about 3 hours. 4.5 Lightening the Load on the Demineralizer and Suppressing Clad Leakage to the Boiler Feed Water System The vast reduction in impurities flowing in to the demineralizer means that the phenomenon of impurity coating on the resin is diminished. Thus it is now possible not only to prevent resin contamination but also to suppress effluence into the system by clad which is trapped in the mineralizer each time the condensate flow fluctuates. 4.6 Estimating Filter Life The maximum pressure loss tolerated by the No. 2 unit HFF is 2 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] from capacity of the condensate pump. As the speed of rise in pressure differential caused by the permanent blockage of filters through operation over one year is evaluated to be 2-3 times that of the initial year, estimated filter life is 7-8 years. Meanwhile, as concerns filter life determined by reduction of HFF material strength, we are also beginning to understand the trends of changes in filter strength as a result of filter analysis and other minute checks carried out in each periodic inspection, and we are checking its soundness. In recent evaluations, our initial estimation of life has been shown to be correct, even considering the deterioration with age of materials. 5. Conclusion When we modified the No. 2 unit to DSS operation we took the opportunity to install the HFF in this instance in a thermal power plant, which differs from a nuclear power plant in the nature of its impurities, after repeatedly conducting adequate lab tests in advance to ascertain whether the hollow fiber filter manifested the filter efficiency for which it was designed. From operating figures over about four years, it was confirmed that it had adequate purifying efficiency not only during normal operation but also in DSS and WES start-ups, that it was excellent in its reverse condensing properties, and that it would be sufficiently effective to have a reverse condensing cycle every 800,000 m[.sup]3[/]. Furthermore, in fiscal 1992, we reexamined the design of components such as the diameter of filters, to reduce costs. As a result, it was confirmed that the total area of filters can be halved by doubling linear velocity, and accordingly, cost of modules can also be halved, as shown in Table 4. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4. Comparison of Present and Improved Modules | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Present condition |Proposed improvement | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Av. linear velocity |0.1 m/h |0.2 m/h | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Modules cost |1 |1/2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Av. pore size |0.1 �m |0.2 �m | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |No. of modules |230 |115 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Reverse condensing |3 times a year |10 times a year | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Permeation capacity |Half (350 t/h) of rated |Same as on the left | | |condensate flow (700 t/h)| | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Meanwhile, since the condensate from a once-through boiler contains only around 0.5 percent ion impurities, and 99.5 percent clad, we have assumed that conventional demineralizers fulfill a function only as basic ion exchangers in the event of seawater leaks. We have confirmed that for the role of clad processing, which takes up the majority of this, it is important that the condensate should be processed principally by HFF. This leads us to consider that the design concepts of secondary water processing for thermal power will change from now on through the adoption of the HFF as the condensate processing technology of the future.
