[Petrella] The PRC is growing; its people have a culture that values hard work, seriousness, and discipline; and I believe they can positively contribute to Argentine development. [Korin] Do many immigrants come to Argentina after reading advertisements in their country's newspapers? [Petrella] We are seeking to channel requests for residence in Argentina through our consulates in Shanghai and Beijing. We want to prevent this from becoming an activity that is not controlled by the government because this sort of situation can lead to abuse, as already has occurred. It recently occurred with Peru, for example. Our laws do not establish that a person has to pay to enter Argentina. [Korin] Do you know of any similar advertisement in Hong Kong? [Petrella] Yes, but our consulate in Hong Kong is always informing everyone that Argentina does not charge anything to allow people to enter the country, that except for an extremely small sum for stamps, admittance is free. [Korin] What about Russia? [Petrella] I can show you a folder with a list of those who want to legally come to Argentina. [Korin] How many people are on this list? [Petrella] Nearly 15,000, all of them professionals. In addition, 20,000 Rumanians have asked to come to Argentina. [Korin] To mention a migration policy contemplating the admittance of Rumanians to Argentina sounds contradictory because, so far, no Rumanian has been able to settle here. [Petrella] The problem is that there has been no agreement in this sense. Argentina is studying the situation and reporting on it to Europeans, thus inviting them to fund the migration program. [Korin] Is Korean migration still intense? [Petrella] Yes, but Korean migration has been dealt with unofficially; there has been no program for it. The Foreign Ministry, however, deems it very positive. According to the ROK Embassy, nearly 80,000 Koreans are living in the federal capital. [Korin] Most immigrants, however, come from neighboring countries that are not as developed as those you have mentioned. What happens to those whom the government believes to have little "hard-work culture," as you say, and who come from countries that do not have a strong economy? [Petrella] They are all hard workers (he laughs). The idea is not whether the person is coming here to invest. It is whether this person will join our working reality and avoid joining criminals. [Korin] The government was interested in having East European immigrants. Now it leaked that it is holding talks with the PRC. How do these migration projects benefit Argentina? [Petrella] The country benefits from migration that generates services and jobs. They are not entirely destitute and come from countries that traditionally export capital and technology. History and previous experiences show that if a society receives immigrants from countries with a strong economy, part of this economy comes with the immigrant. This is partially what occurred with Japanese immigration to southern Brazil. The immigrants immediately establish links with the mother country and this is positive. This has occurred in Argentina with relation to Spain and Italy. Regarding East Europe, while the other countries offered these countries financial assistance, Argentina was the only one to offer them the possibility of absorbing part of the migration that the other European countries could not absorb. [Foreign Minister] Di Tella said: "We offer them la pampa, blue skies, and Argentine land." (Petrella stands up and moves his hands). But we were talking about people who could support themselves. Argentina is one of the few countries in the world that still offers this possibility. [Korin] Which other countries do? [Petrella] Australia, New Zealand, Canada -- but to an increasingly smaller degree. To a certain extent, South Africa does too. [Korin] What does a country need to have an open migration policy? [Petrella] It needs space. A country with large free territories must fill them up. Not exactly to fill them up but to have a more rational occupation of these territories. [Korin] What are the strictest countries in this regard? [Petrella] The European ones. They have even signed an agreement to create a common border alround Europe and thus limit the number of possible immigrants. Some even say this agreement harms the asylum right that was so traditional in countries such as Spain and France. The United States is strict but has signed agreements and, in general, is a very generous country. [Korin] But not only in regard to the space issue. [Petrella] Ask them about that. [Korin] How can we combine the concept that empty territories must be filled up with the concept some people have that immigrants occupy positions that should be occupied by Argentines? [Petrella] The thing is as follows: The arrival of people with a certain purchasing power creates jobs and services. They do not occupy other people's positions. It all depends on the immigrant's social and economic level. None of those listed in this folder (points out the list of Russians) comes empty-handed. I also would like to explain that I bluntly reject the concept that there is xenophobia in Argentina. We can say that we have job problems, competition problems, labor law flexibility problems. Our problems in this field are related to labor and not to a xenophobe attitude. [Korin] I am referring to immigrants from neighboring countries who come to Argentina without this standard of living. Are agreements to be signed with neighboring countries being analyzed? [Petrella] No, we are holding permanent talks with these countries because most of those who immigrate to Argentina come from neighboring countries. Border control is not as strict as it should be. Sometimes a person enters the country as a student without being one. Perhaps, Argentine laws are too flexible. To enter the United States a person must prove that he or she has been accepted by a university, in addition to several other things. [Korin] Why have 400,000 immigrants failed to make their situation legal even after the Argentine Government granted them 15 months of amnesty? [Petrella] People are usually afraid of legalizing their situation. This is a widespread sociological phenomenon, similar to the one responsible for people's refusal to pay the value added tax, or freelance workers' refusal to register in the social security system. People tend to distrust the government. Deep inside, there is a cultural distrust about the solidity and fairness of our governmental institutions. This is the only way we can explain why a person chooses to live in an irregular situation.
