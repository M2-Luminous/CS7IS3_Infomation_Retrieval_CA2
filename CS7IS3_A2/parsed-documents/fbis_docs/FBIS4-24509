C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, May 27 (CNA) -- The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) on Friday [27 May] issued a position paper accusing the major opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of blindly pressing for a temporary pension plan for senior citizens. The sternly worded paper came out as the fifth and final day of a sit-in staged by the DPP to campaign for old-age benefits drew to a close. Some 800 elderly joined the sit-in, during which the protesters called on the legislature to discuss the DPP-proposed "temporary rules for old-age benefits," which would enable the Executive Yuan to immediately earmark special funds for seniors. Such a temporary pension would be a transitional measure before a permanent pension plan could be implemented, the DPP said. Saying "a wrong policy is worse than graft," the KMT accused the DPP of pushing its temporary pension plan even though it knows it is unworkable. It added that the pledge the DPP made late last year during local election campaigning to pay old-age benefits was actually a disguised means of vote-buying. During the election campaign, DPP candidates promised that each person 65 years of age and older would receive a pension of NT$5,000 (us$185.18) per month, regardless of their financial circumstances. The commitment, however, has resulted in a dilemma for the DPP, as five of the six counties where DPP members were elected magistrates late last year have been plagued by financial woes. The KMT said the DPP has declined to admit wrongdoing for fear of losing face and future elections. The position paper said the DPP's pension campaign is actually an attempt to win the Taiwan governorship, and pointed to the immorality of treating the elderly as "stage properties of politics." Moreover, it stressed, "it does not make sense for the KMT to endorse the election check drawn by the DPP." Meanwhile, DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh made an apology to Taiwan's senior citizens, saying he regretted that the KMT did not respond favorably to the sit-in. Reiterating the DPP's determination to pay old-age benefits, Shih pledged that the opposition party will continue to strive for the welfare of the elderly. A reasonable distribution of the nation's overall resources would enable the government to take good care of senior citizens, he said. As a follow-up to the sit-in, the DPP has decided to launch a large-scale demonstration on June 26 to promote the well-being of the elderly.
