In my opinion, they are particularly significant at a time when the UN Human Rights Commission holds its annual meeting in Geneva. Havana -- One of the main goals sought by the U.S. blockade against Cuba has been to obstruct medical aid to the population in an effort to undermine support for the island's leaders. The White House believed this action would be effective because more than 40,000 pharmaceutical and medical products (medicine, reagents, disposable material, surgical equipment, and others) were registered in Cuba up to 1959. More than 80 percent of the products were sent by foreign firms, basically U.S. firms, while Cuban laboratories purchased most of the raw materials for their production -- low at the time -- in the United States. Aware of this dependence, U.S. officials worked hard to obstruct that bilateral supply until it was suspended early in the 1960's. They have later tried everything within their means to force the rest of the world to do likewise. The situation substantially worsened for the Cubans following the disappearance of socialist markets in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, which served to considerably lessen the general effects of the blockade for more than 30 years. Under these circumstances, aside from receiving less income in convertible currency, Cuba was compelled to pay higher costs in freight and product prices -- given the distances and given the special deals with businessmen who render their services or supply medical products despite the risk of paying the sanctions imposed by the U.S. blockade. As a result of this, on a given year within the first half of the 1990's, Cuba had to disburse an extra $45 million to cover its public health needs. Had it not been for the blockade, the amount would have allowed, to use an example, the purchase of enough powdered milk to produce 180 million liters of this product. One of the most negative effects of the U.S. policy of isolation is the high cost of freight paid to import merchandise from ports and airports in Europe and other distant areas. Cuba: Were it not for the astronomical freight prices.... It is appropriate to remember that, since the implementation of this line of conduct, the White House has forbidden U.S. ships to load merchandise shipped from any country to Cuba or to dock at any Cuban port; and in 1962 it established the so-called "black list" of ships from other countries that traded with the island. The provision to be removed from that list was to suspend all trade with the island. It is well known that this case history was somehow recast in 1992 for the so-called Torricelli amendment, to officially threaten with strong sanctions the ships that carried any merchandise to Cuba. As of 1993, official statistics show Havana had an annual expense of $6 million in air and maritime freight for the public health sector. The amount would have been $1 million or $2 million if the cargo had been purchased in markets located nearby and under the normal circumstances which surround these deals. The effects of the blockade are simultaneously reflected in a foreign debt increase and a greater disbursement of hard currency given the excessive cost of freight, air freight in many cases, to guarantee the prompt arrival of critical products which guarantee the health -- sometimes the life -- of human beings. The frequent use of air freight, despite the fact it is much more expensive than sea freight, is because under current circumstances Cuba's medical reserves do not always allow the long waiting time by sea, in addition to the fact the blockade also restrictions affect the availability of vessels. The following is one example that illustrates this. As already known, Cuba has been affected by a neuropathy epidemic. Airfreight costs from Europe amounted to $237,448 just to cover a partial shipment of a contract for vitamins and excipients (a substance that dissolves) to manufacture tablets for the sick and as a preventive measure for the rest of the population. Had the blockade not forbidden access to the U.S. market and access to nearby U.S. affiliates, to acquire these products freight costs would have been $55,900. In other words, Cuba had to pay $101,548 extra for just one of the many transactions carried out to face this epidemic. Another case. When examining payments made between 1991 to 1992 for 32 products used in medical assistance from Europe, one can see in airfreight alone $26,037 was spent. From the United States this would have only amounted to $2,413. With the $23,624, which Cuba was forced to pay due to the blockade, Cuba could have purchased 10,453 packages of methotrexate, which is used to treat children suffering from acute leukemia, in other words, 87 percent of this product's yearly requirement. The Obsession To Leave Cuba Without Medicine [subhead] For three decades the White House explicitly forbad Cuba to acquire medicines in the U.S. market, the world's most important. At the time, THE NEW YORK TIMES harshly criticized this. Something similar occurs with chemical reagents, which are essential for the clinical analysis that guarantees health services to the people and vital products for the development of the medical- pharmaceutical industry. The U.S. siege surrounding these essential materials has forced Cuba to pay between 30 to 40 percent more to intermediaries and spend more time to obtain the products it needs, sometimes urgently. If one considers the fact Cuba has very few financial resources, one can better understand all the efforts the Cuban authorities have to make to maintain the level of medical assistance Cuba has, despite everything. The neuropathy epidemic serves as an example for a better idea regarding this. Let's take, among the numerous documents, a contract Cuban sanitary officials made available to me, covering only three products (reagents) earmarked to fight the neuropathy epidemic, which were purchased from a European supplier. The complete operation, including freight, cost $1,938 per shipment. To have some idea of how this affects the Cuban economy, let's say that according to the price catalogue of the U.S. firm Sigma, had there not been a blockade, the f.o.b. [free on board] price for these products would have been $827; that is, 134 percent less for each purchase. If this saving could have been made, with the money difference, approximately 2,485 milliliters of cattle fetal serum could have been obtained. This is an essential reagent component used to test pregnant women for abnormal fetuses. Another comparison serves to demonstrate more crudely the realities of this uncommon process. A contract for 1992 to 1993 which includes prices of 24 medical products turns out to be particularly significant when it is compared with the supply of similar merchandise offered by Miami- based Talgrex International Export Company. In one single purchase, $986,386 in excess of the prices announced by Talgrex were invested. This does not include the burden that was imposed additionally by the freight. For instance, one of the medications included in that contract, the niphedipine [nifedipine], which is used for treating cardiovascular disease, cost Havana $111.67, while in the Talgrex catalog it was sold for $61.56, namely 81 percent less. There is another angle to the problem -- the multiple obstacles that the blockade creates for Cuba when it wants to obtain specific medication. The situation worsens even more when it is necessary to resort to a costly and prolonged medication. Third generation antibiotics are part of this intricate general context. They are an essential part of the work carried out at intensive care units and the cytostatic treatment of cancer patients. An important U.S. company, Lilly, and its branches in Latin America manufacture insulin, which -- as it is well known -- is essential for diabetic patients. However, these companies refuse, using the blockade as an excuse, to sell this product to Cuba, which has tried to resort to the distant European market to guarantee medical attention for these persons. There are 16.5 diabetics for every 1,000 inhabitants on the island, and a considerable part of them are insulin dependent. This means their lives are closely linked to the existence or lack of this much sought after pharmaceutical product. Please ... give handicapped Cubans a chance in Geneva. Another significant example is shown in Havana's relations with the Dutch firm Enraf Nonius, which supplied equipment and spare parts for the rehabilitation of handicapped patients until 1991, to the extreme that 80 percent of the facilities came from that source. On 16 July 1991 the Dutch company sent a message to the Cuban capital notifying that it was suspending its shipments because George Bush's Republican government did not grant it the authorizations demanded by the blockade for products which have a certain degree of U.S. components. Since this step jeopardized the treatment of numerous handicapped patients, the Caribbean nation's authorities were compelled, as in other cases, to seek more costly solutions in the world despite the country's precarious financial situation. In the technology sector, the Cuban health system is compelled, essentially by the blockade, to resort to extraordinary measures to purchase textbooks and magazines, while facing multiple limitations when its specialists want to participate in courses and scientific meetings held in the United States. Books also fall prey to this attitude. The Spanish firm Inter- American Publishers House, Inc. sold Cuba the medical books it needed, but transactions were suspended in 1991 when the enterprise was bought by the U.S. firm McGraw-Hill. Despite all this Cuba has achieved extraordinary development in the public health sector, a fact that is recognized even by relevant members of U.S. scientific institutions which have participated in neuropathy research since 1993 in what represents the pioneer group involved in a noble activity that should be carried out some day in the third world. What the United Nations now demands as a foremost goal for underdeveloped nations on the brink of a new millennium, Cuba already achieved and surpassed years ago -- sometimes at levels that are similar to the ones which currently prevail in developed countries. In fact, it protects its basic achievements in this area despite Washington's systematic efforts to jeopardize its health care system. Those efforts are part of an overall plan to create internal problems and undermine the lifestyle which currently prevails on the island and, eventually, cause it to revert.
