The talks are virtually at a standstill while the main body of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiating team is awaited. Meanwhile, the mediators and the government delegation are busy with something else. There are reports that the government team has already reacted to the proposal from the mediators and observers on the question of national reconciliation and the UNAVEM [UN Angola Verification Mission] mandate. Analysts believe the mediators today dealt with the government delegation's views on UNAVEM. In the case of national reconciliation the government team introduced no major changes, though the same cannot be said of the UNAVEM mandate. The government has proposed changes because, according to a source, it is necessary for the government and the United Nations to define juridical aspects so that the government's legal rights are upheld. Right now, the talks are dealing with national reconciliation and the UNAVEM mandate. The talks will only get off the ground when the main body of the UNITA delegation returns to Lusaka, probably tomorrow.
