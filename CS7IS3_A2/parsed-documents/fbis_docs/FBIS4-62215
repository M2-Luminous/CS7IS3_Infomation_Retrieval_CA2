In an interview with Interfax, Zhirinovskiy spoke of offering three possible options to the Prime Minister. Under the first option, the LDP wants three ministerial posts in the so-called power structures -- defence, police and counter-intelligence. If not, the party is ready to settle for the posts of justice minister and prosecutor general. The final option provides for the posts of economics minister and chairman of the state property committee. Zhirinovskiy said the prime minister would now contemplate the proposals while "we will also think of what position to take towards the government in future".
