They are conscious of their common responsibility within the EU, in particular in this period of profound changes throughout the continent. They intend to closely coordinate their action during their presidencies. Following the radical upheavals which have taken place in Europe since 1989, the EU has a historic obligation and a common objective to help the states of Central and East Europe regain their place in the European family and to involve them in the process of unification which is under way. In this way, we wish to guarantee lasting peace and freedom in Europe. At the Copenhagen summit in July 1993, the Twelve began a long-term process of expanding eastward, by offering a concrete opportunity of membership to countries which are now linked to the EU via association or free trade agreements. To this end, these countries must fulfil a series of economic and political conditions. The EU is supporting this process in a very diversified fashion, ranging from commercial facilities to close political dialogue, and including very substantial technical and financial assistance. We need to be very conscious of the fact that these countries' path toward the EU will be long and difficult. It is all the more important to affirm to them already that they are welcome within the EU. This is why we are jointly suggesting that the heads of state and government of the countries which are seeking membership be invited once a year to a European Council, in order to discuss questions of mutual interest with the Twelve, and soon the Sixteen, and in this way deepen our cooperation. With the same end in mind, at the proposal of Germany and France, the Western European Union has agreed on a status of associated partnership for those countries, in order to foster rapprochement in the area of security policy. In this way we are creating ever more numerous and closer links between the EU and the other members of the European family, which have, for so long, been kept outside the process of unification. The Yugoslavian conflict has clearly demonstrated that the peace and security of our continent are far from being secured. The exacerbation of historical ethnic, religious, and cultural tensions has resulted in an atrocious war, expulsions, the growth of fanaticism, and the changing of frontiers by force. It is our duty as Europeans to do everything to reestablish peace in this region as soon as possible and to avert, once and for all, every possibility of a return to barbarism in Europe. With the United States and Russia In other regions of our continent, there exist latent tensions resulting mainly from unresolved border and minority problems. We cannot ensure stability and peace in Europe if we do not succeed in eliminating the causes of tension and, in this way, forestall conflicts in an effective and lasting fashion. In this respect the EU assumes a particular responsibility. This is why, last December, the European Council in Brussels approved the proposal by the French prime minister to organize a Conference on Stability in Europe, an initiative which was supported by President Francois Mitterrand at the June 1993 Council of Copenhagen. This initiative is based on the observation that political stability is an essential precondition for ensuring economic and social progress as well as peace and freedom. What value would the free trade and association agreements with Central and East European countries, or indeed, their future membership of the EU, have, if serious political crises, provoked in particular by problems of boundaries or minorities, were to call this progress into question? The initiative of the Twelve in favor of a Stability Pact is aimed at encouraging the signing of good neighborliness agreements between all Central and East European countries. Of course, these agreements will not settle, once and for all, all the problems which may continue to exist between these countries, but they should create a climate of trust and introduce means of cooperation which make it possible to resolve any difficulties which may arise by mutual agreement. This principle has been the key to reconciliation and the process of unification of West Europe since World War II. The relationship which today unites France and Germany, long considered as hereditary enemies, is the most striking proof of this. The initiative of the Twelve does not seek to create an additional institution or the draw up a new version of the fundamental principles which we have agreed on within the framework of the United Nations, the CSCE, or the Council of Europe, whether these principles be the inviolability of borders, the territorial integrity of states, or the respect of minority rights. Today, the essential priority is to have these principles applied without restriction in order to effectively forestall tensions and crises in Europe. With this initiative, the Twelve are proposing to their Central and East European partners a European framework for negotiating good neighborliness agreements in a climate of trust. They are able to encourag this movement thanks to the EU's economic and political weight. Political Will of the Countries The Twelve have no intention to prescribe or impose ready-made solutions on their partners. The success of this project will depend on the political will of the countries concerned. Nobody can or wants to relieve them of this responsibility. They alone are in a position to find, while retaining entire sovereignty, the solution which best suits them and which at the same times serves European stability. In our eyes, the participation of the United States and Russia is fundamental to the success of this conference. A close and tested partnership, such as the presence of the United States, is and remains essential to the security of Europe [sentence as published]. We are equally conscious that there can be no stability and effective security in Europe without cooperation with Russia. For this reason we wish to build a close partnership with this country, which is a large and powerful neighbor of the EU. The full participation of the CSCE is equally essential to the success of the Conference on Stability. The conference is fundamentally based on the principles of this institution, and its instruments must be used in full to put the agreements reached at conference into effect. In this way the results of this initiative will be an integral part of the CSCE process and will give it a strong impetus. Germany and France are resolved, with their EU partners, to bring to fruition this first initiative undertaken within the framework of the joint foreign and security policy. They will do everything to contribute in this way to stability, peace, and freedom. Our objective is to call, in a year from now, a conference at which the Stability Pact will be concluded, following a process of establishing a network of bilateral good neighborliness agreements between the countries of Central and East Europe. This Stability Pact will provide an occasion for Europe to prove its determination to overcome, for good, the ancient division of our continent, and to ensure the peoples of Europe a peaceful future.
