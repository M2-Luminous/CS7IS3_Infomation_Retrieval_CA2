Restructure the tax system to achieve major breakthroughs in expanding local financial power. Looking at the current situation, the financial system that lets the central and local governments "eat out of separate pots" no longer meets the needs of our economic development. It is imperative that we separate state and local taxes. Therefore, we must seize the opportunity before us to make a breakthrough in the financial system. The provincial party committee and provincial government must diligently review the experience and lessons in the second phase reform to substitute taxation for profit delivery and "eat out of separate pots" and, in light of Heilongjiang's own realistic situation, gather the relevant departments to conduct an in-depth investigation and study to sort out the situation and forecast the future and come up with some suggestions and a program to separate state and local taxes. They should actively report to the central authorities and, in separating state and local taxes, strive to keep the share of local financial power at or near the nation's average level, so as to lay the foundation for industrial development. 2. Further restructure the system of planning to make a breakthrough in retaining a larger percentage of the raw materials: 1) Reduce the scope of mandatory planning with regard to petroleum. First, it will be unrealistic to completely change the production pattern already set up under the planned system, but we can use 50 million tons of petroleum as base and allocate it according to state plan; the remaining portion should be kept by the localities. Second, with regard to petroleum gas, the province should be allowed to work with Daqing in its comprehensive development and utilization. Third, while Daqing expands its new oil fields, the localities should be allowed to buy shares and make investments; oil should be allocated according to the number of shares. Fourth, local governments should be allowed to invest in and exploit odd-lot oil fields around Daqing and engage in the deep-processing work. Fifth, the localities should have priority in projects complementing the initial processing of new crude produced in Daqing. 2) Reduce the scope of mandatory planning with respect to timber. The state's reduced timber index for 1992 should be used as base, and the entire contract should be taken over by the year 2000. While balancing tree-cutting and tree-planting, any out-of-plan timber should be deep-processed by the localities. 3) Continue to reduce the fixed quota procurement of grain. To reduce fixed quota procurement, the current 10.6 billion jin should be cut to 8 billion jin. The remaining portion should be deep-processed or marketed by the localities themselves. 4) Reduce the large and medium-sized enterprises' share of mandatory plans, gradually decontrol product prices, and allow the large and medium-sized enterprises to purchase raw materials in the market--letting them "buy high and sell high." Only by gradually reducing the state's mandatory planning can a chain of upstream, midstream, and downstream products be produced to achieve breakthrough in Heilongjiang's industrial development. 3. Restructure the financial system to make a breakthrough in credit funds: Seizing the opportunity of the central bank's imposition of macro control and the separation of the state's policy-oriented banks from commercial banks at this time, we should expand the scope of local credit funds. First, taking advantage of Heilongjiang's fine industrial structure, we should strive to win credit support from the state's policy-oriented banks. Second, we can use selective products that are profitable and competitive to win commercial bank loans and help develop industries. Third, while meeting the conditions of the state's financial policy, we should actively develop local banks and raise capital on our own. Fourth, we should take advantage of our border trade and set up bank organs aboard to gather international funds. 4. Restructure the investment system and make a breakthrough in readjusting the industrial structure: To restructure the investment system, we must begin with the province's economic development and the layout of the productive forces, formulate central and local investment plans, and coordinate the development. One, while the state's investment focus is on coal, timber, and petroleum, it should invest in transportation and power supply and other basic industries, and it should also invest in light industrial products that meet the state's industrial policy requirements and are profitable. While the provincial government and governments at all levels invest in the development of light industry that makes use of agricultural products as raw materials, they should gradually shift more emphasis on light industry that utilizes non-agricultural raw materials. We must improve Heilongjiang's lopsided industrial structure and its outdated basic industry. Second, given that the central and local authorities share the same development goals, they should work in concert and cooperate with each other. For example, the province can work with Daqing to produce 800,000 tons of ethylene, which not only will facilitate the development of state-affiliated enterprises but also the creation of local-led industries. The two should make a joint investment to accelerate the realization of this project. 5. Reform the management system and make a breakthrough in giving play to the province's overall industrial productive capacity and efficiency: First, the central government should continue to decontrol enterprises, and except for the state-monopolized trades, it should hand down most enterprises to the localities and promote the cooperation between the state's large and medium-sized enterprises and local medium-sized and small enterprises, so that they no longer pursue separate development. Second, enterprises that cannot be handed down to the lower levels should work closely with local industrial enterprises. By forging lateral economic ties and through the proper circulation of factors of production, we can help forge the internal organic link between central enterprises and local industrial enterprises and create proper division of labor and improve the province's overall industrial productive capacity and efficiency. 6. Promote reform that focuses on "enterprises' property rights system" and make a breakthrough in the operating mechanisms: Deep-seated conflicts in the industrial economy are reflected in enterprises, and the solution lies in the reform of the property rights system to resolve the issues of enterprises' ability to pursue their own development, their ability to take responsibility for their profits and losses, and their self-discipline, and in addition, we must change the operating mechanisms and push enterprises toward the market. 1) We should continue to expand the enterprise shareholding system. First, we should set up and develop a "workers' cooperative fund" to gather the enterprise workers' scattered funds and turn them into legal person shares, so that the workers can take part in the shareholding companies and help forge lateral ties. Second, shareholding companies that have already been approved should set up windows and counters to accelerate the transfer of enterprises' internal workers' shares to enliven the 1.2 billion yuan's worth of stocks in the hands of stock investors. Third, we should actively develop directional capital-raising companies to absorb corporate funds and entice enterprise workers to buy shares. Funds should be spent on expanded reproduction. Fourth, we should help enterprise be better prepared when listing their stocks in the market and help more enterprises list their securities. Fifth, we should continue to convert some industrial enterprises to the shareholding system and accelerate enterprises' technological transformation. Sixth, all newly undertaking industrial projects should generally be converted to the shareholding system. 2) We should give more weight and add more depth to state-owned, civilian-run operations. Most medium-sized and small state-owned enterprises should become market-oriented through one of the following ways: Convert to the shareholding system and sold by the share or as a whole, broken up and managed as separate entities, leased out, operate as "one enterprise under multiple systems," declare bankruptcy, merge, or form alliances and so on. 3) We should put enterprises in the property rights exchange markets and let the superior eliminate the inferior companies. We should accelerate the promotion of free circulation and optimal combination of key factors of production. While continuing to set up markets for capital goods, personnel, labor and services, technologies, and information, we should accelerate the improvement of the province-wide market for exchange of property rights and management rights. Enterprises that are chronically losing money should be publicly auctioned off, merged, leased out, or contracted out. Through enterprise reform that focuses on property rights, we can push enterprises toward the market, radically change their management mechanisms, and increase their ability to compete.
