FR941027-0-00008 FR941027-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;22&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9050; AD 94&hyph;22&hyph;01] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, &hyph;30, and &hyph;30F series airplanes, that currently requires inspections to detect ice or snow accumulation on top of the fuselage and in the inlet of the number 2 engine, and removal of ice and snow accumulation. This amendment adds certain airplanes to the applicability of the rule and limits the inspection requirement to only a certain group of airplanes. This amendment is prompted by the development of improved fan blades on certain engines and the identification of additional airplanes that are subject to the unsafe condition. The actions specified by this AD are intended to minimize damage to the number 2 engine due to ingestion of ice and snow. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Information related to this rule may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Raymond Vakili, Aerospace Engineer, Propulsion Branch, ANM&hyph;141L, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California 90806&hyph;2425; telephone (310) 988&hyph;5262; fax (310) 988&hyph;5210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 75&hyph;04&hyph;11, amendment 39&hyph;2094, which is applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, &hyph;30, and -30F series airplanes, was published in the Federal Register on July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36375). The action proposed to supersede AD 75&hyph;04&hyph;11, which currently requires inspections to detect ice and snow accumulation on top of the fuselage and in the inlet of the number 2 engine, and removal of ice and snow. The action proposed to add Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;15 series airplanes to the applicability of the rule, and to limit the inspection requirement to only a certain group of airplanes. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the single comment received. The commenter supports the proposed rule. After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. There are approximately 379 McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, &hyph;30, &hyph;30F, and &hyph;15 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 226 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. (Currently, there are no Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;15 series airplanes of U.S. registry that will be affected by this AD.) The inspections that were previously required by AD 75&hyph;04&hyph;11, and retained in this AD take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspection requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $12,430, or $55 per airplane, per inspection. This AD will only add the cost of inspections for the operators of Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes. For operators of Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, &hyph;30, and &hyph;30F series airplanes having all solid fan blades in the number 2 engine position, the economic burden will be reduced since the previous requirement to inspect these airplanes in accordance with the existing AD will be eliminated by this AD. However, this does not relieve operators of the responsibility to comply with the requirements of §§91.527 (``Operating in icing conditions'') and 121.629 (``Operation in icing conditions''_air carriers) of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 91.527 and 121.629). The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
