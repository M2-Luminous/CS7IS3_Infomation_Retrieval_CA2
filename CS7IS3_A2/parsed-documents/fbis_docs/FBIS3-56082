The step earned sizable support from the rightist opposition but was sharply criticized by some members of the ruling majority. Kestutis Jaskelevicius, chairman of the parliament's Budget and Finance Committee, ironically remarked that the next step would be to impose a ban on short skirts. A special commission of the Lithuanian Finance Ministry said the move would eliminate possibilities to root out illegal casinos by applying economic methods and to get additional budget receipts. A similar view was expressed by Finance Minister Eduardas Vilkelis. The parliament ignored the commission's arguments because "believers pray for such a decision." The law will come into effect if it is signed by the president. The regulations of establishing casinos and gambling rules were approved by the Lithuanian government only a half year ago.
