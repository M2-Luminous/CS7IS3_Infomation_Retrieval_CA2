FR940728-1-00011 FR940728-1-00003 In 8 CFR 340.1(b), the Service proposes that notices of intent to reopen naturalization proceedings under section 340(i) of the Act be served on the affected party no later than 1 year from the time naturalization vested. The Service found that setting a 1-year time period for such action would assist in keeping reopenings limited to actions truly corrective in nature, as the Service does not intend the reopening process to be used in cases requiring extensive investigation of possible grounds for revocation. Section 340.1(b) also proposes notice and response requirements for administrative reopening of naturalization applications. The Service proposes that the district director who originally granted the naturalization proceedings pursuant to this regulation. The proposed regulation also provides that the applicant be personally served with notice of intent to reopen naturalization proceedings and to deny naturalization. The Service must include with the notice all evidence upon which the intended reopening is based. The proposed regulation further provides that the applicant must be given sixty (60) days during which to respond to the notice, as well as the opportunity to submit any evidence in support of the naturalization application. The applicant may also request an informal, nonadversarial hearing to present evidence in response to the notice of intent to reopen naturalization proceedings, and to challenge the grounds for reopening alleged by the district director. The proposed regulations provide that the applicant, in lieu of responding to the notice of intent to reopen naturalization proceedings, may also elect to withdraw the naturalization application which the district director intends to reopen. The applicant may do so either in writing, or by failing to respond in any way to the notice. Section 340.1(c) describes the evidence that the district director must consider when rendering a decision on whether to reopen proceedings and deny the naturalization application. Because a reopened naturalization application is treated as a continuation of the original naturalization proceedings, the burden rests with the applicant to establish eligibility for naturalization. The district director's decision to reopen the naturalization application must reflect that he or she has considered all evidence of record relating to the naturalization application. Because the Service recognizes the need to provide the applicant with a prompt adjudication on whether the application will be reopened and denied, the regulation at §340.1(d) proposes that such decision must be rendered no later than 180 days after service of the notice of intent to reopen naturalization proceedings and to deny naturalization. Section 340.1(e) proposes that the applicant may seek administrative appeal of a district director's adverse decision. If the district determines, however, after examining the evidence of record, that reopening is inappropriate, the Service must forego further investigative action under section 340(i) of the Act, but may pursue plenary revocation action under section 340(a) of the Act. All administratively final decisions under this proposed rule are subject to judicial review in Federal court. The Service wishes to point out that until a decision to reopen naturalization proceedings and to deny naturalization becomes final, through failure to appeal or through exhaustion of all administrative and/or judicial appeals, the applicant remains a citizen of the United States. Once a decision adverse to the applicant becomes final, however, the naturalization is rendered void ab initio and the applicant must surrender his or her certificate of naturalization for cancellation. This rule proposes to redesignate §340.11 as §340.2 and to change the heading to distinguish the actions described therein from those described in §340.1. The Service also proposes changes in the language and format of redesignated §340.2 to clarify the recommendation procedures and requirement set forth in that section. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation and, by approving it, certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because of the following factors. This rule proposes a procedure for the Service to reopen naturalization applications filed by individuals. The affected parties are not small entities, and the impact of the regulation is not an economic one. Executive Order 12866 This rule is not considered by the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, §3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process under section 6(a)(3)(A).
