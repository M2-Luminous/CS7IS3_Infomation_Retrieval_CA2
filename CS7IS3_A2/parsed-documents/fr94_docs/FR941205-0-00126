FR941205-0-00126 FR941205-0-00027 B. Expanded Scope for Already Approved Methods Comments on expanding the analytical scope of these five methods were favorable. These methods, EPA Methods 200.8, 200.9, 300.0, SM 4110B, and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method D4327&hyph;91, were discussed in the 1993 proposal or the 1994 NOA. Specific comments requesting that approved methods cover additional analytes are described and answered below. A commenter asked EPA to expand the scope of Method 200.8 to include additional metals that are not currently regulated by EPA. While EPA encourages laboratories to use any approved method for all contaminants that are within the analytical scope of the method, EPA can only approve a method for contaminants that are regulated. One commenter asked why Method 200.9 did not include the secondary drinking water contaminant, zinc. EPA believes analysis of zinc with Method 200.9 is impractical, because the instrument and procedure used are very sensitive to small amounts of lead. The analysis is subject to random contamination, and the concentration range of zinc that can be reliably measured is too narrow to be of use with typical drinking water samples. EPA recommends more suitable methods (EPA 200.7, 200.9, SM 3120B and SM 3111B) for measurement of zinc in drinking water samples. Commenters were concerned about expanding the scope of the ion chromatography methods to include fluoride. They believed that EPA did not have data to show that interference problems would not preclude use of ion chromatography for the analysis of fluoride in drinking water samples. EPA's 1990 study (Bionetics) which involved participation of seventeen laboratories demonstrated that fluoride can be reliably measured in drinking water samples with ion chromatography. Thus, EPA has no hesitation in approving the three proposed ion chromatography methods for the analysis of fluoride in drinking water. C. Updated Methods Comment on updating earlier versions of six methods to the current versions was favorable. These methods, EPA Methods 504.1, 515.2, 524.2, 525.2, 548.1 and 549.1, were discussed in the 1993 proposal or the 1994 NOA. Problems were reported by a commenter with the use of trimethylsilyldiazomethane (TMSD) for derivatization of the analytes in Methods 515.1 and 515.2. The commenter suggested that EPA also allow the use of diazomethane for this purpose. EPA agrees with the commenter and, as discussed in the 1993 proposal, EPA allows use of either derivatizing reagent. However, because dalapon is not adequately derivatized by TMSD, the use of TMSD in Method 515.1 is not approved for analysis of dalapon. Procedures for using TMSD with Methods 515.1 and 515.2 are described in the document Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 1994d). D. Updates to Methods by Reference to Most Recent Manual Comments were favorable on approving versions of previously approved methods that are now contained in the eighteenth edition of Standard Methods (APHA, 1992) and in five new EPA manuals (EPA, 1994a, 1991, 1990a, 1992b and 1993a). These publications were described and discussed in the 1993 proposal or the 1994 NOA. Questions or requests from commenters about some of the methods contained in these publications are described and answered below. 1994 EPA Metals Manual (EPA, 1994a)‚ê£Three commenters asked to add other regulated metals to the scope of Method 200.7, because use of a new axial configured inductively coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) instrument improves the sensitivity of the method to the required regulatory limits. EPA will not approve this request in today's rule, because Method 200.7 as written allows use of other types of ICP/AES instruments that cannot meet the regulatory limits for the additional metals. To extend the scope of Method 200.7 as suggested by the commenters would require either a formal ATP approval (EPA, 1993c), or publication of a new AES method that allowed only instruments with an axial configuration.
