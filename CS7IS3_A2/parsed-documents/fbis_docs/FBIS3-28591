[TEC] will introduce a system of international bidding for procuring large general-purpose equipment, including hydraulic power generators. As the first step, TEC will invite European companies to join in an international bid to be held in the near future to procure a water turbine for one of its generators. TEC has so far held international bidding only for procuring high-tech equipment such as nuclear reactors, or for general-purpose equipment such as transmission lines which would require only a small amount of funds. TEC is expected to place constant orders for equipment -- such as hydraulic power generation equipment which requires relatively large amounts of funds. If the international bidding for this procurement should be expanded, it would be useful in easing the demand by the United States and European countries to open the Japanese market. TEC plans to place an order for a water turbine for one of its generator to replace the obsolete turbine at Yukawa Hydraulic Power Station (in Nagano), and also to increase its generating capability to 18,000 kilowatt-hours. Prior to the bidding, in late January four Japanese companies and three European manufacturers -- including Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation as well as GEC Arstaum-Nelpick of France, Fest-Alpine of Austria, and Surdzer- Eshawis of Switzerland [names as published] respectively -- were entrusted with estimations. Various European countries have criticized Japanese electric power companies for favoring mostly American companies such as General Electric (GE) as far as international biddings are conducted. European companies are known for high technological standards in manufacturing hydraulic power generators. TEC has judged that with the participation of the three European companies in this bidding, various European countries will become less dissatisfied. A water turbine costs hundreds of million in yen. However, in addition to turbine used at the Yukawa Hydraulic Station, TEC still has many hydraulic power stations whose turbines have to be replaced. Therefore, it is expected that a considerable number of orders for water turbines will be placed in the future. If TEC should succeed in the current order, the company intends to invite more foreign companies to join in the bidding for large machines such as thermal power generators.
