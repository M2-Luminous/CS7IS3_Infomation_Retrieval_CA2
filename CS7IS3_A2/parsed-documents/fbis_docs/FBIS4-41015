Chechevatov, commander of the Far East Military District, by Valeriy Usoltsev under "Military Commander Takes the Floor" rubric; place and date not given: "They Will Not Be `Toy Soldiers'"] [Text] Col. Gen. Viktor Stepanovich Chechevatov, commander of the Far East Military District, is a man of indisputable authority for the region's Cossacks. They consider him "one of their own." And it is perhaps now understandable why the Cossack hetmans of Russia's remote regions elected him unanimously as their appointed hetman. [Usoltsev] Viktor Stepanovich, many politicians of the most diverse caliber and rank are today wooing the Cossacks and seeking to win their favor, that is to say, to attain the sort of position in which you now find yourself, enjoying their love, esteem, and respect.... What do you think is moving these politicians toward the Cossacks? [Chechevatov] Well, you have come up with a whole "bunch" of questions. So, am I to analyze, on the basis of my own experience, the goals of people who, I suppose, are using the Cossacks simply to attain their own interests, for their own political advantage? My experience is not suitable. I am with the Cossacks with all my soul, with all my heart. They are such radiant people, just what our Fatherland needs today! They are a force. That is why these people are trying to get attached to them. They represent the special spiritual world order of our excellent national "mix." And to "toy" with the Cossacks today, to "woo" them, is to destroy -- to deliberately destroy, I believe -- the green shoots of our national recovery. These people want to use them -- but for destructive purposes. But the Cossacks.... They are an open people, they frequently trust those who by no means take them where they need to go, where our Russia itself needs to go.... So much "dirt," so much "trash" has swamped the Cossacks today; there are so many "masqueraders" in their midst. "Masqueraders" not only on the outside but on the inside too, people whose very thoughts are pernicious.... But there is virtually no opposition to all these deceitful, false, alien elements among the Cossacks, it seems to me. I often say this to the Cossacks at meetings. After all, this compromises the entire movement and provokes distrust in it on the part of outsiders. At best, that is -- if such an expression is appropriate. At worst, it provokes caustic mockery and downright insults. But I believe that, nevertheless, the Cossacks will not let anyone else get their grubby hands on their banners, their martial glory. The other day I returned from an official trip along the Amur and the Ussuri. I visited the Cossack villages. Traditions are alive and well. And traditions are like the roots of a tree. If there are roots, they will "pump in" the strength of the earth, and therefore, everything else will be there too. Hereditary Cossacks have appeared here once again. Kalmykovs, Nazarovs, Poluyanovs, Byankins. They know how to teach good sense to the Cossack "young," how to kindle love for the Motherland in their hearts, how to develop in them a sense of Duty, Honor, and military self-sacrifice in the name of the land in which they were born. And the Cossack villages themselves? It is like finding yourself in another world. Take Mogilevka, for example. The Cossacks, able in mind and body, live and create there. Their homes are beautiful to look at; there is always a good harvest; there is no despondency, and people believe in tomorrow. Therefore they actually prepare this tomorrow themselves, without relying on anyone else to do it for them. You know, after a meeting with such a people you feel a real spiritual uplift, the world seems a brighter place. Anyway, it seems that the district commander has started to gush. And this is contraindicated for us military people, as one of Aleksandr Kuprin's heroes remarked. Well? Time to talk about Cossack soldiers? [Usoltsev] You mean the creation of Cossack subunits in the district? [Chechevatov] There you have just used the term "subunit." Some Cossacks and hetmans are offended if we use this word, and not "combined formation," say, or "unit," at a pinch. They say that it is humiliating. We, they say, are ready today to put forward corps and armies. You are not ready, I reply. Why start to compromise a good thing? And again, what kind of new game of "gigantomania" is this? Your first steps do not have to be painful strides; just stretching your foot forward will do. And who needs cripples? Not all of them understand jokes, they take offense.... As a rule, it is not those who think about the task in hand itself who think in terms of "corps," but those who think about themselves in that task. About being on show, being a prominent figure. In general, of course, many people have appeared today who wish to take command of "corps," to shine in generals' shoulder boards; for some Cossacks, as I notice, have a pretty simple attitude toward ranks: If it's what you like, it's yours by right, so help yourself. However, all this has been said before. My opinion is that the time has come to begin serious work on a program of military training for young Cossacks "at local level," in their native villages. After all, what happened in the past? The Cossack came into the services already with a sufficient degree of professional training. We have already started to do one or two things in this area. In a number of Cossack villages classes in military science are being given under the leadership of hetmans, with the aid of retired officers and sergeants. The district command is making available its own training grounds and firing ranges and allocating weapons and ammunition for these purposes. Many serving officers are also involved with young Cossacks and are training replenishments for themselves. As a rule this takes place on nonworking days, in off-duty periods -- in their personal time, as we say. This is truly selfless devotion. It turns out that, despite everything, real officers have not died out in our country. Today Cossacks living along the border already know where they have to go in the event of a deterioration of the situation or the emergence of a threat to Russia, where to get their arms, and at what gun emplacement to perform their combat task. We have started to use Cossacks to guard military stores and other Army facilities. By the way, the security and defense of Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy Ostrov has already been entrusted to Cossacks. A Cossack company has been formed there, and young Cossacks are serving creditably. As district commander I would like to mention the best men by name. They are all "hereditary villagers": Privates Aleksandr Chernyshov, Konstantin Mamontov, Vladimir Ivanov, Sergey Petaltsev. The district command sees the Cossacks as a real military force, as their reliable reserve. And of course, we will not leave them to confront problems alone. [Usoltsev] Cossacks complain of the lack of uniforms and equipment. All this costs a lot of money these days. And where are horses to be had? Can the district help here? [Chechevatov] We will help the Cossacks with uniforms and equipment. Rest assured that we are taking this question off the agenda. As for horses, the reviving villages have begun to raise them themselves. In the aforementioned Mogilevka. Back when he was a sovkhoz director the current hetman, Vladimir Torkhov, founded a stud farm on his own land and built a hippodrome, attracting dozens of young men and women to equestrian sports. It was from here that for the first time in the region, and perhaps in the old Soviet Union as a whole, young men began to come to serve in the Border Troops with their own horses. Yes, all problems are being resolved. If, of course, there is a desire to resolve them. If there are people who dream of making Russia great, of training for it a new generation of true sons and reliable defenders of their native borders. These will not be "toy soldiers." These troops will be the pride of our Armed Forces. This is my belief.
