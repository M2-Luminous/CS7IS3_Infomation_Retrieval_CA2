Bosnian Serb Army sources inform that the Moslems on the left bank of the Drina [River] have shelled the villages on the right bank, where the Serb population has returned after their liberation in a Serb counter-offensive which checked a Moslem offensive launched from Gorazde earlier this Spring. The Moslem infantry on Sunday attacked the village of Bijela in the Konjic municipality in northern Herzegovina, and engaged in sporadic provocations along the entire front between Nevesinje and Mostar, the local Bosnian Serb Army command informs. Moslems have also been opening fire from a 20-mm gun and a heavy machinegun on Serb positions in Sarajevo's suburb of Ilidza. Three Moslem snipers have been firing from the city's Dobrinja locality at the Serb residential area near Sarajevo airport. Moslems have been opening fire also from small-arms and hand-held rocket launchers in the area of the Vrbanja bridge. Movements of Moslem troops and mechanisation have been reported from the direction of Mt Igman towards the suburb of Hrasnica, and from Butmir airport to Donji Kotorac, all in Sarajevo.
