Since the beginning of the year, customs departments nationwide have uncovered over 20 major smuggling cases using the "three fakes." The value of these cases was some 90 million yuan, or about 35 percent of the total value of cases uncovered during the same period. Of these, automobiles have become the main target for smuggling using the "three fakes," as 90 smuggled automobiles were uncovered by customs officials in the first quarter alone. On 2 March this year, disguised under the names of three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, as well as using fake customs' tax reduction and exemption certificates and seals, illegal elements smuggled into the country 11 automobiles but were uncovered by Jinan customs officials in one stroke. Besides automobiles, other goods uncovered were motorcycles, color television sets, steel products, and polyester fibers. It has been learned that gangs who specialize in producing fake certificates and seals for use in reselling goods for profits have been uncovered in the society. In smuggling cases using the "three fakes" uncovered by customs officials in various localities, illegal elements applied unscrupulous means to produce various fake customs seals and certificates. A certain company produced 17 fake copies of "Customs Certificates for Imported Goods" to obtain the tax-free status by cheating on 32 items, including motorcycles, for resale, and was uncovered by the Shenyang Customs Department; and a certain company employee teamed up with others to illegally make two customs seals as well as 29 books of registration certificates for ship crews and their goods for resale activities, and was discovered by the Dalian Customs Department. Further, in the middle of March, the Kowloon Customs Department discovered the activities of producing fake customs penalty and confiscation certificates as well as covering up the illegal sources of goods. As smuggling activities using the "three fakes" have seriously sabotaged the normal order of import and export trade, causing great damages to the country, it is necessary to severely crack down on such activities. It is understood that the General Administration of Customs has made specific arrangements on organization and leadership, key task areas, and plans of action for local customs officials to severely crack down on the "three fakes" smuggling activities.
