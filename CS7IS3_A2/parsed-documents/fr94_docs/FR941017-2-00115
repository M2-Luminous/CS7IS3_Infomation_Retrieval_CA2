(70&hyph;8369) Energy Initiatives, Inc. (``EII''), One Upper Pond Road, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, a nonutility subsidiary of General Portfolios Corporation (``GPC''), a nonutility subsidiary of General Public Utilities Corporation (``GPU''), and GPU, 100 Interpace Parkway, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, a registered holding company, have filed a post-effective amendment under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(b) and Rules 45, 53 and 54 to their application-declaration filed under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 13(b) of the Act and Rules 45, 51, 90 and 91 thereunder. By order dated May 17, 1994 (HCAR No. 26053) (``May 1994 Order''), the following proposals were authorized: (i) for EII (a) to acquire through December 31, 1995 all of the stock of North Canadian Power Inc. (``NCP''), a company engaged exclusively in the business of owning or leasing and operating qualifying cogeneration facilities (``QFs''), as defined in the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended (``PURPA''), and developing other QFs and electric wholesale generators (``EWGs''), as defined in Section 32 of the Act, for a total of $72 million (``Purchase Price'') and (b) to enter into assumption agreements obligating EII to make payments up to $25 million; and, (ii) for GPU (a) to make up to $72 million in capital contributions or loans to EII through December 31, 1995 to pay the Purchase Price and (b) to assume certain guarantees associated with QFs and/or unconditionally guaranty EII's obligations and to make additional capital contributions up to a maximum aggregate amount of $25 million; and, (iii) for EII to issue, sell and renew through December 31, 2004 notes in an aggregate principal amount of $25 million, and for GPU to unconditionally guaranty the notes and EII's other related obligations. The May 1994 Order reserved jurisdiction over EII's proposals to (i) issue and sell $2.5 million of unsecured promissory notes to banks and accept guarantees or supporting agreements from GPU, and (ii) provide services to the QF projects as managing general partner under an exception to Section 13 under the Act. It is stated that, on June 13, 1994, EII acquired the common stock of NCP pursuant to the May 1994 Order. At the closing, GPU made a cash capital contribution to EII in order to fund the amount of the purchase price then being paid ($53,517,590). The balance of the purchase price (approximately $20 million) remains deposited in escrow pending receipt of required third party consents. Since the acquisition, EII and GPU have reached an agreement in principal on the terms and conditions of a loan agreement (``Loan Agreement'') with a group of lenders for whom Citibank, N.A. would initially act as agent. EII and GPU now request the authority to enter into the Loan Agreement and a support agreement (``Support Agreement''). The Loan Agreement would permit borrowings by EII in an aggregate amount not to exceed $30 million. Notes issued under the Loan Agreement would bear interest at either (i) the higher of Citibank, N.A.'s prime rate and the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points (``Alternative Base Rate''), or (ii) the interest rate per annum at which deposits in U.S. dollars are offered by the principal office of the reference bank (initially, Citibank, N.A.) in London, England to prime banks in the London interbank market, plus additional costs for reserves, if applicable (``Eurodollar Rate'') plus 50 basis points. Issuance of the Notes would be subject to certain conditions, and the Notes would be subject to acceleration under certain circumstances. Borrowings bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate would be prepayable at any time without penalty. Borrowings bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate would also be prepayable, subject to payment of certain costs incurred by the lenders in connection with the prepayment. EII would agree to pay the lenders under the Loan Agreement a facility fee of 37.5 basis points per annum and a one-time commitment fee payable at the initial closing of five basis points. EII and GPU also propose that the Loan Agreement will include a letter of credit (``L/C'') facility. Pursuant to this facility, EII would be able to request any lender which is a party to the Loan Agreement to issue an L/C, in a maximum aggregate face amount for all L/Cs outstanding of up to $15 million. The lender would, however, have the discretion not to issue an L/C. The aggregate amount that EII could borrow under the Loan Agreement would be reduced by the face amount of the outstanding L/Cs. Drawings on an L/C would initially bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate. If EII elects not to immediately reimburse the issuing bank, the drawing would be treated as a borrowing under the Loan Agreement. EII would be required to pay the issuing bank a letter of credit fee of .50% per annum on the face amount of the L/C. The Loan Agreement would have an initial term of three years, subject to extension for one year in the sole discretion of the lenders. Upon termination, EII would be permitted to repay any then outstanding loans over a two year period in quarterly installments, but EII would not be permitted to re-borrow during such period. To induce the lenders to enter into the Loan Agreement, GPU proposes to deliver to the lenders a Support Agreement. Among other things, that agreement would provide that GPU would maintain 100% ownership of EII and would use its best efforts to arrange for repayment of the Notes when they become due and payable.
