The end of the Cold War has created new opportunities for arms control and disarmament. One of Japan's major goals is to strengthen the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] system for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. That is why one of the first international policy decisions I made after becoming prime minister asserted Japan's strong support for the indefinite extension of the NPT beyond 1995. There have been reports in the last few days that Japan might change its policy should North Korea arm itself with nuclear weapons. I wish the people who write such reports would come to Japan and talk to our people. Then they would realize how deeply we feel about this issue. Let me be very clear on this point: I see no possibility that Japan would decide to become a nuclear power. Such a policy would be against Japan's national interest. We, like you, are very concerned about the current situation on the Korean peninsula. And we are determined, working closely with government leaders in the Republic of Korea and America, to help settle this issue. On the issue of conventional arms control, Japan also is actively involved. We are the only major nation in the world which is not selling any weapons to other countries. We have proposed a UN-supervised system to make it easier to monitor international sales of conventional arms. We want to broaden this system, to make it more effective. [passage omitted]
