UN peacekeepers Sunday [20 March] discovered Serb tanks and other heavy armament within the 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone imposed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization around the Bosnian capital last month. A NATO spokesman said that the United Nations Protection Force [UNPROFOR] was involved in negotiations with the Serbs to settle the issue. "We expect these weapons to be put under UNPROFOR control immediately as has been the case with other weapons in the exclusion zone," the spokesman said, adding: "Uncontrolled heavy weapons within the exclusion zone remain subject to NATO airstrikes in accordance with NATO's February 9 decision." On that day NATO issued an ultimatum threatening airstrikes if the parties to the conflict -- Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Government forces -- did not withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo or put them under UN control. UNPROFOR said Sunday's discovery of four tanks, three anti-aircraft guns, four 105mm howitzer and 18 mortars was a "big violation" of the UN demilitarization plan. [passage omitted]
