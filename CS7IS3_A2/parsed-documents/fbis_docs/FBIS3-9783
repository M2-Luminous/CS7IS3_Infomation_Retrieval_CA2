Rejecting especially remarks made by Premier Vaclav Klaus, the Council said they expected Klaus to "apologize" at a CMKOS meeting due in April, Jurina said. Klaus described the March 22 rally as a position taken by a group of people, adding that essential Czech policy questions are not decided at rallies but in parliament. The former was possible in February 1948, but "is not possible on March 22, 1994," Klaus said, referring to the 1948 Communist coup. Jurina said that in pressing for its demands (for better terms for workers), the council would "harden its attitude in collective bargaining." He said the Council intended to hold regional demonstrations, put pressure on employers and deputies, and conduct its own public opinion surveys. CMKOS will also adopt a stricter line on defending employees "affected by the employment law," Jurina said, adding that the Council warned union members against allowing themselves to be manipulated by political parties as part of the political game. Union members should "reject all attempt to be drawn into unpremeditated and pseudo-radical actions," Jurina said.
