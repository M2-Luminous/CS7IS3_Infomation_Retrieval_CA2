FR940513-2-00083 FR940513-2-00039 The Family Friends program for children with disabilities or chronic illnesses was established, in 1986, by NCOA, with funding support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. In 1990, the program diversified by helping another at-risk group, the rural poor (Rural Family Friends Help Families in Distress). That same year, NCOA introduced Family Friends into homeless shelters for families and children. Then, in 1992, Family Friends took on a new challenge_to give social and emotional support to families of babies who are HIV-positive. In 1991, AoA began implementation of the Volunteer Senior Aides (VSA) Program pursuant to the legislative mandate of Section 10404 of the 1989 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA). Section 10404 authorized this program for community-based demonstrations to determine to what extent volunteer senior aides, by providing basic medical assistance and support to disabled/chronically ill children and their families, can reduce the cost of care for such children. Program funds became available with the FY 1991 Appropriation Bill for the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), which provided funding under Section 1110 of the Social Security Act. Within DHHS, AoA was then assigned responsibility for program administration and awarded grants supporting six three-year community-based VSA demonstration projects. The six grantees are: •The Los Angeles County Area Agency on Aging (Los Angeles, CA) in collaboration with Jewish Family Services of Los Angeles and Huntington Memorial Hospital of Pasadena; •The CrossRoads of Iowa Area Agency on Aging (Des Moines, IA), in collaboration with the Easter Seal Society of Iowa; •The Region IV Area Agency on Aging (St. Joseph, MI), in collaboration with the local Foster Grandparents Program; •The Philadelphia Corporation for Aging (Philadelphia, PA), in cooperation with Temple University's Center for Intergenerational Learning and Institute on Disabilities; •The County of Riverside Office on Aging (Riverside, CA); and •The Mid-America Regional Council (MARC) Area Agency on Aging (Kansas City, MO) in collaboration with the Children's Mercy Hospital and the University of Missouri's University Affiliated Program for Developmental Disabilities. The last of these, MARC, is also conducting evaluative research on the VSA Program. The National Council on the Aging, drawing upon its experience with Family Friends, provides technical assistance, training, and capacity-building services to the VSA demonstrations. Because of the continuing need for and the proven success of the Family Friends/VSA, program, AoA is now soliciting applications to develop and implement VSA projects in additional communities. Proposed projects should demonstrate the use of Volunteer Senior Aides to assist families of disabled/chronically ill children, thereby reducing the cost of care for such children. These projects should effectively employ the unique skills, varied experience, good will, and availability of older volunteers in assisting the Nation's children who are severely disabled or chronically ill. VSA Project Parameters Volunteer Senior Aides projects, usually tri-generational, are designed to benefit everyone involved. The children, who have serious, chronic illnesses or disabilities and range in age from infancy to 12 years, receive physical care, self-help instruction, emotional support, and nurturing. Their siblings may receive greater attention or may benefit indirectly as their family is strengthened. The parents (or, in some cases, grandparents) of these children are given encouragement and respite_intangibles that they need to carry on. The volunteers_aged 55 and older_have a mission and are rewarded with a sense of personal pride and accomplishment. They becomes less isolated, more involved in the community, and develop an affectionate relationship with their new ``granddaughters'' or ``grandsons'' and/or other family members. The community is strengthened by older citizens voluntarily providing supportive services to younger citizens. Health care costs are reduced. And people learn to rely on each other, connecting with an ``extended family'' in this era of disconnected families. Family Friends or VSAs are extensively trained to find the best way to help a family. The type of help depends upon what's needed at the time. They may tutor the child, teach personal care and self-help skills, or take the child to recreational/cultural events. These volunteers often act as advocates, serving as ``case coordinator'' and speaking on behalf of the family to the various professionals who plan and manage the child's care. They also provide social and emotional support and, in many cases, respite to weary parents. (Respite is provided only when the child is medically stable and by agreement of parents, project director, and volunteer and is limited to half of the time the volunteer spends with the child.)
