According to the Kyushu Regional Bureau of International Trade and Industry, total production of integrated circuits (ICs) in the Kyushu region in April hit a record high of about 670.6 million chips. April marked the 15th consecutive month of year-to-year rises, said the regional bureau of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). An official of major microchip manufacturer Oki Electric Industry Co.'s semiconductor factory in Miyazaki Prefecture said the record- breaking output reflects "strong exports to the United States due to robust demand for personal computers there." "A great number of microchip makers are building new facilities to boost production capacities," he said. In 1992, ic output in Kyushu plunged 11 percent from the year before to 6.36 billion chips. Production began to show signs of picking up early this year. In February, the first year-on-year rise in about two years was seen. IC production surged to 668,637,000 chips the following month, the highest level since the 670 million scored in September 1993.
