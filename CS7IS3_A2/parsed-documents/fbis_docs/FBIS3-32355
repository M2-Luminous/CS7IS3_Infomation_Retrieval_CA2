The document asserts that authorization was never requested for the U.S. officer to leave the country because the U.S. Embassy only kept the foreign minister abreast of the situation by telephone. Upon confirming the incident, the U.S. Embassy promised the Salvadoran Foreign Ministry to prosecute the officer in accordance with U.S. legislation as stipulated under the Vienna Convention. Despite the official explanations provided by the U.S. Embassy, the communique states, the Salvadoran Government is not fully satisfied. Consequently, a letter of protest has been sent to the Clinton administration demanding penalties against the individuals who violated El Salvador's laws, especially its immigration laws.
