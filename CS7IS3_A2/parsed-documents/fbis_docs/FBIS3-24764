An AFP correspondent saw the bodies of two women and one man on the road leading to the airport. One of the dead had his arm blown off. There was no immediate confirmation of the clash from either U.S. military or UN sources. "He was sitting by the road. He wasn't doing anything," said a relative of another victim, who was shot in the head. A child, less than 10 years old, was hit in the throat while a man had his wrist blown up by a high-caliber bullet. Panic spread in the crowded streets shortly after the firing erupted, with passers-by screaming: "It's the Americans, It's the Americans."
