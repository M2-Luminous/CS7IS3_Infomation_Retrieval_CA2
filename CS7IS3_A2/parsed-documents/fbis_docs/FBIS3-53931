FBIS3-53931 "drnes014_k_94006" FBIS-NES-94-014 Document Type:Daily Report 21 Jan 1994 IRAQ Radio Reports UNSC Review of Embargo Measures JN1901131494 Baghdad Republic of Iraq Radio Network in Arabic 1220 GMT 19 Jan 94 JN1901131494 Baghdad Republic of Iraq Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] It was announced at the UN Security Council [UNSC] last night that the UNSC held unofficial consultations and failed to agree that the conditions required for lifting the embargo imposed on Iraq have been met. This decision was expected at this point in time. However, reliable diplomatic sources there have said that the next UNSC's review of the embargo, due to be held in March, will witness further positive developments, and that these developments will push for the lifting of the embargo imposed on Iraq. A diplomatic source has explained to the Iraqi News Agency correspondent in New York that a reading of the positions of the UNSC members during yesterday's consultations strongly show a flexible British position, particularly since the speech delivered by the British representative to the United Nations during the UNSC consultations was free of any strong accusations or additional conditions. The source added that there is evidence that the British position will be better during the next consultations the UNSC will hold in March, when the political stage will be set for the lifting of the sanctions. Other sources said that the UNSC consultations have almost seen a consensus on the need to lift the sanctions. All UNSC members, except U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, called for lifting the sanctions. In a statement to reporters yesterday, French ambassador to the United Nations Jean-Bernard Merime affirmed that the French position on Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 has remained unchanged. He said Iraq's position on this paragraph should be the yardstick to be heeded for lifting the oil embargo imposed on Iraq. He added that things will be good when Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special Commission, and Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, submit their reports per Paragraph 22 of the aforementioned resolution, reports which could help lift the embargo. Rolf Ekeus had informed a REUTER correspondent at the United Nations that he would leave for Baghdad early February for political talks with Iraqi officials. He added that his talks will focus on the overall developments pertaining to the dismantlement of the sanctions. In his statement to reporters, French ambassador Merime has not denied that there are differences between France and the United States over the lifting of the Iraq sanctions. Other diplomatic sources have said that the Spanish ambassador stressed, during the UNSC deliberations, the need for the UNSC decisions to be guided by Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and to be free of any political purposes. These sources noted that the Brazilian ambassador was more frank and clearer. In his speech, he affirmed that the UNSC and the Sanctions Committee must not act in a manner that harms the Iraqi people, or hurts their national economy. The Brazilian ambassador affirmed that Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 is clear. He added: The UNSC must be firm in the implementation of its own resolutions, a firm implementation of which is demanded. Diplomatic sources said that this remark by the Brazilian ambassador was meant to reject the addition of any fresh conditions to the provisions enshrined in Paragraph 22 of the aforesaid resolution, which provides for lifting the embargo imposed on Iraqi exports, including oil, once Iraq implements the provisions 8-13 enshrined in Resolution 687, which address the weapons of mass destruction--the provisions which have actually been implemented. The PRC ambassador strongly called for lifting the embargo imposed on Iraq and ending the Iraqis' suffering. He, along with the Russian, Nigerian, and Brazilian ambassadors, called for amending the traditional statement issued by the UNSC every 60 days so that it may note positive developments in the Iraqi position. As for the speech delivered by the U.S. representative to the United Nations, it was a paper she received from Van der Stoel, a Netherland national, the so-called Human Rights Commission rapporteur, during a meeting they had in the Hague last week. This paper included a string of lies and falsehoods that characterized the U.S. position. Radio London said that the UNSC consultations reflected differences among the UNSC members, adding that the French position was strongly favorable to Iraq.
