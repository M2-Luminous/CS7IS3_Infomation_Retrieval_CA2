Commenting on the U.S. Government's action at a news conference on 17 February, Futoshi Shirai, administrative vice minister of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, said: "I have heard the Japan Mobile Communications Company, which is in charge of handling American mobile phone companies, has done what it can do for them. I think that Japan has no means left to deal with the issue." In this way, he expressed his pessimism about avoiding U.S. sanctions. At the news conference, the administrative vice minister also said that the Japan-U.S. negotiations were set to be held on the morning of 15 February at the request of the U.S. side, but the negotiations were delayed until after U.S. Trade Representative Kantor's news conference, and lashed out at the way the United States has dealt with the issue in bilateral negotiations, saying, "My feeling is that the United States intended from the beginning to confirm Japan's violation." Masahito Tani, deputy minister of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, returned to Japan on 17 February after holding talks with Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Barshevsky on the issue of opening the Japanese mobile phone market. Speaking at a news conference that day, he expressed the grim view that negotiations cannot be held under the present circumstances, saying: "We will not comply with any request from the United States for the resumption of negotiations under the threat that it may resort to the process of imposing sanctions against Japan. At the present stage, the issue cannot be resolved politically."
