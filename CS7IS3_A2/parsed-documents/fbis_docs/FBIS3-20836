Niteks has about 1,500 employees; some 500 of them are underemployed. Approximately 1 million people, white collar and blue collar workers, are supposed to lose their jobs throughout Serbia soon. The new economic program foresees that about 200,000 of them will return to farms. Many other Serbian companies are trying to convince their work forces, which migrated from the countryside to the cities, to exchange their hammers for a sickle. The management of the Smederevo ironworks, a huge investment, is trying to motivate its workers to cultivate edible forest plants. The Crvena Zastava automobile factory in Kragujevac is planning to open a farming center. However, it seems that it will be difficult to persuade people to return to the countryside. The state program could be enforced only by using repressive measures and massive layoffs. It is questionable whether these people are really ready to return to the countryside; some of them have no place to which to return. People have migrated to the cities because they have found city life more comfortable, with more job and education opportunities. Now they feel shortchanged on all counts; they have lost their work, they are pressured to return to the village, they cannot send their children to school. It is hard to expect that all the problems will be solved with economic measures. Will the proponents of such a policy be forced to resort to violence, as was the case in China during the Cultural Revolution or as the Pol Pot regime [in Cambodia] did when it forcibly relocated the population, abolished the use of money, and established cooperatives?
