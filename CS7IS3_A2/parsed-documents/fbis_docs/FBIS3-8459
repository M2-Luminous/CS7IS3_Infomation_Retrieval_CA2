Velebit, near Gracac, ISKRA reports. Following minor provocations on 4 March, the Croatian Army intensified its activities and is bringing in reinforcements with strong artillery backing, the information says. The representatives of diplomatic and consular missions in Belgrade have been requested to inform their governments about these assaults by Croatia against the sovereignty of the RSK, and to raise the issue in international forums, in view of the fact that Croatia is violating all the cease-fire agreements signed with the RSK so far. The Krajina Foreign Ministry warns that the latest attack against the RSK, if the Croatian offensive is not checked, could have dire consequences and could result in the escalation of the war in the region of former Yugoslavia.
