"The center-right axis has no future without the National Alliance." MSI [Italian Social Movement] Secretary Gianfranco Fini is watching the movement between the Northern League and Forza Italia and waiting, but he is not anxious. He has made plans to meet with [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi in the near future and fully intends to conclude the electoral accord on which he has set his sights. [Caviglia] Deputy Fini, Bossi now seems to see a better chance of an electoral accord between yourself and Forza Italia. Is this a real overture? [Fini] In my view, the fact that Bossi has told Berlusconi to handle the south, means that he is well aware that this means an accord with the National Alliance. Berlusconi has the votes and can form a consensus -- I do not question that -- but, if he wants his followers to be elected, he must build a relationship with us. Therefore, in my opinion, the accord is both numerical and logical. [Caviglia] But what type of accord can there be between you and Forza Italia if Berlusconi signs a binding pact with the League? [Fini] Clearly no hidden accord. We do not like the idea of stepping down, where one candidate refrains from running for election in order to do a favor to the other. If there is to be an accord, it will be made out in the open. Otherwise it would be like cheating the voters. On the other hand, neither can there be a political and program accord after the boost that Bossi has given federalism. [Caviglia] Does that means you are setting conditions for potential allies? [Fini] I am simply saying that Bossi's attitude has made any chance of a political accord impossible. We cannot accept the prospect of federalism. [Caviglia] So how can you reach an agreement? [Fini] I think there is room for a clearly stated electoral agreement between the National Alliance and Forza Italia in the south. [Caviglia] With both symbols, one beside the other? [Fini] That is one possibility, but not the only one. I repeat, in my view the need for this accord lies in the numbers. And the result would also be very important because of its indirect effects. If an accord is reached between Berlusconi and the League in the north, and between Berlusconi and the National Alliance in the south, can you imagine how many constituencies Segni [Pact for Italy leader] and Secretary Martinazzoli (PPI [Italian Popular Party]) would win? [Caviglia] You tell us. [Fini] Maybe Stintino [Segni's home in Sardinia], where Segni would succeed in getting elected even if he were a pirate, and not many more. As for the rest, they will have to be content with about 20 deputies elected through proportional representation. And it would be the best change for the Italian political scene. [Caviglia] It seems that the Center has become your chief adversary. [Fini] The Center is the great uncertain factor of Italian politics, and the sooner the field is left clear, the better. The "old" at this moment is represented by Segni par excellence, because he is preventing Italy from having a perfect bipolar system, in which there are only two alignments. But I do not think this will last for long. After its predictable election debacle, the PPI and its allies will embrace the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. [Caviglia] Actually, Segni and Martinazzoli keep on repeating that they are an alternative to the leftist cartel. [Fini] That is in their nature. That is why the PPI has remained entirely in the hands of people like [PPI Veneto Regional Secretary] Rosy Bindi and [PPI Sicily Regional Secretary] Sergio Mattarella, who are very keen to reach an accord with the PDS. And that is why the real centrists like Casini, Mastella, and D'Onofrio left the party. They understood that the PPI was not even a real center because it was suffering from an acute pull to the left. At that point they had to choose and they are now trying to build a center-right alliance with us. [Caviglia] A result that still seems a long way off. [Fini] Well, the election campaign is clearly not the ideal moment, because each party roots for its own flag, proclaims its own identity. But building this alignment is part of our vision. [Caviglia] Isn't yet another step forward required? [Fini] From the point of view of values absolutely not. We have stated that Fascism is a part of history. What more would you have us do? [Caviglia] A little self-criticism perhaps as the communists did.. [Fini] It is not a matter of self-criticism, but of recognizing the fact that those things have been superseded. That there is no longer any sense in splitting into Fascists and anti-Fascists. Nor is there any sense in our being an alternative to the system, because the system no longer exists. We want to be able to be elected to power and make an alliance with the Center, but one thing must be clear: I remain a man of the Right.
