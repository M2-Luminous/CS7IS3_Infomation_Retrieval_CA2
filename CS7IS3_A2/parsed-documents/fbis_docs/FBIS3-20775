In administering the state, it is only the most necessary jobs that are filled, and they are most strictly controlled. The cost of legislative work has increased. The representative missions operate on a subsistence level with obsolete equipment. Given the situation in which we find ourselves today, with a variety of economic difficulties, increased social tensions, job insecurity, declining living standards, and so on, we encounter a variety of comments, divided thoughts, and different views. One of them that is frequently heard, most likely triggered by the latest price increases, is the following: One cannot build a new state at no cost. Unquestionably, this is quite true, as is the second view, which seemed to be the precise opposite of the first: that under the circumstances in which we are creating and building an independent and sovereign Macedonian State, costs should not matter. Based on our possibilities, we should build the state on a firm and stable basis. In all cases, regardless of the various shades of meaning, one way or another the two views lead to the same question: What kind of state are we developing, be it expensive or inexpensive, and at what cost, even though we are dealing with a relative concept. Small Steps The answer to this question, however, is not nor could it be simple or, even less so, claim to be accurate. To reach it, even if within a certain global framework, we must include a large number of parameters and perform a number of mathematical computations. However, this does not mean that we could not reach some more specific knowledge as to the nature of our state and the cost of its functioning. According to Dr. Josif Talevski, secretary to the government of the Republic of Macedonia and a specialist in state administration, if we are seeking the answer as to how much the state is costing us in the financial indicators, which would include the state agencies and management and administering organizations, according to the projected Republic budget for 1944 [as published] submitted by the end of last month, we could generally say that the total will exceed 48 billion denars. This includes all the expenses of all agencies, starting with the office of the president of the Republic, the Assembly, the government, the ministries, and all the way to the lower-level services and agencies. Compared to other countries, the cost is low, particularly taking into consideration the average wages of state officials, which are public knowledge. As we know, furthermore, this year's budget for state authorities and organizations has been considerably reduced as compared to last year's. Furthermore, according to the Budget Law the recipients of the budget in the legislative, executive, and judicial branches must use their funds strictly for their specific purposes, efficiently and economically. Such an economical approach, however, involves more than simply the use and handling of funds. The emphasis is on having a less costly but not less efficient state and on having these attributes become part of all aspects of the work of state agencies and administrations. Incidentally, these bodies are less cumbersome than the impression they project. This is further confirmed by data: Excluding the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Defense, they total 1,753 employees. There is pressure to increase this number. According to Dr. Talevski, increasing the administration is a typical phenomenon inherent in and affecting all systems. Dr. Talevski says that an increased administration is directly related to increased state and public affairs. We cannot claim to have avoided this phenomenon. It should be pointed out, however, that in 1993 the number of employees of budget-supported state agencies substantially declined for a variety of reasons (retirement, attrition, etc.). More precisely, it is only the most necessary positions that have been filled in accordance with the systematization regulations. Again, for this year, according to the budget laws no new personnel may be hired unless specific funds have been stipulated in the budget for that purpose, based on a resolution passed by a special commission to be set up by the government. Extensive Meetings According to Talevski, in discussing the size of the administration we must always bear in mind that it must be consistent with the size of the population and must meet the needs of the citizens. It would be difficult, he said, to name a country that knows precisely the size of the administration its needs. Improving and updating the state administration presents no problem. "Modernizing the administration is necessary to make it more efficient. We are still far from claiming to have a modern administration in terms of facilities. The conclusion is that we cannot accuse the administration of inefficiency if we do not invest in its modernization. It is enough to take a look at our local offices and their facilities. Updating them may increase the cost of state management, but if we want efficiency the cost is inevitable." The legal authorities of the state cannot be ignored in determining whether the cost of running the state should be higher or lower. In this specific case, more funds would be required to ensure the unobstructed work and functioning of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. Among others, we must provide for the salaries of the 137 Assembly officials, the 76 permanent paid representatives, and the 53 managers and experts, and cover other expenses. Such expenses have not declined. As of 8 January 1991 [as published], for example, so far 72 sessions have been held, many of which have been extended. A large number of them were initiated and not completed. Therefore, adding this all together it turns out that, in practical terms, the parliament was in session one day out of three. On the other hand, it has been calculated that an average session, including the cost of printing, public facilities, toilet articles, and per diem and travel expenditures, costs about 300,000 denars. Here is another piece of information: The cost of the 68th parliamentary session was 34,570 denars for per diem expenses; payments to the representatives for the 11 months of last year totaled 18.329 milion denars. Transportation The premises of the representatives of the Macedonian State are furnished with obsolete and worn-out equipment, and their transportation fleet is very modest. The service in charge of general and Assembly work for the Macedonian Government, which services all state authorities and organizations, has only two small airplanes and about 35 various vehicles, most of them of inexpensive models. The fleet is quite obsolete and should be updated. However, there are no financial possibilities whatsoever to update it. As the service officials have stated, they will wait for better times. Obsolete Facilities Based on the sums we have quoted, it is quite obvious that the Macedonian State is not among the rich. Despite the existing economic circumstances, it insists that the necessary functions be performed with a modest amount of the people' money. However, this does not mean that this situation can last forever. With the expansion of international and other activities, and the opening of diplomatic and other missions within Macedonia and Macedonian missions abroad, commitments will increase and so will demand for funds. In this connection, another topical issue is that of representational facilities. It is a fact that our country still has no proper residence in which to house heads of state or government or any other high guests. It is true that Skopje and Ohrid each have two cottages used to house representatives of foreign countries visiting Macedonia. They are in such poor condition, however, that we should not even list them as representative facilities. They have remained virtually unchanged since they were built, with worn-out and obsolete amenities, and they have a large number of other unsolved problems. In terms of their purpose, they are dysfunctional. According to Boris Treneski, who heads the Service for General and Assembly Projects of the Macedonian Government, it is precisely for such reasons that we must concern ourselves with these facilities and bring them up to modern standards. In that sense, the government has already passed a resolution on renovating the four cottages -- "Makedonija," and "Vodno" in Vodno, and "Biljana" and "Ohrid" in Ohrid -- and on refurbishing the Representatives Club in Skopje, making it suitable for receiving foreign delegations. Furthermore, possibilities will be sought to provide proper premises for an international press center. Considering the economic situation, this will not be easy. However, we have no choice.
