Some 30 envoys and senior foreign ministry officials from the United States, Canada, the European Community and Russia proposed ways to bring relief to besieged Moslem enclaves and prevent use elsewhere of Bosnian Serb heavy weapons withdrawn from around the capital, German foreign ministry political director Juergen Chrobog said. [passage omitted] [Russia's Vitaly] Churkin told reporters: "We know now what we are doing. We are acting together." Asked if Russia would put pressure on the Serbs, he said that some countries had "special channels" by which to influence the warring parties "for the common good:" the Americans with the Moslems, the Germans with the Croats and the Russians with the Serbs. [passage omitted] Chrobog said Tuesday's meeting concluded that the European peace plan for the former Yugoslav republic was "quantitatively more or less right" in giving a proposed 33 percent of the republic's territory to the Moslems, but that "qualitatively" there needed to be improvements in besieged Moslem enclaves. For Sarajevo, the participants agreed the need for consolidation of the peace through demilitarisation, free access for humanitarian aid and a restoration of normal life with UN help, according to a joint statement. They expressed their "deep concern" regarding the situation in other Bosnian regions, and stressed the need to "concentrate efforts on extending the security zones". They stressed the need to improve conditions for the besieged Moslem population of Maglaj, and called for a rapid reopening of the airport at Tuzla. Regarding the fighting between Bosnian Moslem and Croat forces, they called for a ceasefire and withdrawal of artillery to allow a return to normal life in Mostar, and an effective ceasefire with a pulling back of the warring parties in central Bosnia. The meeting was aimed at building on the peace in Sarajevo resulting from the withdrawal, under threat of NATO airstrikes, of the besieging Serb forces' artillery. NATO responded to the shock caused by a presumed Serb shell which killed 68 people and wounded some 200 in a Sarajevo market early February.
