FBIS4-23291 "drafr106_e_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-106 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia ECOMOG Issues Warning Statement to Factions ECOMOG Issues Warning Statement to Factions AB0106121394 Monrovia Radio ELBC in English 0900 GMT 1 Jun 94 AB0106121394 Monrovia Radio ELBC English BFN [Text] ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] is warning that its patience and calmness should not be misinterpreted as weakness. ECOMOG is reminding the factions that Article 8 of the Cotonou Accord allows ECOMOG the right of self-defense but it does not wish to be compelled to implement this section of the accord. According to a release issued last night, ECOMOG noted that the practice whereby all the factions abduct ECOMOG soldiers at will must stop. The release noted that while ECOMOG's neutral position in this crisis is unquestionable and so far as ECOMOG will not [words indistinct] helplessly while its men and material are being maltreated and vandalized, ECOMOG says its patience should not be misinterpreted as a weakness. The release continued that about two weeks ago, nine ECOMOG soldiers belonging to the Ugandan contingent were abducted by the LPC [Liberian Peace Council] for no reason whatsoever and kept in captivity for about three days. Also, another soldier was kidnapped by the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] early this year and is yet to be released. Similarly, five ECOMOG soldiers are still being held by ULIMO fighters. ECOMOG wishes to reassure the people of Liberia and the international community that ECOMOG is religiously committed to the principle and spirit of the Cotonou Accord. ECOMOG says this commitment is evidenced by the way ECOMOG troops have continued to remain calm in the face of extremely reckless provocations. Meanwhile, the West African peacekeeping force has described as baseless and false allegations being made by the warring factions in the Liberian crisis against ECOMOG. ECOMOG says these allegations are only intended to discredit ECOMOG and its invaluable role and responsibility as a neutral peacekeeping force. In a statement issued last night, ECOMOG said while these allegations would not have required any rebuttal, it is necessary to stop [words indistinct]. In the statement, ECOMOG said in March this year, ECOMOG, in collaboration with UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission in Liberia], initiated a cease-fire negotiation between the NPFL and LPC but to their disappointment both sides proved not to be honest and serious about achieving peace. On two occasions, ECOMOG and UN joint reconnaissance missions to ascertain the disposition of the opposing forces were frustrated by the NPFL. On its part, the LPC has refused to cease hostilities so that ECOMOG can deploy its troops. ECOMOG says it is preposterous, therefore, for the NPFL and LPC to turn around after all these efforts to cast aspersions as to ECOMOG's neutrality. On the ULIMO issue, ECOMOG noted that in March, April, and May this year, series of reconciliatory meetings were held, all initiated by ECOMOG at the ECOMOG headquarters with UNOMIL officials in attendance to resolve the rift between Alhaji Koromah and Roosevelt Johnson to enable the peace process move forward. The cease-fire agreements reached at these meetings were not respected by either party. Still in an attempt to curtail the mayhem in Tubmanburg, Bong mines, and Bo, ECOMOG deployed troops to these areas as a confidence-building measure and to deter the fighters of the two factions from further carnage. The release said in spite of all these, the fighting persisted, thereby endangering the lives of ECOMOG officers and men as well as material deployed to these areas. The release concluded that since ECOMOG is a neutral multinational force whose mandate is to ensure that peace returns to Liberia, it did all that was humanly possible short of combat action to stop the carnage without success.
