A public security officer nevertheless warned him that further investigation would be conducted regarding the pieces he wrote for overseas media during this period. Wang said, however, that safeguarding the freedom of speech is a component of China's democratic movement and that he would continue writing. Deprivation of political rights primarily refers to the right to vote and stand for election, the freedoms of speech, press, and assembly as laid down in the constitution, and the right to take up posts in an enterprise or institution, among other rights.
