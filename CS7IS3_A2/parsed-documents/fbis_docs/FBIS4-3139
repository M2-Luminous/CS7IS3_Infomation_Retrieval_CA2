The source told REUTER a number of People's Liberation Army soldiers, armed with flame-throwers, robbed and burned to death the tourists and eight Mainland Chinese crew of the boat on Chientao [Qiandao] Lake in the Province of Chekiang [Zhejiang] on 31 March. Mainland Chinese authorities found out about the murders the next day but decided to cover them up and ordered the loot to be returned because the impact of the incident could be far-reaching, the source claimed, quoting intelligence which has been described as authoritative. The deaths of the tourists under mysterious circumstances have strained uneasy relations between Taiwan and Mainland China. Relatives of the victims have accused Mainland China of covering up what they alleged to be mass murder. Mainland China acknowledged last week that the blaze might have been caused by saboteurs. It pledged that the culprits would be severely punished.
