According to the requirements of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, our province should completely pay back the wages in arrears to teachers, office cadres, and retired cadres by 5 February. After hearing the reports, Cheng Weigao said: In the previous stage, according to the guidelines of the central authorities and the requirements of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, the departments concerned in the province did a lot of work and adopted some very good methods and measures. Although a few problems have not completely been solved, most problems have been alleviated. To further improve the work and thoroughly solve the problems, we should mainly attend to two tasks. First, we should set time to pay back the wages in arrears to teachers, cadres, and retired cadres; and to solve the problems that the staff members and workers of the enterprises with difficulties, the disaster-hit rural areas, and the extremely difficult areas lack money and grain to spend the Spring Festival. Second, we should ensure the stability of goods prices and particularly ensure to stabilize the prices of grain, oil, meat, eggs, and vegetables. We should realistically conduct price inspections and market management. Cheng Weigao pointed out: Solving practical problems for the masses and ensuring we spend the Spring Festival in a good way is not a specific problem but a matter relating to the overall situation. As for the areas that cannot pay back the wages in arrears, the leaders there should first sell their sedan cars and then pay wages to the staff and workers. Cheng Weigao stressed: Our country is not rich enough. So, we should vigorously advocate the policy of being diligent to build the country and do all undertakings and the policy of waging an arduous struggle and arduously doing pioneering work, resolutely oppose waste and extravagance, and create the greatest economic results with the least input. The leading organs and the leading cadres should set an example in this regard.
