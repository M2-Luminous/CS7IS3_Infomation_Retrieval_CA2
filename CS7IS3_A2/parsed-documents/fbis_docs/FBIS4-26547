In audio-visual product stores in the Dachengshi section of Beida District, inspectors seized 360 pirated cassette tapes, 547 video tapes, 1,390 compact discs, and 119 laser discs. Some of these audio and video products contained indecent material and others were poorly produced. During the inspection, inspectors discovered that some audio-visual product stores were operating without a business license, while others did not have any legitimate source of supply. The store operators did not have any understanding of copyrights and lacked the ability to tell genuine products from counterfeit ones. It has been learned that, since March this year, in Xian City proper, the authorities have seized a substantial amount of pirated audio-visual products, specifically, over 140,000 audio tapes and close to 100,000 video tapes.
