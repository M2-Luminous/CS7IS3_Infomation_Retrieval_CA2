No one can actually claim that the official Kuwaiti organs are responsible for this behavior or that they know of it. Our brilliant Kuwaiti colleague, Ahmad al-Jarallah, writer for AL-SIYASAH newspaper, wrote an article about this issue, which has been republished by AKHBAR AL-YAWM. He linked the fact that President Mubarak did not visit Kuwait on his journey home from China to the material and propaganda support the terrorist movements are getting from certain religious societies. Perhaps al-Jarallah's analysis is correct, or perhaps it exaggerates. But there is no doubt that he supports his view well by referring to the incident in which a Kuwaiti citizen who has close links with a famous Kuwaiti Islamic society arrived in Cairo with thousands of dollars that he was going to spend in a suspicious way. He claimed that the money was to be used to publish some books. We must praise the successes of the Egyptian security forces, which have recently taken matters into their own hands. They have succeeded in forestalling numerous terrorist acts, and in following and tracking down the leaders of this terrorism and the people who plan and support it inside and outside Egypt. Undoubtedly this is an important and necessary accomplishment to confront this criminal scheme. The objective of this scheme was to shake the stability and security of Egypt and cause seriously hurt the Egyptian people. The fact that the security organs found large amounts of foreign currency in some terrorist dens has raised questions about its sources. It was also natural that there is a growing conviction that there is foreign funding to buy weapons, pay agents, and spend set up and carry out terrorist crimes. It is no secret to anyone that in some Arab countries that hide behind the cloak of Islam, the religion of justice, some groups and societies are soliciting funds from their citizens on the pretext of helping Bosnia or Afghanistan, since Islam is a just religion. But these funds are actually being used to support and bolster terrorists directly or indirectly. In Kuwait, when meeting with Egyptian Tourism Minister Dr. Mamduh al-Biltaji and his delegation at the beginning of this week, Kuwaiti Amir Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad focussed on the firm Egyptian-Kuwaiti relations. He said that under no circumstances could his country forget the kindness of Egypt and the Egyptians during the liberation war, and in fact for scores of years even before that, before God granted it its oil wealth. He said that Egyptian teachers, engineers, doctors, and workers have contributed toward the education and medical treatment of Kuwaiti citizens. This means that Kuwait's progress and development go back to their efforts. The amir of Kuwait added that Egypt is the heart of the Arab nation and that what befalls it, befalls the whole Arab nation. The amir of Kuwait pointed out that terrorism and extremism have nothing to do with the true religion; extremism is a phenomenon in all religions. He affirmed that Islam has absolutely nothing to do with such behavior. As for the heir apparent of Kuwait, Sa'd al-'Abdallah, he spoke with great zeal about the strong fraternal relations between Egypt and Kuwait. When discussion turned to the Kuwaiti citizens' enthusiasm for visiting Egypt, he said in very clear terms that the Kuwaiti Government cannot and will not allow any Kuwaiti citizen to misbehave in Egypt or to commit any act that harms its security and stability. He affirmed that the Kuwaiti Government, which he heads, is ready to take the strictest measures possible against any Kuwaiti citizen who entertains ideas of this kind or violates the law. Actually, what the amir and heir apparent of Kuwait said in my presence confirm the importance of Arab and Islamic solidarity in containing the phenomenon of terrorism, whose objective is to weaken the Arabs and harm Islam, which is being subjected to a slander campaign by being linked to murderers, criminals, and saboteurs. During the big party given by Khalid al-Marzuq, the great lover of Egypt and owner of AL-ANBA' newspaper, which was attended by high Kuwaiti officials in honor of Egypt and the Egyptian delegation led by Mamduh al-Biltaji, the issue of the Kuwaiti citizen arrested in Cairo with thousands of dollars was brought up. Investigators claim that he was supposed to hand it over to some terrorist elements. This came out at the party in a chat Dr. al-Biltaji had with Shaykh Khalid Sultan, head of the Kuwaiti society to which the arrested Kuwaiti citizen belongs. Shaykh Sultan tried to deny that this Kuwaiti had any ties with Egyptian terrorists. He affirmed to Dr. al-Biltaji his respect for Egypt and concern for its security and stability. It has become well-known that terrorist operations, which Islam is being falsely accused of, are only a continuation of the campaign to attack and destroy the unity and solidarity of the Arab and Islamic nation in confronting international changes. Perhaps the most important proof of this is that the current image that terrorism is blatant arose after the foolish Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Also, terrorism is not at all free of responsibility for sedition in fraternal Yemen, which is currently going through a bloody and terrible war, the victims of which are the Yemeni people themselves.
