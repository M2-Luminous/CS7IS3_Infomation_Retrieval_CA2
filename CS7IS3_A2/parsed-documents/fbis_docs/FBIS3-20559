Answer: In 1994 Heilongjiang will be faced with very good opportunities for reform and development and will encounter unprecedented challenges. We will concentrate on doing a good job with large- and medium-sized enterprises and stress doing a good job of handling enterprise reform and upgrading. By reform we will free up current productive capacity and through upgrading we will develop new productivity. The organic integration of the dual tactics of reform and upgrading simultaneously employed will lay a firm foundation for the establishment of a modern enterprise system and promote sustained, coordinated, and sound development of the industrial economy. Question: Intensifying enterprise reform is one of the keys to industrial economic tasks throughout the province in 1994. So, what is the thinking on enterprise reform? Answer: The overall thinking on Heilongjiang's enterprise reform in 1994 is: To lay a foundation of enterprise operational autonomy closely centered on doing a good job with the core sector, large- and medium-sized state enterprises, fully promoting reform of the property rights system, and striving to achieve progressive breakthroughs. We will fundamentally convert the mechanisms of large- and medium-sized state enterprises that are prepared and establish a modern enterprise system suited to the demands of a market economy. At the same time, in accordance with the requirements for structuring a modern enterprise system, we will accelerate comprehensive reform of the macroeconomic control system, the market system, and the social security system. We also should speed up progress on converting the internal mechanisms of enterprises and improvement of the external environment. Question: In recent years Heilongjiang has adopted several policy measures to do a good job on large- and medium-sized state enterprises. What new plans are there in this respect for 1994? Answer: In 1994 we will adopt some new measures based on the new situation and tasks that reform and development are facing and speed up progress on large and medium-sized state enterprises. First we will actively and safely promote a modern enterprise system. In 1994 the state is selecting 100 large- and medium-sized enterprises to establish an experimental modern enterprise system. Heilongjiang is recommending three enterprises, the Qiqihar Steel Mill, the Jiamusi Paper Mill, and the Heilongjiang Polyester Factory, to the State Economic and Trade Commission to participate in the national experiment. At the same time, the province is selecting 15-20 enterprises to establish an experimental modern enterprise system at the province level. In 1994 we also will expand the scope of the experimental stock system and select 100 large- and medium-sized state enterprises to conduct the experiment, concentrating on selecting 60 of these large- and medium-sized state enterprises that are relatively well managed and have upgraded technology. Second, continue to intensify the implementation of Regulations on Converting Enterprise Operating Mechanisms and the Regulations on Supervision and Control. The provincial economic committee with relevant departments can strictly investigate and prosecute violations of the legitimate rights of enterprises. We should formulate detailed rules and regulations for Heilongjiang to implement the Regulations on Supervision and Control of state assets and institute supervision and control of the state assets of Heilongjiang's experimental enterprises and stress the implementation of the responsibility system for asset management and the experimental appointment of a control commission. Third, we should accelerate enterprise restructuring and improve the internal mechanisms of enterprises. First, we should accelerate the reform of the three enterprise systems. Second, we should increase efforts to strip away the logistics services system. Third, we should resolutely institute bankruptcy toward enterprises that have been losing for a long time and have no hope of turning around the losses or funds to offset their debts. In 1994 the state will set aside 7 billion yuan in bad debt reserves to be used as loans to cancel the bad debts of bankrupt enterprises. Heilongjiang will actively use this opportunity to plan the bankruptcy of about 80 state industrial enterprises (two to three of these large- or medium-sized enterprises). Fourth, in accordance with the demands of the market economy we should enhance enterprise management and administration. Presently quite a few enterprises are striving to convert their mechanisms. But a considerable number of enterprises have lax internal administration and management is "slipping." In 1994 the state will institute "convert mechanisms, stress administration, practice internal skills, and increase efficiency," and "in-depth economy results" activities. As the state launches these activities, Heilongjiang should continue to stress activities to improve quality and decrease consumption and tap potential and increase efficiency targeted at "100 Red Flag" enterprises and, based on economic returns, set up an evaluation to publicize the top five in 110 industries throughout the province. Fifth, reduce unreasonable enterprise burdens. In accordance with relevant state stipulations on credit interest owed on allocations changed to loans, economic committees at every level with relevant departments can do a good job on the remaining credit interest owed on the 1.46 billion yuan Heilongjiang industrial enterprise allocations changed to loans between 1983 and 1985. Using the base of the remaining credit interest owed on state allocations changed to loans, we should select ten cities and by category and by time period explore experimental opportunities for concrete solutions and strive to include Harbin in the list. We also should have multiple channels for supplementing enterprise circulating funds and permitting large- and medium-sized state enterprise, based on 1 percent of their sales income, to draw their own circulating funds, be exempt from income taxes, and figure it in their production costs. Enterprises that have not recently submitted after-tax profits should draw 50 percent of their retained profits to be used to supplement circulating funds. We should once again appraise enterprise adoption of medium-term loans within the quota and give short-term loans outside the quota. Question: Reform of Heilongjiang's small state industrial enterprises has made a good start. How will this be advanced in 1994? Answer: In recent years, especially in the last three years, Heilongjiang's small state industrial enterprises have remained in a slump, holding back industry throughout the province. Based on the provincial party committee and provincial government plan, localities have generally picked up the pace of small state enterprise reform consisting mainly of reform of the property rights system. The provincial economic committee, on the basis of surveys and research, top to bottom integration, and one factory one policy, has formulated the plan for the Reform of Small Heilongjiang State Enterprises. The plan's overall goal is to essentially complete reform of 2,585 small state industrial enterprises throughout the province in about two years, concentrating on reform of the property rights system, to lay a good foundation for the transition to a modern enterprise system and move small state industrial enterprise development to the fast track. According to the plan, reform of small state industrial enterprises will take thirteen specific forms: a stock system; a stock cooperative system; "grafting" restructuring; leasing operations; "one enterprise, multiple systems," asset contracts, participation in and organization of enterprise groups, mergers, selling off assets, stripping off operations, shutting down, bankruptcy, and other types of reform. We already have "tallied" the 2,585 enterprises according to the thirteen forms described above. Beginning in 1994, in accordance with the plan, we will put all of our efforts into advancing reform of the property rights system of small state industrial enterprises and in that year we will complete the reform of 1,210 enterprises. Question: Since upgrading enterprise technology is as important as reform, what new measures will be taken in 1994 to promote the technical upgrading of enterprises? Answer: Although in recent years Heilongjiang has increased investment in upgrading technology, the rate of increase has always been less than the national average and the gap with some provinces has become greater and greater. As of now, only 40 percent of Heilongjiang's large and medium-sized enterprises are conducting systematic upgrading and have some upgrading. If this situation does not change, it will be very difficult for Heilongjiang's industry to make great progress. In 1994 we will speed up the promotion of the upgrading of enterprise technology in three respects. First, explore new avenues for reforming the investment system for upgrading Heilongjiang technology. Based on Heilongjiang's situation, the area of investment in technology upgrading is divided into two categories. One category is policy investments, which is related to the national economy and people's livelihood. They have good social benefits, but small benefit to enterprises. Their investment cycle is long and risks are great. They are mainly supported by policy and their source of funds comes mainly from policy investments and loans. Another category is commercial investments. Their economic returns are good and they are able to pay back principle and interest on loans. Their source of funds comes mainly from commercial loans or financing. Reform of the investment system for upgrading technology concentrates on doing three tasks well: The first is to select state policy investments for technology upgrading projects in Heilongjiang's industries with long investment cycles and great risks such as transportation, energy, and defense; the five major mainstay industries and ten major projects; and current enterprises that are applying new high technology upgrades, and strive for the state's opening up bank support. The second is to enhance macroeconomic controls on technology upgrades and guide the orientation of investment funds. The third is to transition from a project approval system to a project filing system. Beginning in 1994, except for special state loans for key projects and major provincial technology upgrades for which state loans are requested, the provincial economic committee will no longer approve general projects and as a rule it will be changed to a filing system. Second, coordinate and integrate technology upgrading with reform of the enterprise system and external economic technology and broaden channels for funds and increase investment returns. First, rely on key projects and promote reform of the stock system and, based on a good grasp of the base of the experimental reform of the stock system in such enterprises as Qiqihar Steel Mill, Heilongjiang Polyester Factory, Hualin Rubber, Jiamusi Paper Mill, and Yichun's Guangming Furniture, select some enterprises that have key technology upgrade tasks to actively and safely conduct stock system reform. Second, step up the use of foreign investment "grafts" to upgrade current enterprises and continue to implement the plan to use foreign investment to upgrade 100 large- and medium-sized enterprises and stress the implementation of matching domestic funds for projects solicited from Hong Kong and Korean businesses and organize mature projects by levels for activities directed at different countries to solicit businesses and introduce funds and convene the Mudan River "grafted" upgrading on-site exhibit. Third, concentrate efforts on especially stressing major technology upgrading projects. In 1994 Heilongjiang plans to arrange for investment in technology upgrading on the scale of of 4.5 billion yuan, a 28 percent increase over the previous year, and concentrate on 37 key projects such as Jiamusi Paper and Qiqihar Steel. In 1994, 701 projects will go into production or achieve production and they are expected to earn a value of output of 3.34 billion yuan and 850 million yuan in profit taxes, and earn US$38.04 million in foreign exchange.
