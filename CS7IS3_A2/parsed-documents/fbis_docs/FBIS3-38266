Aizpeolea and A. Diez report: "Gonzalez Buries Bicephalous Model in PSOE"] [Excerpts] Madrid -- PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] Secretary General Felipe Gonzalez trusts that he will have sufficient support at the 19-20 March Socialist congress to have a free hand in drawing up the party leadership list. Gonzalez acknowledged that with this congress the bicephalous leadership model (the Gonzalez-Guerra tandem) is drawing to a close, and a model of shared responsibility will prevail. The PSOE leader met with the news media on Wednesday evening [19 January] in order to offer some clues to a congress at which he will play a decisive role and at which he is trying to continue to arbitrate. The PSOE secretary general believes that the new leadership, in addition to being collective, must be effective, representative, and consistent with the party's blueprint for renewal. That is, he wishes to have competent people with sufficient authority in the PSOE to surmount the current internal discord. Gonzalez does not wish to identify the people enjoying his confidence, and to whom he will delegate the day-to-day running of the PSOE, because he will give priority to his role as prime minister. In this connection, he emphasizes his traditional idea that the party is an instrument serving society -- not an end in itself. He will wait until the holding of the congress before revealing the list, out of respect for the wishes which party members may express at the congress. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that he is already thinking about those people and is conducting numerous contacts among regional party secretaries and other individuals with influence in the party. What about Alfonso Guerra? Gonzalez confirmed that he has proposed Guerra as deputy secretary general in the collective leadership plan. This is the only name which he has revealed, and he will reveal no more. He has not spoken with him -- they both attend PSOE Federal Executive Committee meetings -- and is in no hurry to do so, although he does not rule out the possibility that they may meet privately before the congress. Nor has he decided yet on the precise model for the Executive Committee. He is considering one out of three options: a very small Executive Committee, a large Executive Committee with a permanent secretariat, and a small Executive Committee with an intermediate body -- with very strong territorial representation -- with respect to the Federal Committee. Whatever the model he decides on, Gonzalez guaranteed the existence of a small and effective Executive Committee, as well as some kind of territorial representation. First, Renewal He believes the renewal of the PSOE can take place with Guerra with the collective leadership, but, in turn, he made it clear he is not prepared to sacrifice his aim of renewal to the integration of all the tendencies which he seeks symbolically in Guerra's presence. In this connection, Gonzalez repeated the message he made public at the Las Ventas rally in October 1992. He sets it as a condition for his leadership of the PSOE that his renewal plan not be questioned, and in this respect he will accept conditions from neither side. Otherwise, he recalled his resignation at the 1979 congress, where he did not accept the majority theses. Gonzalez asserted that he will not yield to pressure from some PSOE regional secretaries to intervene in the precongress process, because he wants the party grassroots to express their opinions freely, and he is aware that his personal intervention could influence the congress. He still reserves for himself the role of arbitrator in the party, a task he has performed since the Suresnes congress in 1974. He acknowledged that his nonintervention policy and conflicts over the selection of lists could weaken the party. Nevertheless, he did not exaggerate. He believes the internal conflicts are due to a power struggle -- at the local level in most cases -- but an alternative to the PSOE's national blueprint is in no event being proposed within the party. He does not believe the renewalist and Guerraist sectors can be defined in terms of their greater or lesser support for the Socialist government's activity. In this connection, he believes this classification is superficial. To the same effect, he stated he is not counting the results produced by the votes in the various local associations. The PSOE secretary general also guaranteed the use of individual voting at the congress, better to reflect the Socialist grassroots' wishes. Although he did not expatiate on the matter, he intimated that the traditional procedure of voting by delegation is inappropriate for the congress to express the grassroots' wishes. Better Relations With Aznar Gonzalez admitted he has had two meetings with [Italian Popular Party Chairman] Aznar at the Moncloa Palace -- the second at the end of December. They discussed the NATO summit, which was to be held in the next few days, the reform of the labor market, and the crisis at the Credit Bank of Spain. The atmosphere of trust was greater at the second meeting than at the first. Contacts will continue because Aznar represents the votes of 8 million Spanish people and is a real government alternative. Gonzalez stated that a regular relationship is logical from the democratic viewpoint. The autonomy model -- It is not identical for all communities. There are distinctive features to be respected. Convergence and Union's turnabout in autonomy -- He asserted that he will accept no territorial constraint when negotiating with the Catalan nationalists, but emphasized that he is determined to carry forward the impetus for autonomy contained in the PSOE program. Terrorism -- He will not change the strategic line in the struggle against terrorism. International cooperation, police pursuit, and the Ajuria Enea pact -- He regards the proposal of Ramon Jauregui and Mario Onaindia as a future possibility which does not breach the Basque pact. In any event, an offer of dialogue depends on a prior end to violence. [passage omitted] Government Will Stand by Labor Reform Despite Strike Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez asserted he will stand by the plan for labor market reform regardless of the extent of the general strike called by the trade unions for 27 January. Gonzalez added that there will not be any cabinet reshuffle as a result of the trade union mobilizations, and completely ruled out considering an early election in the event of a Socialist failure in the European elections and the Andalusian autonomous community elections in June. The head of government showed himself prepared to resume dialogue on the reform of the labor market, provided that employers and trade unions previously reach agreement and contribute improvements to a plan which he deems essential for creating jobs. He acknowledged that there could be some abuses with the new forms of labor contract, but he immediately added that it is much worse to offer no solutions to the economic crisis. In any event, he believes that Spain passed the worst point in the economic crisis during the election, although the public perception came later. He reaffirmed the expectations he expressed during the election campaign, when he stated that by May "we will no longer be talking about the crisis as we are doing now." He emphasized that, despite its continued fall, the unemployment rate is less than in October and November, but he saw real emergence from an economic crisis, which he did not hesitate to describe as simultaneously brief and intense, as conditional upon Germany's pulling power. Crisis, Priority Gonzalez emphasized that the government's priority is the battle against the economic crisis, and other tasks are subordinate to this aim. In this connection, he stated that reforms such as the reform of the labor market fit into the social democratic blueprint, because either it provides a permanently reformist response or it cannot survive, as has happened with communism. By way of a paradox, he emphasized that the trade unions held a strike in 1985 against the Pensions Law, and now they are calling another strike in defense of that law's contents. Gonzalez assessed favorably his relations with the Catalan nationalists of CiU [Convergence and Union], and stated that their entry into the government will not be raised again, although, in his opinion, it would be the most stringent and desirable thing. He deemed the formula of a parliamentary pact of support for the government sufficient to give the government stability, and he made it clear that he will not support another round of negotiations with the nationalists unless it is comprehensive and serves the interests of all of Spain.
