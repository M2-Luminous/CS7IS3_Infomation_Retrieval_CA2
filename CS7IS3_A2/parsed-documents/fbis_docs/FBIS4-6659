The FTC said the national union formed by 114 tile makers has fixed the prices of mosaic tiles for domestic sale and exports in violation of the Antimonopoly Law. Commission officials said the tile makers, plagued by swollen inventories in the wake of the burst of the "bubble economy," formed the price cartel to prevent price falls. The FTC issued the order after three rounds of investigations at the union's headquarters in Nagoya and other places, the officials said. Tile makers belonging to the union set a low-end price for mosaic tiles at 95 yen per sheet, each consisting of 18 tiles, the officials said. Companies not accepting the FTC order will be liable to a penalty fine set in proportion to sales.
