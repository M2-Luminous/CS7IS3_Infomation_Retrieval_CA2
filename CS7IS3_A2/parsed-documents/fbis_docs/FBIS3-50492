The bill was approved by the Senate early this morning. The promulgation of this law, the senators' claim to have been the chamber that submitted the law, and their decision to modify the duration of the senators' terms today elicited various reactions from the leaders of the Justicialist Party [PJ], the UCR [Radical Civic Union], and other political sectors. National UCR Deputy Leopoldo Moreau criticized the "shortsightedness" of his fellow party members who opposed the constitutional reform, adding that Fernando de la Rua "has not understood the change that this reform will imply for the consolidation of democracy." In a conversation with NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS, Moreau reiterated that "(the reform project) originated in the Chamber of Deputies," but said that this matter is not "essential" enough to cause a constitutional conflict. For his part, Senator De la Rua criticized the contents of the law, because "far from reducing presidential powers, it increases them," noting that Buenos Aires UCR Constituent Assembly delegates "will adopt their own position" in spite of any decision by the party. De la Rua, who also talked with NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS, said that the minister of coordination, which is created by the reform, "is an entelechy," reiterating that the possibility of reelection of the current president "violates ethical rules." He added that "the bill did not follow the usual steps," noting that "it should have returned to the Chamber of Deputies" after the Senate eliminated the paragraph reducing the senators' terms. PJ Senator Antonio Cafiero said there is "firm discipline" in the PJ bloc in the Senate, remarking that "only one paragraph" of the law establishing the need to reform the Constitution had been modified. Cafiero explained that the Senate "failed to endorse only one paragraph of the law" because it is an exception, adding that the decision to reject the reduction of senators' terms to four years "was unanimous." "As we are considering a law that should be approved by a two-thirds majority in each chamber, the five steps provided for for common bills do not apply," Cafiero said. For his part, Progressive Democracy Deputy Alberto Natale said that the Senate decision to modify the decision by the Chamber of Deputies "makes it mandatory that the bill be returned to the Chamber of Deputies." According to Natale, "congressional proceedings which are ruled by the Constitution include the list of steps to be taken for a bill to be approved by Congress." Natale added that "the bill should return to the Chamber of Deputies, because otherwise the constitutional reform will not have a healthy birth." Socialist Unity Deputy Hector Polino also said that the law on the need to reform the Constitution "does not meet the requirements for submission to the executive branch," adding that the Senate approval was "unconstitutional." Polino explained that "there are two different bills, each of which were approved by just one chamber of Congress," noting that "congressional proceedings have not been completed for either one." "The entire reform process has been embarrassing, and the conclusion they are trying reach in Congress implies the death of the country's entire constitutional doctrine." National Senator Jose Antonio Romero Feris justified his vote against the reform on the grounds that "before thinking of modifying the Constitution it is necessary to comply with it." Romero Feris added that the introduction of runoff elections and the post of minister of coordination "do not entail any kind of restrictions on the powers of the president." He said that "the pact was reached behind closed doors, and was approved -- reluctantly but with Prussian discipline -- by the lawmakers of the majority parties." National PJ Senator Oraldo Britos said the bill originated with the Senate, and that "some articles were eliminated because the Chamber of Deputies did not take into account the bill that was submitted by the Senate." Britos added that the duration of senatorial terms "will be decided by the Constituent Assembly, because the Senate has proposed six years." Finally, Raul Alfonsin's spokesman Simon Lazara said that the Senate rejection of the four-year term proposed for national senators was "lamentable," although he explained that this decision "does not affect the group of basic agreements" reached by the PJ and the UCR. "It is obviously the defense of sectorial interests, an attitude that impairs the image of the Senate and that does not match the spirit of the reform agreement," Lazara told NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS. Mendoza leader Raul Baglini (until a few days ago the leader of the bloc of national UCR deputies), said that "now that the constitutional reform law has been approved the UCR should overcome its internal disagreements -- which have been broadly disseminated because of the importance of the subject -- and should prepare for the election of Constituent Assembly members, thus guaranteeing a modern reform with equilibrium between the branches of government."
