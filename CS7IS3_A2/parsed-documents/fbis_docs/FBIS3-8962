Vlk met with Zhirinovskiy in Warsaw over the weekend and said he found the Russian leader's views very reasonable. The Republican Party, led by Chairman Miroslav Sladek, invited Zhirinovskiy to the Czech Republic earlier this year, just two days after Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus, following Zhirinovskiy's much publicized and controversial tour of several European countries, said he hoped the Russian would not come. During the tour, Zhirinovskiy said the Czech Republic would lose Moravia and all that would be left was Prague and "a few breweries where the beer will turn bitter." In an interview for Czech Television, he predicted that in ten years young Czechs would be vilifying President Vaclav Havel and cleaning the boots of German army officers. Vlk, Sladek, and Zhirinovskiy met in Warsaw to attend a congress of the Polish National Front, a small party with similar extremist views. Speaking at the congress, Vlk called for the creation of an international association of nationalist, conservative rightist parties. The Republicans also accepted an invitation to attend the Liberal Democrats' April 2-3 congress in Moscow. Zhirinovskiy told the Polish party congress that Russia had no territorial claims and its armies would never head west, but at the same time he would not allow any Western armies to use Poland as a path to attack Russia. If he becomes president, he added, he would protect Russian interests by any means necessary, "including nuclear weapons."
