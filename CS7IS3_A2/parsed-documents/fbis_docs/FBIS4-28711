Their basic position on economic sanctions is that they should follow the passing of a resolution by the UN Security Council. But since China is resistant to such a resolution, there is a possibility that sanctions will only be carried out by major nations such as the European countries plus the three countries of Japan, the United States, and South Korea. As there are also obstacles to making these sanctions effective, the government is having a difficult time figuring out what it should do. Direction of Economic Sanctions and Problems Involved [subhead] If a resolution on sanctions is passed by the UN Security Council, they will probably be conducted -- as seen in past examples -- in the following steps: 1) A ban on exports of arms and oil; 2) a ban on trade in general; 3) restrictions on visits; and 4) a freeze on overseas assets and suspension of financial transactions. Informal talks by UN Security Council members have started in New York, but before that, on 4 June, the three countries -- Japan, the United States, and South Korea -- held a working-level meeting in Washington. According to a source in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], during the meeting the United States was said to have noted: "For economic sanctions against North Korea to be effective, the key point will rest on whether exports of oil from China and monetary remittances from Japan can be stopped." North Korea has mostly depended on China for the supply of petroleum products since Russia stopped supplying it with oil. Shortages of foreign currency reserves are serious in the country. As such, the United States thinks the key for economic sanctions to be effective is in the hands of China and Japan. Economic sanctions are implemented by restricting the flow of people, commodities, and money. Japan can control personnel exchanges under the Immigration Law, and trade and banking operations under the Foreign Exchange Control Law. As for trade, a top official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said: "We are getting ready to take action along the lines of a UN resolution if a resolution is decided upon." The ministry will be able to cope even if sanctions escalate into those requiring a total ban on exports or a ban on intermediary trade. However, there will be problems if Japan wants to restrict monetary remittances and travel. In addition to about 15,000 North Korean residents living in Japan who return there on annual visits, there are about 20,000 people coming and going between Japan and North Korea each year. It is has been pointed out that cash carried by Koreans on visits to their hometowns have become a major source of foreign currency for that country. A MOFA source noted problems from a human rights viewpoint: "Enforcement of sanctions in this area will be difficult." Moreover, under the existing law it will be difficult to be harsh on only visitors to North Korea and to impose restrictions on rules allowing each person to carry up to 5 million yen. Sanctions in the Past [subhead] The severest action the Japanese Government has so far meted out as economic sanctions were those taken against Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) for its policy of oppression of blacks and against Iraq for invading Iran. Both cases were enforced following sanctions decided on by the United Nations. Among sanctions taken without a UN resolution were those taken against Iran over the incident of taking U.S. Embassy personnel as hostages; against the Soviet Union over its invasion of Afghanistan; and against China over the Tiananmen incident. The contents of these sanctions mostly concerned limiting personnel exchanges -- reducing the number of embassy personnel (for Iran) and reducing the number of government officials and other people exchanged (in the case of the Soviet Union and China). The economic sanctions taken were lenient in nature, like requiring exporters to obtain prior approval on exports (to Iran) and freezing economic cooperation (to China). Whether or not Japan will go for full-scale economic sanctions against North Korea this time will depend on the UN Security Council resolution -- seen from past experiences.
