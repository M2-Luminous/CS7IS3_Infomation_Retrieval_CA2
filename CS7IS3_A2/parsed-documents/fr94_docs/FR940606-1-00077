FR940606-1-00077 FR940606-1-00012 (3) Spaces between the secondary barrier and independent tank structures. (e) Spaces in the cargo containment portion of the vessel, except ballast spaces and gas-safe spaces, must not connect to pumps in the main machinery space. Pump vents must not be open to machinery spaces. (f) Duct keels may be connected to pumps in the machinery space if_ (1) The connections are led directly to the pumps; (2) The discharge from the pumps is led directly overboard; and (3) There are no valves or manifolds in either line which could connect the line from the duct keel to lines serving gas-safe spaces. 22. In §154.407(a), remove ``Z 8 '' wherever it appears and add, in its place, ``Z B '' and revise the definition of ``Z B '' to read as follows: §154.407 Cargo tank internal pressure head. (a) *␣*␣* ``Z B '' = largest liquid height (m) above the point where the pressure is to be determined in the b direction (see figure 2). Small tank domes not considered to be part of the accepted total volume of the cargo tank need not be considered when determining ``Z B ''; * * * * * §§154.420 and 154.439 [Amended] 23. In §154.420(a) and §154.439 introductory text, remove the words ``of the American Bureau of Shipping published in ``Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels'', 1981'' and add, in their place, the words ``in Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels.'' §154.421 [Amended] 24. In §154.421, remove ``, 1981''. 25. In 154.440, paragraph (c) is revised to read as follows: §154.440 Allowable stress. * * * * * (c) For an internal pressure head that meets §154.439(a), tank plating must meet the deep tank standards in Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels. §154.448 [Amended] 26. In §154.448(b), remove the word ``its'' before the word ``support''. 27. Before the undesignated heading ``SECONDARY BARRIER'', add a new undesignated heading and §§154.454 through 154.458 to read as follows: Internal Insulation Tanks §154.454 General. (a) The design of an internal insulation tank and its supporting hull structure or independent tank structure must be specially approved by the Commandant (G&hyph;MTH). (b) Internal insulation tanks must be made of materials that withstand the combined strains calculated under §154.457(a). §154.455 Design vapor pressure. The design vapor pressure (P ○) of an internal insulation tank must not exceed 25.4 kPa gauge (3.55 psig). For internal insulation tanks supported by the hull structure, the Commandant (G&hyph;MTH) may specially approve a P ○ between 24.5 kPa gauge (3.55 psig) and 69 kPa gauge (10 psig). For internal insulation tanks supported by independent tank structures, the Commandant (G&hyph;MTH) may specifically approve a P ○ greater than 69 kPa gauge (10 psig). §154.456 Internal insulation tank system design. An internal insulation tank must be designed for the following: (a) Any static and dynamic loads with respect to_ (1) Fatigue failure; (2) Crack propagation from both free and supported surfaces; (3) Adhesive and cohesive strength; (4) Compressive, tensile, and sheer strength; and (5) Water ballast in spaces adjacent to the inner hull forming the supporting structure of the internal insulation tank. (b) Combined strains from static, dynamic, and thermal loads. (c) Compatibility of the tank insulation material with the deflections of the vessel's inner hull or independent tank structures. §154.457 Calculations. The tank design load calculations for an internal insulation tank must include the following: (a) The combined strains from static, dynamic, and thermal loads. (b) The response of the internal insulation tank, its cargo, its supporting structures, and any ballast adjacent to the supporting structure of the internal insulation tank to the vessel motion and acceleration under worst weather conditions. Calculations for a similar vessel may be submitted to meet the requirements of this paragraph. (c) Plastic deformation and fatigue life resulting from static and dynamic loads in the insulation and in the supporting hull structure or independent tank structure. §154.458 Model test. (a) A test must be performed to determine whether the primary and secondary barriers of an internal insulation tank, including corners, joints, pump mounts, piping penetrations, and other critical areas, are capable of withstanding the combined strains from the static, dynamic, and thermal loads calculated under §154.457(a). (b) Combined tension and fatigue tests must be performed to evaluate crack behavior of the insulation material in the event a through crack develops in the inner hull or independent tank structure. (c) Analyzed data from the tests under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section must be submitted to the Commandant (G&hyph;MTH) for acceptance. 28. In §154.459, add a new entry and new footnotes to table 3 to read as follows: §154.459 General. * * * * *
