[Khalaf] The Palestinian people in Jericho were in a state of great joy. They raised flags. The boy scouts beat drums and blew trumpets. The whole Palestinian people in Jericho were very joyful. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How do the Palestinian people view the future? [Khalaf] This agreement is a historic step after the signing [of the Declaration of Principles] on 13 September 1993 in Washington. This particular step marks the beginning of the first phase in the life of the Palestinian people. For the first time, the Palestinian people will govern themselves through self-rule in Jericho and Gaza. The area is not insignificant. It has a population of approximately 1 million. This is an important and historic step in the life of the Palestinian people. We hope and implore God that it will be a good and constructive step toward establishing peace in the whole region. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Differences centered on the Jericho area. What agreement has been reached regarding the size of the Jericho area? [Khalaf] There are promises. As we understand it, there is a promise by the U.S. secretary of state. There should be no differences over the border. The important thing is that the self-rule plan in the two areas was signed. This is very important for the Palestinian people. The borders will be in accordance with the agreement and the peace plan signed by Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Won't a new phase begin that will require the Palestinian and Israeli sides to deal with each other? [Khalaf] During the current phase the areas must be opened up so that Palestinian citizens will enjoy a kind of prosperity. In the period preceding the talks the areas were closed. This closure caused great hardship for the Palestinian citizens and a recession in the Palestinian economy. We hope that the means of livelihood will be opened for the Palestinian people so that their economy will thrive. Economy is the most important thing in the people's life. We hope there will be aid and mutual economic cooperation between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. Naturally, we need foreign aid from the European Union, the World Bank, the United States, and other foreign and Arab states. Over 27 years the Israeli and Palestinian economies have merged. It is difficult now to separate the Israeli economy from the Palestinian economy. This separation will take much time. But now there are direct trade dealings and contacts between the Israeli and Palestinian economies. It is difficult to stop or reduce these dealings. The Palestinian people must feel there is economic prosperity and an increase in their income. The Jericho area is an agricultural and tourist area. We must export our goods to other towns, including Israeli towns. We do not have factories or plants. We have agriculture. Jericho is the agricultural capital of the Jordan valley. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Are there preparations in Jericho and the occupied Palestinian territories to receive the Palestinian national authority? [Khalaf] Yes, we are awaiting the arrival of our Palestinian brothers [from abroad]. We are one family and one people. We are waiting impatiently for the arrival of our brother Palestinians who will take over authority and establish law and order. This is the most important step in our life. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] As we end this dialogue, we thank you. We always welcome you to the Voice of the Arabs. [Khalaf] I thank President Muhammad Husni Mubarak for his titanic efforts. I also thank the Egyptian people for receiving the Palestinian and Israeli peoples and for their efforts toward establishing peace in the region.
