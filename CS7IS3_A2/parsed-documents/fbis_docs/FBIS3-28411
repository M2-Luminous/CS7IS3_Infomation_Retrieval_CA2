When Washington officials confirmed the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missile batteries in Korea on a request from the commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea, there were immediate speculation of a possible link with moves to promote the sale of the now-famous anti-missile system to Korea. Recent U.S. media reports included quotations from senior U.S. defense officials encouraging South Korea to consider the purchase of the Patriot missile which they vouched as the best system at the present time. It is known that Seoul's defense authorities have had considerable interest in the Patriot system since its employment in the Gulf War and that preliminary negotiations started in mid-1993 between military procurement officials here and the Raytheon Co., the U.S. manufacturer of the missile. Yet, it is not quite gratifying to witness U.S. officials showing great salesmanship as if representing their defense contractors. On top of this, an embarrassing document has been disclosed here involving U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William Perry in which Perry, who has been nominated for Pentagon chief, strongly suggested that South Korea purchase a specific airborne self-protection jammer for the Korean Fighter Program on a commercial basis. U.S. reports have it that this particular ASPJ system had been found defective in tests, adding to our dismay. Under the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, which has been the primary channel of Korea's procurement of U.S. military hardware, the U.S. Government, which often arranges long-term, low-interest credits for the transactions, retains the right to approve the supply of specific items. In the course of implementing the FMS program, the possibility of U.S. defense officials' opinions affecting the choice of weapons may not be excluded. But suggesting Korea purchase a specific item on a commercial basis outside the FMS avenue is certainly extraordinary. We hope that responsible U.S. officials restrain themselves from being involved in military procurement schemes directly or indirectly so as not to cause unnecessary misgivings on this side of the military alliance.
