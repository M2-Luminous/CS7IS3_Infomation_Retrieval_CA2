(check all that apply) ␣The ground station provided local expertise that was of value ␣The ground station had data from my area of interest ␣Metadata and/or browse files from the data at the ground station were readily available ␣The ground station provided training and assistance in applications and other user services ␣The ground station was difficult to use ␣Data prices were too high ␣Not applicable ␣Other comments XXXXX ␣ XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (22) Currently, the Landsat system is unable to acquire data from all land areas because of the absence of recording capability and TDRSS link. In regard to your work, this limitation ␣Makes the current Landsat system of no value ␣Substantially limits the value of Landsat ␣Has no impact on the work ␣No opinion (23) If Landsat data were available as a raw data stream from a location in the US for use without restriction, and for only a modest fee to cover government costs, would your organization be interested in accessing it for distribution to others on a commercial or public service basis? ␣No ␣Yes for commercial development (value-added) ␣Yes for public service (noncommercial) distribution ␣Not applicable ␣Depends on following conditions/circumstances: ␣ XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ␣ XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ␣ XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ETM+Instrument Characteristics 1Band 1Wavelength (um) 1Ground resolution (m) Pan 0.50&hyph;0.90 15 Band 1 0.45&hyph;0.52 30 Band 2 0.52&hyph;0.60 30 Band 3 0.63&hyph;0.69 30 Band 4 0.76&hyph;0.90 30 Band 5 1.55&hyph;1.75 30 Band 7 2.08&hyph;2.35 30 Band 6 10.4&hyph;12.5 60 •Swath width=185 km •5% absolute radiometric calibration •Revisit time=16 days •Best 8 of 9 bits •Data transmitted via two 75 Mbps data streams (24) Given the above description of the ETM+instrument on Landsat 7, how likely are you to use ETM+data? ␣Very likely ␣Somewhat likely ␣Not likely ␣Will not use ETM+data ␣Don't know (25) Please rank the following features of ETM+in order of their importance to you.
