After hearing the report, Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee and chairman of the regional people's congress standing committee, made important instructions. Wang Qun said: Last year particularly after the launching of the anticorruption struggle, the procuratorial organs across the region concentrated energy to investigate and handle a number of major and appalling cases and made noticeable achievements. However, the current situation cannot catch up with the requirements of the party Central Committee and the expectations of the people. This year, the procuratorial organs should continuously regard the investigations and handling of the cases that take place at leading party and government organs, judicial departments, administrative and law enforcement departments, and economic management departments as their duty-bound political task; conscientiously and effectively attend to it; and unswervingly deal blows to serious economic criminal activities, including corruption and bribery cases. We should give priority to and attach primary importance to investigating and handling the major and appalling cases that can produce great impacts and big damages. He stressed: All localities should proceed from reality, sum up the experiences in investigating and handling cases, strengthen the extent of attack, and thoroughly investigate the cases no matter who involves. It is necessary to make a key breakthrough in investigating major cases and to rapidly attack the cases that have accurately been investigated. We should ensure not to have the cases half-handled lest forfeit the chance for combat should be forfeited. The anticorruption struggle is extremely complicated. Those criminal offenders have tried every possible means to avoid being attacked and adopted various countermeasures against us. The procuratorial organs should bravely carry forward the spirit of marching forward despite hardship, weariness, and risks and deeply and constantly wage the struggle against corruption. In regard to the issue of strictly enforcing laws, he said: Chief Procurator Zhang Siqing mentioned that at present, a tiny number of localities and department leaders still have confused understanding about the relationship between anticorruption and the economic work and there still exist the phenomena of replacing laws by words, using power to repress laws, practicing local protectionism, and lacking the courage to face difficulties. These problems warrant our attention. We should firmly attend to the law enforcement work and attach importance to grasping and publicly handling the cases of administrative and law enforcement organs and financial departments not strictly enforcing laws and seriously violating discipline. In investigating and handling the major and appalling cases of this category, the procuratorial organs should pay attention to dissecting and analyzing the cases, draw inferences about other cases from one instance, and transfer the cases that offenders are not subject to criminal responsibilities to relevant departments for handling. If these problems are not solved, it will be difficult to create a new situation in waging the anticorruption struggle. He urged that the leaders of the party committees at various levels should have a high degree of political responsibility, smash all ideological obstacles, eliminate all interference and obstructions, free themselves from the restrictions of personnel relations, and enthusiastically and effectively support the work of procuratorial organs in line with the principle of "being resolute first and prudent second and being sure to do accurately." Simultaneously, we should do our best to eliminate the procuratorial organs' economic difficulties in handling cases.
