FR940413-2-00125 FR940413-2-00061 As of the close of the comment period on February 28, 1994, the Department had received one letter from an interested person commenting on the proposed exemption and requesting a hearing. In the opinion of the commentator the transaction involved a highly speculative investment in real property that would jeopardize the ability of the Plan to provide stable retirement pension income to participants and beneficiaries. The Department forwarded a copy of the commentator's letter to the applicant and requested that the applicant address in writing the concerns raised by the commentator. In response, the applicant stated that the general concern of the commentator regarding the Plan's purchase of the Lots and construction of the Parks was not at issue in the application, as relief was requested only for the lease of the Lots to Actives who are parties in interest solely because they are employees of contributing employers to the Plan. With respect to the leasing of Lots to Actives by the Plan, the applicant points out that no fiduciary or other party in interest except Actives will be allowed to lease Lots from the Plan. Further, an independent fiduciary will be required to review the leases to Actives and the number of such leases will be limited. The transactions would involve a very small percentage of the assets of the Plans. In the opinion of the applicant, the requested exemption would make the Plan's investment more productive by increasing the rental income to the Plan and would permit the Actives to decide whether to live in one of the Parks, rather than being prohibited from doing so. With respect to the purchase of the Lots by the Plan and construction of the Parks, the applicant maintains that such an investment by the Plan was not a prohibited transaction and did not require an exemption. In the opinion of the applicant, there is substantial evidence in the application file which addresses the propriety and attractiveness of the purchase by the Plan of the Lots and the construction of the Parks, which took into account the Plan's portfolio and the general investment objective to achieve the highest rate of return commensurate with safety of principal over the long term. In this regard, it is represented that the investment satisfied the Plan guidelines requiring diversification and profitability, and that the Board of Trustees made such determination, after considering independent professional investment advice. In addition to commenting on the transaction, the commentator requested the Department schedule a hearing on the matter. The Department notes that in its final regulation on procedures for filing and processing prohibited transaction exemption applications, 29 CFR 2570.46, there is no provision for a hearing unless the exemption is from the fiduciary self-dealing prohibitions of section 406(b) of the Act. This exemption does not grant relief from section 406(b) of the Act. Further, the Department does not believe that any issues have been raised which would require the convening of a hearing. Accordingly, after giving full consideration to the record, including the comment by an interested person and the responses of the applicant, the Department has determined to grant the exemption, as described herein. In this regard, the comment submitted to the Department has been included as part of the public record of the exemption application. The complete application file, including all supplemental submissions received by the Department, is made available for public inspection in the Public Documents Room of the Pension Welfare Benefits Administration, room N&hyph;5507, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210. For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this exemption refer to the Notice published on October 29, 1993, 58 FR 58190.
