A. Morozov, Yu. V. Snytkin; UDC 621.396.965:621.391.26] [Abstract]Control using the information function involves a ratio analysis after each observation interval in order to determine the component amount of information which can provide the greatest increase when the controlling parameter values are next selected. This means a practical selection of a detection mode (detection, tracking, identification) and of controlling parameter values which can be changed in real time. When the loss function is not specified, control can be found and satisfactory results can be obtained using an approach based on maximizing the increase in the amount of information at each step. 1 figures and 2 references.
