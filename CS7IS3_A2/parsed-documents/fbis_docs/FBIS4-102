Mr. Oyono is quoted to have said that his country is prepared to go to war over the Bakassi Peninsula, a piece of Nigerian territory which has been the subject of dispute. Mr. Oyono is also quoted as having said that there could be an outbreak of war anytime now. In reacting to the Cameroonian minister's utterance, the minister of state for foreign affairs, Chief Anthony Ani, said the Nigerian Government considers the statement unnecessarily belligerent and unfortunate, especially in the face of ongoing efforts to resolve the matter amicably. Chief Ani also said it is instructive that Mr. Oyono's threat was issued in Addis Ababa, where a committee of OAU had risen from deliberations in the finding of a diplomatic solution to the dispute. Chief Ani has however warned that Nigeria's capability to protect its territory and citizens should not be underestimated.
