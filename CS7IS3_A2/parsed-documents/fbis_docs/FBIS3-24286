This is especially notable in Ujar Rayon. One of the candidates for membership in the party's Central Council of this rayon was threatened, another ANIP member was arrested and beaten by officials of the law enforcement organs." As N. Imanov stated, local government organs ordered court medical experts not to take note of the bodily wounds on these persons. He said further that Shahin Hummeteliyev, chief of the local police department, gave the orders for this work. Sh. Hummeteliyev, committing these evil deeds in the name of high officials in the republic, is acting arbitrarily in Ujar Rayon. The deputy chairman of ANIP explained that if this kind of arbitrary action continues, he would publish the names of the above-mentioned high officials.
