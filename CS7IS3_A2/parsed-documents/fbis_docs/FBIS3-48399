DP spokesman Rep. Pak Chi-won issued a statement attacking President Kim's planned tour to Beijing as contrary to the principle of "reciprocity." "Former President No Tae-u first made an official visit to China in September 1992, while in office," Pak said. "Therefore, according to the principle of reciprocity, the Chinese head of state, President Jiang Zemin, has to pay a visit to Seoul this time," Pak insisted. If President Kim goes through with his plan to China, the criticism will be unavoidable that his administration hasn't yet broken away from diplomatic flunkeyism, Pak said. President Kim himself has said that his new administration would carry out its diplomatic policies on an equal footing with the world's super powers, calling it a "new diplomacy," said Pak. "We are worried Kim is not keeping his own word. We also fear that the so-called new diplomacy may turn into a new slavish diplomacy," Pak said.
