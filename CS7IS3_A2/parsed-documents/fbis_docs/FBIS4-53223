The Surface Ship Combat System Mark 7 (SSCS), made by BAe-Sema [British Aerospace-French Electronics Group] processes battle data, enabling a destroyer to detect, target and neutralise enemy vessels before they can retaliate. South Korea's Defence Ministry said it chose BAe-Sema's system over a rival German model, Cosys-200 Kl, because the British product is better value, has superior logistical support and because the Royal Navy had decided to develop a compatible system. The deal may be a sign that Seoul's arms procurement programme is being revived after a bribery scandal left it paralysed last year. Seoul had been expected to opt for the SSCS Mk7 last summer but the Defence Ministry said the decision was delayed "due to problems arising from the credibility of the British manufacturer". Military analysts believe the real reason for the delay was quite different. At the time the deal was being discussed, the reformist government of President Kim yong-sam was conducting a colossal purge of the remnants of the previous military-backed regime. In the purge last year, 39 generals, two former defence ministers and a former naval chief of staff were sacked, reprimanded or jailed for "selling" promotions or taking kickbacks from arms manufacturers. At such a time, no one wanted to be seen signing a multi-million-pound purchase order for fear that prosecutors might question their motives and subject their personal finances to an audit. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the government spent a third of its budget on defence to deter any possible aggression from the hostile North. The volume of money that was poured into the South Korean military was matched by the secrecy surrounding the way it was spent. Parliament had no right to scrutinise the military accounts, and corruption among senior officers was consequently rife. Few high-ranking members of the old military government would emerge unscathed from a rigorous financial probe.
