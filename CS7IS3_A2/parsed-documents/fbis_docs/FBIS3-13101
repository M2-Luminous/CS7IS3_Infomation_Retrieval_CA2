Children were terrified to learn that two people were arrested the Sunday before last [27 February] for hiding explosives in the kindergarten's kitchen. Parents were also terrified to learn that their innocent children could have been killed at any moment. Al-BILAD has learned that last Sunday [as published], the security agencies apprehended 'Abd-al-Majid M. and 'Imad S. [not further identified] less than an hour after the two hid large quantities of machine guns, weapons, and ammunition in al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten. The kindergarten is affiliated with the Islamic Center Society, which, as is well known, is controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood group. Eyewitnesses told AL-BILAD, which rushed to investigate the story in al-Qasr, that 'Abd-al-Majid M. is considered the shaykh of the returnees from Afghanistan. He was arrested before for involvement in the Muhammad Army case, but was later released. The second suspect, 'Imad S. was working as an imam at the mosque adjacent to the kindergarten and lived in a house within the mosque building. He was also working at an Education Ministry school in al-Yarut town. He is married to a woman who teaches at al-Faruq kindergarten, where the explosives were hidden. According to information made available to AL-BILAD, 'Abd-al-Majid M. brought the explosives in a car from Amman. He then asked 'Imad S. to hide them in his house. However, the latter suggested that they be placed in the mosque. The explosives were then moved to a communal kitchen used by the imam. The kitchen is part of the adjacent kindergarten. Apparently, the car that brought the explosives from Amman was under close watch by security agencies. After the explosives were hidden, the security agencies, which were closely monitoring the operation, hurried to arrest 'Abd-al-Majid M. and then the imam, 'Imad S., only minutes before the call to the evening prayer in al-Yarut village, near al-Qasr. From its investigation into the case, AL-BILAD was shocked to find out that the operation was part of a new terrorist scheme the "Jordanian Afghans" [term used to refer to Jordanian Muslim militants who fought in Afghanistan] were planning to execute outside Amman. Informed sources told AL-BILAD that the scheme involves moving the bombing operations from Amman to the governorates and districts since the security agencies have gained full control over such operations inside Amman. The scheme involves concealing the explosives at mosques and kindergartens that are controlled by the Islamists. According to well-informed sources, the primary objective of the scheme is the assassination of a General Intelligence officer and the bombing of shops selling alcoholic drinks in the various governorates, particularly al-Karak, as part of a large-scale scheme aimed at disturbing Jordan's domestic security and terrorizing and intimidating citizens. Within this context, AL-BILAD learned that the security agencies have uncovered large quantities of ammunition, machine guns, and bombs in many mosques in various parts of the kingdom, including 'Ubadah Bin-Bishr mosque in al-Subayhi, where dynamite sticks were found. Information leaked to AL-BILAD confirm that an Arab state is involved in supporting the Jordanian Afghans group in these operations. It has been proven that contacts were held between the [Jordanian] Afghans and other Afghan parties supported by the same state. The final number of the "Afghans" arrested thus far in the bombing cases stands at around 40. According to informed sources, the accused will be brought to trial in the next few days. AL-BILAD toured al-Qasr town as soon as the weapons cache was discovered in al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten and obtained detailed information from the residents of the area and informed sources on the kindergarten operation, which is considered, as we have said, one of the major operations planned by the Jordanian Afghans. The first observation one can make at the kindergarten is that the kindergarten, affiliated with the Islamic Center Society, has more than 470 children. The weapons were hidden less than one meter away from a kindergarten class full of children. This means that these children could have been killed at any time if there was any mistake in the transportation of these explosives. Eyewitnesses also said that none of the townspeople expected the imam of the mosque adjacent to the kindergarten to be involved in such acts. This means that the scheme was thoroughly planned. AL-BILAD also learned that the mosque where the imam worked was built at the expense of al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten, which is affiliated with the Islamic Center Society controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood. Residents of the area have not observed any strong connection between the first and second suspects to suggest any suspicions of an organizational link between them. In a related development, AL-BILAD has learned that other people suspected of affiliation with the Jordanian Afghans were arrested in al-Rabbah area. No information or specific figures are available yet on those arrested. In previous issues AL-BILAD published exclusive reports on a plan involving bombings in Amman. It also published reports on the secret files of the Jordanian Afghans, as well as those arrested in these cases. It is worth noting that the Muslim Brotherhood group has not yet reacted to reports on the hiding of weapons in a kindergarten that they control. Residents of the area say they think the suspects belong to the Muslim Brotherhood group.
