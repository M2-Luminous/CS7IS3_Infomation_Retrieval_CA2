Galanos accused the Papandreou government of impolitic actions and lack of sensitivity toward the government and people of Cyprus. Despite his efforts to maintain diplomatic protocol, Galanos did not refrain from using very strong language to describe the way the Greek government action in canceling the Cypriot National Council meeting with the prime minister in Athens and for recalling National Guard Commander Lieutenant General Yeoryios Siradhakis. "I would like to express my personal discontent with the fact that the Papandreou government, which raised the morale of our people by elevating the Cyprus issue as a national priority, did not show the necessary sensitivity toward our government and people in these two cases, which were, at the least, unfortunate," said Galanos in his address during the debate on the 1994 state budgets. Galanos explained that the two incidents to which he referred include the last minute cancellation of the National Council's visit to Greece and the impolitic firing of Lt. Gen. Siradhakis, especially considering the way it was done, despite the Greek prime minister's assurances and commitment to President Glavkos Kliridhis. [passage omitted]
