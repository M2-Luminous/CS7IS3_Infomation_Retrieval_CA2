[Kwasniewski] Wedding and marriage are two separate things. Of course, the election victory gave us great satisfaction. We proved that there is a demand for the left wing in Poland and that, despite having been condemned to political nonexistence, we managed to present a rational program and people who are worthy of support. [TRYBUNA] And the challenges that you have been facing did not reduce your satisfaction? [Kwasniewski] Everything we have been facing since the elections is much harder and less pleasant than the campaign or the elections themselves. The SLD was faced with very specific and complicated problems, beginning with the formation of the coalition, maintaining very weak reforms, dealing with a very neglected social area, fighting unemployment, the poverty of many people, and changing inefficient ways of implementing social policies and privatization. The SLD also had to prove that the contemporary Polish left wing not only is no threat to democracy but that it strengthens democracy, and we also had to prove that the victory by the SLD and the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP] does not mean a return to the old system, undemocratic ways of ruling, and a centralized economy. [TRYBUNA] Do you not think that the SdRP failed to consume the election success to a sufficient degree? [Kwasniewski] I would like to separate these issues. I think it is quite natural and a consequence of democratic principles for a party that has won the elections to coform a government, its members becoming the ministers, and the party holding a dominating position in the state administration. And I reject all accusations that this amounts to booty sharing or fighting for posts. In Poland, we must get used to victorious parties implementing their mandate after the elections, and the mandate is a consequence of the election results--these parties simply build their personnel structures and look for instruments that will allow them to act. In that sense, I do not think there is anything wrong with replacements at the posts of voivodes [local governmental officials] or in ministries, provided, of course, that these replacements are not purges. The SLD approached the election results with great responsibility and deliberation. We are the kind of party that imposed limits on itself. I regard it to be a virtue and not some evidence of weakness or a mistake. The fact that we managed not to fight for the post of prime minister--to which we had a right--despite having won the elections, the fact that we did not demand specific numbers of ministers and deputy ministers in accordance with mathematical proportions but were rather guided by the candidates' skills and human values, not their party membership--I regard all that to be a virtue, as well. [TRYBUNA] We used to say that Solidarity elites acted differently when in power and in the opposition. Can we not apply the same saying to the SLD and the SdRP? [Kwasniewski] I think the problem of acting differently in the opposition and while in power is generally a big problem of the relationship between authorities and society in Poland. That problem is a huge burden left by a difficult historical legacy. Today, there is a problem and a challenge at the same time: On the one hand, the question is how to be in power so that citizens are aware that they and their issues are at stake and not some incomprehensible ideas or values? On the other hand, the question is how to shape in Poland the kind of statehood awareness under which people would identify themselves with their own state, would respect the legal system, would be proud of living here and now, and would be able to defend their state's dignity in contacts with the outside world? [TRYBUNA] To what extent have you, the SLD and the SdRP, changed by being in power? To what extent have you abandoned the earlier program principles? [Kwasniewski] Right after the elections, people were being told that the election promises were not being fulfilled. I can see two problems here: The first is that many promises or program principles simply cannot be fulfilled immediately. And the other problem is that some of the promises were kind of imposed on us--they were not written down by us anywhere. We did not say that we will find the resources for some gigantic social programs as early as in the 1994 budget, and that is because we knew that the budget was going to be burdened with an enormous deficit and that there is no particular room for maneuver, unless the maneuver is to lead to a disaster or to a very short-term effect in the form of inflow of money, inflation, and a breakdown of public finances. [TRYBUNA] What happened to the SLD's and the SdRP's left-wing nature at the time you assumed power? [Kwasniewski] We have been trying to show and implement that left-wing nature in a very rational and sensible manner--first of all by establishing budget principles. We said outright that there can be no further cuts in expenditures borne by senior citizens, by the budget sphere, by science, culture, the educational system, and we also said that one must look for additional sources of revenue. We went in the direction that would definitely never have been chosen by liberal right-wing governments--that is, we increased taxes. Second, we initiated a more determined fight against the so-called gray zone by setting in motion customs and financial mechanisms that are designed to cause an increased inflow of money to the budget. Third, we are in favor of comprehensive changes in social policies. These are clear signs of our left-wing nature. [TRYBUNA] According to the SLD voters, what you have been doing can be described at most as building "capitalism with a human face." [Kwasniewski] In my view, what we have been doing is attempting to build a social and economic system that will be efficient and competitive and that will bring money to implement social programs--and that is in essence the entire socialdemocratic or left-wing concept that can be put forward today. I am convinced that ideological issues are of lesser importance today. Our left-wing nature should demonstrate itself through a modernization of the systems of social care and assistance and of the entire social policy, but, on the other hand--and this may sound very liberal--we must take care of economic development. I remind all those who are critical of us, including those who used to occupy high posts in the past in the Polish People's Republic, that Poland was in a state of crisis, going on for many years, which was due not just to Reagan's sanctions but also to inefficiencies in the economic system that was in effect in Poland, despite various attempts of economic reforms, which, even though they were quite bold at times, were eventually torpedoed as a result of various political disputes. [TRYBUNA] As chairman of the SLD and the SdRP, are you not afraid that your parties will suddenly lose to the left wing, like, for instance, the Union of Labor? [Kwasniewski] One can lose to the left wing or the right wing. I would not regard that as a determining factor, neither in our thinking nor in our actions, and that is because, in my view, much more serious issues are at stake in Poland right now. What is at stake is the strengthening democratic institutions, the establishment of an efficient economy that will help resolve the unemployment problem and will result in increased budgetary revenues for social programs. What is also at stake is Poland's integration into the European arrangement, based not on asking for mercy or various credits but on the principle of our being a significant participant of that arrangement. [TRYBUNA] According to critics, the SdRP is not supported by any kind of basis but only by an unstable electorate. They also say that the party is lacking a class nature [klasowosc]. Do you agree with this accusation? [Kwasniewski] I cannot see how anyone could agree with that. A system of social classes as described in textbooks is fading away. But the SdRP--and I am convinced of that--is a party of employees. Modern social democracy does not offer just the protection of social interests to employees. That function is fulfilled primarily by trade unions. A political party that wants to represent the interests of employees must secure economic development and social justice in the process of consuming the aforementioned development. [TRYBUNA] You [left-wing activists] have always wanted to join the Socialist International. What chances does the SdRP have now? [Kwasniewski] I think there is an enormous opportunity in that regard. The stereotype perception of Poland is changing. There is nobody around anymore to say that, in Poland, the so-called postcommunist left wing has no social support. There is nobody to say that we are in favor of restitution of the old system and that we are not making efforts to adapt ourselves to democracy and a free market. I also think that there is currently nobody in the West who would have doubts that there are no hopes that a social democracy may be born out of such forces as the Democratic Union [UD]. In that sense, there is clearly an increasing interest in our participation in the Socialist International. I experienced much to confirm this--for instance, during my talks in Spain, Norway, and Germany, and also in Budapest and Bratislava. I have faith that our case will finally be settled during a congress in the spring of next year. I think the issue is of mutual interest. The International must have serious partners in East and Central Europe if it wants to avoid being pushed into the margin by the right wing. We also have an interest here because I think the maturity of many Western left-wing parties makes it possible to use their experiences. [TRYBUNA] Two parties representing different interests and different types of voters form a coalition. According to many views, the coalition is quite chimerical. Why is that? [Kwasniewski] A coalition is always a difficult creation because it is formed by partners with different experiences, expectations, and programs. That must be said outright. I know of no coalition in the world that would be free of conflict. It is a misunderstanding, which is sometimes spread in society, to view the current problems of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the SLD as having their sources in the old relations between the Polish United Workers Party and the United Peasant Accord. It is just a myth. We are dealing with different parties now, different leaderships, and a completely different generation of activists, who, in many cases, do not even remember the old days. Of course, our partner's temperament and ways of action are quite different from ours. These are definitely issues that make life difficult, but they are not insurmountable. One must say in all honesty that both sides are only shaping their place and position in this relationship on the basis of common sense and conviction. [TRYBUNA] A view is prevalent that there is "original sin" lying at the basis of the current complicated relationship inside the coalition. What was that sin about? Was that when the individual members of the government were appointed? Was it your statement concerning UD [that the SLD is closer to UD than to the PSL]? Or was it that you gave up trying to win the post of prime minister? [Kwasniewski] In my view, the SLD imposed a limit on itself. It made a decision on offering the prime ministerial post to the PSL, and we were right in doing so. We were eager for this government to be based on a majority, and we succeeded. I definitely think the attempt by our partner to act through accomplished facts was not too fortunate at a point when the government's composition was not yet settled. As far as my statement on UD is concerned, perhaps that was not too fortunate, but... I think that, given the real arrangement of forces in parliament after the elections, only the SLD had the opportunity to form a coalition--with either the PSL or UD. Both coalitions could have been based on majorities. But it turned out very quickly that UD is not ready for that and is not capable of implementing such an idea after its election defeat.... I see no reason for the SLD, for instance, to choose just one partner currently. It is quite natural in politics to cooperate loyally with your coalition partner, but there are valves open also for others. The PSL also has such open valves. [TRYBUNA] Political stability is a dream of society and of representatives of elites. What is currently the greatest danger to that stability? [Kwasniewski] Given the unique chance that Poland has, the dangers are inside ourselves, and they are also a consequence of the inability to find compromise solutions and of a lack of persistence. The world has shrunk enormously. Those people count the most who are able to introduce the biggest amount of the interesting and the effective into this whole arrangement of political and economic relationships. I think it would be bad if we were to lose the chance among disputes and selfishness. Selfishness is what I fear the most. [TRYBUNA] What is your position on the "Kwasniewski for president" idea, which has been appearing more and more often and which is confirmed by approval expressed in public opinion polls? [Kwasniewski] I am happy because of that. But, to be honest, in my view, the issue of presidential elections should not appear in serious political debates before the end of this year. The SLD has not made a decision on the issue, and neither have I. [TRYBUNA] We thank you for the conversation.
