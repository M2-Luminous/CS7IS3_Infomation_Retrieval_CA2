FR940617-2-00006 FR940617-2-00003 D. Comments The comment period on the DEIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability appears in the Federal Register . It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at this time. To be most helpful, comments on the DEIS statement should be as specific as possible, and may address the adequacy of the statement or the merits of the alternatives discussed. (See the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3). In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of DEIS statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and concerns. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC. 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not raised until after completion of the final EIS. Wisconsin Heritage, Inc. v. Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). The reason for this is to ensure that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final. Dated: June 9, 1994. Phil Janik, Regional Forester, Alaska Region Forest Service, Department of Agriculture. Dated: June 13, 1994. Robert P. Davison, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, Department of the Interior. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14716 Filed 6&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;11&hyph;M
