Dell'Utri and two others, say Milan prosecutors, doctored accounts to conceal a line for slush funds paid to politicians. Berlusconi, commenting on former assistant Dell'Utri's arrest order, called it "a colossal mistake." The leader of the Forza Italia movement said the decision did not affect him personally as the arrests "pertain only to Fininvest, which is in fact the injured party in this case." He said he was "sure the Cassation Court will set things right." The Cassation Court, Italy's supreme court of appeals, must now decide on the case. Elena Paciotti, president of the National Association of Magistrates, called the Forza Italia leader's comments "worrying," in a statement issued this afternoon with the vice president of that association Ciro Riviezzo and secretary Marcello Maddalena. "It is worrying that a prime minister-designate should pronounce himself on a decision in a penal case to go before the Cassation Court," the magistrates said. "His statement, which is very strong considering the office of the person making it takes on the worrying flavor of a message aimed to influence the independent justices of the supreme court, and demonstrates a singular lack of respect for the rules of due process." Today's ruling overturns an earlier one by a preliminary investigations judge in which a request from public prosecutors to arrest Dell'Utri and the others was rejected. The court said the three can be arrested on charges of falsifying accounts to set aside slush funds. Milan Chief Public Prosecutor Francesco Saverio Borrelli, whose office had requested a warrant for Dell'Utri, said he was "very satisfied" by today's ruling. According to the sentence, Dell'Utri, the director general of Fininvest's Telepiu' pay-TV station, and Romano Luzi, another former top executive in the group owned by Premier-designate Silvio Berlusconi, can be arrested because there is a danger that they may tamper with the evidence. Luzi left Fininvest to set up the Conaia company, which is believed to have falsified its bills to help Publitalia to set up its slush funds. The three will not be taken into custody immediately, as they have the right to contest today's ruling at the Cassation Court. But the ruling forbids them from going abroad without permission from a judge. In a communique today, Fininvest management expressed its backing for Dell'Utri, saying that the advertising company had "strong business skills" and functioned with "great professionality." "I know the truth of the matter and the truth cannot be changed, given what it is," said prime minister-designate Silvio Berlusconi this evening, confirming his view that the arrest orders for three Fininvest managers were "a colossal mistake." "I don't believe there are any negative aspects to what I know. I said the judges had made a big mistake and I confirm that," the Forza Italia leader told reporters.
