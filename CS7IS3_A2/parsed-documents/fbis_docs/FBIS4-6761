"We should depart from the old-fashioned view of agriculture being a declining primary industry," he said. "We should instead establish a new future-oriented perception that agriculture is a developing secondary or tertiary food industry." While talking with the members of the Rural Development Committee, a presidential advisory organ, at Chongwadae [presidential office], the president said it is especially important to improve educational, medical, cooperative and marketing systems in the rural areas. The Rural Development Committee reported to the president a set of programs being planned to improve rural conditions. Also on Tuesday, President Kim met nine American promoters of a Korean war memorial program. The visitors included William Livesey, one-time commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea. The visitors said they were promoting the construction of a large Korean- and Vietnam- war memorial education center in Pennsylvania. "I hope the projected education center will become a significant space helpful to enhancing friendship between the peoples of Korea and the United States," President Kim said.
