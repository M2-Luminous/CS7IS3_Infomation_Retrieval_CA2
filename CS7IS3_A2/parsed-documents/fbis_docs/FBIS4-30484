However, the institute indicates if domestic demand rises significantly, the surplus should drop and that there is a need to take actions to provide for greater increases in domestic demand and market-opening measures to include deregulation in order to avoid a worsening in Japan-U.S. friction. The estimate assumed that the yen would stay in the $1 = 105 yen range or gradually rise to $1 = 95 yen by 1998 while domestic demand would rise to 2 percent or 4 percent. The estimate indicates a trade surplus with the United States of $71.6 billion assuming a foreign currency rate of $1 = 95 yen and a 4 percent growth in domestic demand, substantially above the fiscal year 1993 surplus with the United States of $50.2 billion. If the value of the yen remains around $1 = 105 yen and domestic demand grows 2 percent, the trade surplus would be $80.2 billion. On the other hand, assuming a 4 percent growth in domestic demand and exchange rates at either 105 yen or 95 yen, the overall trade surplus in 1998 would fall below the $120.2 billion surplus of 1993. In the event domestic demand is 2 percent, the surplus will be substantially higher. Of special note is that the surplus will grow at a significantly higher rate if the yen rises in value, whether economic growth rate is low or high. The research institute concludes that an expansion in domestic demand is more effective than adjustments in foreign exchange rates in reducing trade surpluses because structural conditions exist in which it is difficult to reduce exports even if dollar-denominated prices rise because of a strong yen.
