In Mtunzini, on the north coast, Mr Amos Cebukulu was awoken by a knock on his door on Saturday night. He saw that one of the men was armed, and fled. Upon his return Mr Cebukulu found the body of his son. The HRC meanwhile said violence had "definitely decreased", but spokesman Linda McLean cautioned that there was still dissatisfaction over the election results and concern over policing in the province. "We are still very worried about the violence in KwaZulu/Natal."
