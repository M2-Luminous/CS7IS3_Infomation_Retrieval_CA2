MPT's Communications Research Laboratory (CRL), NTT, KDD, and Japanese computer manufacturers will be connected, while MPT will seek participation from overseas research institutions. This is an effort to compete against the United States which is promoting the National Research Education Network (NREN) program that links universities and research institutes throughout the United States. Both Japan and the United States are developing strategies with which to enter the multimedia era by establishing communications networks among research institutes as the core of their program. This network incorporates the latest ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) switchboard which can control a large volume optical fiber network capable of carrying information at a maximum volume of 10 gigabits per second. Current NTT serviced communications lines have a maximum capacity of 150 megabits per second. The latest network's capacity is said to improve upon this by 66 times. MPT's CRL, Communications Network Research Institute (Musashino City, Tokyo), KDD Research Institute (Kamifukuoka City, Saitama Prefecture), NHK's Broadcasting Technical Research Institute (Setagaya-ku, Tokyo), and the International Telecommunications Basic Technology Research Institute (ATR, Kyoto) representing a third sector, are to be connected. They are expected to be joined in the future by the research institutes of computer manufacturers, including NEC, Fujitsu, and IBM Japan. The MPT has named this experiment the "Global Gigabit Network" (G Net), and plans to expand participation to include overseas research organizations using an overseas high speed network which KDD shares with AT&T. The G Net will focus on technical experiments concerning the operation and maintenance of networks, and development of new methods using supercomputers and databases owned by other facilities. The new methods will cover a wide area of communications including TV conferences through vivid images, and remote medical applications through which medical images will be transferred over long distances for diagnosis. They also plan to include environmental research to analyze air pollution and meteorological phenomenon on a global scale. The MPT will spend Â¥488 million, a sum approved in the third FY93 supplementary budget, to facilitate computers and communication equipment at CRL. NTT will provide free of charge large volume optical fibers, while each research organization will arrange for their own equipment needs. Meanwhile, the participating organizations will form a liaison committee. The new network is scheduled to be ready by March 1995.
