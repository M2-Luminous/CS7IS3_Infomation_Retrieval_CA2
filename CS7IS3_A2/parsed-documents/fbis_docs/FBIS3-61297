In your opinion, what event in the past year best characterizes the relations of your country with Russia? 2. What prospects do you see for our bilateral relations in 1994? Here are the answers of our esteemed diplomats. [end boxed item] Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Ukraine: "I Hope That the Ice Will Melt..." 1. In the sequence of events, it is difficult to identify one that most clearly characterizes the relations of Ukraine and Russia in the past year. In my opinion, several could make up the general background. The joint participation of our sailors in peacemaking operations in the Georgian port of Poti. Those days demonstrated: We were together, and we will remain together. And we are always ready to help others. The same sense of mutual aid characterized the actions of our sailors who saved Russians near Zmiyinyy Island in the Black Sea. And on the part of Russia, specialists from the State Committee for Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Elimination of Natural Disasters instantly offered help and assistance to those who suffered during the colossal flash flood in Transcarpathia. All these events, as you see, are of an emergency nature, but it is exactly in such moments that relations between people and nations reveal themselves in a special way. And another sad event. Ivan Kozlovskiy, the great singer of the Land, passed away. Prominent cultural figures from Ukraine and Russia stood in mournful silence at his grave. Kozlovskiy united our people. His death left a permanent mark on the souls of people, on the banks of the Moscow River and the Yenisey and on the banks of the Dnieper. 2. I hope that the ice will melt. I hope that we will finally be understood and that there will be an end to the groundless accusations that "Ukraine is deceiving the world." Otto von der Gablentz, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the FRG: "We Have Learned To Give Meaning to History..." 1. Our relations are so close that there is no one big symbolical event that characterizes them. Federal Chancellor Kohl, for example, in 1993 alone personally met three times with President Yeltsin in Russia. The ministers of foreign affairs of the two countries, Kinkel and Kozyrev, had 15 personal talks in the last year and a half. But our relations are also characterized by the reactions of Germans to the stirring events that have occurred in recent months in Russia: the attempted coup at the beginning of October, the referendum on the Constitution, and the elections. We are intensively affected by the difficult path that Russia is taking to democracy, to contacts with the rest of the world, to a rule-of-law state, and to the market. We are accompanying it on this path with a sense of sympathy, and where possible we are rendering effective support. 2. I am confident that we will move forward to a definite stage on the joint path to building German-Russian relations. An event is scheduled for the middle of the year that has symbolic significance for this time. On 3 August 1994 a solemn ceremony will be held with regard to the conclusion of the withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany. It will demonstrate that Germans and Russians have also learned to give meaning to the difficult chapters of our long joint history with respect and a spirit of mutual understanding. In 1994 the cooperation between our parliamentarians with the newly elected Russian parliament will very likely occupy one of the central political places in our relations. It can contribute to the fact that Russia is taking root in the community of European democracies, which in the form of the Council of Europe have established a forum for themselves devoted to the preservation of democracy and the protection of human rights in all Europe. Incidentally, in the middle of 1994 Germany, taking over the chairmanship of the European Union, will assume special responsibility for the current efforts being applied to the expansion of relations between Russia and the European Union in the direction of real partnership. Bakhyt Nadirov, Kazakh Charge d'Affaires Ad Interim: "Russia Is Our Strategic Partner..." 1. In my view, relations between Russia and Kazakhstan cannot be examined outside the context of the problems of the Commonwealth as a whole and the mutual relations between its members. We were all part of the USSR. Including Russia and Kazakhstan. And in this sense I would note the startup of the second power unit of the Ekibastuz GRES-2 [state rayon electric power station]. This is why: It is a unique legacy, delivered to us from the Union. Representatives of all the countries of the CIS took part in the construction of this installation, but specialists from Russia made a special contribution. The capacity of the combined electric power system of our countries grew into a whole Dneprogas! We have already broken out of the habit of such concepts as international construction. But here is a real example for you: The power of the joint efforts that was born in Kazakhstan's Ekibastuz is in a condition to direct electricity to the Urals, Western Siberia, Central Russia... It is no accident that President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev took part in the opening ceremonies, a person who has offered many positive ideas for the development of integration processes in the CIS. 2. As for the outlook for our cooperation, my attitude toward it is quite optimistic. The adoption of the new Constitution of the Russian Federation is a chance for civil reconciliation and a chance for political and economic stability in Russia. But the fact that Russia is a strategic partner for Kazakhstan needs no proof. We welcome the election of President Yeltsin as chairman of the CIS, and we hope that this act will serve to further strengthen the interaction of the countries of the Commonwealth. Sumio Edamura, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan: "A Foundation for Partnership Has Been Laid..." 1. Two main directions have appeared in our relations. First--restoration of the track from which Japanese-Russian relations had been derailed as a consequence of the postponement of the visit of the president of Russia to Japan the year before last. Second, the active position of Japan as the country chairman of the Tokyo country summit of the "Group of Seven" in coordinating their activity on assistance to Russia. These two directions, in our opinion, interacting favorably, brought about positive results. As a result of President Yeltsin's visit to Japan in October a foundation was laid for the restoration of partnership relations between the two countries based on recognition of common values. Secondly, the Tokyo summit was concluded successfully. At the meeting that was held by representatives of the "Group of Seven" countries with President Yeltsin, a high evaluation was given to Japan for its active role as the country chairman. 2. I think that the main task is to be able to move our relations toward the establishment of genuine partnership relations between Japan and Russia, using the foundation laid during the visit of the president of Russia. I would like to hope for a further continuation of the position for rendering assistance to the efforts of Russia that are directed at democratization and transition to a market economy and, simultaneously, at ensuring the reliable advancement of our relations toward the conclusion of a peace treaty with the resolution of territorial problems.
