The president sent a message of unity, reiterating that an end must be put to the tragic situation the population has been experiencing for a very long time now. [Begin Aristide recording] The flag of unity has existed since 18 May 1803, so Haitians can live freely in a free Haiti. Let us doff our hat to our flag. We, like all other peoples, have a flag. It is not a gift from foreign colonists; nor a trinket, merely for display; nor an ornament for outward show. Our flag resulted from a battle against slavery. The blood of our ancestors was shed so all peoples would respect us, once we respect one another. Let us doff our hat to our flag. Every time we hoist our flag, what we are hoisting is the symbol of that very freedom. Every time we sing our national anthem, we are swearing ipso facto that Haitians live freely in a country that is theirs. Let us doff our hat to our flag. That must be done. We must have it done. We must all join hands so that Haiti can be released from any disguised form of slavery. The dreams of our students are our nice university dreams. [sentence as heard] Congratulations to you! An avalanche of admiration and respect to the memory of all students who (?have died), like stars of hope! To (?honor) their memory, we must lift Haiti's chin. [end recording]
