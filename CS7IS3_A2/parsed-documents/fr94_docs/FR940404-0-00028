FR940404-0-00028 FR940404-0-00013 Included in that determination were findings that the area had attained the NAAQS for ozone, that the improvements in air quality were due to permanent and enforceable emission reductions, and that the Administrator has fully approved a maintenance plan for the area as meeting the requirements of section 175A of the Act. 11 11 Section 175A sets forth requirements for maintenance plans. Section 175A(a) requires each State which submits a redesignation request under section 107(d) to submit a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision to provide for maintenance of the applicable air quality standard for at least 10 years after redesignation. Section 175A(d) requires inclusion in the SIP of such contingency measures as the EPA Administrator deems necessary to assure the State will promptly correct any violation of the standard which occurs after redesignation. The finding that the area had attained the NAAQS for ozone was based on the data indicating that Knox County had no violations in 1989, 1990 and 1991. The finding that permanent enforceable VOC emissions reductions have been obtained was based on evidence that emissions had been reduced in Knox County as a result of the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP) and reduced gasoline RVP requirements effective in 1989. In finding that the maintenance plan meets the requirements of section 175A, EPA cited the elements of the plan discussed above. EPA noted that the plan relied on a gasoline volatility level of 9.0 psi RVP, not 7.8 psi, as is required under current regulations. Moreover, the final rule found that Knox County had demonstrated that it can maintain the ozone NAAQS using the less stringent volatility level of 9.0 psi RVP. On that basis, the maintenance plan was approved. No significant comments were received subsequently and the redesignation of Knox County to attainment for ozone became effective October 27, 1993. VI. Today's Final Action EPA is today relaxing the RVP standard for Knox County, Tennessee from 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi. The effective date of this rule is on June 3, 1994. Tennessee has met the criteria for relaxation of the RVP standard discussed in the December 12, 1991 notice. The State has in place a fully approved implementation plan for Knox County that demonstrates that the county can maintain the ozone NAAQS with a 9.0 psi standard. Tennessee's approved implementation and maintenance plan does not require a RVP standard more stringent than 9.0 psi. EPA's approval of this plan was based on evidence that the Knox County area can maintain ozone attainment for ten years with a 9.0 psi standard. Based upon the approval of the maintenance plan, EPA believes sufficient alternative programs are in place to achieve attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS and that further imposition of the 7.8 psi volatility standard would impose needless costs to consumers. 12 12 In the May 29, 1991 notice proposing to modify the Phase II volatility standards, EPA estimated that the 7.8 psi standard will increase the cost of gasoline by approximately 1.1 cents per gallon over the 9.0 psi standard. This action is being taken without prior proposal because EPA believes that this relaxation in the RVP regulation is noncontroversial, the effect of this rulemaking is limited to Knox County, Tennessee, and EPA anticipates no significant comments on this action. Today's action is based on the same information that EPA relied on in its approval of Tennessee's maintenance plan. EPA received no significant adverse comments regarding its approval of the maintenance plan or the redesignation of Knox County to attainment. The public should be advised that this action will be effective 60 days from the date of this Federal Register notice, unless notice is received within 30 days that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent notices will be published. One notice, which will be published before the effective date, will withdraw the final action. Another notice will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. Interested persons are invited to submit comments on this proposed approval. EPA will consider all comments received within thirty days of the publication of this notice. Consequently, this procedure still allows the opportunity for public comment and opportunity for oral presentation of data that is required under CAA section 307(d). This procedure merely provides an expedited procedure for final action where a rulemaking is not expected to be controversial and no adverse comment is expected. VII. Environmental Impact The amendment is not expected to cause Knox County to violate the NAAQS for ozone. The Knox County nonattainment area has met the NAAQS since 1989. That is, Knox County, has not recorded an exceedance during the time when the RVP standard in Knox County was no more stringent than 9.0 psi. VIII. Economic Impact The relaxation of the 7.8 psi standard to 9.0 psi will result in a cost savings to consumers of approximately 1.1 cents per gallon at the pump. IX. Administrative Requirements Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 through 612, whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations and small governmental jurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. In such circumstances, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. Under Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, I certify that these regulations will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The regulatory revision is limited to the Knox County area and should have no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. These regulations, therefore, do not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. Under Executive Order 12866, the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:
