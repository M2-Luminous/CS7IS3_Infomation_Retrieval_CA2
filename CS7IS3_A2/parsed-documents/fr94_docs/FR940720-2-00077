FR940720-2-00077 FR940720-2-00065 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket No. 52&hyph;001] Issuance of Final Design Approval Pursuant to 10 CFR Part 52, Appendix O; U.S. Advanced Boiling Water Reactor Design; GE Nuclear Energy The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued a final design approval (FDA) to GE Nuclear Energy (GE) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 52, Appendix O. This FDA allows the U.S. advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR) standard design to be referenced in an application for a construction permit or operating license pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50, or in an application for a combined license pursuant to 10 CFR Part 52. In addition, GE has completed the technical review stage of design certification pursuant to the applicable requirements of Subpart B of 10 CFR Part 52. The staff performed its technical review of the U.S. ABWR standard safety analysis report, certified design material, and technical specifications in accordance with the standards for review of design certification applications set forth in 10 CFR Section 52.48 that are applicable and technically relevant to the U.S. ABWR standard design, including the exemptions and applicable regulations identified in Section 1.6 of the final safety evaluation report (FSER). On the basis of its evaluation and independent analyses, as discussed in the FSER, the staff concludes that, subject to satisfactory completion of the ABWR design control document and certified design material, GE's application for design certification meets those portions of 10 CFR Section 52.47 that are applicable and technically relevant to the U.S. ABWR standard design. Therefore, the staff and the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards will utilize the U.S. ABWR standard design and will reply on it in the administrative review phase of the design certification process in accordance with 10 CFR 52.51. A copy of the FDA has been placed in the NRC's Public Docket Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20555, for review by interested persons. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 13th day of July 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Dennis M. Crutchfield, Associate Director for Advanced Reactors and License Renewal, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
