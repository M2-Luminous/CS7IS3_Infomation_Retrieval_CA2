The proposed rule change is described in Items I, II, and III below, which items have been prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The CHX, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act''), proposes to add Rule 37 (b) and (c) to Article XX, relating to the Exchange's Midwest Automated Execution System (the ``MAX''), and the automated execution system within MAX in which a Specialist may voluntarily choose to participate on a stock by stock basis (the ``SuperMAX''). II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the CHX included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in section (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change (i) Purpose The purpose of the proposed change is to incorporate the operation of MAX and SuperMAX into the CHX Rules. Currently, MAX and SuperMAX are only described in notices and approval orders. The proposed rule would consolidate this information into a single rule. The approval orders upon which this rule filing is based are, among others: Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32631 (July 14, 1993), 58 FR 39069 (July 21, 1993); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19629 (March 24, 1983), 48 FR 14105 (April 1, 1983); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27727 (February 22, 1990), 55 FR 7396 (March 1, 1990); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12451 (May 14, 1976), 41 FR 20932 (May 21, 1976); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22985 (March 7, 1986), 51 FR 9562 (March 19, 1986); Securities Exchange Release No. 32668 (July 22, 1993), 58 FR 40449 (July 28, 1993); and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34155 (June 3, 1994), 59 FR 29838 (June 9, 1994). (ii) Statutory Basis The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others No comments were solicited or received by the Exchange. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change constitutes a stated policy, practice or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration or enforcement of an existing rule of the Exchange and therefore has become effective upon filing pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of such rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purpose of the Act. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making a written submission should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.
