Kiet told the weekly newspaper Cong Giao va Dan Toc (Catholicism and the Nation) that the issue was one of "national sovereignty," as Vietnam had not signed any agreements with the Vatican allowing them to make unfettered decisions in their appointments. Each country had the right to ensure stability and order through its own rules, Kiet said, but adding that he believed the Vatican "would not create a tense situation and push the local church to violations of national laws." After a brief thaw, when Vietnam relaxed some religious restrictions, relations between Hanoi and the Vatican worsened in September when authorities in Ho Chi Minh City rejected the appointment of Bishop Huynh Van Nghi as a "supervisor" of the church instead of deputy archbishop. City officials denounced the move as a "Vatican plot" to install an exiled nephew of former South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem as successor to the current archbishop, who is more than 80 years old and ailing. Vietnamese officials said they had agreed that Nghi would be named deputy to replace Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh and accused the Vatican of manoeuvring to position Diem's nephew Nguyen Van Thuan in the job. Thuan was appointed deputy archbishop in 1975, but the communists took power in the then Saigon soon afterwards and refused to let him take up his post. He left Vietnam for Rome in 1992 and has not been allowed to return. Kiet praised Archbishop Binh in the interview, saying he had not failed in his duties to the nation, although "unfortunately, not all Vietnam's bishops have adopted this positive line." Some seven million people, or around 10 percent of Vietnam's population, are Catholic, making it the second largest church community in Asia after the Philippines. But the problems between Hanoi and the Vatican have left the country without a cardinal, as no successor has yet been named to replace Trinh Van Canh, the archbishop of Hanoi who died in 1990. Hanoi has also been irritated by a Vatican ruling that priests should not join any political organisations in Vietnam, including the Solidarity Committee of Patriotic Catholics, which comes under the Communist Party's Fatherland Front. Vietnam insists that Catholics belong to the committee but has denied accusations from the Vatican that it is trying to form a state-controlled church.
