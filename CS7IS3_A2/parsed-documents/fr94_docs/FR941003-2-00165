FR941003-2-00165 FR941003-2-00057 Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on August 18, 1994. 5 No comments were received on the proposal. 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34525 (August 11, 1994), 59 FR 42620 (August 18, 1994). Currently, PHLX Rule 1001 establishes a position limit of 100,000 contracts for FCOs traded on the PHLX. The PHLX proposes to amend Exchange Rules 1001 and 1002 to increase the position and exercise limits for FCOs, including cross-rate FCOs. 6 Specifically, under proposed Commentary .05(b) to PHLX rule 1001, the PHLX proposes to establish a position limit of 150,000 contracts for FCOs with annual trading volume of at least 3,500,000 contracts, based upon the previous year's volume. At the beginning of each calendar year, the PHLX will review FCO volume information from the previous year to determine which limit will apply; a higher limit will be effective on the date set by the Exchange, and a lower limit will take effect on the Monday following the mid-month June expiration. If the PHLX's beginning-of-the-year FCO trading volume review indicates that the position limit for an FCO must be lowered from 150,000 contracts to 100,000 contracts, the PHLX will promptly notify FCO participants that the lower limit will be effective for all series in that option on the Monday following the mid-month June expiration, and FCO participants will be required to comply with the lower limit. 7 In addition, the PHLX's Market Surveillance Department plans to monitor trading volume on a monthly basis, so that FCOs will be eligible immediately for a higher position limit when annual trading volume, as measured from the beginning of the calendar year, exceeds the levels established in the proposal. 6 Currently, the PHLX trades two cross-rate FCOs, the British pound/Deutsche mark and the Deutsche mark/Japanese yen. 7 See Amendment No. 3, supra note 4. In order to implement the proposal prior to the end of 1994, the PHLX plans to conduct a one-time review of FCO volume, calculating volume for the 12-month period immediately preceding approval of the proposal, so that FCOs with annual trading volume during that period of at least 3,500,000 contracts will be eligible for the 150,000-contract limit immediately after approval of the proposal. 8 The PHLX states that for the 12-month period from September 1993&hyph;August 1994, the Deutsche mark and the French franc would qualify for the higher limit. 9 8 See Amendment No. 2, supra note 4. 9 See Amendment No. 3, supra note 4. The PHLX notes that the Exchange's exercise limits are established by reference to position limits, so that any increase in position limits will also increase exercise limits. Accordingly, the PHLX proposes to amend Exchange Rule 1002 to reflect the proposed amendment to Exchange Rule 1001. The Exchange views the current FCO position and exercise limits as too low in light of increased levels of trading activity in the underlying currency markets and the resultant growth in liquidity of PHLX FCOs in recent years. The PHLX's proposal is designed to identify and accommodate those active currencies where heavier trading and open interest warrant higher limits. The PHLX understands that if it were to begin trading a new currency, measurement of the new currency's trading volume for purposes of establishing its eligibility for the 150,000-contract limit would be calculated from the beginning of the ``calendar year.'' When FCOs began trading on the PHLX in 1982, FCO position limits were set at 10,000 contracts. 10 Since that time the position limits have been changed three times, including an increase to the current level of 100,000 contracts in 1986. 11 Since 1986, the PHLX has added several new products for which position limits are aggregated with other trading in the same underlying foreign currency. 12 As a result, many traders have begun to regularly accumulate positions near existing limits, especially in certain more active currencies. In those active currencies, the PHLX believes that trading interest could migrate to the over-the-counter (``OTC'') market, hampering PHLX liquidity if large traders continue to be restricted by the current position limits. 10 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19313 (December 8, 1982) 47 FR 56591 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;81&hyph;04). 11 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27310, supra note 2.
