FBIS4-51996 "dreas087_m_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-087 Daily Report 5 May 1994 Thailand Reactions to U.S. Drug Probe Reported Reactions to U.S. Drug Probe Reported House Pledges Full Investigation BK0505033894 Bangkok THE NATION in English 5 May 94 pp A1, A4 BK0505033894 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] The House committee which oversees MPs' conduct yesterday pledged a full inquiry into Chat Thai MP Thanong Siriprichaphong, accused by a US court of smuggling huge amounts of marijuana into the United States over a period of years. Meanwhile, the opposition yesterday conspicuously deferred a decision on a plan to censure the government. It was not Aimmediately clear if the opposition bloc was-buying time to ponder the possible backlash from the Thanong case. Charoen Khanthawong (Dem-Bangkok), chairman of the House committee, said the committee would formally open an investigation into the matter next Tuesday. "This will seriously affect the (credibility of) Parliament. We must uphold the honor of Parliament by getting to the bottom of the matter and explain it to the public," Charoen said. "In my opinion, Thanong should resign and the party to which he belongs must also take responsibility." The committee chairman said the most severe measure which could be taken against Thanong would be for MPs to sign a motion seeking his ouster from the House of Representatives. "But I don't think we will have to resort to such a harsh measure," he said. Chat Thai secretary-general Banhan Sinlapa-acha yesterday said that no Thai law enforcement officials had confirmed, or denied, the allegation that Thanong had been involved in trafficking drugs to the US. "The man himself denied he had anything to do with it," Banhan said. "The party has yet to see if there is any hard evidence to substantiate the charge against Thanong. The way I see it, this is a personal affair. The party could not have known about it." However, Banhan said, he had asked Thanong to explain at a press conference, probably sometime today. He did not think the timing of the disclosure was aimed at hurting Chat Thai's reputation. "This case could not hurt the party's credibility. We have yet to see the facts," he said. Banhan would not say when the opposition intended to submit a no- confidence motion against the Chuan administration or which Cabinet members would be targeted in the censure. The opposition had been expected to make a decision yesterday. Piyanat Watcharaphon, a former Social Action MP, said the Chuan government had apparently neglected to take legal action against Thanong though it had been aware of the US charges against him for more than a year. "The question is why it was revealed just now, when the alleged wrongdoing happened a long time ago," said Piyanat, who lost his seat when he was sacked from the party. He believed Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and other coalition leaders must have been aware of the matter but had failed to act on it. Sources said a group of Democrat MPs plan to submit a motion seeking an official inquiry into the cases of Thanong and other MPs who have been accused of involvement in international drug trafficking. Opposition leaders did not mention their much-heralded plan to censure the government when they emerged from a meeting at the Princess Hotel yesterday. On Tuesday they had promised a decision would be made at the meeting. At a press conference after the meeting, opposition leaders instead criticized the government on such issues as terrorism in the South and the controversial Pak Mun Dam. They also denied allegations that some opposition leaders masterminded the southern violence in an attempt to destabilize the government.
