Pointing to the negative stand taken by the South Korean authorities toward the North's proposal to convene a national conference, he said: This is a challenge to the patriotic proposal of the North side which is bending all efforts for the convocation of a national conference and treacherous act openly ignoring the desire of all the fellow countrymen for an early opening of an epochal phase for the peace and peaceful reunification of the country. Now the fellow countrymen of all walks of life in the North, South and overseas hoping for national reconciliation, unity and reunification are fully determined to bring the national conference to a success. The workers in the North and South must take the van in the nationwide movement for the convocation of the national conference. The workers in the North and South must meet and discuss with each other the great work of the nation with the national conference ahead and jointly pave the way for reunification. Responding to this urgent demand, the GFTUK Central Committee proposes to the trade unions of South Korea to hold in a short time bilateral contact for discussing the question of the convocation of a national conference.
