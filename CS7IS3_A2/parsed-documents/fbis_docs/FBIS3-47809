They allege that the spectrum analyzer which a trading firm in Yokohama exported to the DPRK through a third country may be used for the development of a ballistic missile. The Japan Defence Agency expressed "deep concern" over the case and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department made a fuss, probing into "suspected" trading firms and manufacturers of telecommunication devices. The socalled "export of a spectrum analyzer" is an utterly groundless fabrication against the DPRK. It is impossible that the spectrum analyzer, which is used for the development of television and other telecommunication apparatus, was exported to the DPRK through a third country. Still more preposterous is the argument that the DPRK may use the device for the development of a ballistic missile. The case faked up by the Japanese reactionaries is a product of their chronic habit of fabricating every possible case to slander the DPRK. It is a revised version and extension of the rumour about "hi-tech leakage" they had spread some time ago. They had spread the rumour that their technology had been used for the "development of nuclear weapons" in the DPRK. As it turned out to be a false rumour, they have concocted the case of "export of a spectrum analyzer" this time. Judging from the fact that the Japanese authorities fabricate such rumours and cases one after another, it is easy to guess that they in actuality do not intend to establish good-neighbourly relations with the DPRK, but, on the contrary, are intensifying the anti-DPRK campaign, although they call for "resumption of DPRK-Japan talks". By inventing the case of "export of a spectrum analyzer," they foolishly seek to impair the image of the peace-loving DPRK and put "sanctions" and pressure on it through "an international cooperation system." Unbiased public opinion is angered at the false case because lurking behind it is a criminal intention to step up their military power buildup under a faked pretext, stage a comeback to Korea and, further, bring Asia under control. The Japanese authorities must look straight at the trend of the times and immediately stop their futile anti-DPRK campaign.
