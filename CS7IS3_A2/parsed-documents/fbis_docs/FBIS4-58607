The Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Mr. 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, and deputies Shoja', Kamyar, and Movahedi-Saveji, from the cities of Bandar-e Enzeli, Urmia, and Tehran, gave speeches. Then the Majles took up its agenda, and we direct the attention of our respected readers to the detailed proceedings. 'Abdol-Ghoffar Shoja', Deputy From Bandar-e Enzeli If attention is given to the agricultural sector, it will assuredly be the first sector to replace oil. The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Shoja', deputy from Bandar-e Enzeli. During his speech he offered congratulations and felicitations on the anniversary of the Islamic revolution of Iran and the blessed month of Ramazan. He added: Today America, as the leader of the world's domineering nations, through the use of the measures it has devised and promoted in the Security Council, considers the United Nations to be its agent in creating the world's cultural, economic, and military policy in the new world order. Through the use of military tools and implements, it is thinking of changing the geographic borders of nations and controlling the world's strategic economic points, such as the oil-rich Persian Gulf sheikhdoms, which submit to domination. The speaker discussed the fact that America, despite its claim to world leadership, is one of the world's most accursed and vulnerable nations. He said: Economically, America is now one of the world's most indebted nations, and is considered one of the most insecure nations socially. The Islamic Republic of Iran, despite 15 years of tricks by world imperialism, through reliance on just Islamic government with the backing of its great people, is in full control of all its current affairs and its First and Second Five-Year Plans. Today it is one of the most secure nations in the region and in the world in terms of political, cultural, and economic independence. Continuing, he said: Proper and committed Islamic management, serious supervision and control of executive affairs, timely and appropriate encouragement, the exposure of cultural and economic criminals, and dealing with them in an effective and revolutionary way can be the basic factors in achieving full independence for the government. Careful supervision and attention to the nation's potential resources can bring us closer to cultural independence without dependence on foreign specialists, with a minimum of foreign exchange. An example is the agricultural sector. A look it its performance tables under the First Five-Year Plan will confirm to government officials that if more attention is given to this sector, it will assuredly be the first sector to replace oil with agricultural and livestock exports, and it will provide all the nation's domestic needs. During his speech, the deputy from Bandar-e Enzeli discussed the fact that the nation's forests and pastures are being destroyed and that in previous years we had floods and heavy losses because of the lack of plant cover in the vicinity of the nation's cities and villages. He called on officials to create suitable work environments and to employ sincere and specialist manpower along with real planning in order to be able to take basic and useful steps to save the nation's natural resources. He also criticized the dysfunctional situation with fisheries and fishermen in the northern part of the country in the Caspian Sea. He said: Another problem in the area arises from the lack of real and timely policymaking by officials of the Iran Fisheries Organization, idle fishermen, and the excessive waste of time for the region's Majles deputies and officials. Today, in view of the shared use of the fish in the Caspian Sea by five nations on its shores, waiting for fish in a launch cannot answer the economic needs of the fishermen in the northern part of the country. Shoja' also said: The phenomenon of the rising waters of the Caspian Sea in the last few years and the lack of persistent and timely action on the part of the appropriate officials has brought heavy losses to the people. Unfortunately, real steps were not taken by the Plan and Budget Organization to provide emergency government assistance, and this in itself calls for serious questions and memos to the officials in charge. I, therefore, request that quick attention be given to this important matter. The speaker discussed the liberation of the newly independent Central Asian nations, most of which are Muslim and can be in close contact with Iran via the Caspian Sea. He said: Until now, with the passage of several years, free trade has not taken place between Iran and the other nations of the shores of the Caspian Sea, and this in itself is considered a turning point in trade and the spread of Islamic culture. Unfortunately, the European nations, seeking to dominate the culture and economy of the nations of the region, went into these countries more quickly than we did and have made the most of them culturally and economically. At the end of his speech he asked the respected president of the republic to give special attention to opening Bandar-e Enzeli, this old port in the north, to free trade with the nations of Central Asia. 'Ali Kamyar, Deputy From Urmia The Majles and the government must discuss economic realities with the people, and not keep saying that our situation is good. The next speaker was Kamyar, deputy from Urmia. He thanked the exalted leader for appointing a new chief of the Voice and Vision organization. He said: His excellency has repeatedly demonstrated that His Holiness, like the late Imam, considers the Majles to be at the head of affairs and that he gives special standing to the views of the Majles. He then discussed the economic changes in society. He said: The topic of the day in our country is the price of foreign exchange, and everyone is analyzing the government's decisions on this matter. However, an important point on which everyone must focus is the failure to deal seriously with the economic problems. While we believe that world imperialism suffered the greatest damage with the establishment of the sacred Islamic government, we must accept the fact that in response it will direct the greatest pressure and aggression at us. We all know that since the imposed war, by their own admission they have been unable to deal with great Iran. Since that time they have made a serious and firm decision to fight us culturally, politically, and economically. It is appropriate to understand the imperialist positions in this regard with sufficient care. Their goals must be analyzed and we must resist them as necessary. He said that we must assess our strengths and weaknesses. He said: The exalted leader sounded the alarm in the cultural dimension two years ago, when he declared a general mobilization against the cultural invasion, and everyone has at least recognized this as an important danger. The speaker continued: It must be accepted that our economic situation today is the result of the failure to deal seriously with economic issues. We have spoken about attention to production, but we have been satisfied with talk. We have spoken about low consumption, but in practice we faced growth in consumption. We have spoken about agricultural growth, but every day we witness agricultural malfunctions. We have spoken of the need for nondependence on oil, but in practice we have done nothing. We have repeated slogans about domestic goods, but our markets are full of foreign goods. How effective have we been reaching our goals to fight rural emigration, the growth in unemployment and high prices that keep rising every day? We must realize that the drop in the price of oil is the result of several years of world imperialist policy, for which they invested year after year with no other aim but to damage Islamic Iran. The speaker explained: If we wait too long to move, if we do not awaken soon, if we do not make a serious decision to fight back, criminal America will achieve the next in its series of goals, which is to make us indifferent towards the sacred principles of our Islamic government. The Majles and the government must discuss economic realities with the people, and not keep saying that our situation is good. Yes, our situation on the political issues is good, but on the economic issues our situation is nothing to brag about. It is true that we are in a better situation than our neighboring countries, but this is not enough. Their situation is not comparable to ours. We are independent and we must remain truly independent. We must evaluate our own specific circumstances. Continuing his remarks, the deputy from Urmia noted: Why should we not tell the people that our nation's income is not as high as our consumption? The nation's income is not enough to meet its heavy expenses. You must realize that the nation's oil revenues are several times less than they were 15 years ago, and on the other hand our expenses are several times greater. Our great nation must realize that the front line in our religious crusade is now the battle against economic plots. They must realize that the rise in the price of foreign exchange is not in any way the desire of the government, and that the government itself suffers the most from this. The growth in the price of the dollar depends on the demand for it. If we decrease our own need for foreign exchange, the price of foreign exchange will automatically go down. We are proud that in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] we imported $28 billion in goods. You must look at the statistics and see what percentage of this was essential goods. When we compete most heavily to buy foreign goods and when we all believe that we must buy famous foreign brands when we buy goods, then we can no longer expect domestic goods to develop and to rise to acceptable standards of quality. Kamyar added: Don't we realize that Japan, which is at the highest economic level, reached this position by consuming its own goods. He mentioned pouring banking facilities into the commercial sector, allocating high profits to the banking facilities because the production sector cannot pay the profits, and reducing the ability of the government banks to work with the noncommercial sector on such practices as the payment of housing allowances to teachers, and other things. The speaker then discussed the high percentage of unemployment in the municipality of Urmia and the stagnation of factories. 'Ali Movahedi-Saveji, Deputy From Tehran Why don't the Speaker's Council and the public relations office defend the Majles against those who speak against it? The final preagenda speaker was Movahedi-Saveji, deputy from Tehran. During his speech he said: Today one of the issues the imperialist world is trying to exaggerate is the issue of Salman Rushdie and his The Satanic Verses. All the Satans, the imperialist powers, and the enemies of Islam who have long been hostile towards Islam and the Muslims are supporting a filthy, spying, and mercenary individual who really wrote those things for money. The deputy from Tehran discussed the fact that His Holiness the Imam's (peace be upon him) command concerning Salman Rushdie is the command of Islam and absolutely cannot be changed. He said: If Islam, the glorious Koran, and the divine verses in the Koran can be changed, this command can also be changed. As for the matter of carrying out this command, it must be done by people who are undertaking this sacred defense of Islam and the sanctity of prophecy with sacred intent for the sake of God. This will actually be a great act of worship they will be performing and it has nothing to do with a prize, money, or a reward. In the same regard the speaker added: Of course, for every great Islamic and religious obligation, if those who spend money for the sake of God or who put themselves in danger are killed, they have performed a great act of worship and have been martyred on the path of God. The matter of setting a prize or a reward for killing such a filthy person may have something to do with an individual or a group, but it has nothing to do with the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He also continued: Throughout this period the Majles has neither studied nor approved any budget as a prize or reward for killing such a filthy person. However, if in Iran or anywhere else in the world any Muslim is able to spend his assets or wealth to please God and eliminate this filthy person, there is no problem with that either. The deputy from Tehran discussed the pressuring and slaughtering of the people of Lebanon, Palestine, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. He said: I think that although Israel or America are really behind all these crimes, savage killings, torture and occupations of land, it is the hand of Zionism that has come out of America's sleeve, both in the present and in the past. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Zionists behind the Serbs are the ones who are in the European and American governments. They are trying to support these kinds of crimes financially and through propaganda and provisions. Movahedi-Saveji discussed the prestige and status of the Majles. He said: I have a complaint against the respected Speaker's Council and especially the Majles public relations office. Why doesn't the Speaker's Council and especially the Majles public relations office provide timely, appropriate, rapid, and truthful statements defending the Majles against those who speak against it, who are actually violating the Constitution and slandering the Majles? In the same regard the speaker added: A gentleman, competent or not, had a position of responsibility in one of the provinces. Finally he was fired and then he got another position and comes and tells that our Constitution is defective because it provides for interpellation of the president of the republic, but the president of the republic does not have the right to dissolve the Majles. Deputy From Jiroft's Letter to Newspapers Concerning Recent Statements by the Former Governor-General of Kerman Although I have no intention of answering the issues raised by the respected former governor-general of Kerman and informing the dear and brave people of Iran, in general, and from Kerman Province, specifically, about what happened among the majority of the respected deputies from Kerman, because the honor of an outstanding public figure, His Holiness Ayatollah Hashemi-Rafsanjani, the beloved president of the republic, requires that the sword of the pen remain in its sheath and that I not upset him, God willing his excellency will permit me to write at the appropriate opportunity about what happened during and before the time I was a deputy and to set it before him as a means of unburdening my heart and reducing my pain. However, I expect the respected individuals in charge of the newspapers, especially the influential newspapers RESALAT, KEYHAN, ETTELA'AT and SALAM, to print the following material concerning what they published about Mr. Mar'ashi, on the same pages and in the same columns and under the same headlines, for the information of the dear people. 1. The decision that he should not be a governor-general was made by his excellency, the president of the republic. 2. Have the 12 years of his experience been wasted or not? Who should answer? 3. If the government and the Majles are not together (God forbid) who must know? 4. The respected deputies definitely know that the Fourth Majles was formed with local sentiments and not on the basis of national interests!! 5. It is no secret to anyone that the dissolution of the Majles is a prerogative of the absolute vice regency of the chief jurisconsult and that during the revisions and amendments to the Constitution, His Holiness Imam Khamene'i did not permit this to be added to the Constitution, but who should know if the Constitution is defective or not? 6. Did the deputies from Kerman think the executive apparatus is like a corporation and that some of the officials were from the Movali ol-Movahedin Institute and the Milad, Mahan, Kerman Vehicle and other companies..., which is one of the remaining distinctions of Mr. Mar'ashi [as published]? The answer is known to those who are aware of the Koran and the Book of God. 7. Why did many of the high-level officials of Kerman Province refuse to obey the decision by the respected president of the republic? Why did they abandon the ceremony of introduction on 11/30/1372 [19 February 1994], and leave the dear toiling and hard-working personnel in the office of the president of the republic waiting? They did not listen to the advice from the respected and dear Friday Imam of Kerman. They forced the workers and personnel of some of the municipal offices and other places to withdraw as if taking sanctuary during the blessed month of fasting. It is not clear who will answer for that! 8. Time has given the answer to "it is not yet too late." 9. You must ask the people of Jiroft about the "model governor-general"!! 10. The crying of people "which did not come from emotional women, but from men who were crying about all their limbs and wounds" was observed by all the dear passengers who flew without Mr. Mar'ashi after a long delay. 11. The servants of God, the respected deputies of Kerman, Sirjan, Zarand, Kohnuj, and Baft, and the respected minister of the interior...[as published]? 12. Perhaps they have started addressing a second-year college student in economics as "engineer" and we did not know? 13. Unlucky 13! It definitely was not, is not and will not be unlucky. What firmer evidence that it is a blessed number can there be than that after 12 years of successful service he is still friendly, although it is difficult and it involves these things! 14. God grant that this be the last press battle for the respected former governor-general of Kerman and the deputy from Jiroft. With apologies to the sacred office of president of the republic. Zadsar Jirofti Deputy from Jiroft Legislation Bill To Change the Legal Status of the Large University Presses The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was the report from the second consultation of the Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission concerning the Bill To Change the Legal Status of the Nation's Large University Presses and Institutions of Higher Learning, for which Article 1 and its notes were approved by the deputies. Article 1: All the nation's universities and institutions of higher learning are authorized to operate their presses as corporations. Note 1: The wages and benefits of the workers in the aforementioned companies will adhere to the Uniform Payments System Law. Note 2: For presses that are operated jointly by more than one medical university or nonmedical university, the shares of each university in the aforementioned press must be specified in the charter. Note 3: The charters for the presses of the universities mentioned in this law whose status is changed to a corporation will be prepared by the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Health Care and Treatment, and will be approved by the Council of Ministers after approval by the National Administrative and Employment Affairs Organization. Note 4: The presses covered by this law are required to allocate at least 50 percent of their work capacity to the printing of books and academic, educational, and research journals and publications for the nation's universities and institutes of higher education and research, and they must operate in such a way that their printing affairs are not disrupted or suspended. Note 5: Any form of government aid to make up for losses is prohibited and the profits made must be allocated to develop and equip the same printing press. Bill on the Use of Weapons When Necessary by Police Agents The second item on the agenda was the report from the first consultation of the Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission Concerning the Bill on the Use of Weapons When Necessary by Police Agents, the general form of which was approved. In view of the need to employ weapons by police officials in the performance of their lawful responsibilities in sensitive cases, which may sometimes lead to the death or injury of suspects, and in view of the fact that appropriate legal regulations have not been set exempting these kinds of agents from penalties for the performance of their lawful responsibilities and maintaining security in the cities, this has disturbed agents in many places, while suspects have not heeded warnings from agents because they are not authorized to fire. In events that have taken place in Mashhad and elsewhere, agents did not have the authority to perform their missions at borders, guard stations and roadside interrogations. This bill permitting agents to use their weapons was therefore submitted and its general form was approved by the commission. It is worth saying that this bill must be studied in the second consultation. Rejection of Motion To Detach the National Grain Organization From the Ministry of Commerce and Attach It to the Ministry of Agriculture The final item on the agenda was the report from the first consultation of the Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission concerning the rejection of the Motion To Detach the National Grain Organization From the Ministry of Commerce and Attach it to the Ministry of Agriculture, continued consideration of which was postponed to the next session. Majles Notes Budget for Fighting the Cultural Invasion and Its Expenditures Yesterday, in a conversation with RESALAT's parliamentary correspondent, Dr. Kamran, a member of the Majles Islamic Guidance and Art Commission, criticized the performance of the nation's cultural organizations with regard to Note 55 of the budget bill. He said: Last year, on the initiative of the Majles and for the purpose of confronting the enemy's cultural invasion, a special budget was allocated in the form of Note 55 for the purpose of implementing suitable programs in this regard. This year the government also included this in its 1373 [21 March 1994 -20 March 1995] budget bill, but in view of most of the members of the commission, the performance this year by the organizations concerning this note was not positive. In the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], instead of submitting appropriate programs for resisting the cultural invasion and spending this budget on that, the relevant organizations spent the money on the cultural programs they were already carrying out, and this is in conflict with the main goal. To answer the main message of Note 55, which is to carry out appropriate programs, the cultural organizations used this budget to buy organizational houses, to help the offices of some of the Friday imams, to build offices in some parts of the country and to complete some of their projects that were half-complete. These things are in conflict with the goals of this note. We hope in the year 1373 the organizations will refrain from spending the money in this budget on the current tasks and day-to-day work of the organizations and will implement real projects to fight the cultural invasion. Continuing, he said: Of the 60 billion rials allocated this year to fight the cultural invasion, about 80 percent was spent on programs other than fighting the cultural invasion. Dr. Kamran also added: The Plan and Budget Organization's supervisory responsibility in this regard is not proper and complete, and this organization must exercise greater supervision to prevent this type of performance. Letter From a Number of Deputies Concerning the Printing of Bills More than 80 Majles deputies sent a letter to the president of the republic asking that government institutions no longer publish bills and calendars at the beginning of the new year. The full text of this letter is as follows: To His Holiness Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani, respected president of the Islamic Republic of Iran: Peace be upon you, With wishes for your excellency's success and acceptance, as you know, every year the ministries, companies, banks, and bodies of the Islamic revolution print large numbers of various calendars and bills at heavy cost to the Muslim treasury, and yet at the same time a large number of our students across the country are unable to obtain stationery, shoes, and clothing for the New Year's holidays. Therefore, we, a number of Majles deputies, are asking your excellency to issue a firm order to the organizations under the mantle of the government to refrain from pointless expenditures of this kind and to spend the money instead to procure essentials for needy students (for your information the report published in RESALAT on 12/3/1372 [22 February 1994] is enclosed).
