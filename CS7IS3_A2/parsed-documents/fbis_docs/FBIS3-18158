FBIS3-18158 "drweu039_n_94009" FBIS-WEU-94-039 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Feb 1994 NORDIC COUNTRIES Norway Majority Favor EU Membership If Finland, Sweden Included 94P20405A Oslo AFTENPOSTEN in Norwegian 12 Feb 94 p 5 94P20405A Oslo AFTENPOSTEN Language: Norwegian Article Type:CSO [Article by Harald Stanghelle] [Text] A slim majority of the voters would say yes to Norwegian membership in the EU [European Union] if Finland and Sweden join, according to the polling firm Opinion. A poll that Opinion conducted for AFTENPOSTEN confirms the impression that the yes side is gaining support. Some 41 percent say yes, 39 percent say no, and 19 percent still have not made up their minds. This is the first time since the negotiations started between Norway and the EU that there is a majority in favor. In January 36 percent said yes and 42 percent said no when we asked the voters their opinion on Norwegian EU membership if our two Nordic neighbors were members. Several polls this month show that the yes side has been strengthened at the expense of the no side. Opinion's February poll shows that 37 percent of the voters now say yes to EU membership unconditionally. A full 48 percent say no, however, and 15 percent have not decided. So there can be no doubt that the no side continues to have the upper hand, even though there has been migration within the electorate in the last two months. The yes side has advanced by 11 percent since December in Opinion's polls, and the no side has declined by 6 percent. Another fact is that the yes side has become more convinced. The yes alternative "definitely yes" was chosen by 10 percent more supporters in February than in December. Negotiations One important factor in the trends that this and other polls show may be the strong focus on Norway's negotiations with the EU. The negotiations have led to the issue becoming more imminent, and at the same time the main point of the no side's argument is overshadowed by the tug-of-war going on in Brussels. Another reason the voters are confident that the government is protecting Norwegian interests may be the impression created by what former Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen termed "rigid Norwegian positions." According to Opinion's poll there can be little doubt that the outcome of the negotiations is important to the voters' stance on the EU. When we asked, What importance do you ascribe to the outcome of the negotiations in your vote on Norwegian EU membership? 54 percent said "great" (28 percent) or "some" (26 percent) importance. The figures also show that a full 58 percent of the undecided voters ascribe great importance (40 percent) or some importance (18 percent) to the negotiation outcome in determining their final position. The outcome of the negotiations has the greatest significance for Labor Party voters: A full 66 percent say it is of importance to their view on the EU issue. Only 31 percent of the Progress Party's voters say the same thing, while the other parties go from 45 percent (Center Party) to 52 percent (Christian People's Party). We find some of the same trends in the underlying data in the question that links Finnish and Swedish EU membership to the Norwegian voters' position. Of the Labor Party's voters, a full 58 percent say yes provided our neighboring countries are members, and 28 percent say no. If we consider the decidedly no-leaning Socialist Left Party, 15 percent say yes, and 70 percent say no under the same conditions. The corresponding figures for the Christian People's Party are 18 and 70. The background data support the impression that the Center Party is the purest no party. Even if Sweden and Finland become members, only 3 percent of the Center Party's voters will say yes to the EU, 88 percent continue to say no, and the rest are undecided. Today's poll has two other features worth noting: When the yes percent rises, the disparity between opinions among voters in urban and rural areas grows. In the cities there are 41 percent in favor, while there are only 32 percent in favor in the rural areas. Among the rural voters 55 percent say no, while the no percentage in the urban areas is 42. Another interesting feature is that increasing numbers of Labor voters are saying yes to Norwegian membership. To our unconditioned question of EU stance, 53 percent of the Labor voters say yes, while 34 percent say no. The Progress Party is becoming more of a no party: Fifty percent of the party's voters are against Norwegian membership, and 35 percent are for. Opinion's February poll was conducted between Monday [7 February] and Wednesday of this week. It is based on interviews with 1,003 persons. We always caution against placing too much importance on a single opinion poll, but several polls in the last few weeks show the same trend. There can be no doubt that the February poll is a psychological breakthrough for the yes side. It is the first time in a long time that a poll shows a majority in favor of membership under conditions that are central to the arguments of the yes side. The belief that nothing can change the Norwegian people's opposition to the EU has suffered a blow. Paradoxically, this poll could also have a positive effect for the no side whose leaders have had trouble keeping their followers from assuming victory in advance. EU Membership if Sweden and Finland Are Members: Yes: 41, No: 39, Undecided: 19 percent. Importance of Negotiation Outcome: Great: 28, Some: 26, Little or None: 38, Undecided: 8 percent. Good for Prices, Not for Welfare Norwegian EU membership would be good for prices, defense, security, and the environment, but a drawback for jobs, welfare institutions, the districts, agriculture, and fisheries. This is how the voters respond in an extensive poll on how Norwegians believe EU membership would affect important issues. Opinion has conducted the poll for AFTENPOSTEN. The voters do not believe that Norwegian membership in the EU would have any overall effect on their own financial situation. Some 15 percent think membership would be an advantage, 14 percent a drawback, and a full 56 percent believe Norwegian membership is irrelevant to their own financial situation. In spite of this, the voters have very clear opinions on what membership will mean for important, much-discussed issues. It is interesting to note that the assessments do not automatically coincide with each individual's standpoint on the EU. All of 57 percent think membership would be an advantage for price levels in Norway. Only 11 percent think it would be a drawback. We get the same clear-cut response to such issues as agriculture, districts policy, and fisheries. Only a minority of the voters, even among those who favor membership, think that membership is advantageous in these areas. What is interesting is that as many as 35 percent of the voters think that EU membership will be disadvantageous to employment, while only 19 percent think it will be advantageous. These responses have to be viewed in the context of the notion of welfare institutions: Some 40 percent of those interviewed think EU membership would be a drawback to the Norwegian welfare institutions. Only 11 percent think membership would be an advantage in this area. In these two very significant areas Norwegian voters believe that EU membership will lead to decline in comparison with today's conditions in Norway. It would appear that the so-called Zhirinovskiy effect is present when a full 39 percent believe that EU membership would be an advantage in terms of Norway's defense and security position. If we are to believe the figures of this poll, an even closer relationship with our allies seems reassuring. It is also worth noting that while such groups as Norwegian Environmental Protection Association is strongly opposed to EU membership, 32 percent believe it would be good for environmental efforts if Norway joins the EU, while 27 percent do not. - EU Membership and Employment--Advantage: 19, Drawback: 35, Irrelevant: 29, Undecided: 18 percent. - EU Membership and Prices--Advantage: 57, Drawback: 11, Irrelevant: 15, Undecided: 17 percent. - EU Membership and Districts Policy--Advantage: 10, Drawback: 55, Irrelevant: 12, Undecided: 24 percent. - EU Membership and Norway's Defense and Security--Advantage: 39, Drawback: 12, Irrelevant: 22, Undecided: 28 percent. - EU Membership and Welfare Institutions--Advantage: 11, Drawback: 40, Irrelevant: 25, Undecided: 25 percent. - EU Membership and Environmental Protection Efforts--Advantage: 32, Drawback: 27, Irrelevant: 18, Undecided: 24 percent. - EU Membership and Norwegian Agriculture--Advantage: 9, Drawback: 68, Irrelevant: 5, Undecided: 18 percent. - EU Membership and Norwegian Fisheries Sector--Advantage: 15, Drawback: 57, Irrelevant: 7, Undecided: 21 percent. - EU Membership and Personal Finances--Advantage: 15, Drawback: 14, Irrelevant: 56, Undecided: 15 percent.
