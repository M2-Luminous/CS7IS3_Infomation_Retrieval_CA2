FBIS4-67614 "jptep002__l94017" JPRS-TEP-94-002-L JPRS Epidemiology 30 January 1994 LATIN AMERICA ARGENTINA Measures To Eradicate Foot-and-Mouth Disease Measures To Eradicate Foot-and-Mouth Disease 94WE0177A Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish 30 Jan 94 p 15--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94WE0177A Buenos Aires LA NACION Spanish CSO [First paragraph is LA NACION introduction] [Text] Discussing foot-and-mouth disease, the administrator of Senasa [National Service for Animal Health] said that this disease, which first appeared in Bariloche and then spread to other areas, will soon be fully under control. Senasa's general administrator, Dr. Bernardo Cane, yesterday told LA NACION that within 60 days the situation in Rio Negro will be fully normalized. There, because of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the region, approximately 9,000 sheep were sacrificed to prevent the spread of disease. Shortly after his return to Buenos Aires from that region, Cane, in a telephone interview, said that the strategy implemented by his organization, including the slaughter of animals, vaccination, revaccination, restrictions on livestock movements, the establishment of new fixed checkpoints, and the inspection of meatpacking plants and pig-breeding facilities, would be operational within 90 days. Thirty days have now elapsed, so he felt that within 60 more days the situation will be absolutely under control. Efforts are continuing to achieve that goal. He said that in Bariloche 125,000 animals were revaccinated and there are no signs of danger. In Viedma a similar number of animals have been vaccinated and revaccinated. Concerning the last eight outbreaks in Adolfo Alsina, San Antonio Oeste, and General Conesa, he said that immediate action was taken, as on the other occasions, and that the situation was under control. No Danger The official also said there was no danger for either Buenos Aires or Chubut and, when asked if what had happened could pose some risk to the progress of the National Plan to Eradicate Foot-and-Mouth Disease, he emphatically said no. "On a national level," he said, "everything is going very well. In the last three months there were only seven instances reported all over the country (not including the ones in Rio Negro); this will absolutely not impede the progress of the plan." Foot-and-mouth disease causes Argentina losses of $300 million a year because of international restrictions on our meats. Foot-and-Mouth Disease Plan In his conversation with LA NACION, Cane said that the area covered by Chubut, Santa Cruz, and Tierra del Fuego, that is, the area south of the 42d parallel, is considered by international organizations as a disease-free zone not requiring vaccination. He also said that starting tomorrow, staffers from the Pan American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Center, from INTA [National Institute of Agricultural-Livestock Technology], and Senasa will begin work on a Foot-and-Mouth Disease Plan to standardize a package of epidemiological measures that, when implemented in the mid-term--it cannot yet be determined exactly when--will enable Neuquen and Rio Negro Provinces to regain the status of vaccination-free zones. Neuquen does not vaccinate and to protect itself from this disease it has banned the entry in its territory of meat containing bones--the virus multiplies in the bone marrow. Furthermore, Senasa has declared Neuquen free from foot-and-mouth disease, and for the past 10 years no outbreaks of this disease have been reported. The Foot-and-Mouth Disease Plan will now attempt to have this province and Rio Negro internationally recognized as regions free from foot-and-mouth disease. Sacrifice When asked whether it was absolutely necessary to sacrifice animals, Cane answered that firmness in making such decisions counts for a great deal with international organizations. "By sacrificing these animals it is possible to recover disease-free status within one year; if that is not done, it takes at least two years, and by 1995 we want to have this disease under control," said Cane. He added that both the European Union and Chile supported the measures taken by Senasa and have not imposed restrictions on our products. Chile--the only country in South America recognized as free from foot-and-mouth disease--is at this time the third-ranking buyer of our meats, following Germany and Italy. Every year it buys 25,000 tons of refrigerated choice meat cuts. Concerning his position as Senasa's director, Cane said his resignation is still under consideration by Secretary of Agriculture Felipe Sola. However, he reiterated his desire to continue working with all the sectors involved, "for we all share this responsibility." A few days ago Cane said in a statement to Telam that "mistakes were made on a national and provincial level and by producers and the meat-packing industry," which contributed to the spread of this disease south of the Colorado River.
