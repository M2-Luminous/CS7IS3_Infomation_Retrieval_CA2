They discussed practical plans for reconstruction, and social aid -- something that has never been tried on a large scale after a war. Sweden has been making preparations for reconstruction through the efforts of a group chaired by Foreign Minister Under Secretary of State Lars-Ake Nilsson. The group has been working very hard in the last few weeks. The Swedish Government is hoping that there will be a unique project involving coexistence, in which new ideas about conflict resolution will be tested on the spot. Volunteer organizations will play an important role. These are therefore being invited to a seminar in Stockholm later this month. The Helsinki committees, the Red Cross, Save the Children, and other well-known organizations will take part. But new approaches will also be tried. "Perhaps the immigrant organizations in Sweden with their special knowledge can help," Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas suggested. "If we are to achieve any form of population return to the region we have to try to create security, structures, surveillance alongside economic aid." Personally af Ugglas is somewhat pessimistic about the prospects of peace soon. But the preparatory work for reconstruction could in itself have a peace-building effect. It could increase the sides' desire to reach a settlement, she said. The Nordic countries are also discussing in concrete terms which area they should adopt in particular in Bosnia in the event of peace. "For Sweden it is natural to think of the Tuzla region," Margaretha af Ugglas said. "That is where the Nordic battalion located, and a multicultural society still exists there." A problems for the Nordic area is, however, that it is not represented in the top-level meetings on the former Yugoslavia, despite the considerable involvement of Nordic troops in Bosnia. That is why Sweden wants to attend the meeting of foreign ministers in Geneva on 13 May, which was called by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and will be attended by Britain, France, and Germany as well as the EU [European Union]. "But since we are not members of the EU or NATO we have some difficulty in being admitted to the core consultations, at which the political decisions are reached," Foreign Minister af Ugglas said. In a joint statement issued after yesterday's meeting, the Nordic foreign ministers gave a powerful indication of their desire to play a larger political role in the peace negotiations on the former Yugoslavia. Among other things, they referred to their considerable contribution to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and expressed their support for the setting-up of a contact group which would, together with the international mediators, draft a proposal for a total cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They also proposed that an advisory group, composed of countries contributing troops, should be attached to the Security Council for every UN operation. Behind the Nordic stance lies a dissatisfaction with the UN leadership and with the disagreement between NATO and the United Nations.
