Ozawa told a press conference that "it is impossible to explain" the basis for his belief that the country is developing nuclear weapons because "I have not seen it with my own eyes, but I believe so, that's my hunch." Ozawa, one of the main strategists of the coalition government, told a television interview Sunday that North Korea "definitely has nuclear arms," without giving any evidence to back up his statement. He reasoned that if the country did not have any nuclear weapons, it would open its facilities to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Ozawa said that if it has nothing to hide, it "should show everything." The pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryun) demanded that Ozawa withdraw his remarks, saying "they are preposterous and defiant" and that they "ignore elementary diplomatic common sense."
