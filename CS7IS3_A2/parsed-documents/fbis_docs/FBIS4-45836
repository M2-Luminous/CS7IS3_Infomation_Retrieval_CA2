He said government will never cope with the scourge in as far as concerns treatment of AIDS patients and provision of hospital facilities. [sentence as received] To cope, he said, government will have to build a hospital in every six months and be able to provide between 400 to 500 beds every year. "That is taking into consideration that each patient will be in hospital for 20 days," he said. He said the present nurses-to-patient ratio stands at 1 to 600 and there is only E[emalangeni]1 million this year to be used in the prevention of AIDS, after having been increased from E300,000 last year. He told senators that in the next two years, people will be dying in large numbers as long as they don't change their behaviour. As a result, he said, there would be 40,000 orphans and helpless old people who would be left stranded as bread-winners, as people in the sexually active range, would have died. Dr. von Wissel was replying to several questions from Senators during the debate on the vote of the Ministry of Health. Senators wanted to know the cause of the disease, its impact and if there were any plans to counter its effects. The minister said sexual promiscuity is the largest contributing factor to the epidemic. He said children are becoming sexually active "much too much early" as between 15 to 18 years. To emphasise this view, the minister informed the House that one out of 10 women who are treated for maternity problems in hospitals, is a child who attempted or committed a back-street abortion. He said 75 percent of 16 year olds are sexually active, half of whom have got more than one partner at a time and have sex, at least, more than two times a month. [passage omitted] Presently, he said, 22 percent of the population are HIV positive (have the virus that eventually develops into AIDS). "One in every five in the country has the HIV virus. In certain areas, out of three women, one has it." The minister said AIDS should not be stigmatized. "It's just like cancer or any other disease that we have since learnt to live with. So people should stop thinking of it as a dirty disease."
