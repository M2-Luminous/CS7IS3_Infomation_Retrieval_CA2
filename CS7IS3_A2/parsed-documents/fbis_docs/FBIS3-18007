Today, [Swedish] Premier Carl Bildt travelled to Riga in order to try to influence the Latvian Parliament also to approve the treaty. Lars Gunnar Erlandson reports: [Erlandson] The lightning visit which Premier Carl Bildt is paying to the Latvian capital Riga today is almost exclusively about what will happen to the treaty which Latvia is about to conclude with Russia. There is strong opposition in the Latvian Parliament to the treaty, which the government has said it will be able to sign shortly. Everything indicates that the Russians will be able to retain a radar station in Skrunda, but one difficult issue is the rights which the Russians are demanding for the thousands of retired Russian military staff remaining in Latvia. Latvian Premier Valdis Birkavs does not want to divulge what advice he has received from Bildt, but he stressed that Sweden's view of security in the Baltics is very important. This is what Premier Carl Bildt had to say after the discussions in Riga. [Begin recording] [Bildt] I believe that the great significance of this troop withdrawal treaty is recognized here. At the same time, we recognize the very difficult decisions which this treaty means for Latvia, both with regard to the radar base in Skrunda and with regard to the rights following from this for certain military officers to retire here. [Erlandson] Is that the hardest nut to crack? [Bildt] It is difficult to know which is the hardest, but a treaty of this kind means coompromise on both sides. There is a strong nationalist opposition in Russia which does not want this treaty at all, and there is uncertainty here, too. [Erlandson] But could there be a treaty where something is excepted, for instance the issue of retired officers? [Bildt] That is part of the treaty, so I found it difficult to see that, as things are now developing. The treaty is written as a whole and all these things must be sorted out one way or the other in a relationship governed by a treaty between Latvia and Russia. One must be clear that, in the relations between a large country like Russia and a small country like Latvia, it is in the interests of the small country to have a treaty. A state without treaties can always be utilized by the big ones, treaties are always in the interests of the small ones. [end recording]
