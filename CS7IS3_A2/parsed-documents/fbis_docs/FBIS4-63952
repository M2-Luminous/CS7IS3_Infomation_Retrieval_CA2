This is what Major General Valeriy Kuznetsov, Republic of Crimea internal affairs minister, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent yesterday in an exclusive interview. V. Kuznetsov pointed out that this military buildup is "unnecessary and atypical" of Crimea, which is already "awash with military formations and combat equipment." At the same time, he noted, Ukraine is indoctrinating and sounding out army units on the matter of the personnel's willingness to take practical action in the event of the introduction of a state of emergency in Crimea.
