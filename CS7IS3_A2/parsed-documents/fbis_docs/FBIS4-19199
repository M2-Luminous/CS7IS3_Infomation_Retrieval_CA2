FBIS4-19199 "drweu073__a94010" FBIS-WEU-94-073-A Daily Report 15 April 1994 ANNEX Germany Supports Polish EU Membership Supports Polish EU Membership AU1404142594 Hamburg DPA in German 1310 GMT 14 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1404142594 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- [no dateline as received] In addition to the expansion of bilateral relations with Poland, Germany wants to advocate with all its strength this country's accession to the European Union [EU]. "Europe without Poland would be a rump," Chancellor Helmut Kohl stated in Bonn on Thursday [14 April] after a talk with Polish head of government, Waldemar Pawlak. A united Europe without Poland is unthinkable, Kohl said. In addition to economic relations, Pawlak's first visit to Germany as Polish prime minister focused on European integration and Poland's accession to the EU, which is desired by both countries. Pawlak stressed his government's interest in reducing artificial barriers for Polish export products with in the EU. Poland's negative trade balance with Germany must be balanced in the future, Pawlak said. After his talk with the 34-year-old head of government, Kohl spoke to journalists in the chancellor's office and stressed that the quality of relations between Germany and Poland is also vitally important for Europe. Regardless of the generation gap between him and his guest, both of them know how important it is to learn from history and to turn bad experiences into good policy, Kohl said. The chancellor envisages the goal of shaping goodneighborly relations with Poland along the lines of German-French relations. Perhaps it is a new image of Germany for Poland that the FRG in particular supports Poland's desire for EU membership so emphatically. Pawlak and Kohl want to take specific measures soon to reduce the long waiting times at the German-Polish border crossings to a tolerable level. Kohl wants to use Germany's presidency of the EU Council during the second half of this year to present proposals to the partners in the EU about how Poland's path toward final membership can be paved. Kohl paid tribute to the Polish reform policy and expressly welcomed that the country has joined the NATO partnership treaty. As has been heard from Polish delegation circles, economic relations in particular between the two states should be given more substance. German investors are still too hesitant. Given an overall volume of foreign investment in Poland at $3 billion, German investment is only 400 million German marks, it was said. Pawlak will conclude his two-day visit to Germany in Stuttgart on Friday.
