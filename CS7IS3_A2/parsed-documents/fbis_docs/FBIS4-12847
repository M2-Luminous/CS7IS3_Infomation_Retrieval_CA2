During a meeting today with Italian members of parliament Antonio Catika and Joseph Sarta [names as received], the minister said that such contracts would include railroads, communications, aviation, airlines, maritime transportation, trucks, and buses, and could be worth billions of dollars. He said Italian firms had benefited from the extensive commercial ties that once existed between Iraq and Italy. He said such firms suffered grave losses as a result of the unfair embargo imposed on Iraq by the U.S. Administration. The two Italian parliament members stressed that they will brief the Italian parliament during its next session on their impressions of the situation in Iraq and the suffering of the Iraqi people as a result of the blockade. They will also brief the Italian parliament on the extensive business prospects available for Italian firms in Iraq.
