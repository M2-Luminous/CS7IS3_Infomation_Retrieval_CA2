Ricardo Montenegro, president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industries, noted, however, that this reduction might affect several national reconstruction projects which depend on foreign aid. Montenegro believes that during the past year our country achieved substantial economic growth. Therefore, we are more likely to become independent of foreign aid. This economic growth will increase year after year and foreign aid, such as that from the United States, will become dispensable. [Begin Montenegro recording] We are pleased about this. We had been told that the aid would be suspended gradually. It is becoming a reality. We have always believed and felt that as Salvadorans we should become self-sufficient and stop depending on friendly countries. [end recording] This year the U.S. Government might reduce aid to the country from $230 million to $94 million, which is 70 percent. Although the Chamber of Commerce and Industries views this measure with good eyes, it is anticipated that some projects to be carried out in keeping with the national reconstruction plan may experience some delay. [Begin Montenegro recording] It could be that some projects, especially those involving reconstruction, might be delayed if the aid is cut definitely or in large amounts. We are certain that the U.S. Government is quite aware of the country's situation. We don't think they will make substantial aid cuts. [end recording]
