What does a person think about this who, in his capacity as head of the government commission that awards licenses for the export and import of arms, should have a sufficient overview? [Gerinec] Each businessman tries to find a buyer and, once he finds him, he tries to keep his name a secret because many possibilities exist to jeopardize a potential deal. The producer or seller, let alone the buyer, therefore prefers not to speak. I believe that it has been positive for Slovakia thus far that one was talking less in this regard, and doing more. [Sporer] Doing? On the basis of the small amounts of spare parts produced in our arms factories (about 5 percent of the original production volume from the time before conversion) to which the factory managers admit, this "doing" could not involve large-scale deals? [Gerinec] I agree. Besides, the sales have been restricted to excess equipment from the arsenal of the Army of the Slovak Republic, and these sales are gradually coming to an end, owing to the available time frame, which is limited by international agreements. [Sporer] The state used to sell heavy weapons manufactured in Slovakia through the Omnipol foreign trade company. This company was and still is represented by people who now live in the Czech Republic. These businessmen have contacts with specific countries and, within these countries, with specific customers. It is logical that, when an Arab client or another customer used to conclude agreements on deliveries with someone from Omnipol during a dinner, he will not turn to the prime minister or the arms factory director with an order today, but to the man with whom he once cooperated. Is the loss of Omnipol a big loss? [Gerinec] It represents not only a loss but, literally, damage to Slovakia's interests. These people continue to work for the benefit of those who pay them; their priority is to conclude contracts for the benefit of their own organization--that is, Omnipol. They trade in arms manufactured in the Czech Republic, but, naturally, they also try to sell weapons manufactured elsewhere. Business is business. Naturally, they try to achieve the maximum financial profit for Omnipol, also vis-a-vis our factories, for example. We are trying to prevent this by means of the system we have created. Only a Slovak firm or juridical person can trade in arms commodities in Slovakia. [Sporer] But cannot Omnipol still participate in business transactions as a middleman? [Gerinec] It could do so only through a Slovak firm that would make the purchase for it. Omnipol could then sell the merchandise to a third party. [Sporer] The most ideal solution would perhaps be to enlist people from Omnipol for a similar firm in Slovakia, or am I wrong? [Gerinec] Omnipol is a well-established organization. The people working there have certain guarantees. Slovakia does not avail itself of a similar organization that would be established on world markets. Our businessmen who have acquired some reputation in this branch tried to enlist them, in a way. But the offer of something that could only be successful in the long run was too little, compared with the guarantees they now have. [Sporer] How do you evaluate, from this viewpoint, the activity of Mr. Luhovy, for example, former minister of general engineering and, before that, director general of the ZTS [Heavy Engineering Works] economic production unit? [Gerinec] As far as I know, Mr. Luhovy is involved in business while being retired. He lives in Slovakia and wanted to help Slovakia. [Sporer] Was he rejected? [Gerinec] No. Of course, the question is how such assistance can be realized. I do not know how Mr. Luhovy is doing. I am not in touch with him. [Sporer] The Armex company was established in Slovakia almost seven months ago, as an alternative to Omnipol. The former government placed Vitazoslav Moric, honorary deputy chairman of the Slovak National Party, at the head of this company. Yet, to this day, Armex has not received a license from your commission.... [Gerinec] It is difficult to comment on this issue because Armex has not yet applied for a license. It apparently had a reason not to apply. [Sporer] What reason? [Gerinec] The state retained 100-percent participation in Armex. An organization made up of representatives of five government departments was to be established, whose task was to take upon itself trade issues and also to coordinate these activities, if possible. The launching of Armex was linked to the launching of production in arms factories. The problem is that not even the basic prerequisites have been met--I am thinking, among other things, of the experience and initiative of the people involved--so this organization does not work. It was perhaps exaggerated to expect more of the state officials who were charged with this duty. [Sporer] Is it within the government's jurisdiction to resort in Armex to personnel changes, for example? [Gerinec] Of course. The government established the company, it appointed its director general, and it can even dissolve Armex. [Sporer] How many companies trade in arms in Slovakia? [Gerinec] This question is difficult to answer because it is a question of obtaining a permit [koncese] for sale, which is awarded by the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic. Once the ministry grants someone a permit to sell and purchase arms commodities, he can ask the government's licensing commission for a license to engage in this activity. However, there are private businessmen who sell weapons only on the territory of the Slovak Republic on the basis of a mere trade license. If they restrict their sales to the territory of the Slovak Republic, they need not be holders of a license from our commission. I emphasize, however, that those who export or import weapons must ask our commission for a license. Firms trading in short hunting weapons make use of this possibility most. However, a license can be requested even by a company that mostly trades in other commodities and wants to engage in arms trade as a supplementary activity. [Sporer] People in the Martin and Dubnica arms factories claim that, after conversion, Poles rushed into the territories that have been vacated by Slovaks. Russians, too, are very active. Moreover, the Czechs have set up the RDP [Research, Development, Production] Group [holding of arms manufacturers] and try to assert themselves with a modernized T-72 tank. What chances are there for our heavy weaponry to return to its former markets? [Gerinec] It is true that the Poles, who have not carried out any conversion, entered the vacated space. The Russians have not stopped developing tanks and have already mastered the production of tanks of the T-80 and T-90 ranges. Moreover, they own a great mass of excess weaponry [that they must discard to comply with international agreements]. It must be admitted that we have never manufactured any new models, but well-established models that we were able to "show," so to speak. That is also true of the T-72 tank. If we want to be successful, someone will therefore have to invest in development. [Sporer] Which "someone"? [Gerinec] A customer interested in the commencement of production. It is customary abroad that this task is assumed by the army of the country that owns arms production. The army replaces its equipment, and trade with other countries gradually receives a chance. The problem is that our Army's budget, no matter how high it may seem in comparison with the budgets of other government departments, simply does not allow the Army to supplement its arsenal with new weaponry. Therefore, the Army is not able to help set arms production in motion. It is a different matter, of course, when a factory starts an innovation program and reconstructs a tank turret, for example (which is the case at the Dubnica arms factory), and finds for it customers in armies equipped with T-72 tanks. It is up to the managers of these arms factories to calculate whether such deals are worthwhile. [Sporer] There is talk about the state having lost tens of billions of korunas as a result of conversion. Plainly speaking, how can the arms factories cover this loss, in your opinion? [Gerinec] Their managements are in the best position to answer this question. However, it would probably be inappropriate for me to reply only that the annual turnover of special production used to represent some 20 billion Czechoslovak korunas. People from the Martin factory cite a better example. They say that, when they produced and sold a single tank, they made the same profit they make from the production and sale of 40 tractors today.
