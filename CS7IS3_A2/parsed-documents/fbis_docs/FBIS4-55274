The refugees, predominantly Croats from the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, refused to leave Slovenia, where they have been accommodated, by April 15, as was envisaged by a Slovenian-Croatian agreement on governmental level. In a note to Zagreb, Ljubljana demands that Slovenian ownership of the resorts and interstate agreements be respected. Failing to specify the diplomatic measures it will resort to, Slovenia threatened that the refugees would be moved out, with the explanation that its future moves are politically and morally justified. Slovenian-Croatian relations have in recent weeks again deteriorated, as can be seen from Ljubljana's cold response to President Tudjman's invitation to Slovenian President Milan Kucan to pay an official visit to Croatia. Besides the problem of the resorts, i.e., ownership, Ljubljana and Zagreb have also failed to regulate a number of other important political and economic issues. The delimitation of the border on the Adriatic coast and the delivery of power from the Krsko nuclear power plant and the payment for it have also been reasons for dispute. The constant drop in the exchange of goods between these former Yugoslav republics is a consequence of these disputes.
