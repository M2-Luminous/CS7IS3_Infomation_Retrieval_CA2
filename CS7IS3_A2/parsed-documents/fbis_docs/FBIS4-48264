Sani Abacha, to relinquish power without delay. In an open letter dated 11 May, released to the media in Lagos late Monday [16 May], the Anglican cleric urged the Nigerian leader to reverse immediately the annulment of country's 12 June 1993 election results and install a democratically elected government. "Now is the time for you to bow out honourably" he said. "If you cannot see the handwriting on the wall and bow out, the end may be inglorious." Rev. Adetiloye told Abacha that refusal to [word indistinct] would throw Nigeria into "a disastrous revolution" that could divide the country. In an apparent reference to former military ruler, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, who stepped down from after annulling the elections in which millionaire businessman Moshood Abiola claimed victory, the archbishop said: "De-annul the annulment, install the democratically elected president and [word indistinct] honour as a hero of the decade, otherwise your exit would be equally inglorious." The archbishop expressed surprise that the Nigerian leader had gone to South Africa to witness the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela after his (Abacha's) "active participation in the annulment of a free, fair and peaceful election" of Nigeria's own president. The archbishop's letter comes in the wake of growing pressure from various organisations, groups and individuals on the Nigerian leader to step down. [passage indistinct]
