There is no cause for immediate alarm because, since becoming the "moral" victor in the elections, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has been firing off in all directions, more for the sake of provocation than in earnest. But he cannot be ignored, because some day this man could become Russian president. Whatever fate awaits him, his moment of truth came yesterday, when he triumphantly entered the skyscraper that (for the present) houses the new parliament. It was an entry worthy of a rock star, rather than a politician, because only Madonna and Michael Jackson are granted such a reception. [passage omitted] Vladimir Volfovich, I asked him, amid the throng, is what you told one Austrian newspaper true? Do you want Italy to cede the South Tyrol to Austria? [Zhirinovskiy] Definitely. You wanted to break us up into pieces. Well, now you can taste some of your own medicine. [Franceschini] Who do you mean by "you"? [Zhirinovskiy] You Italians, you Europeans, you Westerners. You caused the Soviet Union to collapse, and it would serve you right to suffer the same fate and to see what it feels like. Thus, perhaps you will understand what Russia is experiencing now, without the 14 republics that have historically belonged to it. So, South Tyrol must go to Austria, Trieste can go to Yugoslavia, Sicily can go it alone, and so forth. [Franceschini] But the Soviet Union was a vast and totalitarian empire. Italy is a small democratic country. Why do you want to break it up into pieces? [Zhirinovskiy] You are small, but you must become even smaller. You must end up with an Italy as small as Andorra or Liechtenstein: Then you will understand! [Franceschini] But in your opinion Russia should regain not only the former Soviet republics but also the former communist countries of Eastern Europe. [Zhirinovskiy] Not at all. I say this to the countries of Eastern Europe: Stay neutral, free, and independent. You do not need NATO at all. Why do you want to lick American and British generals' boots? You will never have anything to fear from Russia. Russia will never reach as far as Prague or Budapest. [Franceschini] What about as far as Kiev? Are you in favor of taking away Ukraine's nuclear weapons? [Zhirinovskiy] Definitely, yes. It must have all its missiles taken away, and Russia must have them back. No new nuclear powers must emerge in the world; there are already enough. [Franceschini] So you agree on this with Yeltsin and Clinton. They are working well in the negotiations with Ukraine... [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, they are good fellows, but let them first get out of the way. It would be better. [Franceschini] Will you be seeing Clinton during the Moscow summit? [Zhirinovskiy] I am willing to meet with him, but he is afraid. I really do not know of what. [Franceschini] Well, you have earned yourself a terrible reputation... [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, people say all kinds of things about me: The latest is that I am supposedly a KGB agent, and to think that I was never a CPSU member, have never been in prison or a mental hospital, I do not get drunk, I speak four languages, I have two degrees, I served my country faithfully in the Army, I have not run away to seek my fortune abroad, and I have never stolen a single ruble from anyone. Where can your Clinton find another Russian politician with a record like mine? [Franceschini] But every second day you declare war on some foreign country or other... [Zhirinovskiy] I am opposed to war; I am in favor of peace and of civilized coexistence between all the countries of the world. I do not threaten anyone, either in the South or in the West: We want relations of good cooperation with both Finland and Turkey, with both Afghanistan and Poland, but there are risks of war in the world, and they could increase if someone makes some wrong moves of the kind discussed by NATO in Brussels. [Franceschini] Namely? [Zhirinovskiy] Namely, the idea of waging war on Bosnia. Mitterrand's proposal to bomb the Bosnian cities is pure fascism, or evidence of senility. Mitterrand is evidently a crazy old man; he has not long left to live, and intends to bring the world to war. He is the warmonger, not I. Mitterrand, Major, Kohl, Clinton, the Japanese, the whole of G-7: They are to blame for the war in the Balkans. They hold a summit in Brussels, but the time will come for other summits at which people will be called to account for all these crimes. [Franceschini] Some people expect your first proposal in Parliament to be an attack on Boris Yeltsin. [Zhirinovskiy] Not at all. It will be a proposal for a general amnesty for all political crimes from 1985 to the present. That is, from the day Gorbachev came to power until the violent events of last October. The lengthy crisis and the changes of these difficult years have led to thousands of unjust sentences. Russia must bury its past at a stroke. It must look ahead. To the future. With me. Then it will succeed in rising up again.
