The REUTER, AP, ABC, NIKKEI, and YOMIURI SHIMBUN correspondents raised questions about the timing, venue, and level of the forthcoming Vietnamese-U.S. talks on the issue of financial claims and about any other issues that will be discussed at these talks. The REUTER correspondent asked another question about the reason for the postponement of the talks on financial claims and about when the two sides would discuss the opening of liaison offices. In reply, Mrs. Ho The Lan said: It is true that Vietnam and the United States had initially planned to discuss mutual financial claims on 15-16 February. But as Mr. Le Mai clearly stated at his 4 February news conference, with President Bill Clinton's declaration lifting the embargo against Vietnam, and with his proposal to exchange liaison offices between the two countries, new issues have arisen that need to be discussed by both sides. The talks must therefore be postponed for some time to allow for better preparation. The issue of financial claims and the setting up of liaison offices in Hanoi and Washington will certainly be included on the agenda of the upcoming talks. We have thus far only agreed that Hanoi will be the venue for the talks. I will inform you of the timing when an agreement is reached. To a question raised by the REUTER and AP correspondents about when Vietnam and the United States will begin their talks on human rights, Mrs. Ho The Lan said: Vietnam advocates holding dialogues with all countries, including the United States, on matters of mutual concern, including the human rights issue. As for how much progress has been made in connection with the dialogue on human rights, we have reached a general understanding that such a dialogue will be an exchange of views based of equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in each other's internal affairs. It is on this basis that Vietnam and the United States have agreed to meet to discuss matters of mutual concern, including the human rights issue -- in the near future in New York or Washington -- to understand each other's positions better. By the way, I would like to reassert it is Vietnam's policy to attach importance to relations with the United States and to wish for normal relations between the two countries on the basis of respect for each other's independence and sovereignty, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality, and mutual benefit. During their previous talks, both the United States and Vietnam came to understand that the goodwill and efforts of both sides will determine whether or not obstacles arise in the path of normalized relations between the two countries. The two sides also unanimously held that no political conditions should be attached to the normalization of relations between Vietnam and the United States. The BANGKOK POST correspondent asked whether Vietnam saw any prospects for differences over the Spratly and Paracel archipelagoes being settled through preventive diplomacy, in view of the 16 February Bangkok seminar on preventive diplomacy held between the ASEAN countries and their interlocutors with UN participation. Mrs. Ho The Lan said: The Paracel and Spratly archipelagoes are under Vietnamese sovereignty. We advocate settling all disputes through peaceful negotiations. This conforms to the general trend of the countries in the region. We believe that all differences can be settled through negotiation and diplomacy. The QUAN DOI NHAN DAN correspondent said that according to the Chinese press and Radio Australia, China has sent two research ships to the Spratly archipelago to explore for oil. The correspondent asked if the Vietnamese side had any comment on this. Mrs. Ho The Lan said: Time and again, we have affirmed that the Spratly and Paracel archipelagoes are Vietnamese territory. Any foreign oil exploration in the Spratly archipelago area or on Vietnam's continental shelf without Vietnam's permission or approval amounts to a violation of Vietnam's sovereignty and other rights. This incident is at variance with an agreement reached between the two countries that both sides should refrain from doing anything that may further complicate the situation while they conduct negotiations to settle problems in the Eastern Sea. Answering a question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent regarding Vietnam's observation of the results of the Geneva conference on Indochinese refugees, Mrs. Ho The Lan said: We have expressed our stance on several occasions regarding the repatriation of Vietnamese refugees still stranded in first-asylum countries. I would like to reiterate that the Vietnamese Government is ready to hold talks with all parties concerned to take back refugees whose applications for resettlement in third countries are turned down. Such repatriation must be carried out on the basis of willingness; respect for human dignity; and guarantees of safety, orderliness, and the necessary international financial assistance so that returnees can gradually stabilize their lives after returning to Vietnam. In this spirit, we have been cooperating and are currently cooperating effectively with the High Commissioner for Refugees and other parties concerned to help complete the repatriation program by the end of 1995. Asked by the ITAR-TASS correspondent about Vietnam's reaction to the possible NATO bombing of Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mrs. Ho The Lan said: We hope that the Sarajevo issue will be settled through peaceful negotiations among the warring factions. We do not believe that bombing will bring peace to that country or stability to the Balkan region. [Hanoi VNA in English at 1445 GMT on 17 February in a similar report adds: "On news about whether Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa would visit Vietnam, Mrs Lan said: Vietnam has not received such news through official channel. However if the Japanese prime minister plans to visit this year, he is welcome and Vietnam considers it an important event in the development of the friendship and cooperation between the two countries. Mrs Lan rejected the news that Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet was going to visit Indonesia and to meet with Taiwan's president in Bali."]
