Moscow urged compromise in the crucial area of trade in nuclear materials and announced it would send one of the Government's heaviest-hitters to Brussels on 27 April with the aim of bringing the talks to an end. Alexandr Shokin, the minister responsible for the economy and foreign trade, wrote to the EU foreign affairs ministers, meeting in Council in Luxembourg on 18 April, calling for their "cooperation" in bringing the talks to "an early and successful conclusion." Although there are officially three issues standing in the way of the Treaty -- nuclear materials, rights for EU ships flying non-EU flags, and the establishment of foreign banks in Russia -- the stakes have now in reality boiled down to the issue of cheap uranium imports into the Union. In his letter, Mr. Shokin referred to the nuclear fuel trade problem as the "principal outstanding obstacle" in the way of an Agreement that would regularise EU-Russian political and economic relations and get Russia on the same footing as Ukraine, which penned a similar Partnership Agreement with the EU in March. Russia wants trade in nuclear materials to be incorporated into the Agreement along with other related issues such as investment, nuclear nonproliferation, conversion of defence industries, nuclear safeguards and environmental policy. The EU's official stance has been until now that a separate Agreement is needed to regulate Russian uranium exports to the EU while France has taken a harder line in seeking a quota. The Eurodif plant in Tricastin, France, produces 40 percent of world's requirements of enriched uranium, and the Paris Government is concerned this industry would be threatened by Russia's enormous capacity to make the same product at much lower prices. Mr. Shokin acknowledged this fear in his letter, and said Russia is "prepared to provide assurances that its exports of natural and enriched uranium to the Community will be nondisruptive, avoiding sudden surges." However, in return, Russia would want assurances that the EU would avoid unilateral measures "disrupting mutual trade" and would consult with Russian Government if problems arose over time. Mr. Shokin enclosed a draft exchange of letters between Russia and the EU, including all his proposals. In a statement at the end of the Council meeting, the foreign ministers said the Russian proposals "merit careful study," and called on the Commission to look into them with the intention of seeking a joint response from the Council. Ministers confirmed the "great importance" they attached to completing the Partnership Agreement negotiations.
