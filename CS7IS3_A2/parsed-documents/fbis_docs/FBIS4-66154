In an interview with our reporter, Edo Zitnik, Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle assessed the Slovene participation at this conference as follows: [Begin recording] [Peterle] First of all, I would like to express my satisfaction with the fact that Slovenia managed to win full-fledged status at this conference. I am happy that this conference developed in the direction of preventive diplomacy. [Zitnik] Will Slovenia be mentioned in the group of nine Central European states that are the potential candidates for future membership in the European Union in the conference document issued this afternoon? [Peterle] Slovenia will not be specifically mentioned in this group of states bearing in mind that this group primarily consists of the states that must resolve their minority issues or neighboring relations, which Slovenia does not have to do. This conference is not the institution at which it would be decided whether Slovenia will progress closer to the European Union or not. [Zitnik] One should nevertheless point out here that, for example, Poland and Czechia, which do not have minority problems, are also mentioned in this group? [Peterle] This is true. However, I do not see any danger for Slovenia drawing closer to the European Union in this fact. [Zitnik] Did Slovenia nevertheless tried to be included in this group of states before the conference? [Peterle] Slovenia proposed that it be mentioned, but later did not insist on it when it was given assurances that this mention does not have any special political connotations. [end recording]
