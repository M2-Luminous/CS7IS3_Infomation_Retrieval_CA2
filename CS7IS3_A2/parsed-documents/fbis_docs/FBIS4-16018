Filatov, head of the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation, conducted by an unidentified interviewer. Filatov answers three questions: on the proposed political accord, the alleged blacklist of former Supreme Soviet deputies, and the composition of the Constitutional Court. Filatov says that the people voted for a market economy and everyone agrees that there can be no going back; an agreement on political accord would ensure continuity of policies, to the benefit of all. Filatov says that the so-called blacklist contains the names of those Supreme Soviet deputies who remained in the White House and fomented disorder; they will not receive financial compensation for their loss of income; housing rights will be decided on an individual basis. Moving on to the question of the Constitutional Court, Filatov says: "I personally consider that the members of the Constitutional Court, as it was composed at the time, were considerably to blame for the harm which was caused to our state, ending with the dramatic events of last October. You may recall that the Constitutional Court was elected at the Congress of People's Deputies and it seems to me that, right from the start, the principle governing the nomination of the members of the Constitutional Court was incorrectly drawn up, because the nominations were to a considerable extent made by the political groupings, and the regions had very little representation on these questions. "Unfortunately, we got a Constitutional Court which to a considerable extent represented various political forces. Hence the latest instruction issued by Boris Nikolayevich, and the instruction that the Council for Personnel Policy should draw up recommendations on the list of those candidates for the Constitutional Court which it should put forward to the Federation Council for appointment. We have now examined this question at the Council for Personnel Policy. We have agreed that the main criterion which we will look at in each candidate is his political neutrality. So, the candidate should not be a politician, should not be the leader of a party, political grouping etc. He should be in the first place a professional at his job. "If the condition is observed that political neutrality and professionalism should be placed first, then there is no reason why the law on the Constitutional Court should not be adopted. I think that it is clear to everyone that such a law is now very much needed. It is particularly necessary now for the Third Estate, the third structure of power, to go into operation when work has begun on adopting the laws of the Russian Federation," Filatov concludes.
