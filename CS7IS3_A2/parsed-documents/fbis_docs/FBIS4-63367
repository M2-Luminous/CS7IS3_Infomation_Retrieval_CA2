"At present there are no international sanctions against the People's Democratic Republic of Korea. Therefore, Russia, as any other country, has the right to ship to North Korea purely defensive systems of armaments and spare parts to them on a commercial basis", a high-ranking government source told TASS on Monday. Pyongyang's foreign debt to Moscow, which remains from the time of the former Soviet Union, exceeds three billion US dollars and impedes commercial operations with North Korea, according to the source.
