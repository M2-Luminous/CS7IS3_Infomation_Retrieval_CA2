Israeli security force also did their bit by killing at least another 18 Palestinians and wounding many more when they fired into the crowds gathered at hospitals to donate blood and show support for their fellow countrymen. The U.S.-brokered agreement between the Zionists and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) for an autonomous Palestinian administration in Gaza and Jericho, is now christened in blood. The PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat issued a statement saying the massacre could have "very serious fallout... at all levels," and his organization declared a 3-day strike in Gaza in memory of the dead. 'Arafat is not the only party to blame for this massacre, nevertheless he must take the major share of responsibility for this tragedy because his cooperation with the Zionist entity and its American handlers gave some Palestinians the impression that the usurper Zionists could be trusted and that peace may be achieved simply by taking the Zionists and the Americans on face falue. Throughout their 45 years of occupying Palestine, the Israelis have claimed that their security agencies are the best in the world and have often criticized other countries' security systems. It would take a great deal of faith to believe that this massacre was purely a coincidence and the work of a "lone" crazed Jewish fanatic. Hopefully, later investigations will clarify questions regarding the slow response of the Zionists to this massacre, as well as the reason why nearly 20 more unarmed Palestinians were slaughtered by Israel's security officers. Israel is just buying time until its lobby in U.S. Congress can once again convince congressmen of Israel's strategic value to America. After the fall of Communism the American Israel Political Action Committee (AIPAC) lost some credibility among Americans. AIPAC's perennial argument that Israel, as the "only democracy in the region," and as a bastion of anti-Islamic ideology in Muslim Middle East is no longer valid due to the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the gradual realization by the U.S. that Islam can not be defeated by Israeli conspiracies and lies. It is for the people of Palestine to draw their own conclusions from this latest Zionist atrocity. But logic, common sense, and the past behavior of Zionists tell us that the Israelis, despite their peaceful utterances, have no desire for peace.
