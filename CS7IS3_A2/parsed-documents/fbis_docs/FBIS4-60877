For his part, leader of the Union of Communists Aleksey Prigarin called for next year's May Day celebrations to be held in a Soviet state. On last October's events, he said "the government neither wants nor is capable of leading the country out of crisis." He denied that the present regime had become stronger since. The regime is on the brink of an abyss and that is why it has started to talk about civil peace, Prigarin said. By contrast, he said, the opposition has built up its muscle though it is not strong enough yet to be able to lead most of the farmers, workers and intellectuals. The rally involved prominent opposition leaders such as chairwoman of the former Soviet Union's parliamentary leadership Sazhi Umalatova, Ilya Konstantinov of the National Salvation Front, Communist Party leaders Gennadiy Zyuganov and Anatoliy Lukyanov, leader of the Russian National Union Sergey Baburin and chairman of the Union of Communist Parties Oleg Shenin. As the marchers went along Leninskiy Prospect in southwestern Moscow, a man was spotted on the rooftop of an adjacent building throwing down anti-communist leaflets. Police have begun searches for the man while the marchers tore apart the leaflets describing the action as provocation, our corespondent reports from the scene. Earlier, similar leaflets were thrown down from the top of a building in Tverskaya Street during a demonstration arranged by the trade unions in Moscow. The demonstrators marching along Leninskiy Prospect stopped close to Gagarin Square, the scene of last year's violent clashes between police and protesters, to keep a minute's silence in memory of the victims. Red flags were lowered and several flowers laid on the roadside. Speaking over a loudspeaker, communist party leader Viktor Anpilov promised that "time will come when police will appear on city streets without truncheons or automatic guns, but this is impossible under the present regime." On his proposal, anti-Yeltsin slogans were chanted. One of the leaders of the Working Russia Movement Vladimir Gusev called on the demonstrators to take a vow to the fallen opposition members that "we will defend our Soviet state" and win the cause that "our friends have died for." Our correspondent says that none of the speakers mentioned that Vladimir Tolokneyev, member of riot police, was the only dead victim from last year's clashes. Leader of the National Salvation Front Ilya Konstantinov told our correspondent that although he mourned about all victims dying in violent clashes last May and October, "it must be realized that the opposition tried to defend itself." At the same time, he admitted that Tolokneyev's should have been mentioned.
