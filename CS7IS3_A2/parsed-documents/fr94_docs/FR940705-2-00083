FR940705-2-00083 FR940705-2-00061 Social Security Administration Rescission of Social Security Acquiescence Ruling 86&hyph;1(9)_Summy v. Schweiker, 688 F.2d 1233 (9th Cir. 1982) AGENCY: Social Security Administration, HHS. ACTION: Rescission of Social Security Acquiescence Ruling. SUMMARY: In accordance with 20 CFR 416.1485(e) and 422.406(b)(2), the Commissioner of Social Security gives notice of the rescission of Social Security Acquiescence Ruling 86&hyph;1(9). EFFECTIVE DATE: July 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Darlynda Bogle, Litigation Staff, Social Security Administration, 6401 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21235, (410) 965&hyph;4237. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A Social Security Acquiescence Ruling explains how we will apply a holding in a decision of a United States Court of Appeals that we determine conflicts with our interpretation of a provision of the Social Security Act or regulations when the Government has decided not to seek further review of the case or is unsuccessful on further review. As provided by 20 CFR 416.1485(e)(4), a Social Security Acquiescence Ruling may be rescinded as obsolete if we subsequently clarify, modify or revoke the regulation or ruling that was the subject of the circuit court holding for which the Acquiescence Ruling was issued. On January 23, 1986, we issued Acquiescence Ruling 86&hyph;1(9) to reflect the holding in Summy v. Schweiker , 688 F.2d 1233 (9th Cir. 1982), that an additional pension or compensation payment from the Veterans Administration (now the Department of Veterans Affairs) as a result of unreimbursed medical expenses is not income for Supplemental Security Income purposes. Concurrent with the rescission of this ruling, we are adding a new paragraph (a)(7) to section 416.1103 of Social Security Regulations No. 16 (20 CFR 416.1103), which provides that payments from the Department of Veterans Affairs resulting from unusual medical expenses are not income for Supplemental Security Income purposes. Because the change in the regulations adopts the court's holding Summy on a nationwide basis, we are rescinding the current Acquiescence Ruling.
