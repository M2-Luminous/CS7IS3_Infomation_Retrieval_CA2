"The army is still carrying out combing operations," said tribal leader Kisha (eds: one name) and cited an incident on April 12 when soldiers allegedly beat tribals indiscriminately in this frontier district bordering India. "This shows a lack of sincerity" on the part of the troops, Kisha added. A Bangladeshi army officer here confirmed that operations to flush out the outlawed guerrillas were continuing, but denied allegations that soldiers were using repressive measures to combat tribal insurgency here. "If we know that insurgents have taken position in a village, you do not expect us to sit tight," the army officer added. On ceasefire violations, the officer said: "We do not fire unless we are fired upon -- we maintain that strictly." He asserted that it was the rebels who violated the ceasefire frequently in three districts of Bangladesh's Chittagong hill tracts. Both Kisha and the officer, however, said insurgency-related violence in the sprawling tracts ebbed since the first ceasefire offered by the rebels became effective last year and was extended several times. Government troops have been fighting Shanti Bahini (Peace Brigade) Buddhist rebels in the frontier hill districts of Khagrachari, Rangamati and Bandarban for the past 19 years. The bush war has, by an official count, left more than 2,500 people dead, many of them killed in rebel ambushes and riots with Moslem settlers. The unofficial toll is widely believed to be much higher. The Bahini, which claims to have 3,000 guerrillas on its rolls, have allegedly set up bases in adjoining Tripura state in India where some 56,000 tribespeople, mostly from the Buddhist Chakma tribe, have taken shelter. The question of repatriation of the Chakmas to the tracts here remains embroiled in controversy with New Delhi demanding guarantees of safety for the homeless returnees. Bangladesh army sources said during the year-long ceasefire the Bahini rebels were responsible for 60 violations. The rebels say the soldiers broke the ceasefire 54 times since last May. "(Armed) activities have reduced a lot, but not zeroed... In recent days there has been no deaths in military-rebel engagements," the army officer said. This pictureseque valley-town, situated 1,300 feet (394 metres) above sea level, could have been a holiday resort. But the dragging insurgency has discourged western or local tourists from visiting the region. Security forces patrol the town as well as nearby villages. Troops with machineguns are positioned in secured towers atop hills here. Residents say life has become easier since the ceasefire, which is due to end on May 15, came into effect. "We still feel scared and people are careful not to be out of homes after evening," said Anup Chakma, a tribesman. Other residents agreed that the fragile ceasefire had given everyone a respite from the regular gunbattles and bloodletting in this remote zone of Bangladesh.
