A sudden stoppage of the middlemen's wholesale business may cause chaos in the distribution of agro-fishery goods and a sharp rise in their prices. About 2,000 middlemen held a rally at the Karak-tong Agro-Fishery Wholesale Market in Seoul to agree to stage a lawful labor struggle until the government rewrites the recently revised act concerning the distribution and price stabilization of agro-fishery goods. Under the newly revised act, which went into effect this past Sunday, the government has banned licensed middlemen at agro-fishery wholesale markets from carrying on the wholesale business. Middlemen are only allowed to act as intermediaries between city- designated wholesale companies which collect agro-fishery goods from producers and retailers or wholesalers. In the process, they receive a broker's commission on traded agro-fishery products. The current fee is 4 percent. In the past, however, middlemen acted a wholesalers and earned huge profits in the process of relaying agro-fishery goods from wholesale companies to actual retailers or wholesalers by charging more than a 4 percent commission on transacted goods. The middlemen's unlawful wholesale practice has played a major role in increasing the price of agro-fishery products. The wholesale business, however, has accounted for about 80 percent of the total transactions of goods at agro-fishery wholesale markets. There are about 11,000 licensed middlemen across the nation, including 1,500 at the Karak-tong wholesale market along with 69 city-registered wholesale companies which can collect agro-fishery goods from producers and list them on the wholesale markets for public auction. Agro-fishery products brought into the Karak wholesale market amounted to 6,675 tons yesterday, down 1,072 tons from the previous day but the wholesale prices of agro-fishery goods increased an average of 5 percent. To soothe the middlemen's growing protests of the revised act and a possible price surge of agro-fishery goods, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries yesterday decided to designate the month of May as a guidance period for middlemen before the implementation of the revised act. The ministry also said that it will assist in the establishment of retailers' cooperatives which can buy agro-fishery goods directly from the city-registered wholesale companies.
