He said: Introspection is a motivating force for social progress. In handling the Chientao Hu case, the government was not overly emotional and did not try to turn it into a political event. What the government wanted was to find out the truth and make the truth public. Huang Kun-hui, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, said: Communist China can reduce the damage done to cross-strait relations only by conducting a thoroughgoing investigation of the Chientao Hu tragedy. Lien Chan said: The government believes that there is nothing more important than human life and that we should not conduct investigations into the Chientao Hu case in a perfunctory way. A modern country should handle things in a modern way. Therefore, after the Chientao Hu tragedy occurred, the government issued a forceful statement urging Communist China to conduct a thoroughgoing investigation. During this period, outsiders expressed their general opinions as well as specific positions on this case. However, the government still maintains a careful, positive, and conscientious--not simply accusatory--attitude toward the incident. He said that, right from the very beginning, the government has maintained an extremely correct attitude. In response to the questions raised by people entertaining particular stands, he said: We cannot be ambiguous about this incident or shift our focus somewhere else. Shifting focus is a very serious matter which will affect the future of the country. Huang Kun-hui said: What we needed was to get the truth out. But Communist China tried to cover up the incident by embargoing news reports and fabricating information. They did not treat the victims' families in a reasonable way. All of these actions, of course, led to dissatisfaction on our part. As for the 1990 tragedy in which illegal mainland immigrants died of suffocation on a boat while being repatriated, direct responsibility did not lie with our side. However, we did conduct an investigation and we told the mainland of the occurrence of the incident on our own initiative. In addition, we did pay a reasonable amount of compensation. In order to prevent such an accident occurring again, we later signed a repatriation agreement with the Mainland on Chinmen Island. Meanwhile, Ku Chen-fu, chairman of the SEF, said on 22 April: If Communist China makes public the Chientao Hu tragedy as soon as possible without any cover-up, gives reasonable compensation to the victims' families, and provides reasonable explanations for the people of the whole country, then the communications between the two sides can be reopened. Ku Chen-fu said that it is necessary for all of us to judge whether or not the information revealed by Communist China is correct. Ku Chen-fu also urged Communist China not to [word indistinct] or procrastinate.
