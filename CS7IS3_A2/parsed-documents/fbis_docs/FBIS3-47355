They said the price of Japanese rice began to rise at the beginning of the year, with the popular "koshihikari" brand harvested in Niigata Prefecture hitting a high of about 34,000 yen per 60 kilograms as of Wednesday. Prices of other popular brands have risen 1,500-2,000 yen per 60 kilograms over the year-end levels, they said. Rice imported from the United States and Thailand is expected to hit the domestic market in March. The government has decided to import more than one million tons of foreign rice to make up for a shortage in supplies caused by 1993's poor harvest, the worst since the war. A private rice market research organization said retailers are scrambling for popular brands of domestic rice ahead of the introduction of foreign rice. The Agriculture Ministry, worried that the strong demand for domestic rice may disrupt the supply-demand balance, has instructed rice retailers to blend domestic rice with imports.
