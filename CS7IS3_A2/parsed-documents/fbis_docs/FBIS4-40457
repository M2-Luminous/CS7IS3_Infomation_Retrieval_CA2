Calls from some ministers to keep calm gave way to apocalyptic predictions by others. At times presentations turned into a bitter squabble. Meanwhile the premier, who had just returned from leave, appealed to his subordinates to put first the interests of Russia, not their departments. Government "back-benchers" -- apparatus officers -- tired by the stuffiness of an overcrowded room, did not particularly try to fight off an overpowering drowsiness. The reason for this situation, generally uncharacteristic of the Viktor Chernomyrdin cabinet, was the issue discussed at the session. Putting aside all other items on the agenda, the participants concentrated on summing up the results of the first half-year. Strictly speaking, there was no particular need for a report by First Deputy Economics Minister Yakov Urinson: Exactly a week ago the government examined the economic situation. However, having returned from his leave, the premier decided to familiarize himself with the situation. According to Urinson, the industrial recession has reached 26 percent in the first six months of this year, nearly halving compared to 1991. An analysis of the decline pattern done by the Economics Ministry for the first time is noteworthy. Ministry experts attributed 35 percent of this slump to cuts in military spending; another 15 percent, to cuts in budget investments; 10 percent is linked to falling demand for oil in the CIS countries (caused by high prices), and 10 percent is due to declining effective demand among the Russian population. The remaining 30 percent has been caused "by the effects of market mechanisms, poor adaptability among enterprise managers, and the breakdown of economic links." The gist of the conclusions made by ministry experts is this: A basically new economic situation has emerged in Russia. Its signs include the weakening of nonmarket factors and the effects of demand constraints, which has brought about a sales crisis. Urinson stopped short of calling this state depression. There is no particular point in recounting the content of subsequent reports by sector ministers: a standard (with rare exceptions) set of excuses and a minimum of sensible propositions. Viktor Chernomyrdin's reaction to these presentations surprised even the veterans of the government apparatus. One of them recalled Aleksey Kosygin, usually a very discreet premier in the USSR Government, who yelled at his subordinates only once: When he lost patience with immoderate sectoral claims by then ministers and their total disregard for state interests. Viktor Chernomyrdin yesterday chose a similar vocabulary and tonality. "We shall not give anything to anyone for free"; "ministries must reflect the interests of the entire state, not just of their own enterprises"; and "we will not be bossed around by anybody" are quite happy expressions of gratitude to the president for his determination "not to ditch Chernomyrdin." The premier also reacted to the president's criticism of the government's performance. "Well, enough is enough; we shall not put up with this any more" and "I shall have enough political will for everything" -- these words are apparently to be one of the last warnings to the sluggish intermediary government level. True, weekly public sermons to subordinates have now been practiced for more than a month. Commentary The draft presidential edict "On Amendments to the Russian Federation President's 23 May 1994 Edict No. 1004 On Certain Questions of Tax Policy", moved by the Russian Social Insurance Fund for government consideration, was taken off the agenda at the very beginning of the session. The draft envisioned revoking instructions to the government to submit to the State Duma a draft law on reducing the rate of payments to the social insurance fund to 3.6 percent from 5.4 percent. Apparently, serious substantiation will be needed to encourage the president to cancel one of his proposals to alleviate the tax burden. So far the fund's case boils down to a shortage of funds: Revenues in the second half will fall by 2 trillion rubles, as a result of which the fund will not have enough money to pay even the benefits stipulated by the law. True, temporary disability allowances, for example, are paid out of the fund's money held in enterprise accounts. If the fund's figures are correct, this will primarily affect the poor, who get their benefits through social security bodies, which is promises an aggravation of social tension. The fact that the draft edict was taken off the agenda does not mean anything: Even if the government insists on reducing the rate, the same can hardly be expected from the State Duma. Meanwhile, unless the Duma remembers, in the very near future, about the need to establish a new rate for contributions to nonbudget funds (or extend the old one), beginning with 1 July they may not be paid at all. Main macroeconomic indicators in the first half of 1994 Gross domestic product in current prices will total 248 trillion rubles. At constant prices GDP will fall by 18 percent compared to the same period last year. The volume of industrial output will decline by 26 percent compared to the first half of 1993. Exports will grow by 3.6 percent, reaching $20 billion. Imports will grow by 18 percent to approximately $15 billion. The balance of trade will be $5 billion (a fall of 24 percent). The exhange rate of the national currency will fall by 60 percent compared to December 1993, exceeding 2,000 rubles per $1. The purchasing power of the ruble, compared to the dollar, will increase by 18 percent. Real estimated monetary incomes will grow by 14 percent. The number of officially registered unemployed is estimated at 1.4 million, which is 0.6 million people more than at the beginning of the year.
