According to incomplete statistics from some provinces and cities throughout the nation as of the end of 1993, during the year at least 9,440 new shareholding system enterprises were added, of which 2,968 were limited stock companies, 6,472 were limited liability companies, and 1,776 were internally held stock companies. The cumulative total of shareholding system enterprises throughout the nation reached as high as 13,000. Total capital stocks were 208.632 billion yuan and, as of 31 December, there were 122 shareholding companies on the market. Throughout the nation there were 51 securities registering organizations and as many as 25 million stockholders. In 1993 there were a total of 174 types of A stocks from surface and in-depth brokers on the market, a 235 percent increase over 1992. There were a total of 41 types of B stocks from the two types of stock brokers, a 128 percent increase over 1992. Compared to the same point in 1992 (31 December), the total 1993 market value (for A and B stocks) increased by 308 percent; the volume of transactions increased by 572 percent; and the amount of transactions increased by 552 percent. In 1993 there were a total of 17 types of legal person stocks on the market, a 467 percent increase over 1992. At the same point in time (31 December), according to the calculation of comparable specifications, in 1993 the volume of legal person stock transactions increased by 186 percent and the amount of the transactions increased by 140 percent over 1992. In addition, last year China also added the legal person stock circulating market, NET system. ---Expanded Scope. The shareholding system enterprise model has rapidly expanded to all trades and professions, from industry to commerce, villages, cultural organizations, athletic departments, and schools all have actively initiated shareholding system experiments. A number of privately owned and collective enterprises in the area of new and advanced technology also discarded their former model of ownership and shifted to shareholding system enterprises. Numerous newly established enterprises and newly established projects (such as the Three Gorges Project) conscientiously use the shareholding system function to help to rapidly raise funds and clearly define property rights. ---Going on external markets, winning the initial victory. In 1993 nine large national enterprises were designated as the first batch to go on external markets. By the end of the year, six enterprises already had accomplished this task. In the short period of six months, six large and medium-sized national enterprises on external markets had as much as HK$272.8 billion in frozen external funds (not including globally raised amounts), 72.6 times the funds raised in the plan. In addition, the people-run enterprise, Sitong Group, also raised 180 million in Hong Kong. The merger clearly was successful. ---Progress in the legal framework is gratifying. At the beginning of last year, the State Council promulgated the Notice on Further Strengthening Macroeconomic Controls on Securities Markets, establishing the keynote for this year's national regulation of the securities market. In April the State Council issued the Provisional Regulations on Administering the Issuing and Trading of Stocks to provide China's shareholding operations with an embryonic framework. Subsequently, rules and regulations for such things as disclosing information, establishing a securities exchange, and guarding against securities fraud were implemented one after the other. The most gratifying was that at the end of the year the first major national law, the Company Law of the People's Republic of China, was passed by the Fifth Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress and was formally promulgated. The legal framework of the Chinese stock system is gradually entering the "three dimensional" stage. ---The interior and remote border province regions are no longer silent. Such "developing provinces and regions" as Shanxi, Nei Mongol, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Tibet, unwilling to be left behind, are actively engaging in experiments with the shareholding system. Especially Tibet ended the historical gap in experimenting with the shareholding system and in a standard and reliable way developed four shareholding system enterprises, and Lhasa opened a securities exchange business department. In addition, such places as Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, and Shanxi successfully issued stocks to society. ---Remarkable performance convinces people. (1) Enterprise economic performance: Thirty Shanghai companies comparably strong on the market realized an average 128 percent increase in profits from January through June 1993. These indices far exceeded other types of enterprises. (2) State asset performance. Stock-issuing premium coefficients were higher than state asset appraised reinvestment coefficients. For example, after the state assets of 10 Shanghai enterprises were appraised, the rate of increased value rose by 56.98 percent and the rate of new assets put into production increased by 10.52 percent. It is obvious that in the reform of the shareholding system the rights and interests of state assets were fully guaranteed. (3) Stockholder performance: In the first half of 1993, the rate of repayment to stockholders of the first 30 companies on the market was generally between 30 percent and 101 percent. The majority of the outstanding repayment companies on the market were concentrated in Shenzhen, 76.7 percent. ----Stock issuance went safely and smoothly. In 1993 for the first time in Chinese history, large-scale public stock solicitation activities were carried out in various places throughout the country. For this the State Council Securities Commission issued "1993 Stock Sales and Subscription Suggestions" and one after the other various places established "stock issuing headquarters," resolutely implemented the "three public" principle, and adopted the pattern of unlimited sale subscription certificates and savings account quota sale certificates. Throughout the year, stock issuing went safely and smoothly. That is, there was nothing like the "August 10" incident and excessively large first and second class market profit differentials were curbed. ---Severely punish illegal activities and clean up the stock market environment. The Chinese government and securities control department have resolutely attacked such illegal activities as using stocks for private gain, black market trading, behind the scenes trading, leaking of information, corruption and accepting bribes, unlawful bond trading, and disturbing the stock market. For example, relevant departments have strongly and swiftly dealt fairly and seriously with such cases as the case of the president of the savings bank in Zibo city diverting 1.7457 million yuan in public funds to speculate on stocks; the case of the Guangzhou bond trader swindling customers; the case of a certain seventeen-year-old Shanghai youth cheating on securities; and false stocks and false purchasing certificates appearing everywhere. The cleaning up of the stock market environment has won the acclaim of the vast number of stockholders.
