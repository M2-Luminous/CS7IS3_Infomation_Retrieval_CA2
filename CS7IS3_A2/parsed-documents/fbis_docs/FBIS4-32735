The new government, which took power in mid-March after a vote of no-confidence toppled former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, has made attracting foreign investment one of its main goals. Success here could mean success at the polls and, ultimately, success for Slovakia's ailing economy. "The long-term goal is to bring our factories up to world standards, to make our products more acceptable," said Fred Nicholson, adviser to Slovakia's privatization minister. "And without foreign investment, it would be very hard to get our economy going." Leaders admit that they can only begin the economic turnaround process before facing the possibility of being voted out of office in the fall. But they hope that they can make some permanent changes in the country's economic profile. Spearheading a worldwide whistle-stop campaign by Slovak politicians, Prime Minister Josef Moravcik told the National Council of French Employers in Paris last week that his country was safe territory for Western investors. Moravcik's economics minister, Peter Magvasi, traveled with him and put out the word that more than half of the Slovak companies to be privatized in the next round are earmarked for foreign investors. On the same day, Slovak President Michal Kovac praised his country's 1993 economic results to an Austrian business group in Vienna and promised investors substantial tax breaks. At the end of May, he will make the same pitch in Switzerland, but there he will add "more concrete details" about how investors can get involved, said presidential spokeswoman Anna Turenicova. In June, Kovac will cross the Atlantic with a message for American business. Slovakia has long been the orphan child of the Visegrad nations. Of the $8.8 billion in foreign direct investment received by Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia since 1989, only $366 million--or 4 percent of the total--has found its way to Bratislava. The country offers the cheapest labor force in the region, but its political instability and the Meciar government's hostile attitude toward privatization has scared off many would-be business partners. Roughly 300 enterprises worth 220 billion SK ($7.7 billion) will be privatized in the next round, privatization adviser Nicholson said. About 80 billion SK ($2.8 billion) worth of shares have been set aside for coupon privatization, and the remainder will be for sale. "Foreigners are more than welcome," Nicholson said. Nearly three-quarters of the companies being considered are heavy industrial concerns, such as steel mills, chemical plants, rubber manufacturers and the entire Slovak electric company. Nicholson said sales could begin as early as June. Only about 15 percent of the Slovak economy is currently in private hands, and Nicholson said the goal is to unload 60 percent by the end of this round. The Slovak National Agency for Foreign Investment and Development, an investor liaison organization, is blanketing embassies and governments around the world with promotional materials. Politicians are drafting laws to eliminate double taxation and offer extensive tax breaks. Legislation protecting investments already has been prepared and should be debated in parliament's next session. Brigita Schmognerova, deputy prime minister for economic affairs, currently is in the process of trying to streamline the bureaucracy by cutting back on the number of hoops investors must jump through and by locating all the responsible people in a single office. "We're trying to make it easier," she confirmed. Schmognerova said the strategy also includes landing the support of international financial institutions, such as the International Finance Corp. and the International Monetary Fund. Slovakia and the IMF are in the final stages of negotiating a "standby loan," an expression of the fund's confidence in the country's economy. Schmognerova has also been lobbying business people from other countries, inviting them to visit before the elections. The government's aggressive methods are already showing some success. A mission from the American Overseas Private Investment Corp. will arrive in mid-June, and another American delegation is expected in July, Schmognerova said. The number of tenders from abroad for Slovak companies has risen considerably over the last two months, according to several privatization and economics officials. And Nicholson said he receives five or six inquiries from foreign investors every day. "The ministry is trying to come forward to these people, which didn't happen before," he said. "The word is out that we want to do this." Nicholson said he estimates that nearly half of the inquiries have come from Americans. Sweden, Germany and Austria have also figured prominently, and Nicholson said he expects more interest from the French after Moravcik's visit. But financial consultants say that while the changes are encouraging, most investors are moving with caution. "The presence of the elections really means everyone is adopting a wait-and-see attitude," said Geoff Upton, a partner at Price Waterhouse in Prague. "If [the new government's] campaign requires specific investments before the elections, they may be disappointed." Schmognerova said she and her colleagues feel that the work they are doing now will pay off, with or without a victory at the polls. "We really do have a long-term interest in developing the country," she said. "Even if [the current government falls in September], some of the investors will decide to come anyway."
