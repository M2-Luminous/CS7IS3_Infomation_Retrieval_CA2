Forgotten, the acrimonious exchanges between Greek European Affairs Minister Theodore Pangalos and his French and German counterparts. Alain Juppe, whose comment on the return of PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] to power had been a scathing "how people forget!," came to Athens on Thursday [3 February] to celebrate the high mass of European solidarity. "Full French support to the Greek presidency": The French foreign minister did not fail to embrace the soothing European discourse. Just like German Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Helmut Schaefer, who came a few days earlier to insist that there was not "the shadow of a cloud" between his country and Greece. Invectives against Germany seen as "a country with brutish power and the brains of a child" were seemingly just as faraway as their author, troublemaker Pangalos, gone to Africa... Since 1 January the Greek Government has done all it could to be accorded its good behavior credentials. Over and done with, the dream -- openly flaunted by Greek officials until the end of December -- of replacing the embargo against their Serb ally with one against the Bosnians, should they refuse to compromise at the peace table. Theodore Pangalos will only repeat that "the use of violence must stop" in the former Yugoslavia. He hardly even questions any more the principle of air strikes, which he judges would be fruitless and ineffective. "As the Americans and the French found out in Indochina!," he taunted on Thursday. Consigned to oblivion -- for the duration of the presidency? -- Athens' rhetorics on the Republic of Skopje's resolve to call itself Macedonia. Athens seems to have sized up the decision of six of its European partners to establish diplomatic relations with the former Yugoslav republic in December. Since early January, the Greek Government has shown some eagerness to have its presidency taken seriously and to complete by 1 March the Union enlargement process as regards four countries: Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway. While it seems unlikely that the four rounds of talks can be completed in time for these countries to sign the Union treaty in early 1995, as scheduled, Greece appears determined to advance the process as much as it can. To this end, it has called two meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers for 21-22 and 25-26 February in Brussels. Athens clearly expects to benefit should one or several of these countries successfully complete the fast-track membership process, but this would also afford it an opportunity to push for the admission of a candidate particularly dear to its heart: Cyprus.
