FR941107-1-00053 FR941107-1-00011 7. The rules will apply to the management area (the EEZ off the west coast of Florida and off the south side of the Florida Keys). 8. NMFS agrees that its staff will prepare the proposed (and final) Federal rule. The Council agrees that its staff, with assistance by the staffs of FMFC and NMFS, will prepare the environmental assessment, regulatory impact review, and/or other documents required in support of the rule. The Council believes that using a regulatory amendment procedure under the protocol would provide more flexible, responsive, and cost-effective management of the stone crab fishery. The following rules or regulatory changes could be implemented under the protocol: Limiting the number of traps that may be fished by each vessel; the construction characteristics of traps; gear and vessel identification requirements; gear that may be used or prohibited in a directed fishery; bycatch levels in non-directed fisheries; seasons; soak/removal periods and requirements for traps; use, possession and handling of stone crabs aboard vessels; and minimum legal sizes. Concomitant with the proposed regulatory amendment procedure, Amendment 5 proposes to add to the objectives of the FMP the following: ``Provide for a more flexible management system that minimizes regulatory delay to assure more effective, cooperative state and federal management of the fishery.'' These additional measures in Amendment 5 do not require implementing regulations. Additional background and rationale for the measures discussed above are contained in Amendment 5, the availability of which was announced in the Federal Register on September 30, 1994 (59 FR 49908). Additional Measures Proposed by NMFS In a significant number of sections, the stone crab regulations do not conform to current standards applicable to other federally managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico and off the southern Atlantic states. Accordingly, NMFS proposes to revise the entire part 654. The substantive changes proposed by NMFS are discussed below. The purpose and scope section, §654.1, would be revised to clarify the geographical scope of the regulations. In §654.2, unused definitions would be removed and the address of the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, would be corrected. The vessel and gear identification requirements, currently in §654.4, are essentially identical to Florida's requirements. Since all required identification markings would be issued by Florida, separate Federal vessel and gear identification requirements would no longer be necessary. Accordingly, this rule would refer to pertinent rules of Florida for such requirements. In §654.7, the prohibitions would be restated and prohibitions would be added: (1) On using fishing gear in a manner to obstruct fishing or damage vessels and gear; (2) on making a false statement to an authorized officer; and (3) regarding interference with an investigation, search, seizure, or disposition of seized property in connection with enforcement of the Magnuson Act. For uniformity and clarity, NMFS proposes to restate the seasonal trawl closures in the area off the southwestern coast of Florida and in the shrimp/stone crab separation zones in terms of ``trawling.'' Currently the regulations at §654.23 state these closures in terms of ``trawl gear'' and ``fish(ing) for shrimp.'' For the southwestern Florida closure, the change in terminology is not substantive. For the shrimp/stone crab separation zones, the change would ease a restriction, in that fishing for shrimp by traps would not be prohibited in the zones/times in which fishing for shrimp is currently prohibited. In terms of gear separation, which is the purpose of the shrimp/stone crab separation zones, fixed gear and trawling would continue to be separated. In addition, the description of the area of the southwestern Florida seasonal trawl closure, and its depiction currently in figure 1, would be clarified to describe and show only the area that is in the EEZ.
