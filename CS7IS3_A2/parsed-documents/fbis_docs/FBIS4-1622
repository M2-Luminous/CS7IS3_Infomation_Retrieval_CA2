And it lays down grades for regular checks on their performance which may lead to promotion, demotion or the sack. The code, titled "Provisional Regulations on Appraisal of State Civil Servants," aims to improve the performance of State employees. Appraisals will include day-to-day evaluations and an annual examination and they will rank civil servants in three glades -- excellent, qualified and unqualified -- according their integrity, ability, dedication and service record. The new code says no more than 15 percent of civil servants should receive "excellent" rankings. Appraisal committees are to be composed of department heads and staff representatives elected by workers. Employees must comprise at least a third of the selection group. "Excellent" workers get cash rewards equivalent to one or two months extra pay, while "qualified" ones get an extra month's salary. Those who receive the top two grades for two consecutive years will be promoted. Those deemed unqualified get demoted in their first year and dismissed if they are found to be unproductive a second year. Since the civil service was set up October 1 last year, more than 40 ministries have trained workers or organized courses to publicize the system. Several provinces, including Hainan, Guangdong, Shangdong, Anhui and Jilin, have taken steps to set up the new civil service. The Ministry of Coal, which was set up in the first half of last year, has shed about 900 -- 75 percent -- of its workers. Provincial governments are focusing their attention on solving problems arising from the implementation of the new system.
