FR940922-1-00027 FR940922-1-00008 (2) Subject to certain very limited exceptions, all vehicles sold, imported, delivered, purchased, leased, rented, acquired, received, or registered in the OTR that would be subject to the OTC LEV program would have to be certified pursuant to a California Air Resources Board (CARB) Executive Order; (3) The OTC LEV program would allow the sale of the five categories of California vehicles: California Tier I, TLEV, LEV, ULEV, and ZEV; (4) Manufacturers could choose any combination of California certified vehicles to meet the following average NMOG fleet emission standards: 1999_0.113 g/mi 2000_0.073 g/mi 2001_0.070 g/mi 2002_0.068 g/mi 2003 and later_0.062 g/mi Regarding California's ZEV sales mandate, the OTC recommends that, to the extent it must apply to satisfy section 177, it shall apply. But if it is not required under section 177, the OTC recommends that the ``individual states within the OTC may at their option include such a requirement and/or economic incentives designed to increase the sales of ZEVs in the programs they adopt.'' (5) The effective date for the OTC LEV program would be January 1, 1996, allowing two vehicle model years prior to applicability of the standards in 1999, but would not preclude earlier state implementation. D. EPA Actions in Response to the OTC LEV Recommendation On March 18, 1994, EPA published a notice announcing receipt of the OTC's recommendation, as required by in section 184(c)(1). See 59 FR 12914. This notice explained EPA's process for responding to the recommendation, identified the major elements of the recommendation, and briefly explained EPA's intended approach at that time for analyzing the issues. On April 8, 1994, EPA announced that the public hearing as required by section 184(c)(1) would be held in Hartford, Connecticut on May 2&hyph;3, 1994. See 59 FR 16811. On April 26, 1994, EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on the OTC recommendation. 59 FR at 21720. This notice described the framework for EPA's action on the recommendation and provided substantial detail regarding the issues EPA was considering in deciding whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove the recommendation. The NPRM described in detail the background and context of the OTC's recommendation, as well as the legislative history of section 184. The text of the OTC's recommendation was reprinted as an appendix to the NPRM. It also addressed the applicability of rulemaking procedures for EPA's action on the recommendation. Thereafter, the notice addressed the standards applicable to EPA's review of the recommendation, including both the ``necessary'' and ``consistent with the Act'' criteria. Regarding necessity, the NPRM addressed the legal interpretation of this standard, the magnitude of emissions reductions needed for attainment in the OTR, the focus on contribution of emissions from across the OTR, and the timing of the necessary reductions, including the relevance of maintenance after attainment. The NPRM also explained the OTC's recommended LEV program in detail, EPA modeling of the emissions benefits from this program, and the auto manufacturers' FLEV alternative. The NPRM then explained EPA's approach to considering other alternatives to the OTC LEV program. Regarding consistency of the OTC LEV recommendation with the Act, EPA addressed issues common to pending litigation in New York and Massachusetts as well as other issues regarding consistency of the OTC LEV recommendation with section 177 of the Act. Overall, EPA proposed, in the alternative, to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove the OTC's recommendation. The NPRM provided that the public comment period would remain open until June 3, 1994, thirty days following the public hearing. To provide a further opportunity for interactive discussion of the issues among the various interested parties, members of the public, and EPA, the Agency held an additional series of three public ``roundtable'' meetings in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Durham, New Hampshire, and New York City. The agenda for these meetings was structured to generally follow the framework for analysis described in the NPRM. EPA published a notice on June 2, 1994, providing the time, place, and agenda for each meeting. See 59 FR 28520. The primary topics discussed at the first meeting in Philadelphia were the proper interpretation of the ``necessity'' standard, and the OTC LEV program itself. The topics addressed at the second meeting in Durham included the magnitude of reductions needed in the OTR, alternatives to the OTC LEV program, and a proposal from the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) for emissions trading. At the third meeting in New York City, the discussion continued regarding alternative approaches to achieving the necessary emissions reductions, including the automakers' FLEV proposal, and a proposal from Texaco, Merck, and Public Service Electric & Gas Co. to establish a cap on NO X emissions together with trading. At the New York City roundtable meeting, EPA re-opened the public comment period on the NPRM until July 30, 1994, to allow interested parties to submit additional information in response to issues raised in the roundtable meetings. See 59 FR 35292. On August 4, 1994, EPA formally created a subcommittee of the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. App. The subcommittee will focus on issues related to the OTC petition and provide a public forum to pursue discussion of alternative car standards that could apply in 49 states. The first substantive meeting of the subcommittee will take place in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, September 13 and Wednesday, September 14, 1994 at the Ramada Plaza Hotel. EPA published a notice of these meetings on August 30, 1994. See 59 FR 44729. II. Explanation of Proposed Action EPA is proposing today to approve the OTC's LEV recommendation based on the determination under sections 184(c) and 110(k) of the Act that the recommended LEV or a LEV-equivalent program 2 is necessary throughout the OTR and that the recommended LEV program is otherwise consistent with the Act. EPA is proposing to find under its SIP call authority in section 110(k)(5) 3 that the SIP for each state in the OTR is substantially inadequate to meet the requirements relating to pollution transport in section 110(a)(2)(D). 4 EPA is thus proposing to require each state in the OTR to revise its SIP to include the LEV program within one year after the section 110(k)(5) finding is finally issued. EPA is proposing that the SIP call allow individual OTR states to give manufacturers the choice of complying with either the OTC LEV requirements or_if such a program is developed_a voluntary new-vehicle program to which automakers could voluntarily opt-in that achieves equivalent or greater emissions reductions that are fully enforceable and qualifies for SIP credits. 5 2 A ``LEV-equivalent program'' is an alternative voluntary federal program that would achieve emission reductions from new motor vehicles in the OTR equivalent to or greater than would be achieved by the OTC LEV program. 3 Section 110(k)(5) authorizes the Administrator, whenever she finds that a SIP for an area is substantially inadequate to mitigate adequately the interstate pollutant transport described in section 176A or 184, or to otherwise comply with any requirement of the Act, to require the State to revise the SIP as ``necessary'' to correct the deficiency. 4 Section 110(a)(2)(D) requires that SIPs contain adequate provisions to prevent emissions within the state that contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other state. 5 EPA does not ordinarily undertake rulemaking to issue a SIP call. EPA usually issues SIP calls by letter containing a finding of substantial inadequacy. The basis for the SIP call and finding would then be the subject of notice-and-comment rulemaking before the imposition of any sanctions warranted in response to state failure to respond to the SIP call. Here, EPA is choosing instead to undertake notice-and-comment rulemaking regarding the basis of the SIP call before issuing it. EPA is also proposing that states in the OTR be allowed, but not required, to adopt the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) sales requirement. The OTC recommended that EPA require states to adopt the ZEV sales requirement only if it is a necessary component of a LEV program under section 177. EPA is proposing today that a ZEV sales requirement is not a required component of a LEV program adopted under section 177 and that states would therefore not be obligated to adopt it. However, states have the discretion to include a ZEV sales requirement. States may also include economic incentives designed to increase the sales of ZEVs as long as such incentives are consistent with sections 177 and 209 of the Act. EPA is also taking comment on whether to adopt a ``ZEV equivalency approach'' to require states either to impose ZEV mandates or to impose other requirements on new motor vehicles that achieve the evaporative NMOG and NO X benefits associated with ZEVs. Finally, EPA is proposing regulations to determine the term ``model year'' for purposes of section 177 and part A of title II of the Act, as that term applies to motor vehicles. The proposed regulations provide that model year will apply on a model-by-model basis. This regulatory action codifies long-standing EPA guidance on this definition and should clarify the applicability of the two-year lead-time requirement in section 177. III.
