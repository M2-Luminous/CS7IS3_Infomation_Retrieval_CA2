This was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the department of information and press of the Russian Foreign Ministry. A few days ago the UN Security Council, he noted, adopted a decision on sending multinational forces to Rwanda. The core of these forces would be made up of a contingent of French troops. It is proposed that the French contingent will number about 2,000 men. All the expenses connected with carrying out this operation will be borne by the relevant countries. Russia supported this UN Security Council resolution, considering that this decision is an enforced step but an essential one in the present circumstances. Here, we proceeded from the position that the human tragedy in Rwanda, which is unprecedented in its scale, and the continuing extermination of the civilian population of this long-suffering country dictates the necessity of adopting urgent and commensurate measures capable of halting further bloodshed in Rwanda. Moreover, we have taken account of the fact that the full deployment of additional UN forces will need quite a long period of time," Karasin said.
