Adoption of such a law was initiated on Wednesday by Chairman of the State Duma's Committee on Legislation and Judicial Reform, Vladimir Isakov. Zatulin said the majority of State Duma deputies supported the idea. He announced that all participants in the hearings agreed that given the present situation of "civil discord" the NATO program should not be joined in a hurry. "Deputies were dissatisfied with the fact that the program did not provide for a special status for Russia and that the NATO members had taken a tough stand saying that Russia did not differ from any other participant in the program," Zatulin stressed. Zatulin was certain that the CIS states must work out a single position on joining to the NATO program. He expected that the CIS summit planned for April 15 would discuss the issue. Zatulin said the CIS states must work out a new defense doctrine taking into consideration that all the relics of the Cold War must disappear, referring not only to the Warsaw Pact but also NATO.
