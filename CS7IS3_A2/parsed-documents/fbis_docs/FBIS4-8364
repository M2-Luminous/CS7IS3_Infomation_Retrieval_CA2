FBIS4-8364 "dreeu071_k_94004" FBIS-EEU-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 CROATIA Croat Negotiator Comments Croat Negotiator Comments LD1204192694 Zagreb HTV Television in Serbo-Croatian 1730 GMT 12 Apr 94 LD1204192694 Zagreb HTV Television Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] A meeting between a delegation of the Republic of Croatia and a delegation of the Serbs living in the UN-protected areas should have been held in Zagreb today. The meeting had been agreed upon in principle back on 29 March when the cease-fire agreement was signed. The new meeting should have been devoted to the normalization of the situation in the sphere of economy. Despite an intervention by the mediators of the Zagreb negotiations, the Serb delegation did not come to the meeting today, probably because of the confusing situation prevailing in those areas, particularly now that they are constituting their new leadership. This was stated by Hrvoje Sarinic, head of the Croatian delegation to negotiations with the local Serbs. He added: I would like to recall that the cease-fire agreement is only a part of a project of normalization of overall relations throughout the Republic of Croatia, not a sort of a settlement between the Republic of Croatia and the UN-protected areas. Further negotiations will refer to economic issues and the final political solution within the internationally recognized borders of the Republic of Croatia. It is under these conditions and with the guarantees by the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations that we agreed to hold Zagreb negotiations and sign the agreement itself. The Republic of Croatia is, as it has always been, interested in the resumption of negotiations leading to the complete normalization of relations and we are expressing our readiness that these negotiations could continue anywhere on the territory of the Republic of Croatia.
