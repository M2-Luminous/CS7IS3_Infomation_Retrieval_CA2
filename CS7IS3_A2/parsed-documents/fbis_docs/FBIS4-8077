A statement from the command, forwarded to TANJUG from the Srpska republic president's office stresses that: The attacks on the Serbs were carried out in order to prevent the realization of the Serb proposal on a complete and lasting cessation of hostilities. Noting that the Serb side was determined to persist in its commitment to an immediate and lasting peace, but also to the energetic defense of the Srpska republic and Serb national interests, the supreme command stresses that the Serbs will not be frightened and that they will keep the right to self-defense with all available weapons. The text of the statement by the supreme command of the armed forces of the Bosnian Srpska republic reads: 1. The supreme command of the Srpska republic armed forces lodges a sharp protest with the United Nations over the bombing of Serb territory. It is not true that UNPROFOR personnel were in danger, and there is no justification for the use of NATO's air force. By doing this, the United Nations has sided against the Serbs in this civil war. Further cooperation of the Srpska republic with UNPROFOR has been brought into question, and all contacts between the Srpska republic and UNPROFOR are now suspended. 2. The supreme command of the Bosnian Srpska republic's armed forces is informing the international public about the Serb proposal for a complete and lasting cessation of hostilities. This proposal was not accepted by the Muslim side and was not supported by UNPROFOR. By protecting the Muslim offensive from defeat, the United Nations is prolonging the war and suffering. The attack on the Serbs was carried out in order to prevent the realization of the Serb proposal on a complete and lasting cessation of hostilities. 3. The peace process has been put in jeopardy and the UN bears the responsibility for it. The Serb side is determined to persist in its commitment to an immediate and lasting peace, and to the energetic defense of the Serb republic and Serb national interests. 4. The soldiers of the Srpska republic are forced to choose between being killed or responding to the offensive. Politically motivated elements in NATO and the United Nations are encouraging Muslim attacks against Serbs in order to take the Serb response as a cause for military intervention. The Serbs will not be frightened, and they will keep the right to self-defense with all available weapons. This is said in the statement by the supreme command of the armed forces of the Srpska republic.
