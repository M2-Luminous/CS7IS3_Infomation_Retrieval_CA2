He named one assembly member, who was sentenced in London, but is still a member of the assembly. He also mentioned apprehending drugs valued at 20 million rupees belonging to a very important person in Karachi. If the Narcotics Board first removes its own corrupt employees, it could be successful in its mission of catching the `big fish' with government cooperation. What is necessary is to form a solid plan and then ask for cooperation from all those countries that have made remarkable progress in controlling this evil.
