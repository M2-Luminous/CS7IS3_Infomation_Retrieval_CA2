FR940216-0-00252 FR940216-0-00010 (ii) If baseline values are determined first on a non-oxygenated basis, the calculations in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii) (A) through (C) of this section shall be performed to determine the value of each baseline parameter on an oxygenated basis. (A) Benzene, aromatic, olefin and sulfur content shall be determined on an oxygenated basis according to the following equation: AV=UV × (100^OV) where AV=oxygenated parameter value UV=no-oxygenated parameter value OV=1990 oxygenate volume as a percent of total production (B) Reid vapor pressure (RVP) shall be determined on an oxygenated basis according to the following equation: E:GRAPHICSER16FE94.019 where BR=oxygenated RVP UR=non-oxygenated RVP i=type of oxygenate n=total number of different types of oxygenates OV i =1990 volume, as a percent of total production, of oxygenate i OR i =blending RVP of oxygenate i (C) Test data and engineering judgement shall be used to estimate T90, T50, E300 and E200 baseline values on an oxygenated basis. Allowances shall be made for physical dilution and distillation effects only, and not for refinery operational changes, e.g., decreased reformer severity required due to the octane value of oxygenate which would reduce aromatics. (5) Work-in-progress. A refiner may, upon petition and approval (per §80.93), be allowed to account for work- in-progress at one or more of its refineries in 1990 in the determination of that refinery's baseline fuel parameters using Method 1, 2 or 3-type data if it meets the requirements specified in this paragraph (e)(5). (i) Work-in-progress shall include: (A) Refinery modification projects involving gasoline blendstock or distillate producing units which were under construction in 1990; or (B) Refinery modification projects involving gasoline blendstock or distillate producing units which were contracted for prior to or in 1990 such that the refiner was committed to purchasing materials and constructing the project. (ii) The modifications discussed in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section must have been initiated with intent of complying with a legislative or regulatory environmental requirement enacted or promulgated prior to January 1, 1991. (iii) When comparing emissions or parameter values determined with and without the anticipated work-in-progress adjustment, at least one of the following situations results when comparing annual average baseline values per §80.90: (A) A 2.5 percent or greater difference in exhaust benzene emissions (per §80.90); or (B) A 2.5 percent or greater difference in total exhaust toxics emissions (per §80.90(d)); or (C) A 2.5 percent or greater difference in NO X emissions (per §80.90(e)); or (D) A 10.0 percent or greater difference in sulfur values; or (E) A 10.0 percent or greater difference in olefin values; or (F) A 10.0 percent or greater difference in T90 values. (iv) The requirements of paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section shall be determined according to the following equation: E:GRAPHICSER16FE94.020 (v) The capital involved in the work-in-progress is at least: (A) 10.0 percent of the refinery's depreciated book value as of the work-in-progress start-up date; or (B) $10 million. (vi) Sufficient data shall have been obtained since reliable operation of the work-in-progress was achieved. Such data shall be used in the determination of the adjusted baseline fuel parameter and as verification of the effect of the work-in-progress. (vii) Increases in each of the annual average baseline values (per §80.90) of exhaust benzene emissions, exhaust toxics emissions and NO X emissions due to work-in-progress adjustments are limited to the larger of: (A) The unadjusted annual average baseline value of each emission specified in this paragraph (e)(5)(vii); or (B) The following values:
