Threatening to execute him, the kidnappers demanded that Boris Kakubava cancel the congress of the displaced Abkhazian population scheduled to he held in Tbilisi 23-25 April. The organizers of the terrorist act seem to be afraid that the congress could make the Georgian leaders' political course on the Abkhazian issue look negative. A probable tragic end has been prevented by the prompt intervention of the Abkhazian Liberation Union. This, as well as other events (delegates of the congress have been denied transport by rayon authorities; transport routes have been closed), demonstrates a desire of the authorities to prevent the congress. The Abkhazian Liberation Union places the entire responsibility for the incident and its consequences on the leadership of the Republic of Georgia. This statement was made public by the press service of the Abkhazian Liberation Union at a news conference in Tbilisi on 23 April.
