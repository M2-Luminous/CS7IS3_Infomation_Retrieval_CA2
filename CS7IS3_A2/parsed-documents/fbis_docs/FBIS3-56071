The document says that "with the sanction of several officials of Riga's local government bodies and under their direct participation, on January 10, 1994, illegal actions were undertaken with respect to Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh and Major Generals Nikolay Taylakov and Anatoliy Vodopyanov who serve in the Northern-Western Group of Forces." The generals were detained by the municipal police and, accompanied by the guard, were sent in the direction of the Russian-Latvian border to be deported from Latvia. The generals were freed according to the private order of the president of the Latvian Republic. Latvia's Foreign Ministry offers its apologies for this action. The Foreign Ministry explains that a preliminary investigation was conducted due to the above mentioned incident; as a result, the Cabinet of Ministers passed a decision to release chairman of the local government body in Riga's Vidzemskiy region Andreis Rucs from his post; the Prosecutor's Office of the Latvian Republic has launched proceedings due to abuse of official authorities on the part of Rucs. Given the fact that these actions were committed on the eve of the inter-state talks, the Latvian party views this event as an attempt by Latvian circles to hinder process of the negotiations and to worsen Russian-Latvian relations. The document says that the Government of the Latvian Republic will do its utmost to prevent identical acts of provocative nature and notes that in the future all issues related to the Russian forces' withdrawal will be solved by means of negotiations. Rita Aksenoka, aide to Latvia's Prosecutor General, told Interfax that on Wednesday Andreis Rucs voluntarily came to the prosecutor's office. At present he is being interrogated. Speaking at a briefing in the Russian capital some time earlier, spokesman of Russian Foreign Ministry Grigory Karasin declared that Moscow "awaits an expanded official answer of the Latvian party regarding our demarches." "Taking into consideration that the January 10 events were the most serious, though not the first one, provocation of Latvia's extreme nationalist forces it is important that all concrete organizers of this action will be punished and Latvian authorities will undertake necessary measures to prevent similar dangerous incidents in the future," emphasized Karasin.
