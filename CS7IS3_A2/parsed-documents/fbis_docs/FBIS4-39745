Yuriy Baturin on the Inside of the Kremlin"] [Text] When Boris Yeltsin sets off for his regular vacation this summer -- or fall -- Yuriy Baturin, the president's national security adviser, will be left "in charge" of the Kremlin apparatus. One aide always remains in the Kremlin during the vacation period, while the others all take the opportunity to take a breather while the president is away from Moscow. Why Baturin exactly? Because the job description of his post, which was created at the end of last year, could not be better suited to the problems which almost traditionally arise when Yeltsin is on vacation. Baturin, if I am not mistaken, has never yet publicly outlined the range of his functions and the duties which the president has imposed on him. Conversations in the Kremlin and in a number of government and nongovernmental organizations and departments, however, now permit us to form a definite impression of what the national security adviser does. Parallels with the United States, where national security advisers have automatically belonged for many decades now to what we call the presidential staff, would in this case be considerably strained. For at least two reasons. In the United States the status of such aides is enshrined in law. In our country neither Baturin nor any other other presidential aide has such a status. Though, as it turns out, work on a Statute on Aides, which will subsequently be formulated as a presidential edict -- but once again without legislative ratification -- has been going on for several months now. True, the scheduled deadline for the preparation of the draft statute, it is said, has already passed, but in point of fact there is no special reason for haste. Everyone knows anyway that, as one high-ranking official told me, "the president forms his apparatus as he sees fit, and he is fully entitled to do so" and that, in addition, the leader of each department and each level of authority understands that the aides are the president's right-hand men, and, if anyone refuses to fulfill a request or requirement from an aide, "he will be in hot water the next day." And second: Unlike the United States, where threats to national security, whether real or potential, stem mostly, if not 100-percent from without, danger to Russia's national interests is bounded by quite different parameters -- internal or peripheral. Hence Baturin -- who has not, incidentally, been relieved of the duties linked with his previous position of adviser on legal questions, from which he was transferred to national security -- is concerned first and foremost with internal situations. Naturally, conflict and potentially explosive situations, whether it be the situation in, say, Tajikistan, or the latest hostage crisis in Ossetia. His sphere of influence is the power structures. True, Baturin himself is categorically against his post being seen as, let alone being called, that of coordinator of the power ministries and departments. He prefers another term -- adviser [pomoshchnik]. An adviser to these structures on their contacts with the president, and -- not without importance -- on resolving the problems which these structures encounter. Relations with the power structures are various. With some -- particularly with the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Border Guards, and the government communications service -- contacts are very close and productive. Contacts with other departments are marked by problems. None of those with whom I spoke went into detail, still less spoke about the difficulties in such a way as to make it possible to give a direct reference to the source afterward. But without direct quotations I will remark that the lack of enthusiasm over the creation of the post of national security adviser which was initially typical of all power structure workers, virtually without exception, and which Baturin managed to overcome in his relations with some of them, still remains in his work with the defense minister and, in particular, with the foreign minister. Both these ministers, as is well known, are very close to the president and are accustomed to direct access to Yeltsin. According to certain information, Boris Yeltsin, clearly understanding the delicacy of the situation, is himself not inclined to accelerate Baturin's transformation into a broker in his contacts with Kozyrev and Grachev. Baturin, according to the comments of people who are well acquainted with his style and methods, is also not keen on the idea, preferring to operate gradually, step by step, not throwing his weight around but simply giving others the chance to see that he is really useful and necessary precisely as a connecting link with the president, as a man vested with the powers to resolve many questions -- including extremely problematic questions -- independently, without pestering Yeltsin. Are there exceptions to these powers? Of course. The exceptions are situations requiring a political solution, or when two or three directly contradictory opinions are expressed on the same question. Then recourse to the president is inevitable; these polar options are placed on his desk and he, and only he, chooses the one which he considers correct and acceptable. As if illustrating the delicacy of his relationship with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Baturin refused outright to name even one foreign country whose problems -- in particular problems connected with these countries' relations with Russia -- the president has instructed him to tackle directly. To a certain extent, understandably, the same delicacy characterizes relations within the presidential apparatus itself, where, as is well known, the post of foreign affairs adviser, occupied by Dmitriy Ryurik, has existed for a long time. Nevertheless, the geographical or strategic range of Baturin's "foreign" functions can be calculated approximately from the fact that, for example, the national security adviser, who often accompanies the president on foreign trips so as to "avoid confusion," intends to go with Yeltsin to Naples in July for the meeting of G-7 heads of state and government. Continuing the theme of the difficulties which can be explained by purely personal factors and the traditions of interdepartmental bureaucratic friction, it is impossible not to touch on the situation, in some ways paradoxical, whereby alongside the president's adviser tackling national security problems and endowed with a small, but nevertheless his own staff of assistants a similar structure operates in parallel -- the legislatively enshrined Security Council, headed in everyday practical functions by Oleg Lobov and having, naturally, its own apparatus. Relations between these two structures -- and no one has sought to deny this -- are strained. Lobov, considered by some as "Yeltsin's man," found out about Baturin's appointment, it is said, only from newspaper reports. However, the appointment was so sudden that the Security Council secretary was not the only one left in ignorance until the last minute. But the problem, it seems to me, is not so much in possible personal grievances and suspicions that someone wants to undermine someone else. The problem is different; genetic, perhaps. A situation has arisen whereby two structures handling in principle the same questions and to some extent duplicating one another are forced to coexist. Competition, and all that competition entails, cannot be avoided. For example, competition over such an apparently banal question as who has what access to the president. Baturin meets Yeltsin almost every day, Lobov -- once a week; saying, it is true, that such meetings are sufficient, but at once adding: "I would like to meet more often." Or the problem of keeping informed. Baturin, all the reports suggest, possesses far more information possibilities than the Security Council, even though in theory the sources are the same for both. But I was told that departments and ministries share information, mostly of an operational nature, with the president's adviser even in cases when he does not specifically request it. The Security Council, however, informed people testify, mainly receives information in response to requests, and sometimes in the form of weighty analytical documents. But clear and succinct information is needed -- there is no dispute here -- bearing in mind in particular that the president prefers to deal with documents numbering two or three pages, and frequently just one page. Incidentally: According to sources, Baturin intends to institute the preparation of a daily report for the president -- a kind of "list of threats to Russia's national security." It will be exactly one page in length with, it is true, more lengthy fact sheets appended, so that the president, if necessary or if he so desires, can turn to them for details. Relevant places in the fact sheets will be underlined and highlighted in advance. Kremlin sources intimate that the Security Council sometimes looks "an unwieldy, not very resourceful organization akin to an academic scientific research institute, preparing rather too facile documents from which -- as was the case, for example, with Russia's military doctrine -- it is difficult to calculate practical tasks and, for instance, budgetary directives." The sources do not rule out that the same could happen with national security strategy, which is currently being elaborated and "whose adequacy cannot be vouched for." Sources which, I would say, reflect the opposite side's opinion do not hide the fact that, if certain problems and situations had been passed through the Security Council and its apparatus, it would have been possible to avoid certain major blunders and miscalculations of recent times, as was the case -- I am quoting the sources -- with the release of the Lefortovo prisoners, or the furor that arose over the Russian military bases in the Baltic. "The decisions in that case might have been different," they told me. Can the problem of the collaboration between these two structures, so similar in their functions but intrinsically different in their methods and the nature of their activity, be solved? I confess, I felt no confidence in my interlocutors' answers that, without radical interference from the president to clearly divide rights, duties, and functions between the Security Council and his national security adviser, spelling them out in detail, their coexistence will not continue to be marked by behind-the-scenes friction and mutual reproaches, which, whichever way you look at it, reflect on the efficiency and impact of the performance of common tasks. An almost ideal option is probably the American set-up, in which the president's national security adviser and the National Security Council are an integral unit, with a single apparatus and combined functions. Let us return, however, to Baturin's daily activity. Apart from everything else, this includes questions of the arms trade and, at the same time, weapons destruction laid down in international agreements and accords; questions of the development and consolidation of the production of those high technologies in which, the president's aide says, "we must in no event concede primacy, since otherwise we will be left hopelessly behind"; and problems of the defense sector. Finally there is the elaboration of the doctrine, strategy, and concept of Russia's national security. As far as I was able to understand it, Baturin will finish the preliminary work at least by the end of the year and -- it is not ruled out -- will share its results with the public, in the form of a newspaper article, for instance. In principle Baturin does not believe that the concept should be formulated in the form of some sort of signed document, referring, sources say, to the fact that Britain gets by perfectly well without a written constitution. But the definition and recognition of what the aide calls "Russia's permanent interests," which can be outlined, agreed, and officially recorded at a closed session of the Security Council and to which future generations of Russian statesmen can refer, is essential. What are these interests? From conversations with people who are well acquainted with the president's aide's theoretical "kitchen," two areas can be seen clearly enough: "Closely binding together Ukraine, Belorussia [Belarus], Russia, and in the remote long-term Kazakhstan,"; and second, "Russia must not leave Central Asia; otherwise serious threats to Russia's security could arise there." These are the elements of the basis on which strategy for the next 10 to 30 years is to be elaborated, with definitions, in particular, of the methods and means of achieving set tasks, and also the doctrine of national security for the next 50 years, including intelligence, military, counterintelligence, and other doctrines. ...June 2nd was the first anniversary of Baturin's appointment as the president's adviser on legal questions. He hardly suspected then what he would be involved in by this anniversary, or that he would be left "in charge" during the president's regular vacation, since "all sorts of unpleasant things begin" precisely at such a time. These things are now, it appears, his main speciality.
