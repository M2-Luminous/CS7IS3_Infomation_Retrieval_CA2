Kravchuk at the Center for Cadre Skill Improvement of the Institute of State Government and Self-Government of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine; no date given: "We Are Working With More Than One Day in Mind"] [Text] It is good that we met at this difficult, even extremely complicated time for Ukraine in order to ponder together problems that need to be solved, noted the president. First of all, these are socioeconomic issues and joint actions, our position on elections. We predicted that crisis phenomena would occur inevitably if there were to be the partition of states and reforms in society. However, we did not imagine the entire scope of the crisis. Among the reasons for the current difficult situation, there are domestic reasons that include structural changes in industry, the establishment of new relations between enterprises within Ukraine, and reforms in the financial, banking, and credit systems. Of course, we do not have either a precise program, or an adequate number of persons capable of effecting profound transformations. After all, this is not just about the professional qualifications of people but about fundamentally new approaches and a new system of actions. This requires time, reinterpretation, and retraining. External factors--they frequently say that, supposedly, Ukraine is some kind of a recalcitrant fellow who triggered the processes of economic breakup. Supposedly, this is one of the main reasons why the crisis has become deeper, and so on. I do not disclaim my responsibility and that of the government and other power structures for not acting precisely and consistently at all times. However, it is a mistake to believe that the cause of the crisis is solely in severing the relations. This prevents people from taking more resolute and persistent steps in order to find one solution or another here, in Ukraine, rather than sit on the ramparts as Yaroslavna and lament the severance of relations. I do not want this to be immediately perceived as interference in Russia's domestic processes, but you see that plants are being stopped there--tractor and combined harvester plants, cotton mills. The question is--are we the reason for that? Difficult processes are underway in both Ukraine and Russia. There are people who say: Let us quickly get back together, and everything will fall into place: Sausage will be cheap, and everything will be problem-free. Perhaps those who talk about this desire to restore everything the way it was: "centralized," "administrative," and "power of the united force," and so on. Is this possible? It is impossible. Everybody knows this well, but instead of somehow persuading the people to think and act realistically, certain leaders and the mass media follow the path of least resistance, playing along to the mood of some people. However, there also are examples to the contrary. For example, the Zaporozhye Motorsich plant established relations with Russia--nobody forbade it to them--and is now operating in a stable manner. The director of this plant, Bohuslayev, said correctly as he reported to the congress of industrialists that we should now find direct relations and integrate at the level of enterprises and collectives. I see a strange picture. I receive telegrams: Give us money, do this, open that. What is this, a civilized state? Is it the function of the president to be a patron of all structures with regard to material-technical supplies? I would like to agree with you about one issue, without analyzing the entire set of problems. How are we to come together so as not to divide now into those who are to blame and those who are not? I am giving you the numbers. The total amount of expenditures from the state budget during nine months of this year came to almost 15 trillion karbovantsy. This exceeded revenues by more than 5 trillion. Meanwhile, 983 billion were approved for the year, let us say, 1 trillion. How is it possible to keep increasing expenditures without increasing the revenue side of the budget? Of course, it is possible if the printing press operates and continues to put into circulation money that is not backed up with anything. However, in a month to 1.5 months, ruin would be inevitable. Ways to replenish the budget should be found promptly; the tax service should be resolutely put in order. For this I appeal directly to you. The tax service should work together with organs that are involved in this and with administrations, and mobilize revenues to all levels of the budget on the basis of law and order. We will simply not survive otherwise. I will resolutely support you in putting the tax system in order, stopping the shipment of goods out of the country, and fighting corruption and crime. I would like to once again revisit the question of prices. We did not have an opportunity to not raise prices, but there should be correspondence between them and remuneration for labor. However, there is a nuance: If production falls, and labor productivity falls, whereas wages increase, this is a purely inflationary process. To prevent a slump in production is the only possible way to stop the impoverishment of the people and improve their welfare. Giving the producer freedom is the only way to do this. I have proceeded to grant greater rights to regions. This has to do first of all with economic rights and freedoms and liberalization of government at the level of regions. We will also proceed to give the collectives the right to manage the resources that they have and that they are earning. Intimidating the people with a mafia that is grabbing everything through privatization amounts to deliberately promoting tension in our society in order to stop privatization and conversion to joint-stock operations, because a plant that is given to its collective through conversion to joint-stock format operates to benefit the Ukrainian economy. The task of the state is to create external conditions for the development of production. Customs duties, taxes, price regulators, and wages should be effective. All of this is provided by the state, and the rest by the collective. That is, I would like us to agree in this critical period in the life of our state that Ukraine needs to survive economically. This will give us the power to take a step forward. Do we have grounds to say that we can survive? Definitely. However, everyone should act with initiative to this end. Had kolkhozes and sovkhozes failed to find sources of diesel fuel, lubricants, and gasoline on their own this year, I think that we would not have brought the crop in. Recently, representatives of collective farms have been approaching me; managers are asking for permission to sell products remaining on the farms and obtain in exchange diesel fuel, gasoline, and spare parts for spring work. At present, we should act as the situation warrants. If there are products and a farm wants to sell them in order to not take from the state but rather purchase on its own what it cannot get by without, this should be allowed. I am calling upon you to act accordingly in your localities. I do not see any other way, and I cannot guarantee that the state will collect foreign exchange and will be able to buy the necessary resources in a centralized manner and give them to agricultural producers. Some people think to this day that there is a strategic course that was set forth in 1917, and some deviation from this course is now occurring which will end, and everything will return to the way it was. What will the final result of such a return be? It is blood. It is possible, after all, to analyze how the situation is developing and what outcome it may have. In this regard, I would like to remind you of one comparison. At present, Finland, in which only five percent of the land is suitable for agricultural production feeds itself and has an opportunity to sell 30 percent of its products beyond the borders of the country. It is a civilized modern country with a high level of the culture of consumption, democracy, and protection of human rights. I will ask this question. Tell me please, had Finland remained within the great and omnipotent Soviet Union, would it now be what it is? It would be the way we now are. This is the first point. The second point: Give me the name of a single country of the former socialist system, of the former Soviet Union that is now on an equal footing with the highly developed countries of the world. Would we now be facing this difficult situation had Ukraine been in 1991, when the Soviet Union disintegrated, at the level of economic development of, say, Japan or the United States, producing high-quality competitive products, and had it not been as it is in Ukrainian villages, whereby in Poltava Oblast alone, 100,000 houses have thatch roofs and 30 percent of the schools are suitable for classes? Everything fell apart back then, and now old problems have become extremely acute. In this situation, accusations are being leveled against independence. You have got what you wanted, they say. I do not understand how a statesman can say from the rostrum that the state that he represents is not needed and may not exist. Meanwhile, this sometimes happens to the sound of applause. He lives in this land and does not believe in this land, does not believe in the people, and does not want to be the owner. Some of those who call themselves democrats have now stooped to one of them mounting the rostrum and saying: "Do not give them any loans, do not give them credit." Yet another hero came up and said: "Do not admit Ukraine to European structures because human rights are being violated here." That is to say, they spit upon and tear into themselves. They yell--we are for Ukraine, we will give the shirt off our backs for it. However, pardon the expression, they will keep the pants with a pocket for deposit. This is the kind of democrats they are. Yesterday, I met with the parties. What disturbs you, of what do you accuse the president? The Supreme Council has passed an election law. So, proceed toward the election. If the Ukrainian people love you so much they will elect you. You will engage in politics, and I will be the first one to congratulate you on your election. I will never come to the podium, and will not lecture you after that, as some gentlemen do now. They sat in a chair over there, and worked and failed, and when they moved down--they are already in the opposition, they are already teaching how to work. I will never allow myself to do this because I have honor. This is a serious matter. We are choosing the progress of our state. We should unite. I have thus come to the election. My point of view is as follows. The law on elections exists. We may criticize it yet again, we can see its shortcomings. There are shortcomings, but the law has been approved and signed. Elections should be held on the basis of this law. We should determine our tasks in implementing the law on elections. First, it is monitoring compliance with this law; second, it is ensuring equal rights for all candidates; third, it is preventing the inflow of funds not envisioned by the law from other structures in order to use them to benefit individual persons. Further on, I will ask questions. Can we restrict ourselves to just that and not be interested in intelligent, dedicated, moderate, honest, and principled people coming to the Supreme Council? Can we stand aside? I believe that we cannot. As not only representatives of the president, but as citizens of our state, we may, want, and have the right to do so that precisely such people come to the parliament. At present, I am not segregating them by political coloring. We need new statesmen who are capable of ensuring economic, political, and diplomatic international authority of the state; people who are capable of pursuing a policy intelligently and carrying on friendship, cooperation, and partnership with our neighbors to both the east and the west: Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Germany, and other countries. That is, we should ensure the normal life of Ukraine in a worldwide, European process while at the same time implementing domestic reforms step by step. Voices are now being heard--what is to be done, say, if we do not elect a parliament? Some people suggest--let the president then take over everything. I would like to state my philosophy regarding this question here. Can this not bring about a dictatorship? If I apply this to myself, I think that I am no dictator. I will not allow this to happen. However, who can guarantee that another man will not come after me who will use authoritarian tendencies to the hilt? I for one have confidence in B.N. Yeltsin. The Constitution that has been adopted in Russia gives extremely great powers to the president. I believe that Boris Nikolayevich will use these powers in the interest of Russia, Europe, and the world. However, can I say that after Yeltsin this Constitution will not be used by someone in a different direction? Is there a guarantee that it will not? Nobody will give you one. I want to be understood. If we write a Constitution and talk about democracy, we should take steps that would safeguard the people against the cataclysms in the long run because the nature of each person is embodied in the law, and the law should be such that nobody could take advantage of it contrary to the interests of his own people and the world. This is why I take a very cautious attitude toward such questions and such proposals. There should be counterbalances. I have had a lot of unpleasantness with the current parliament. I have, but I will tell you frankly and openly: The parliament is a counterbalance to possible steps that could have brought about a different interpretation, a different vision of democracy as such. In our evolving democracy, in our evolving state only a parliament may be such a counterbalance, along with other representative organs. And you are supposed, accordingly, to counterbalance them. So, the Constitution and legislation on the power structure are still imperfect here. However, this is not to say that we should reject the significance of the parliament. Consequently, we have to do everything in order for elections to be held and for people to come to the parliament who are responsible for the state, for Ukraine. This is our main task. Now about your personal participation in the election campaign. I will say frankly that anyone can nominate himself as a candidate for deputy. However, everyone must weigh what he is capable of and who he draws on. There are relevant clauses in the law but they do not rule out the opportunity to take part in an election campaign. Our initiative should be based on law and the actual situation. The time before March is going to be extremely difficult. If we overcome inflation--and we should do this--if we overcome the drop in production, if we handle all economic problems and ensure the holding of elections, and elect a professional, responsible, and far-sighted parliament, believe me, this will be a very important step toward resolving upcoming problems, economic, political, and social alike. What has the government done? It has prepared a privatization program that has been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. The government is now completing the drawing up of the budget and the social development plan. We want to give greater powers to regions and basic-level cities from the point of view of the sources of financing and taking advantage of realistic opportunities. A program for anti-inflationary measures has been approved. There is a program for the supply of energy resources to Ukraine during the winter-and-spring season. Work is now underway on arrangements for implementing the plan. The documents that we have adopted are realistic for present-day conditions, and everything should be done in order for these conditions not to deteriorate. All programs will be carried out in this case. The programs in question are market-oriented, reformist programs; however, carrying them out will depend on us. At this difficult time, I am calling on all of you to proceed from the fact that Ukraine is a state; it should be preserved. We have resources, we have potential; they should be used in the best way possible. Certainly, there were and there will be conflicts, and we will not get by without them. However, conflicts may not, should not bring about confrontation, intimidation, menace, strike threats, and so on. I think that if someone goes for a strike and threatens an all-Ukrainian strike, it will be the last strike--the last organized strike, and after that a perpetual strike will come. It will no longer be necessary to organize because it will no longer be possible to return to the real concerns. All those who threaten a strike so actively should know and understand this. A way out should be sought, especially for low-income individuals; persons with many children, the handicapped, retirees, those who need our specific assistance should be helped in every way at every opportunity. In turn, for those who can work, conditions should be created such that they will be able to work and have earnings. Believe me, I see no other way.
