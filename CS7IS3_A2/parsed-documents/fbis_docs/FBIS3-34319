The meetings were held within the framework of the periodic discussions held by these countries to study the situation in Iraq's Kurdistan. The final statement issued stressed the following points: 1. Iraq's territorial integrity. 2. Opposition to any foreign interference in Iraq's affairs. 3. The need to lift the economic siege imposed by the regime on Iraq's Kurdistan and the south. 4. Iraq's compliance with all UN resolutions. If we put aside what was discussed behind the scenes during the meetings, we see that the three ministers' emphasis on the issue of lifting the economic siege of Iraq's Kurdistan and the south is a positive step toward understanding the sufferings of the Iraqi people in general and of our Kurdish people in Iraq's Kurdistan in particular. Our Kurdish people have stressed through the parliament and regional government the need to compel the Iraqi regime to comply with the international resolutions imposed on it by the United States. The brother officials in Turkey, Iran, and Syria should realize that Saddam Husayn and not the Kurdish people is the reason why Iraq and the countries of the region remain within the whirlpool of conflicts that have exhausted the region's peoples and governments. Therefore, efforts must be made to save the Iraqi people--Arabs, Kurds, Turkomen, and Assyrians--from the evils of the Baghdad dictatorial regime. The time has come to put an end to the doubts about our Kurdish people's democratic experiment. The neighboring countries have to understand that recognition of the Kurdish people's national legitimate rights within a democratic and pluralistic Iraq is the guarantee for protecting the country's territorial integrity and for sparing it any foreign interference in internal affairs. Action in any other direction will not be in line with the principles laid down by the new world order for dealing with the problems of the persecuted peoples looking for liberation. Our Kurdish people in Iraq do not intend the democratic experiment to result in anything but legitimate rights.
