FR940928-1-00009 FR940928-1-00003 B. The BAAQMD Monitoring Data The State of California's request is based on an analysis of quality-assured ozone air quality data which is relevant to both the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. This data comes from the BAAQMD State and Local Air Monitoring Station (SLAMS) network which is comprised of 23 monitoring stations. The request is based on ambient air ozone monitoring data for calendar years 1990 through 1992. This data clearly shows an expected exceedance rate for the ozone standard of less than 1.0 per year for 22 of the 23 monitors, including each of the monitors on which the nonattainment designation was based. The exception is the Alum Rock monitor, discussed below, which is a monitoring site that was established during the 1992 ozone season. As described below, the Alum Rock monitoring site recorded one exceedance of the ozone NAAQS in 1992, but EPA believes that due to the circumstances of the timing of the establishment of the site, the best estimate of the expected exceedance rate for this monitoring site leads to the conclusion that the San Francisco Bay Area achieved the ozone NAAQS during the 1990&hyph;1992 period. C. The Alum Rock Monitor The original Alum Rock monitoring site was located at a fire station in the northeast portion of San Jose. The BAAQMD lost its lease to this monitoring site in October 1990. Prior to its forced closure, the site had not recorded any exceedances of the standard since 1987. A new Alum Rock monitoring location was established in August 1992. This monitor recorded an exceedance of the ozone NAAQS on September 26, 1992. The actual monitored value was 0.125 ppm, the lowest possible measured value which would be considered an exceedance of the ozone NAAQS.
