FR940304-1-00185 FR940304-1-00015 Among other things, OPA 90 introduces new safety measures relating to vessel operations. This notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposes regulations to implement sections 4101(a) and (b) of OPA 90, which amend 46 U.S.C. 7101 and 7302, respectively, to require every person who applies for the issuance or renewal of a license, certificate of registry (COR), or merchant mariner's document (MMD) to have a test for dangerous drugs. Under 46 CFR part 10, the Coast Guard issues licenses to qualified officers such as masters, mates, pilots, engineers, operators, and radio officers, and issues CORs to qualified staff officers such as pursers, medical doctors, and professional nurses. Under the authority of 46 U.S.C. 7302, any person serving aboard most U.S.-flag merchant vessels of more than 100 gross tons operating on other than rivers and lakes must be issued an MMD by the Coast Guard. This document serves as a certificate of identification and service, authorizing work in different capacities on deck and in the engine and steward's departments. The MMD, with an appropriate endorsement, is also the credential issued to a qualified tankerman. The statutory language of OPA 90 refers to the testing of an individual for the use of dangerous drugs in violation of law or Federal regulation. Existing Coast Guard regulations are framed around the phrase ``chemical test,'' which is already defined in 46 CFR 16.105. For the purposes of this NPRM, the chemical testing required of applicants for issuance or renewal of licenses, CORs, or MMDs relates only to the use of dangerous drugs. Section 4103(a)(2) of OPA 90 amends 46 U.S.C. 2101 by adding ``dangerous drug'' to the list of general definitions and removes the definition of dangerous drugs from 46 U.S.C. 7503(a) and 7704(a). The definition of ``dangerous drug'' in section 4103(a)(2) of OPA 90 includes the term ``controlled substance.'' Although ``marijuana'' is not specifically mentioned in the new definition, marijuana is a controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. 802, and is therefore covered by the definition of ``dangerous drug.'' This NPRM would revise the definition of ``dangerous drug'' in 46 CFR 16.105 to conform it to the definition in 46 U.S.C. 2101, as amended by section 4103(a)(2) of OPA 90. This change has no substantive effect on the existing drug testing rules in 46 CFR part 16. Currently, 46 CFR 16.220(b) provides exceptions to the periodic chemical test requirement when there has been a recent test for dangerous drugs or participation in a random test program. These exceptions were revised by a final rule published in the Federal Register on May 28, 1993 (58 FR 31104). The revised exceptions would apply to the new testing requirements. Section 4102(b) and (c) of OPA 90 amends 46 U.S.C. 7107 and 7302 to limit the terms of CORs and MMDs to 5 years. On September 16, 1993 the Coast Guard published an NPRM in the Federal Register (58 FR 48572) entitled ``Five-year Term of Validity for Certificates of Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents'' (CGD 91&hyph;211) to implement the provisions of section 4102. Although the NPRMs for chemical testing and terms of validity both deal with the issuance and renewal of merchant mariner's credentials, two separate documents have been issued for ease of review by the public. This NPRM proposes additional changes to update Coast Guard regulations, but it does not affect the regulatory amendments contained in the ``Five-Year Term of Validity for Certificates of Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents'' NPRM. In two places, 46 CFR 10.805(g) and 12.02&hyph;9(f), this NPRM contains proposed regulatory text that would follow after additions proposed in the ``Five-Year Term of Validity for Certificates of Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents'' NPRM. One final rule may be issued combining the requirements for chemical testing and regulations for the terms of validity for CORs and MMDs. Discussion of Proposed Amendments OPA 90 requires all applicants for the issuance or renewal of licenses, CORs, or MMDs to have a chemical test for dangerous drugs. The proposed rules would apply the requirement to (1) an original issuance or a renewal of a license, COR, or MMD; (2) a raise in grade of a license or a higher grade of COR; and (3) the first endorsement on an MMD as an able seaman, qualified member of the engine department, or tankerman. Applicants meeting either of the exceptions contained in ยง16.220 would be exempt from the chemical testing requirements. A chemical test for dangerous drugs would not be required for an MMD endorsement that does not require a new expiration date for the MMD or the duplicate issuance or replacement of valid licenses, CORs, or MMDs. If an applicant applies for multiple documentation transactions at one time, the application is treated as a single transaction and a single drug test will satisfy the drug testing requirements for all documentation transactions covered by the application. In a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) published in the Federal Register on October 17, 1989 (54 FR 42624), the Coast Guard proposed to remove existing 46 CFR subpart 12.20 entitled ``Tankerman,'' and replace it with a new part 13, ``Tankermen and Persons in Charge of Transfer of Dangerous Liquid and Liquefied Gas.'' The Coast Guard is proposing to add chemical testing for dangerous drugs to the requirements for obtaining a tankerman endorsement on an MMD. Because the ``Tankerman'' rulemaking has not been finalized, the proposal to add drug testing requirements is set out as amendment to the existing requirements in 46 CFR subpart 12.20. The final rule will place the drug testing requirements in subpart 12.20 or a new 46 CFR part 13, as appropriate.
