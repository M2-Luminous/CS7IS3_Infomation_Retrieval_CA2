Kuchma told journalists after the meeting that Kebich showed full understanding of the need to establish direct horizontal ties between Belarusian and Ukrainian manufacturers. "We should think about tomorrow for ourselves, using our own experience," Kuchma said. He stressed the importance of Belarus' integrating role in the restoration of economic relations between former Soviet republics and supported Kebich's moves aimed at establishing an economic union with Russia. During his meeting with Vyacheslav Kuznetsov, first deputy chairman of the Belarusian parliament, Kuchma said that the Belarusian model of integration of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus is more preferable than others. He supported the Belarusian Government's position calling for a gradual, evolutionary development of the economy and rejecting shock therapy methods. Kuznetsov and Kuchma called for strengthening both bilateral inter-state and direct ties between enterprises within the framework of the CIS economic union. Kuznetsov noted that 1994 will be a year of big political activity for Belarus. The republic will have to determine the future state system, adopt a new constitution and a law on elections. However, no economic or political upheavals should be allowed to weaken friendship between the Slav nations and their good neighbourly and respective relations between each other.
