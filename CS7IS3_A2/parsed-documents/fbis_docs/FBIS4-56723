Mr. Eduardo Vallarino just arrived a few minutes ago at the Atlapa Convention Center, and we would appreciate hearing his first statements, as well as those of his first vice presidential candidate Rene Orillac. Mr. Vallarino, it would seem that the initial results will remain unchanged despite the optimism you expressed earlier. What can you now say to the country? [Vallarino] Well, at this time I can say that I would like to congratulate the country. I congratulate the country because the elections have been a significant accomplishment for Panama. It has been possible to present Panama's positive image to the world, as I have said on several occasions. I would also like to say that, according to the results disclosed by the Electoral Tribunal and what we have been receiving throughout the country from our own party, we are completely certain that Mr. Ernesto Perez Balladares is the winner. He is the president-elect of the Republic, and we publicly extend our congratulations. [Molinar] Mr. Vallarino, can we take a look backwards, or would you just like to look to the future? [Vallarino] As you wish, forward or backwards [words indistinct]. [Molinar] Then let's do both. Some time ago there was talk about the possibility of an alliance, because it was impossible for you to proceed on your own. You have seen that you received less than 5 percent of the votes. Why then maintain the alliance? [as heard] [Vallarino] This alliance did not come about because of our doing. We tried everything to create an alliance to present a better offer to the country, which meant an alliance. On two or three occasions, I publicly said I was willing to give up my candidacy, to decline my candidacy.... [Molinar, interrupting] Was that a genuine offer or just.... [Vallarino, interrupting] Of course it was a genuine offer, we never aimed to mislead.... [pauses] I do not accept your questioning my statements. [Molinar] No, I am only asking, Mr. Vallarino. [Vallarino] Okay, let's take it easy. Our offer was a real offer. I am not lying. It is absolutely true. If the alliance did not come about, is it simply because there was no similar willingness from the others. [Molinar] Mr. Vallarino, on the other hand, thinking now of what will take place in the future. Since I believe your party will now become an opposition party, what type of political position will the PDC adopt? [Vallarino] That is a decision to be made by the party's political committee. You are once again putting words in my mouth. [Molinar] I am not putting any words in your mouth, I am simply asking what position your party will adopt. [Vallarino] Please do no attempt to put words in my mouth.... [Molinar, interrupting] I am simply asking what position the PDC will adopt from here on. [Vallarino] That is a decision that will be made by the PDC Political Committee. [Molinar] Mr. Orillac, how do you feel at this time? [Orillac] I feel quite satisfied, having participated in an election process that has demonstrated that we Panamanians are also capable of doing positive things. This election process has been positive for all. It has been crystal clear, and the result is clear. The message to the world is that Panama can do positive things. [Vallarino] If the trend witnessed so far continues and the PRD [Revolutionary Democratic Party] emerges as the winner, what can you say about the possibility of some PDC members becoming part of the government they plan to form? [Orillac] Well, I believe that will be a decision to be made by the party in due time. The party's political committee will have to meet and evaluate the possibility. At this time, we do not rule it out or acknowledge it. [Molinar] Thank you very much, Mr. Orillac.
