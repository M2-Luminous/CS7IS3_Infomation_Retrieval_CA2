FR940922-2-00056 FR940922-2-00030 On January 9, 1992 EPA published a notice of opportunity for a public hearing and a request for written comments concerning California's request. 7 EPA received no request for a hearing. EPA received joint written comments from the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA) and the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of America, Inc. (MVMA). Consequently, this determination is based on written submissions by CARB, the written comments submitted in response to the above-mentioned notice and all other relevant information. 8 7 57 FR 909 (January 9, 1991). 8 This information is contained in Docket A&hyph;91&hyph;55. Section 209(b) of the Act provides that, if certain criteria are met, the Administrator shall waive Federal preemption for California to enforce new motor vehicle emission standards and accompanying enforcement procedures. The criteria include consideration of whether California arbitrarily and capriciously determined that its standards are, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as the applicable Federal standards; whether California needs State standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions; and whether California's amendments are consistent with section 202(a) of the Act. CARB determined that these standards and accompanying enforcement procedures do not cause California's standards, in the aggregate, to be less protective of public health and welfare than the applicable Federal standards. Information presented to me by parties opposing California's waiver request did not demonstrate that California arbitrarily or capriciously reached this protectiveness determination. Therefore, I cannot find California's determination to be arbitrary or capricious. CARB has continually demonstrated the existence of compelling and extraordinary conditions justifying the need for its own motor vehicle pollution control program, which includes the subject standards and procedures. No information has been submitted to demonstrate that California no longer has a compelling and extraordinary need for its own program. Therefore, I agree that California continues to have compelling and extraordinary conditions which require its own program, and, thus, I cannot deny the waiver on the basis of the lack of compelling and extraordinary conditions. CARB has submitted information that the requirements of its emission standards and test procedures are technologically feasible and present no inconsistency with Federal requirements and are, therefore, consistent with section 202(a) of the Act. Information presented to me by parties opposing California's waiver request did not satisfy the burden of persuading EPA that the standards are not technologically feasible within the available lead time, considering costs. Thus, I cannot find that California's amendments will be inconsistent with section 202(a) of the Act. Accordingly, I hereby grant the waiver requested by California. My decision will affect not only persons in California but also the manufacturers outside the State who must comply with California's requirements in order to produce motor vehicles for sale in California. For this reason, I hereby determine and find that this is a final action of national applicability. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, judicial review of this final action may be sought only in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Petitions for review must be filed by November 21, 1994. Under section 307(b)(2) of the Act, judicial review of this final action may not be obtained in subsequent enforcement proceedings. As with past waiver decisions, this action is not a rule as defined by Executive Order 12866. Therefore, it is exempt from review by the Office of Management and Budget as required for rules and regulations by Executive Order 12866. In addition, this action is not a rule as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601(2). Therefore, EPA has not prepared a supporting regulatory flexibility analysis addressing the impact of this action on small business entities. Finally, the Administrator has delegated the authority to make determinations regarding waivers of Federal preemption under section 209(b) of the Act to the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. Dated: August 26, 1994. Robert Brenner, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23497 Filed 9&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
