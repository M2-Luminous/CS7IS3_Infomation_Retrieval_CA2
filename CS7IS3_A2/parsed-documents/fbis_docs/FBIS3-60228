The project, given high priority by the State Council, is considered a vital move in stemming deterioration of the rural environment, reducing natural disasters and promoting sustained development of an "ecological agriculture," according to State Councillor Chen Junsheng. The undertaking is a joint endeavor among the departments of forestry, environment protection, water conservancy and agriculture, Chen told a national conference yesterday. The State councilor urged governments at all level to consider rural ecology, an issue he said has been insufficiently weighted in the development of agriculture and rural economy. Chen said he hoped that departments like forestry, water resources, planning, finance and sciences would co-ordinate their efforts in implementing the project. The Ministry of Agriculture and six other ministries launched the plan yesterday by designating 50 counties as ecological agricultural-development centres. Starting in 1980, China has introduced experimental-environmental projects in about 1,000 villages, townships and counties. According to Vice-Agricultural Minister Hong Fuzeng, about 200 counties, with a total area of some 14 million hectares of farmland, will be developed as ecological-agriculture projects by the year 2,000. China feeds 22 percent of the world's population with only 7 per cent of its farmland. Hong said the worsening agricultural ecology should be controlled as soon as possible. Because of population growth and industrial production, 466,700 to 533,300 hectares of farmland are occupied annually by urban, industrial, mining and transportation projects. "We have to face the challenges and explore ways to develop agriculture while protecting the environment," Hong said. He suggested that the ecological development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sidelines and fishery should be coordinated to ensure a balanced increase in output. While reducing pollution caused by cities, industries and township enterprises, the utilization of fertilizers, chemical pesticides and plastic sheet in the rural areas should also be tempered, he said.
