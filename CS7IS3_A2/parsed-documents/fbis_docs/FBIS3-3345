Please, take your seats. Now we will hold a news conference by Prime Minister Hosokawa. The prime minister will make a statement before fielding questions. [Hosokawa] I would like to say a few words before fielding questions at this news conference. I am visiting China at the invitation of Premier Li Peng. During a series of meetings with Premier Li Peng, President Jiang Zemin, and other Chinese leaders, I was able to have a candid and significant exchange of views. I had hoped to visit China as soon as possible after I took office and I am very pleased to realize my visit to this country. I would like to express my gratitude to Premier Li Peng and other Chinese officials for warmly greeting me. I have valued Japan-China relations as one of the most important pillars of Japan's foreign policy. Japan-China relations have entered a new stage after marking the 20th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations and the 15th anniversary of the conclusion of the peace and friendship treaty, and our relations have continued to make good development. As you know, the emperor and empress recently visited China. I had a candid exchange of views with Chinese leaders on how to develop Japan-China relations, which have entered the new stage, into a future-oriented relationship that will be able to make contributions to the world in the 21st century. I confirmed with Chinese leaders to strengthen cooperative ties between both countries. I and Chinese leaders touched on many aspects of Japan-China relations. I believe that China's reform and open up policy has been contributing to peace and prosperity not only in China, but in the region, and Japan will provide all possible support to China's efforts. It will provide the fourth yen-based loan and cooperate with China's bid for GATT membership from the standpoint of Japan's intention to assist China's efforts. During my stay in Beijing, Japan-China accord on cooperation in protecting environment was concluded and I think the conclusion of the accord is very meaningful as a specific indication of bilateral cooperation between the two countries. Regarding the Japan-China economic relations, both trade and investment have largely expanded between the two countries in the past few years and I think this is a very desirable development and the future of relations between the two countries is bright. We confirmed that both Japan and China will continue to exert efforts for further development of our economic relations. I and Chinese leaders confirmed the need to promote the exchange of youths and culture between the two countries. In this connection, both Japan and China have cooperated for preserving the Changan Palace in Chengdu, capital of Tang, which was a major city in the history of exchanges between Japan and China. At the series of meetings, I and Chinese leaders affirmed that Japan and China will cooperate for and make vigorous contributions to the world peace and prosperity. Specifically, I think that I was able to have a candid exchange of views with Chinese leaders on the issue of North Korea's nuclear development, Japan-China cooperation in the Asian and Pacific region, arms control and disarmament, military moves in the region, and human rights. As for the issue of North Korea's nuclear development, during a series of meetings with Chinese leaders, I told them that Japan is deeply concerned over the insufficiency of nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the failure of North-South working-level talks to reach any agreement. Since this is an important issue related to the security of northeastern Asia, Japan and China share the same [ninshiki] understanding. I believe that we were able to confirm the importance of having close contact with each other for a settlement of this issue. In my speech to the Diet in August 1993 shortly after I took office, I expressed my feeling from the standpoint of looking at the past as it was. During the series of meetings with Premier Li Peng and President Jiang Zemin, I told them that I intend to further develop a future-oriented relationship with China from the standpoint of reflecting upon what Japan did to China in the past. I intend to work to develop Japan-China relations in the future. Although my visit to China is brief, I have been able to witness major changes taking place in China and Chinese people full of confidence, and I am greatly impressed by them during my stay in China. I will stop tomorrow in Shanghai and am looking forward to touring the New Pudong Area that symbolizes China's reform and open up policy.
