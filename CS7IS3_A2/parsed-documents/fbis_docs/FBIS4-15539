Baburin, a rather influential member of the current and last parliaments, leader of the pro-Communist Russian National Union, was speaking to reporters after his return from Sarajevo, Belgrade and serb Krajina. "It is necessary to boost the efforts of the Russian Government, parliament and Foreign Ministry to lift the U.N. sanctions against the Union Republic of Yugoslavia and fight for a halt to Russia's participation in these sanctions", Baburin said, adding that Russia should become more active with its humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). Baburin backed the idea of sending more Russian peace-keepers to Sarajevo, but rejected the idea of sending Turkish units to the conflict zone under the aegis of the United Nations. "There is a threat of Islamic domination, even of a rebirth of fundamentalism (in the Balkans)", he noted.
