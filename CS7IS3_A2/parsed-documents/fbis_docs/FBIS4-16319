The Government Is Against but It Is Ignored"] [Text] Mordovia's Supreme Soviet, periodically stirring the public with loud scandals -- now setting up the republic's Constitutional Court to help remove the president from his post, now abolishing it quickly ostensibly as "useless" -- has decided again to make itself known. Relying on the Russian Federation State Duma's and president's permission, a Supreme Soviet session moved elections to the Legislative Assembly from 5 June to 27 November although the election campaign has been in full swing, with more than 350 candidates nominated to 75 seats. The Supreme Soviet motivated its decision by suggesting that simultaneous elections to the Legislative Assembly and local power bodies will be less expensive for the taxpayers. Generally, the wish to save public funds is quite laudable except that no one has consulted the people about the fourth shift in the election date. On 11 April Mordovia's Supreme Soviet Presidium met to discuss its further actions. Quite naturally the subject of discussion was that the executive branch in general and administration chiefs in particular have gotten completely out of hand, and after the "illegal dissolution of the soviets" there is no one to oversee them. The Supreme Soviet Presidium then found an easy and foolproof method to control administration heads. It was decided to elect district and city presidiums from among former deputies of district and cities soviets, up to 25 people, vesting them with oversight functions. Under the interim regulations On Chairmen and Presidiums of District and City Deputies Assemblies, they are to approve the local budget and report on its execution; impose local taxes and charges; approve programs for the development of corresponding territories; amend the local self-government charter; oversee the activity of the administration head; sanction the appointment of administration head and other officials, and so forth. Republic Prosecutor Pavel Senkin, who was present at the Supreme Soviet Presidium session, warned the house against voting to restore soviet power because this contradicts the Russian Federation Constitution and Boris Yeltsin's edict on reforming the soviets. Supreme Soviet Chairman Nikolay Biryukov, however, feeling his colleagues' support, stated that "no matter whether our decision is legal or not, as we shall vote, so it will be." The "yes" vote was practically unanimous. The scandal in Mordovia is growing and has already reached Moscow. The republic's prosecutor, upholding legality, has appealed against the Presidium's actions to the Russian General Prosecutor's Office. Valentin Konakov, the president's representative in Mordovia, in a telephone conversation with SEGODNYA's correspondent, assessed the decision by the Supreme Soviet Presidium as "restoration of soviet power in full volume on a communist basis," stemming from the "desire to preserve their powers to the utmost," moreover, by "exceeding these powers." According to him, the decision is "an unconstitutional act and it does not agree with Boris Yeltsin's edict on local self-government," a fact he noted in his memorandum yesterday to the presidential administration. A similar reaction to the emerging setup has come from administration chiefs who refuse to take their orders from the soviets. The republican government appraised the Supreme Soviet Presidium's decision as interference in its affairs. Yesterday in Saransk a joint session of the government and administration chiefs was held, ruling, in view of the fact that there is no constitutional court in the republic, to request the Russian Federation president to look into the "legality and constitutionality" of the Mordovia Supreme Soviet Presidium's resolution. Mordovia's government decided "not to implement the Supreme Soviet Presidium resolution pending the president's decision." The administration heads were told to be guided in their activity by the latest resolution of the Council of Ministers, not the Supreme Soviet Presidium. In addition, an enlarged session of administration chiefs and the government decided to ask Mordovia's Supreme Soviet, the Russian Federation president, and the Russian Federal Assembly to move elections to the republican Legislative Assembly back to 5 June.
