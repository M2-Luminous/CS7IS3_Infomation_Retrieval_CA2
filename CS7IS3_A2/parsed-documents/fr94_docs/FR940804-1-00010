FR940804-1-00010 FR940804-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Minerals Management Service 30 CFR Part 206 RIN 1010&hyph;AB57 Valuation of Oil and Gas From Indian Leases AGENCY: Minerals Management Service (MMS), Interior. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is considering amending its regulations regarding the valuation of gas produced from Indian leases to ensure that Indian mineral lessors receive the maximum revenues from mineral resources on their land consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's (Secretary) trust responsibility and lease terms. Most Indian leases provide that the value of production for royalty purposes be determined by the Secretary. In making this determination, the Secretary must consider his trust responsibility. In the exercise of this responsibility, value in the discretion of the Secretary may be determined by taking the highest of several values. This notice describes several alternatives to establish these values and solicits comments before publishing proposed new regulations governing the value of gas production from Indian lands. The MMS is not currently proposing changes to the oil valuation regulations for Indian leases. The MMS may consider changes following study of oil valuation for Indian leases. DATES: Comments must be received on or before October 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments, suggestions, or objections regarding alternative valuation methods should be mailed to the Minerals Management Service, Royalty Management Program, Rules and Procedures Staff, Denver Federal Center, Building 85, P.O. Box 25165, Mail Stop 3101, Denver, Colorado 80225&hyph;0165, Attention: David S. Guzy, telephone (303) 231&hyph;3432. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David S. Guzy, Chief, Rules and Procedures Staff, MMS Royalty Management Program at (303) 231&hyph;3432. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background All Indian leases contain provisions for the determination of royalty obligations. Some Indian leases or agreements negotiated under the 1982 Indian Mineral Development Act contain explicit methodologies for determining royalty obligations. The MMS does not intend to alter these express valuation methodologies.
