[Wolff von Amerongen] They are not rosy. Apart from a few exceptions in the field of high technology and energy, the CIS states are currently unable to supply competitive products to the international market. [Reif] How will things continue with Russia? [Wolff von Amerongen] Russia will remain a problem for a long time. The greatest tragedy of the Russians is that they are unable to stop inflation. The National Bank, which should actually act as a factor of stability, is the biggest banknote printer of the country. And even though it provides enormous amounts of money to the armament industry and heavy industry in violation of all reason, wages cannot be paid as a rule. [Reif] What should the Germans do in this situation? [Wolff von Amerongen] We must not let ourselves be discouraged by the events in Russia. If a great number of German companies get involved in Russia, this is done out of tradition and human obligation -- but also with a view to the large market that will come one day.
