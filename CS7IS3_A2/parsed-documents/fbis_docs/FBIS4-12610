You should not be afraid of the enemy, shortages, and hardship. You should stand against the enemy. Ultimately you shall survive and the enemies will depart. [shouts of approval from the congregation] The enemy only thinks of himself. He thinks of lust, wealth, status, and mundane matters of this valueless, untrustworthy, and disloyal world. Divine tradition will not allow them to survive. World creation is not based on this. The creation is righteous. We did not create the earth, the heavens and what is in between them in vain [Koranic verse]. They are wrong because they are moving contrary to the objectives of creation. They will, thus, be crushed. You, the Palestinian youth, who went and carried out that suicidal action in revenge: First, may God join your soul with those of all the immaculate martyrs of Islam. [shouts of approval] Second, we are satisfied with what you have done, and may God give some of the rewards of your deed to us. Third, the enemy should understand what the problem is: When a desperate person reaches the end of his rope, this is to what he will resort. How can mankind tolerate injustice forever? They might tolerate it for a year or two, or 10 or 20 years. You have been bullying these people for the past 45 years. You have suppressed them for 45 years. They are human beings and not sheep to put up with everything until they are slaughtered. God did not create mankind to put up with tyranny. God did not create human beings to be feeble. God created mankind to be an honor-seeking, a justice-seeking creature in search of the truth. These virtues of mankind will work for him eventually. But there is a limit to each individual's endurance. There is a limit to one's patience. When one runs out of patience, the oppressor must expect to see the consequences of his torturous deeds. The United States is making a mistake. The United States' allies are wrong. Israel is wrong. They are wrong to imagine that a handful of weak and vile individuals can solve humanity's plight by sitting around a table to sign an accord. The United States is committing crimes in the world today. On the one hand, when people are killed while saying prayers, they play dead in terms of adopting a stance. Their only response was a feeble and tasteless move, just to silence their own public. On the other hand, when this man took action to avenge the blood of those martyrs by punishing them, they could not wait to hold a session to condemn this action. Shame on you. They killed worshipers inside a mosque during Ramadan, and you did not give a damn. Whereas, when this young person sacrificed his own life just to demonstrate that we are alive, just to tell you not to go on with what you are doing and just to stop tyranny and murder, then you sit and condemn him. [shouts of approval from congregation] [passage omitted] Our Bosnian brothers and sisters, and our brothers and sisters who are the target of repression in Gorazde today -- and with the United Nations failing to do its routine work -- they should know that they will survive because they are righteous. They must learn from history and be a model for the future. They should continue to resist as they have done so well until now. May God bless them with his victory.
