With this aim in view, he initiated a bill on top priority measures to develop Siberia. Speaking at the session of the Interregional Siberia Agreement Association at Irkutsk Saturday, Shumeyko explained that for a period of one year Siberia should be guaranteed against a number of the newly legislated economic measures. For this reason, he spoke in favour of changing transport and electricity tariffs. In his opinion, such a bill should be passed by the assembly houses before they get down to examining the draft of a federal budget for 1995, which the cabinet has been instructed to submit by September 15. The Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin, also attending the session, backed up Shumeyko's proposal. In an interview with journalists, he called for reasonable protectionism toward producers and for giving regions more powers in drafting taxation policy. He stressed that local authorities should display more lawmaking initiative in federal parliament. Deputy Premier Sergey Shakhray has also necessitated a temporary law on commodities shipment to Arctic regions to stay in effect in 1994-1995. He underlined that in the federal budget, endorsed by the parliament's houses on Friday, the delivery of goods to Arctic areas is estimated at 5.5 trillion rubles.
