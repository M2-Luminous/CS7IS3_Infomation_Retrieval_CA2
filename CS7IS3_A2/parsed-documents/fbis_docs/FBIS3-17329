Ossetian Parliament Seeks Extension of Emergency LD2403163194 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 1451 GMT 24 Mar 94 LD2403163194 Moscow ITAR-TASS Language: English Article Type:BFN [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] [Text] Vladikavkaz March 24 TASS -- At its session today, the North Ossetian republican parliament paid attention to the extension of the state of emergency on part of the republic's territory. Due to the prolonged tense situation along its border with Ingushetia and incessant attacks on factories, plants, military units and police posts by armed bandit gangs, the parliament resolved to request the president of the Russian Federation and the Federal Assembly to extend the emergency situation in the Mozdo, Pravoberezhnoy and Prigorodnoy districts and part of the settlements near the city of Vladikavkaz. Addressing the session, North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov, said that in particular, Russia has already spent over 100 billion roubles to support the emergency situation. But the situation in the zone of conflict is complicated, there are conditions which lead to its further aggravation, the refugee and hostage problems remain unresolved and the local population in the region possesses a lot of arms. Currently Russian peacekeeping forces are the guarantor of security in the zone of conflict. Akhsarbek Galazov reaffirmed his initiative to hold a meeting with Ingusetian President Ruslan Aushev aimed at discussing a settlement between their two republics. But this meeting must be well-prepared, he emphasised.
