FR940610-0-00130 FR940610-0-00023 (iii) Ordinary term-of-years and life interests. If the interest to be valued is the right of a person to receive the income of certain property, or to use certain nonincome-producing property, for a term of years or for the life of one individual, the present value of the interest is computed by multiplying the value of the property by the appropriate term-of-years or life interest actuarial factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and term-of-years or life interest period). Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 includes actuarial factors for an interest for a term of years in Table B and for the life of one individual in Table S. However, term-of- years and life interest actuarial factors are not included in Table B or Table S in §20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter. If Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 (or any other reliable source of term-of-years and life interest actuarial factors) is not conveniently available, an actuarial factor for the interest may be derived mathematically. This actuarial factor may be derived by subtracting the correlative remainder factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and the term of years or the life) in Table B (for a term of years) or in Table S (for the life of one individual) in §20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6), as the case may be, from 1.000000. For information about obtaining actuarial factors for other types of term-of-years and life interests, see paragraph (d)(4) of this section. (iv) Annuities. (A) If the interest to be valued is the right of a person to receive an annuity that is payable at the end of each year for a term of years or for the life of one individual, the present value of the interest is computed by multiplying the aggregate amount payable annually by the appropriate annuity actuarial factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and annuity period). Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 includes actuarial factors in Table B (for an annuity payable for a term of years) and in Table S (for an annuity payable for the life of one individual). However, annuity actuarial factors are not included in Table B or Table S in §20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter. If Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 (or any other reliable source of annuity actuarial factors) is not conveniently available, an annuity factor for a term of years or for one life may be derived mathematically. This annuity factor may be derived by subtracting the applicable remainder factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and annuity period) in Table B (in the case of a term-of-years annuity) or in Table S (in the case of a one-life annuity) in §20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6), as the case may be, from 1.000000 and then dividing the result by the applicable section 7520 interest rate expressed as a decimal number. See §20.2031&hyph;7(d)(2)(iv) of this chapter for an example that illustrates the computation of the present value of an annuity. (B) If the annuity is payable at the end of semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods, the product obtained by multiplying the annuity factor by the aggregate amount payable annually is then multiplied by the applicable adjustment factor set forth in Table K in §20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter at the appropriate interest rate component for payments made at the end of the specified periods. The provisions of this paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) are illustrated by the following example: Example. On July 1, 1989, the donor agrees to pay the annuitant the sum of $10,000 per year, payable in equal semiannual installments at the end of each period. The semiannual installments are to be made on each December 31st and June 30th. The annuity is payable until the annuitant's death. On July 1, 1989, the annuitant is 68 years and 5 months old. The donee annuitant's age is taken as 68 for purposes of computing the present value of the retained annuity. The section 7520 rate for July 1989 is 10.6 percent. Under Table S, the factor at 10.6 percent for determining the present value of a remainder interest payable at the death of an individual aged 68 is .31371 Converting the remainder factor to an annuity factor, as described above, the annuity factor for determining the present value of an annuity transferred to an individual age 68 is 6.4744 (1.00000 minus .31371 divided by 10.6). The adjustment factor from Table K in the column for payments made at the end of each semiannual period at the rate of 10.6 percent is 1.0258. The aggregate annual amount of the annuity, $10,000, is multiplied by the factor 6.4744 and the product multiplied by 1.0258. The present value of the annuity beneficiary's interest is, therefore, $66,414 ($10,000×6.4744×1.0258). (C) If an annuity is payable at the beginning of annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods for a term of years, the value of the annuity is computed by multiplying the aggregate amount payable annually by the annuity factor described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A) of this section; and the product so obtained is then multiplied by the adjustment factor in Table J in §20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter at the appropriate interest rate component for payments made at the beginning of specified periods. If an annuity is payable at the beginning of annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods for one or more lives, the value of the annuity is the sum of the first payment plus the present value of a similar annuity, the first payment of which is not to be made until the end of the payment period, determined as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this section.
