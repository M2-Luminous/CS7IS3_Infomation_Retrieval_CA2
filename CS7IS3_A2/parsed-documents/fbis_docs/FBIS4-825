FBIS4-825 "drafr074_c_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-074 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Inkatha Freedom Party's `War Plans' Detailed Inkatha Freedom Party's `War Plans' Detailed MB1704095194 Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English 17 Apr 94 p 1 MB1704095194 Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION English BFN [By Lena Slachmuiljder and Bereng Mtimkulu] [Text] Inkatha's war plans began falling into place this week as the kwaZulu government merged its Umfolozi army with the homeland's police force -- a move that is seen as an attempt to licence its private army. This followed the collapse of international mediation between itself, the government and the ANC. Inkatha's Youth Brigade announced on Friday [15 April] that it would embark on "rolling mass action," involving a week-long stayaway beginning tomorrow with marches in various cities and townships. Reports from sources in Natal indicate that hostel dwellers were evacuating women and children from the hostels in anticipation of a civil war which they say will start soon. In another development, the kwaZulu Police (KZP) has absorbed about 1,000 trainees from the kwaZulu government-sponsored training camp adjacent to the Umfolozi Game Reserve. This has led to fears that the move might be aimed at providing cover to the Umfolozi trainees so that they can carry out attacks with impunity. The trainees are to be employed by the KZP as special constables and will be under the command of the KZP's Internal Stability Unit (ISU). They will then be dispatched in groups of 200 to the districts of Esikhawini, Umlazi, Nqutu, Madadeni, kwaMashu and Ulundi. They have been trained in basic skills of self-defence and shooting, according to camp commander Philip Powell, an Inkatha Central Committee member. It is also assumed that the trainees were brain-washed with anti-ANC propaganda. KZP Commissioner Lieutenant-General Roy During confirmed that the recruitment of the Umfolozi trainees -- as they have since become known -- was underway. He insisted that the recruits would receive further training by the kwaZulu Police. This is an unlikely scenario, as the election is due to take place in 10 days' time. Inkatha's Youth Brigade threatened to turn South Africa into a second Bosnia if the ANC and the police try to prevent their planned marches into Johannesburg and parts of Natal this coming week. Public transport will be disrupted during the week-long stayaway and there are reports that taxis, buses and trains that defy the stayaway call will be attacked as the passengers travelling in them will be regarded as ANC supporters. SA Police regional commissioner Lt-Gen Koos Calitz on Friday banned marches and gatherings in Witwatersrand magisterial districts. The banning orders, promulgated under the unrest regulations of the Public Safety Act, were "deemed necessary for the combating or prevention of public disturbance, disorder, riot or public violence," Gen Calitz said. The banning orders cover Alberton, Boksburg, Benoni, Springs, Germiston, Kempton Park, Johannesburg, Randburg, Roodepoort, Krugersdorp, and Westonaria. The ANC and its youth league have called on the security forces to ensure that it deploys enough personnel to protect innocent people. The ANC also called on the security forces to ensure that Inkatha impis [group of warriors] are stopped from leaving the hostels. Meanwhile, the Johannesburg City Council yesterday said that several areas of the city will be cordoned off from 6am tomorrow. Razor-wire installations will be erected in some of the streets -- especially along roads leading to ANC headquarters at Shell House -- and at the Library gardens and Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) offices in Kruis Street. A strong police presence is expected in the city centre. "The city council is opposed to unlawful marches that endanger the safety of people and interfere with their right to go about their normal daily lives," town clerk Nicky Padayachee said.
