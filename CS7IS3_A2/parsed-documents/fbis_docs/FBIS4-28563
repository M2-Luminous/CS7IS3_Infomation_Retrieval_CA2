Peter Tarnoff, U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs, agreed with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on the need to make efforts to seek China's agreement to solve the problem diplomatically, the officials said. Turning to bilateral trade relations, Kakizawa told Tarnoff in a 15-minute meeting he has had close contact with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and he wants to make the trade "framework" talks successful based on mutual trust. Tarnoff said he hopes progress will be made in the trade talks, noting the importance of coordination between Japan and the U.S. on a wide range of issues, including political and security matters. Tarnoff arrived for talks in Japan Thursday and is scheduled to meet Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda later in the day before leaving for Seoul.
