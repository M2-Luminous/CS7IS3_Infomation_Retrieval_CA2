AL-DUSTUR has learned that the follow-up committee in charge of preparing for this meeting has asked the leaders of parties and national forces that will take part in this celebration to get ready for departure to Amman next Sunday. In the meantime, Yemeni Parliament Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar is still dissatisfied with the way the document of understanding was issued. He insists that this document, which was initialed on 18 January, should be ratified by the House of Representatives, which is the constitutional body in the country. The Yemeni parties are engaged in controversy over the point advanced by al-Ahmar. A bloc comprising the Yemeni Socialist Party, the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, the Right [al-Haqq] Party, and the Nasirite Popular Unionist Organization has emerged. It says that, based on past experience, what the House speaker is demanding is unnecessary. These parties, supported by many independents, do not believe the new document should pass through parliament. They say that none of the previous unity accords was ratified by the House of Representatives and that the new document is a covenant of honor and not a legal pact. [passage omitted]
