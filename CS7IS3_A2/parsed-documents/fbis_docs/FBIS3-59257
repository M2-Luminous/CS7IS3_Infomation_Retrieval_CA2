The financial order, which for a time was chaotic, has gradually taken a turn for the better; the problems of breaking rules and regulations on discounts and loans, disorder in raising funds, and disorder in setting up financial organizations are being corrected, and initial success has been achieved in their correction; and there has been a large increase in savings deposits. At the same time, consumer market prices have continued to rise. The averages for August were: in China as a whole, retail prices rose more than 11 percent, and the cost of living broke a 13 percent increase. This situation has caused concern and anxiety in all quarters. In this regard I will only give some of my own views, and I welcome the readers' criticisms and comments. 1. Market price increases continue to be high mainly because of the delayed reaction to the previous period of the trend for high economic growth, the relaxation in the currency supply policy, and the vigorous measures for price reform. Prices are the "barometer" of the state of macroeconomic operations, and an economic boom and price rise go together, but there is often a delayed effect. A practical analysis of China's economy shows that this delay is generally about a half year's time in the entire economic cycle. When observing the current price situation, one must look back at the economic growth situation over the past several years. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 1988, China's economy was brought under control and consolidated, and the pace of development was clearly slowed. Later the retrenchment dynamic became flexible, and in 1991 a recovery-type growth began (in that year the gross domestic product [GDP] was 3.9 percent higher than that of the year before, a rise of 8 percent). In 1992 the growth accelerated (in that year the GDP was 13.2 percent higher than that of the year before). And the trend of market prices is basically for a state of acceleration to prevail, and this state began in the last half of 1992: from July to December the retail prices were on average 5.8 percent higher than in the same period of the year before, and were 9 percentage points higher than in the first half of the year; the December rise was 6.8 percent, 2.6 percentage points higher than in June. With the spring breeze accompanying Deng Xiaoping's tour of the south, in the second half of 1992 China's economy got on the track of sustained high-speed growth (since July in that year the growth of industrial production has exceeded 20 percent). Correspondingly, beginning in 1993, China's market prices rose markedely: in January they went up 8.4 percent, in March 10.2 percent, in May 12.5 percent, and in the intervening months there was a rise of about 2 percentage points. Because in the first half of this year the growth of China's economy was still in an accelerated state, starting in the second half of the year there was a further rise in market prices, 14.9 percent in July and 15.1 percent in August. This shows that price rises often accompany a high-speed growth of the economy and become a state of acceleration. Prices are a manifestation of inflation, and they often rise following a relaxation in the money supply. In the initial period of development and consolidation, because a policy of strictly controlling the money supply was adopted, money in the narrow sense -- currency and demand deposits (M1) --gradually dropped from more than 30 percent in July 1988 to under 10 percent before June 1990. In the same period, the rise in market prices dropped month by month, from 26.7 percent in December 1988 and 27 percent at the beginning of 1989 to 6.4 percent in December 1989. In 1990-91, because a reasonable growth in the money supply was maintained, the market price rise was basically maintained at under 3 percent; in the period of high-speed growth during the economic recovery, the M1 was affected by the fairly relaxed monetary policy and a situation of accelerated growth clearly appeared. In June 1992 the rise exceeded 30 percent, and in March 1993 it broke through the 40 percent level. Against this background, an accelerated rise in market prices in the second half of 1992 was inevitable, and it is no wonder that current market price increases remains high. An increase in China's market prices often occurs following the appearance of price reform measures. Because prior to reform the old economic system excluded the market's role, and strict administrative controls were imposed on prices, serious irrationalities were created in China's price administrative mechanisms and price relations. Particularly since the nineties began, almost every year reform has taken big strides and charged through several barriers in succession. By the end of 1992 the prices of 90 percent of the consumer goods, of 80 percent of the means of production, and of more than 90 percent of import-export commodities were being basically regulated by the market. Under the dynamic of such a major reform, the general level of market prices was bound to increase; this is a "necessary cost" of price reform that is difficult to avoid. According to estimates, in 1992, of increases of retail prices as a whole, about 70 percent of it was the effect of policy-type price regulation, and in the first eight months of 1993 about half of the price rise was related to price reform. From this we can see that at present the market price increase is not falling back in synchronization with the cooling off of the economy. It is not the case that the current macroeconomic regulation and control policy is not playing its role, but rather it is the total effect of the previous period of high economic growth, generous money supply, and major price reform. This is basically a normal phenomenon, and there is no need for excessive anxiety about it. Of course, as a macroeconomic regulator and controller, there is a necessity for China to obtain and maintain a rational rate of growth in the economy and in the money supply. Mastering the dynamic of appropriate price reform is an important condition for ensuring that the rise in market prices can be lowered to a point that it can be regulated and controlled in order to further perfect the scientific nature of macroeconomic regulation and control. 2. Supply and demand on the consumer goods market are basically in balance, but the rise in market prices is still fairly high, mainly because of the elasticity in consumption and the differences in the consumption mix, causing differences in commodity price rises. Based on a relevant investigation, at present on the Chinese mainland's consumer goods market, commodities for which supply is greater than demand or for which supply and demand are in basic balance account for 91.6 percent, and commodities for which supply does not meet demand account for only 8.4 percent. What people think is strange is: why is there no reduction in the trend for market prices to rise, and why does the rise remain high? As an individual I think that the main reason for the appearance of this contrasting phenomenon is: On the one hand, from an overall view, although for most commodities supply and demand are not in balance, people's elasticity in the consumption of different commodities is different. If there is a lot of elasticity in this consumption, frequently after a price rise the amount of consumption will fall, thereby restraining price rises; if there is little elasticity in this consumption, often after a price rise it will be difficult to have a major change in the amount of consumption, and thus it will be difficult to restrain price rises. Now, on China's consumer goods market, most of the price rises are often in commodities and labor services for which there is fairly little elasticity, e.g., grain, nonstaple foodstuffs, fuel, rent, tuition, transportation fees, etc. Since the beginning of this year, the rise has been very high: in China as a whole, from January to August, compared to the same period of last year, the price of grain rose 26.3 percent, the price of fuel rose 39.4 percent, the price of nonstaple foodstuffs rose ll.3 percent, and the price of service items rose 28.6 percent. For these commodities and services, which have little elasticity, people in daily life often have difficulty in finding suitable substitutes; once the state releases controls on the prices on these commodities or raises the standards for collecting fees, the law of consumption cannot play a role. Moreover, of these commodities and services, a considerable part of them are not in a state of basic balance between supply and demand, and some of them are adversely affected by the natural environment. As for commodities for which there is a lot of elasticity in consumption, their price rises are not high. For example, the price rises on clothing and on daily-use, cultural and entertainment electromechanical commodities are basically less than 10 percent, and the prices on some of them are moving downward. On the other hand, influenced by the rasing of the people's income level, consumption is tending toward fine quality, high grade, and the new and original, and a fairly big change has occurred in its structure. Even looking at the total output, we see that at present in China there does not yet existthe contradiction of a shortage of consumer goods, but there are still many unsuitabilities between the production structure and the consumption structure. Frequently for commodities that satisfy marketing needs, the situation in supply and demand tends to be tight and price changes are fairly big. In particular, under conditions in which market rules and regulations are not sound and the market order is not standardized, abnormal phenomena, such as price rises in disguised form and arbitrary price prices, will often appear, thus raising the general level of price rises on consumer goods. Many people feel that the price rises which remain high in the current market is a case of some people in a high income bracket with a tendency for high consumption spurring increases of prices of new products, high-grade and fine-quality commodities, and commodities of new and original design; and that the rises in the prices of general traditional goods of dependable quality are not high, and that there even has to be a dependency on price cuts to promote sales. Moreover, the high rises in the price of consumer goods since the beginning of this year are related to costs. The concentrated manifestation of this is in the rise in the price of advanced products, the rise in the cost of funds and foreign exchange, and the rise in the cost of labor. Since the beginning of this year, the prices of raw materials and energy purchased by enterprises have risen more than 30 percent compared to those of the same period of last year; labor wages have risen more than 20 percent, the prices of funds have risen more than 10 percent, and the prices of foreign exchange have gone up more than 20 percent. These factors for price increases are bound to push up costs, and thereby spur a rise in the ex-factory prices of industrial goods of more than 20 percent, which is bound to be passed on to the retail prices. It is estimated that the cost-push factor has become one of the most important factors in market price rises, particularly for the prices of the means of agricultural production (which have risen 13.5 percent in the past eight months). Of course the current high price rises on the market are to a certain extent also related to the fairly brisk demand by the people (in the past eight months the volume of commodity retail sales grew 22.5 percent). In the first half of the year, for a while there appeared on the domestic market a situation in whcih there was a race to buy commodities in order to protect their value, and the situation on the agricultural market was also better than it was in the year before, with a rise in prices exceeding 10 percent. What needs to be pointed out is that, since the beginning of this year, the renminbi has been devalued, and the cost of imports has risen markedly, also, from another side, pushing up domestic prices. 3. The pressure of latent inflation has abated, and the consumption psychology of the people is basically stable, but the current pattern of market price rises will be maintained for a certain time. If a problem does not appear in currency control, it is estimated that, beginning in the second quarter of next year, the increase in market prices will certainly fall back. The central government has taken measures to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control with a rectification of the financial order as the breakthrough point. These measures are manifested in the beginning of the cooling off of the overheated economy (from July to Augsut respectively the industrial rate fell back 5.1 and 1.7 percentage points, and the investment growth fell back 5.4 and 13.2 percentage points). The chaotic financial order has been rectified, and the trend in the financial situation is toward stability (from June to August the urban and rural people newly added 109.9 billion yuan to their savings deposits, thereby greatly allieviating the pressure of currency put into circulation). The prices of the means of production are tending to fall amid a stable situation, and the adjusted market foreign exchange prices are basically stable. All of these things will certainly have a positive effect on the market price situation in the next year. From a look at the M1 growth trend, we see that the more than 40 percent growth for a time at the beginning of the year fell back to 19.7 percent by the end of August. This growth was lower than normal, showing that the latent pressure of inflation has begun to abate. If this level of growth can be sustained for more than a quarter, it is bound after half a year to produce a restraining force on market prices, the rise in prices will fall back, gradually returning to a range within 10 percent that can be regulated and controlled. However, in view of the problems in the first and second seasons that have been discussed, it will be difficult within a short time to effect fundamental changes, and the economy will suffer the inertia effect of high-speed growth and of the rises in investment still tending to be on the high side. In addition, the fourth quarter is usually the one in which the effect of currency circultion and financial expenditure is at its peak, and it is estimated that the present more than 10 percent rise in prices will continue for several months. For the year as a whole, the rise in the cost of living could range between 14 and 15 percent, of which the rise in cities could be near 20 percent. Therefore, macroeconomic regulation and control must make a point of preventing two tendencies: the first is excessive pessimism and the other is excessive optimism. A cautious, positive attitude should be taken, and regulation and control should be scientifically mastered, striving both to control inflation and to successfully attain the goal of maintaining a fairly rapid growth in the economy. 4. The key to controlling excessively high price rises lies in maintaining a basic balance in total supply and demand and in promoting the optimizing of the structure. From a look at the macroeconomic regulation and control measures to be taken in the next stage, we see that it will be impossible to completely eradicate inflation and that this will also not be necessary; the point of effort should be one that all sides can bear. Therefore, the dynamic should be to keep the rise in market prices below 10 percent, and the key to this is to enhance the management of the money supply policy and to make strict checks on the currency. At the same time as this, we must, on the basis of maintaining a basic balance in total supply and demand, augment the structural regulatory dynamic, and truly achieve a big development of the bottleneck industries and a rational regulation of the deposit structure. For this reason, we must reform the capital investment system, get a tight grip on setting up investment markets for basic industries and the infrastructure, and establish mechanisms that can circulate the assets of state-owned enterprises, further loosening and rectifying, and encouraging the forces of all sides to advance in unison. Now, first, we must continue to get a good grip on managing investments in fixed assets, and stop or postpone projects for which there is neither capital nor markets. Second, while putting a stop to evil practices, we must "open the front gate," step up the pace of implementing the "funds tray" in the plans, increase the effective supply, in particular support the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, and keep the promise not to just make a show. Third, we must get a good grip on building a unified market in China, devise sound market rules and regulations, break through regional blockheads, and promote the unblocked circulation of resources. Fourth, we must strengthen the legal system, stricly punish all acts that violate law and discipline, particularly cracking down on passing off the fake and inferior as genuine and superior and on driving up prices, and reducing the various kinds of noneconomic factors that cause inflation. Fundamentally speaking, we must prevent the appearance of tangible inflation, and, with dependence on the constant furthering of reform, form management systems and operation mechanisms that meet the needs of the market economy, switching the extensive business style of high input, high consumption, and high speed to the track of depending on technology, fine quality, and low consumption for success, and striving to improve China's economic competiveness and truly developing the economy rapidly and well.
