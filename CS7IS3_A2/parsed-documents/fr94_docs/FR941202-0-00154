FR941202-0-00154 FR941202-0-00014 2. RSPA Should Clarify Its Position on Dual Modal Coverage The Petitioners contend that the RSPA final rule does not make clear the status of employees who may be subject to both the RSPA and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) rules. The Petitioners state that the Common Preamble to the DOT final rules (59 FR 7301, 7377) ``specifically includes the example of an employee that is a pipeline worker and holds a commercial drivers license.'' (Jt. Pet. at 8). The Petitioners state that the Common Preamble states that, based upon an employee's major job function, an employer may designate an employee as either a pipeline employee or a driver for purposes of random alcohol testing. (59 FR 7337). Petitioners contend that DOT employees have made contradictory statements regarding this issue, and urge RSPA to clarify that employees who perform pipeline functions the majority of the time, would not have to be tested under the FHWA rules. RSPA Response. RSPA is granting the request to clarify this issue, but is denying the Petitioners' request to classify an employee, for testing purposes, solely by the percentage of time the employee spends performing pipeline functions. Therefore, no change to the rule itself is necessary. The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (Omnibus Act) amended the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 (now codified in 49 U.S.C. 31306) to require that all drivers of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) who are required to obtain commercial driver's licenses (CDLs), be subject to testing for the illegal use of alcohol and controlled substances. Therefore, a pipeline employee who is required by his or her employer (a pipeline operator) to hold a CDL as a condition of employment, and who is required to be available to drive a CMV as part of his or her job, is subject to the FHWA rules, including random testing. This requirement applies regardless of the amount of time that the employee actually drives a CMV or performs other safety-sensitive duties as defined in the FHWA regulations under 49 CFR part 382 (e.g., loading/unloading vehicles, waiting to be dispatched, performing vehicle inspections). The timing of any random test, however, does depend upon when the employee is performing that driving function. The employee may be subject to random alcohol testing under the FHWA rules at any time just before, during, or just after driving a CMV. If a pipeline employee may be called upon to drive a CMV at any time during the work week, then the employee is subject to random testing at any time during the employee's scheduled work shift. If, however, the employee is called upon to drive a CMV only two days a week (e.g., Monday and Friday), then the employee is only subject to random testing on those two days. In addition, 49 U.S.C. 31306 requires that a driver required to obtain a CDL must be subject to pre-employment/pre-duty testing. Therefore, a pipeline employee who is required to obtain a CDL as a condition of employment, and who is required to be available to drive a CMV, is subject to pre-employment/pre-duty testing under the FHWA rules. Requirements for pre-employment/pre-duty testing under the FHWA rules are contained in 49 CFR 382.301. With respect to post-accident and reasonable suspicion testing, an employee is subject to testing while performing either pipeline or driving functions. If an employee is involved in accident while driving a CMV, then the operator should look to the FHWA rules (49 CFR 390.5) to determine whether the accident is one that requires testing. Similarly, if an employee is involved in an accident while performing a covered pipeline function, the definition of an accident in section 199.205 applies. Conversely, a pipeline employee who is not required by his or her employer (a pipeline operator) to hold a CDL as a condition of employment and does not drive a CMV as part of his or her job, is not subject to testing under the FHWA rules.
