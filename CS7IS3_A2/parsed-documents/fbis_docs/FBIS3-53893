Do the security agencies have enough information on the terrorist networks, I mean information that indicates the actual magnitude of the problem? [Al-Alfi] Currently they are concentrating on gathering the information. I can affirm that gathering and analyzing information is not limited to just inside Egypt but has expanded to include information on terrorist activities abroad. There is coordination among all police agencies in this regard. As for statements on eliminating terrorism, I do not imagine we will eradicate and uproot the crime for good because crime has existed since man was created, since Cain and Abel. [passage omitted] We must be prepared to confront violence and terrorism. The reason behind the latest escalation is that the terrorist groups target not only Egypt but also all the Arab and Islamic countries. It has been noticed that the extremists and deviants have nothing to do with religion; they use religion as a pretext and use people with confused thinking in return for money. This was evident during investigations into recent cases. Besides, we do not wait for a terrorist act to happen and then react. [Zaki] Does this mean that the initiative is now in the hands of security agencies? [Al-Alfi] We no longer wait for a terrorist act to happen and then react. The initiative is now in our hands. Information is bound to flow to the security authorities now that the means of obtaining such information have been modernized. [passage omitted] [Zaki] Don't you agree that there is slackness on the part of the security officials in protecting a public opposition figure, such as former Libyan minister Mansur al-Kikhya? [Al-Alfi] First, Mansur al-Kikhya is a refugee in another country and not in Egypt. He did not take refuge in Egypt. We protect the refugees we have. As for al-Kikhya, he holds several nationalities and came to Egypt on an Algerian passport to participate in a conference of the Arab Human Rights Organization in Cairo. After the conference ended, he stayed on in the Safir Hotel without informing the authorities concerned. [Zaki] Didn't he tell anyone? [Al-Alfi] He came to participate in a conference of the Arab Human Rights Organization. He did not come as a refugee. We carried out our task to provide full security for the conference and nothing happened during the conference sessions. Al-Kikhya went to Alexandria for two days during the first week after the conference ended and returned to Cairo. During this time, some people contacted him asking to meet him and from then on he acted on his own. Intense security investigations are under way to learn about his movements during the week following the conference. To be precise, we must say that al-Kikhya did not come to us as a refugee but to attend a conference whose sessions were provided with full security. Investigations are continuing into those persons who met him last and into his movements and the places he frequented. [Zaki] When Major General Hasan al-Alfi took responsibility for the Ministry of Interior, many people, including me, expected that this would put an end to any torture inside prisons and detention centers in Egypt. It was noticed that the government agreed to host the conference of the Arab Human Rights Organization in Cairo for the first time, which is a great development. Mr. Minister, is the talk about torture still existing in Egypt true? [Al-Alfi] If there are excesses, they must be individual cases and not a common state practice. If such individual excesses have occurred, the perpetrators were questioned and some were actually put on trial. Judicial sentences were also passed against some and others were acquitted. Those who were sentenced are still serving their terms and some of them stood trial before a disciplinary court that punished them. These are individual acts and not part of the practices of the state, government, or the agency. [Zaki] Is that not policy? [Al-Alfi] Of course not. The recent persistent talk on this issue falls within the context of collusion between those who perpetrate acts of violence and terrorism and their defenders to confuse the situation and frustrate those who pursue and arrest the terrorists. Their aim is also to tarnish the image of police to delay them and limit their action. [passage omitted] [Zaki] It is said that a large number of convicted people are at large. [Al-Alfi] We have established a new department for this purpose. I believe that the police and judiciary's efforts are worthless if sentences against wrongdoers and convicts are not implemented. Hence, I set up a specialized department to implement the sentences, coordinate with courts, and follow up on sentences. Its task is also to coordinate with all the authorities that have fugitive convicts and suspects in pending court cases. It is a strong agency that has been provided with all facilities to arrest suspects and convicted fugitives, and we have achieved good results. [passage omitted]
