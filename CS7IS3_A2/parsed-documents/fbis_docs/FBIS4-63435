Nevertheless, all conditions necessary for stopping the war are present today, and peace completely depends on the will of the Azeri Government. Karabakh will do its best to reach stability in the region." The RMK military observers believe Baku is trying to build an image that Russia is unable to create peace in Transcaucasia. Therefore, the declaration of Russian Deputy Defense Minister Georgiy Kondratyev about Russia having to stop the mediation efforts, if Azerbaijan doesn't sign the agreement, is quite understandable.
