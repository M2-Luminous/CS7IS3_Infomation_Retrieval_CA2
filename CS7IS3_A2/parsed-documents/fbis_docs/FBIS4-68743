However, the information on it in newspapers was very scant and contradictory. At 11:30 on 11 April a large group of people, which represented the popular movement in Vologda and the city's entrepreneurial circles, gathered near the building of the Oblast Tax Inspectorate and the Administration of the Russian Federation Tax Police Department in Vologda Oblast. Mikhail Surov, deputy of the Oblast Legislative Assembly, headed this gathering. He was the initiator of the preparation of a petition on a change in federal tax laws and decrees of the oblast administration on local taxation. With this document those gathered resolutely headed for the building. The most interesting thing began then and there. The part of the building that belonged to the tax inspectorate and to the police was under guard. The ordinary passage regime existed there, about which two workers warned those that burst into it. They proposed that the petition be handed over to the authorized person. Next we will refer to the testimony of Lt. Col. Militia Vladimir Aleynikov, chief of the Division for the Protection of Public Order of the Administration of Internal Affairs in the City of Vologda: "When they approached the building, the doors were open. No chain of guards blocked the road on the steps, as some newspapers wrote. I was the last to enter the building. People began to push one another, women looked out of offices, some shouted, and hands were already `flying' in front. I rushed there, shouting: `What are you doing? Be human!' I confronted Surov's group. Only three people from the police in uniforms remained behind me..." The gathering and the subsequent "assault" were filmed by six(!) videocameras: [by the videocamera of] an expert from the Administration of Internal Affairs, [by the videocamera of] a worker at the Administration of the Tax Police Department, and by four cameras of entrepreneurs. Later this entire, not very appealing, action was shown on local television and in Mr. Surov's explanation was understood as a fight for the happiness and well-being of simple folk. Naturally, the author of these lines also became acquainted with the video newsreel and met with officers at the Administration of the Tax Police Department. Lt. Oleg B. said that, together with Capt. Valeriy P., he tried to accompany the delegation and to clarify whether there was a permit for videofilming. However, Mr. Surov with his assistants roughly pushed them away and a crowd surged behind them. Other workers were also subjected to beating and physical pressure. Two beat up Capt. Oleg I. from the Physical Protection Division (which is seen well from the recording), after which he was taken to the hospital with a brain concussion. The crowd of 50 people kept the building under siege for about 1 hour. Surov, like a true military leader, summoned in an emphatic manner "support groups" over the radio-telephone and the execution of orders was reported to him. Police workers were shamelessly and impudently pressured and threatened and unprintable obscene language was hurled at them. Here are only some retorts recorded by me during the viewing of the film. Vladimir Kirillov: "We will identify all of you at home! All of you are photographed. If you want to live in peace... (illegible)." Surov: "Enough of eating and drinking with our money!" In the end with militia support a semblance of common language was found with the overexcited "delegates." Five of them headed by Surov were permitted to pass for a meeting with Vladimir Zolotov, chief of the Administration of the Tax Police Department in Vologda Oblast. A press-conference for the city's entrepreneurs was held on the same day. This time there were no skirmishes. On 12 April in connection with the breach of public order the City Administration of Internal Affairs instituted criminal proceedings on the basis of Article 206, Part II, of the Russian Federation Criminal Code--malicious hooliganism (provides for imprisonment for a period of 1 to 5 years). Now something about the personality of the organizer himself. Mikhail Surov is one of the city's richest entrepreneurs. His firm, Provintsial, has stores, a canning line, a hotel, and a tourist complex, as well as many other things. Together with his associates he declared war on the "Caucasians" in Vologda and, in practice, was able to drive them out. During popular open-air festivals Mikhail Vasilyevich on a true merchant's scale treats people to free drinks and candy. Having become a state figure, a member of the Oblast Legislative Assembly, Mr. Surov ever more frequently speaks about the revival of Russia and of the city. According to him, the road to this lies in an uncompromising fight against tax structures. The sociopolitical and humanitarian activity of Surov and of the political council of the popular movement in Vologda is only the visible part of the iceberg. The invisible part, with its entire mass, represents only banal mercenary interests, naturally, "in preservation and increase." In 1992-1993 Mikhail Surov was forced to pay taxes of several million rubles. He tried to enter into "friendly" relations with representatives of tax bodies, but nothing came of this. Quite recently he had to pay an even bigger sum. Surov sent to the tax inspectorate in Vologodskiy Rayon a petition to have the added-value tax on export deliveries of cranberries and hides returned to him. An additional check was needed. Some documents evoked doubts: Accounting at the enterprise was quite entangled. And then followed the well-known action by the city's merchants. By the way, it is not the first in Vologda's history. A similar action occurred on 12 August 1993. Participants picketed the building of the City State Tax Inspectorate, carried posters with insulting texts, and burned documents of the tax inspectorate. Entrepreneurs with a criminal past were among the initiators. Incidentally, Surov himself was convicted twice. In all, he spent 7 years in a hard labor colony. Tax services in Vologda are under severe pressure. Every opportunity is utilized to discredit Veniyamin Alekseyev, chief of the Oblast State Tax Inspectorate. Over a period of 2 years, not without the influence of certain forces, the oblast administration raised the question of dismissing him, although there were no grounds for this. Commercial structures tried to involve Alekseyev's son in the performance of illegal transactions. Knocked out windows in the office and notes with threats on the door have already become the norm. Local merchants promised to publicly burn the effigy of the chief of the tax inspectorate. In March 1994 during a check of the Provintsial Enterprise Mikhail Surov tried to detain Lieutenant Stepanov, a tax police worker, justifying this by the fact that his identification card was forged. After 10 minutes an operational physical protection group arrived at the office and, thus, the provocation was stopped. It seems that present tax legislation suits no one: neither the state, owing to its low efficiency; nor the taxpayer, owing to its confusion and the large tax percentage; finally, nor tax bodies, owing to criminal "production costs." Gennadiy Khripel, chairman of the Legislative Assembly in Vologda Oblast, also believes that the demands of local taxpayers are quite reasonable, although most of them are sent to the wrong address. It is not for local tax bodies to change the laws! And so, was the "deputation" guided by a simple soul and ignorance? Alas, the action had quite a clear and tough goal: To intimidate inspectors and the tax police and to dictate its terms and, naturally, the amount of the suitable tax. In the city many realize this perfectly well. However, Vologda businessmen (naturally, not all) are not alone in their "holy hatred." More than 100 cases of violent and other wrongful acts against tax bodies, employees, and their family members were recorded throughout Russia in 1993 alone. They include nine cases of arson, explosions, and firing at premises of the State Tax Inspectorate; 15 cases of arson, firing, and explosions at employees' private property; nine bodily injuries were inflicted; 32 threats of physical reprisal and insults were made; two cases of compromise; four cases of the use of arms. Arson at buildings of the State Tax Inspectorate was carried out in cities of Monchegorsk, Ob, Iskitim, Sarapul, and Murom. An attempt to set fire to the private home of the chief of the Rayon State Tax Inspectorate in the City of Iskitim was foiled. A homemade explosive device exploded under the gasoline tank of the official car belonging to the deputy chief of the State Tax Inspectorate in Kurgan Oblast. In Pskov Oblast alone the number of such wrongful acts doubled as compared with 1992. I left Vologda and at parting the lads in camouflage uniforms said: "If similar things are repeated, we will act in a tougher and more decisive manner, including the use of arms, as the Law on Tax Police specifies."
