Speaking to the media, an army officer, Lieutenant (Malefetsane Mabuluka), said the army has made a concession regarding their previous demand for a 100 percent salary increase. He said they will accept any reasonable increase the government will make but appealed it should be in line with the present rate of inflation in the country.
