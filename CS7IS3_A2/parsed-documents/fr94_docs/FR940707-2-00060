FR940707-2-00060 FR940707-2-00038 [FRL&hyph;5007&hyph;8] Campo Band of Mission Indians; Tentative Adequacy Determination of Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Extension of Comment Period. SUMMARY: Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or conditionally exempt small quantity generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR Part 258). RCRA Section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate permit programs for MSWLFs. EPA believes that adequate authority exists under RCRA to allow Tribes to seek an adequacy determination for purposes of Sections 4005 and 4010. On May 11, 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued in the Federal Register (59 FR 24422) a notice of tentative determination on the application of the Campo Band of Mission Indians. In order to provide additional opportunity for all interested parties to review and comment on this proposed action, EPA is extending the public comment period beyond the original July 14, 1994, date provided for in the May 11, 1994 Federal Register notice to August 1, 1994. DATES: All comments on the Campo Band of Mission Indians' application for determination of adequacy must be postmarked by August 1, 1994.
