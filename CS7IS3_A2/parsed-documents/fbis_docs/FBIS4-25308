Speaking at today's closing ceremony of the general meetings of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), Song said that the community should continue its efforts to help establish a scientific and democratic policy-making system. In the main battlefield of the economic drive, all science and technology departments must do their part to help solve the problems which come up in the development of the country's industry, agriculture and the service industries, said Song, who is a state councillor. "Such departments are also expected to help spread the use of new and advanced scientific results in order to raise the productivity of all industries and lead the rural and township enterprises onto a healthy development track and upgrade their technologies," he said. He said that the country's science and technology sector must strive to develop environment-protection technology and develop as well as promote pollution-free production processes and methods so as to reduce and, eventually, halt the emission of pollutants. "Scientists and technologists must contribute more to the protection of the environment on which people of all nationalities live and advance," the official noted. To rule out possible mistakes in major policy-making, the whole process must involve the active participation of science and technology departments, Song said. He said that the Chinese science and technology world must map out its ninth five-year plan and a 15-year development program on the basis of science and democracy. The country's science and technology community should target some scientific and engineering projects that have a direct bearing on social and economic development. He also said that China should train a large number of young scientists and engineers for the next century and set up well-equiped research institutions and key national labs. From now on, the science and technology community should also reform itself so as to open wider to the outside world and expand international cooperation, Song said. He urged the CAS and CAE, China's two top scientific bodies, to cooperate closely with each other while tapping their respective strengths. "This will help develop the national economy and bolster the overall national strength," he said.
