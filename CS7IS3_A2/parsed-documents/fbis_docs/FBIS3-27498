During a span of 80 minutes, President Li answered 30 questions from Chinese and foreign correspondents in a tone of optimism and firmness coupled with plenty of gestures and vivid comparisons. In answering questions, President Li stressed that the world has moved toward a new era of regional cooperation and economic sovereignty after the Cold War and that the Republic of China [ROC] would make efforts in the three directions of peace, cooperation, and prosperity to strive for the development and stability of Asia as a whole. The following is the full text of President Li's opening address, as well as his answers at the news conference: President Li said: This unofficial trip served several main purposes. We deeply understand that at present, after the end of the Cold War, the international situation, especially the international economic situation, has gradually shifted toward regional cooperation. The further establishment of regional economic relations under these circumstances is a matter of great importance. There should be an exchange of views between the leaders of countries in the Asian region and the Republic of China [ROC] with regard to the various countries' conditions and their attitudes toward what the ROC thinks and does. This will be a great help to us. During my eight-day vacation trip, there were many difficulties caused by the absence of diplomatic relations. Despite these circumstances, after talking with and hearing the officials' views, especially from the leaders of the three countries, my conclusion is that the visit has yielded fairly good results. It is very important for our efforts to further establish relations of multilateral economic cooperation in the Asian region in the future. Through our current visit, we can see that all countries' views, sentiments, and respects to the ROC in Taiwan are more than we can imagine at home. This is a very happy thing. We should be grateful to the three leaders for their hospitality. One thing for which I feel sorry about this trip is my not being able to call on Chinese residents in each country, as we had to respect the host countries' arrangements. In Indonesia, I, in an unofficial manner, invited representatives of local Chinese residents to the place where we stayed to exchange views with them and understand their problems, hoping that we could find a way to solve the problems. In Bangkok, however, we were unable to listen to the local Chinese residents' problems. Here I would like to express our regret to the Chinese residents of these three countries. Our country's further development must be separated from ideology, with efforts being made in the directions of peace, cooperation, and prosperity. Although we met with uncalled for disturbances during our trip to the three countries, we did not consider them as very serious problems. We are convinced that the whole world will gradually understand that the ROC is a progressive country, a country which helps other countries, and a peace-loving country. Our endeavors do not reflect different opinions toward any region or country, including Communist China. Our efforts to help the mainland's development and our efforts to help the progress and development of Southeast Asia are all the same. We are ready to help the Asian region achieve development with Taiwan's experience. This is our wish and expectation. I am really grateful to you, ladies and gentlemen, for attending this news conference at such a late hour. I hope all of you will raise as many questions as you can. I will make my answers short so that everyone will have a chance to ask questions. I thank you all, thank you. [Correspondent] Mr. President, you have repeatedly mentioned and stressed pragmatic diplomacy, that existence would bring development, and that the ROC should have its own place in the international community before reunification. In your visits to the three countries this time, have you achieved indirect results in realizing pragmatic diplomacy and fundamentally facilitating return to the United Nations? [Li] Pragmatic diplomacy is completely based on discussions on economic cooperation. This trip prompted the Chinese Communists' protests against many countries, but these countries are all very pragmatic. In spite of the Chinese Communists' repeated protests, they, being ready to make friends with the ROC, maintained an unequivocal attitude, knowing the ROC is a peace-loving and free nation. As to the question of what actual benefits would pragmatic diplomacy bring to our foreign affairs, I think that the benefits to foreign relations through the current visit cannot be seen in the short term. We must take a long-term view and make contacts with many countries. Only then will we be able to see results. [Correspondent] In your opinion, in what way should Chinese all over the world look at your trip? [Li] We don't have a political agenda for my visits to the three countries this time. Everyone should realize that the ROC on Taiwan must develop. It is safe to say that the ROC is a country of a divided China [zhong hua min guo zai tai wan shi zhong guo fen lie zhong de guo jia 0022 5478 3046 0948 0961 0669 3494 2508 0022 0948 0433 5933 0022 4104 0948 1367]. The whole world should realize that a unified China is a goal we will attain in the future. However, at present the reality is that China is divided. As a divided country under separate rule, we should set the direction for our own development. This will create greater room for reunification across the strait in the future. Chinese all over the world should not approach this visit from a political point of view, regarding it as something that was intended to create one China, one Taiwan, or two Chinas. There is no need to see the visit in this way, and quite obviously, that was impossible. [Correspondent] Mr. President, your trip to Southeast Asia this time could be described as quite successful and very fruitful. Will you make further overseas trips in the same manner in the future? What countries or regions will be under consideration should there be any similar trips? [Li] As I have mentioned in my speeches on New Year's Day and on Lunar New Year's eve, this may be a year the ROC will develop a new direction for its international relations. Besides, I feel that it is necessary to somehow make the mainland understand this issue so that they can deal with it more pragmatically. Today is just 16 February, there is so much time left in the year. I think I will visit countries with which we have formal diplomatic ties and countries with which we do not have formal diplomatic ties. It is too early now to say which countries I plan to visit. We will let you know after every preparation has been made. This is the way such matters should be handled. [Correspondent] Your meetings during this overseas trip with the heads of state of the three countries without diplomatic ties with us constitutes a major diplomatic breakthrough, but the Indonesian foreign minister said today that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] conference scheduled to be held in that country this year will follow the Seattle model established in the United States last year, meaning that you may not be able to attend the conference in person. How are we going to resolve this long-standing diplomatic situation on our side? [Li] The United States established a model at the APEC conference in Seattle last November, but it is hard to say whether this model will be followed in the future. Therefore, although the foreign minister of this year's host country, Indonesia, wants to keep the model, future developments remain to be seen. Provided we keep on trying hard again and again in the future, the host country's attitude should eventually change. Moreover, clearly put, are there other people who understand the development of the Asian economic situation more than the ROC does? This is not an issue that can be solved within a short period of time, but I believe the future will be very bright. [Correspondent] Hsu Chia-tun [Xu Jiatun], former director of Communist China's XINHUA Hong Kong branch, said in his memoirs that the Communist Chinese leaders will not approve of Taiwan's recent active maneuver for international recognition, which they consider an action for independence in disguise. Such an attitude on the part of Communist Chinese leaders is bound to affect your unofficial trips abroad. What are your countermeasures for dealing with the attitude of Communist Chinese hierarchy? [Li] Is this the attitude of the leaders on the mainland? How are their unity and cooperation as compared to ours? As is known to all, the communists sometimes use very strong rhetoric in speeches targeted at others, which actually does not reflect the internal view. Moreover, what is Hsu Chia-tun's status? In my opinion, he belonged to the third-generation leaders, about the same age as Hu Yao-pang [Hu Yaobang] and Chao Tzu-yang [Zhao Ziyang]. Since he went to the United States later, what category of people does his mentality and view represent? How reliable is he? It is very difficult to judge the trend on the mainland based on his memoirs? His memoirs may reflect the view of some Communist Chinese leaders, especially those of the older generation with a strong ideology. Is this the consensus among the Chinese Communists? We do not quite understand his view. [Correspondent] Economic cooperation is the development trend of all Asian countries today. When you met the heads of states of the three nations, did you mention any plans for economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, such as cooperation with the ASEAN and Malaysia? [Li] Despite different national conditions and demands, all Asian countries will ultimately depend on foreign countries for markets. Japan and the four small dragons are currently the economically better off countries in Asia. However, assistance from a few foreign countries will not be adequate for helping one become well off. This is an all-inclusive issue. Cooperation with every foreign country will be helpful and our assistance to others will also be useful. Discussions with these three countries about mutual assistance did take place. For example, we discussed with the Philippines the question of signing an agreement on establishing free trade zones. ASEAN states are maneuvering to establish free trade zones. However, it remains difficult to predict the outcome. Ramos and I talked about this question and viewed it beneficial to both countries. Further discussions will be needed to decide whether this question should involve the ASEAN states. As for Indonesia and Thailand, we also discussed the question of developing bilateral trade. The ROC's experiences will be helpful for these countries. We view this quesion with an all-inclusive approach. [Correspondent] Despite Communist China's strong protests against your trip, the Philippines and two other countries have emphasized that it does not violate their "One-China" policy. Will this become a new diplomatic pattern, and how will it affect the future development of cross-strait relations? [Li] It will not have any effect. I believe that Communist China arbitrarily lodged protests time and again, probably because some of its functionaries, who are ignorant of world trends, wanted to win praises from their State Council by lodging protests to prevent Li Teng-hui's visit to these countries. However, such a way of doing things is very immature and childish. In my view, there is no need to worry about this issue. We will continue to maintain relations with the mainland. The focus of cross-strait relations in the future should be laid on searching for ways to strengthen mutual trust, so as to let the Chinese Communists understand what is beneficial to them, and we will not do what is not beneficial to them. I urge all of you not to take this issue too seriously. The ROC is a mature country. [Correspondent] You visited many places during your eight-day tour of Southeast Asia. Which of them left the most profound impression on you? Which of them is worth our using its experience as a reference? [Li] Whenever I visited a country, I paid close attention to its conditions, people's living standards, markets, houses, farmland, and the availability of water. I am very much concerned about these matters. We must not look down upon the developing countries as backward just because the ROC has achieved considerable successes on Taiwan over the past four decades or so. Each ASEAN member has its own strong points and shortcomings. For instance, having taken a look at Indonesia's plan for the cultivation of mangrove woods, I found we are much backward than others in this field of endeavor. Groundwater in many of our localities has a high saline content. To date, no one has come up with a very good plan to make improvement. However, Indonesia has already made efforts to plant mangrove woods and to use them to absorb saline content and to prevent the increase of saline content in groundwater. It may look like an insignificant matter, but it shows there are quite a lot that we must learn. In fact, due to different environments and problems, the people in many places have their own methods of struggle. Many of them are worth our learning. Instead of offering what one has onsidedly, the so-called cooperation should have both sides learn from and coordinate with each other. This is real cooperation. Likewise, we should look upon a number of countries in a "relative," instead of "absolute," attitude, and should thus learn from each other. [Correspondent] During your foreign visit, there were different reports on the so-called "westward" and "southward" overseas investment. What is your attitude toward our country's investment policy? [Li] The ROC's future economic development depends on its overseas investment. This is because Taiwan itself does not have enough economic resources. We are one of Asia's "four little dragons." Statistics on our investment in ASEAN countries, Mainland China, and North Korea -- countries which are less developed than the ROC -- reveal an interesting phenomenon: the more our businesses invest in a country, the greater the volume of trade we have with it. Thus, investment increases trade. We touched many of these issues in a conference on Asia's trade prospects last year. We believe we should not approach things with a suspicious glance. This includes the so-called "westward" and "southward" policies. The most important thing for the ROC is to increase its international investment; economic relations and trade are vitally important to us. From this point of view, the government has no problem with the so-called "westward" and "southward" policies. [Correspondent] Your unofficial visit to the three Southeast Asian countries, called ice-breaking journey by some people, was quite successful. Our country's status and your prestige and achievements in agricultural and economic areas have been affirmed in those countries. It is believed that the trip will contribute considerably to advancing our diplomacy, particularly economic and trade diplomacy. How will the visit affect your political life? Could you describe your state of mind and the changes it has gone through? [Li] During my visit to the three countries, particularly Indonesia, many people called me Dr. Li or Prof. Li. This was simply because many people, whether government ministers or business leaders, knew that Li Teng-hui accomplished something in the academic world and in agricultural reform. They knew what I did was quite successful. These countries hope that we will offer them good advice and help them in this regard. I am quite willing to do so, because it is a meaningful thing to do. Further, this will help us forge closer ties with them. In my talks with Indonesian President Suharto, for example, 70 percent of the questions he raised were on the issue of dealing with high unemployment rate in a country where the population is growing at 2.5 percent a year and on ways to provide appropriate jobs to the unemployed. Seeing that President Suharto showed great concern about this issue and was pleased with my answers, I immediately called Taipei by phone to send two sets of my three books to him to read. I feel it is very significant that my work in the academic work is respected by people. Whether it is an achievement or not, I will be very happy if anything I did is beneficial to the country. My state of mind has not changed. I would feel very good if I, at my age and with the last flames of a burning candle, could help improve the life of ordinary citizens and enable them to live peacefully in the country. [Correspondent] What is the biggest gain of your current trip? What is your mood now? How many points have you scored in your current trip? [Li] It is not nice for me to grade myself. Right now I am very happy. Before my trip to Bangkok, the mass media speculated whether I would meet with the king of Thailand. In fact, my meeting with the Thai king had been arranged in advance. Leaders in the whole world have a common view. Politically, it is necessary to have democracy; and economically, it is necessary to practice market economy, centering on the market. The communist and socialist countries also advocate market economy and freedom of market. Since leaders of the whole world have this view, it is quite easy to promote mutual understanding among leaders of the world. If leaders of the world hold more meetings and talks, there will be only some small-scale conflicts and a world war will not happen. Therefore, I am convinced that the civil war in Yugoslavia will not touch off a world war. [Correspondent] Would you tell us whether you have another plan to go abroad within one or two years? If you go abroad again, where do you want to go the most. [Li] The country I would like to visit most is the United States. As I just said, this is a secret which does not need to be mentioned. Whether the United States or the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan, I think I want to visit all those countries. If there are opportunities, the U.S. President, the Japanese prime minister, the British prime minister, and the French president may all come to hold talks. Although Taiwan is very small, the talks may offer some help to the world. There are many people with whom I want to talk to. [Correspondent] Mr. President, you have met with heads of states of the three countries in your trip. Are we going to set up a trans-ministerial organization to promote the development of bilateral economic relations with those countries? How will investment in those countries by plants and enterprises of our country be protected? [Li] In fact, the issue of investment in the Philippines and Indonesia is well known at home. What the public has not noticed are plans for rural development. As to how we will use our experience of agricultural development to economically help those countries, we have also made plans. We will examine this matter later and I will ask Secretary General Tsiang Yien-shi to take charge of the matter. When public and private enterprises make investment in the three countries in the future, our government will encourage and do its best to assist them. [Correspondent] Having visited the Philippines and Indonesia, do you find their investment environments truly suitable to Taiwan businesses? Do you not feel it is more important to improve our domestic investment environment than helping our businesses invest abroad? [Li] There are no conflicts between improving our domestic investment environment and investing overseas. The only problem is where to spend the money. For the nongovernmental sector, this is a question of capital distribution. Investment direction differs from one country to another. Financially, we have not yet reached the difficult stage of choosing between the two. We should realize why many businesses have invested in public undertakings in Indonesia. Indonesia produces a lot of energy. The ROC cannot advance and develop if it does not have a guaranteed source of energy supplies. Investing in Indonesia is a long-term national policy and absolutely necessary. Investing in that country is out of the need of our long-term national development. It is not the same thing as setting up a few small plants, like some other countries did. In the nongovernment sector, labor-intensive industries in our country will be replaced by investment in hi-tech industries. Therefore, there will be no problems of capital distribution. [Correspondent] The academic circles generally feel our foreign policy and mainland policy should complement each other. In your view, how can the two supplement each other? [Li] Our foreign policy proceeds from pragmatic diplomacy. Our mainland policy aims at promoting mutual trust across the strait. The two have no conflicts with each other. It is not necessary to view many issues, such as negotiations with the mainland, from an ideological perspective. The mainland should realize that it must not approach ideological issues with a "fatherly" mentality. I must reiterate that the pursuit of peace, progress, and prosperity is a worldwide trend. A successful diplomacy will become an important chip in our mainland policy. The two can supplement each other. [Correspondent] Did you discuss the question of Afro-Asian economic and security system with leaders of the three countries during your Southeast Asian tour? [Li] The question of Asian regional security system was not discussed. It does not help things to talk about how to fight as soon as you meet someone whom you have not come to know too well. The establishment of a specific security system should proceed from economic cooperation. Exchange of views on this will come next. The military aspect should not be made an important element. [Correspondent] In your view, has your vacationing journey helped upgrade our relations with the ASEAN countries, the principle goal of your trip? When you attend the APEC summit next time, will you be as relaxed and confident as you play golf? [Li] I am not confident of that. Making friends is not that easy, nor is it that fast. We must go slow in making friends. Take last year's APEC summit in the United States for example. The U.S. President and other people all hoped I would not attend. What would the outcome have been if I had insisted on attending it? We must not let others misunderstand. We must make all countries and people in the world respect the ROC. We must make them view the ROC as an extraordinary country. This was why I said then that I did not want to attend, lest people blame us for destroying the summit's atmosphere. Making friends requires five or six get-togethers to become truly good friends. This is also true in the case of countries. Between friends, some of the things must be done in an appropriate environment. For example, in an appropriate environment, I will ask the good friend: If you all can attend, why can't I? In this way, many things can be resolved at the right time. [Correspondent] Mr. President, what is your impression of the leaders of the three countries you visited? [Li] The leaders of the three countries I visited this time, including the king of Thailand, are all very intelligent and wise. They all have deep understanding of the local situations of their respective countries. For instance, Indonesian President Suharto has been president for 25 years and people think he always lives in his villa; but he knows the countryside very well and also has a clear understanding of the Republic of China. Our current trip has enabled us to understand that many leaders in the world not only understand their domestic issues but also show concern for international issues. The leaders of the three countries have seen many good points of our Republic of China. I respect them very much and our talks were very harmonious. They understood what I said and I also understood what they said. I admired them very much. [Correspondent] Following your visit to Singapore five years ago as "President Li from Taiwan," you made a famous remark: "Although not satisfactory but acceptable." During the current visit to the ASEAN countries, some people addressed you as Professor Li or Doctor Li although you represented the Republic of China in going abroad. In promoting pragmatic diplomacy in the future, how do you plan to make the Republic of China more dignified? Besides, since you can happily hold talks with leaders of the ASEAN countries, why can't the leaders of the two sides of the strait sit down to talk in a calm manner? [Li] This is a very difficult question. I am not criticizing them, but I think, among leaders of the whole world, the leaders of Communist China are most stubborn and ideological. It is impossible for us to ask Communist China to forsake one country and two systems. Under such circumstances, the best way is to act and they will naturally recognize the fact. China is in a situation of split. It is no mistake that a country needs respect. Some people invited me to dinner and addressed me as "Professor Li" and "Doctor Li." They were very innocent and I would not scold them. I think they have their difficulty in their stand toward the Republic of China. However, we should understand that the dignity of a country does not rest with addressing me "His Excellency the Eighth President of the Republic of China." Whether others think highly or not of the circumstances and position of our country -- this is the area, I believe, on which we should focus our efforts. We should be more united and work harder, and not think too highly of ourselves. Don't engage in "promiscuous" and improper acts just because we have tens of billions of dollars in our hands. We should win others' respect with our culture and moral standards. I am very willing to do more things for the country if there is an opportunity. However, things between our side and the mainland are very difficult before the time is ripe, and according to our judgment the situation on the mainland is not very satisfactory. I will study the question you mentioned in the future. [Correspondent] At present foreign policy lays stress on economic affairs. Mr. President, how shall we assist our domestic enterprises to develop transnational enterprises? [Li] I have discussed this question with Minister Chien. As conditions differ from country to country, the approach we take should also be different. In the future, we should examine more carefully the repesentatives and personnel we send to those countries, for it is not helpful if the personnel we send do not understand the conditions of those countries. Now, in addition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other units, even the Academia Sinica will actively discuss those issues. I will ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make an overall examination. [Correspondent] Taiwan's businesses have made considerable investment in Southeast Asia. Mr. President, are there any specific guarantees or measures for encouraging Taiwan's business circles to invest there? [Li] The number one concern among Taiwan businessmen in Indonesia and other areas is, I believe, their children's education, including how to build schools, hiring of teachers and principals, and curriculum. While in Indonesia, I invited four representatives of a friendship association. The government will address the questions they raised. They all hold ROC passports and we should help them solve their difficulties. We have $15 billion investment in Southeast Asia. This amount of money has been put into circulation, but we don't have a financial center to provide assistance. How goods flow into Southeast Asia and back to our country? We will ask Chairman Hsiao of the Council for Economic Planning and Development to study these issues. In short, we will simultaneously formulate measures in regard to education, banking services, freight trade, and so forth. [Correspondent] Mr. President, during your trip to Southeast Asia, did you invite, face to face, the leaders of the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand to visit our country? Will exchange of high-level visits with Southeast Asian countries become a regular, routine event in the future? [Li] I did not raise this question during the meeting with Thai King Phumiphon. As for the two other leaders, I officially invited them and their responses were very good. They certainly responded, by nodding their heads. We were extending an invitation; it certainly would look awful if they did not make any response, like nodding their heads. (laughter burst out throughout the hall) [Correspondent] During the trip, you emphasized promoting regional peace and economic prosperity in Southeast Asia on the basis of progress, prosperity, and peace. Some countries in Southeast Asia are set against one another over the issue of sovereignty of South China Sea. In your talks with the leaders of Southeast Asian nations, did you raise the possibility of using Taiwan's southern policy as a basis for a peaceful solution to the East China Sea sovereignty issue among the Southeast Asian nations so that they can jointly develop the resources of South China Sea? [Li] Your question coincides with my long-term view. I plan to raise this issue during my second or third meeting with them. I tried as much as possible not to raise sensitive issues during the first meetings. Because the meeting time was limited, sensitive issues would have made them uneasy and not want to see me again. I certainly would raise this issue at a second or third meeting. [Correspondent] Mr. President, you care about the aviation and space industries a lot. During the trip, you visited the aircraft plant in Bandung, Indonesia. Are we going to cooperate with Indonesia or are we going to jointly develop aircraft with Indonesia, Europe, and the United States? Will our country's Hanhsiang Company take part in such a cooperation arrangement? What is your assessment? [Li] I asked a lot of questions when I visited the aircraft plant in Bandung. I asked questions about the plant's operations, management, and sales. But I did not suggest cooperation. Why? I know the problems we have. They did not say anything about their problems, but I can understand. As for whether cooperation with Indonesia is possible, because all the planes they produce are for commercial use. [sentence as published] Indonesia has over 17,000 islands, planes are needed for transportation. The plant's monthly output of planes is about 170. Buying a plane is different from buying a car. It takes a lot of money to purchase a plane. Where will the money come from? Problems like these are many. For this reason, I have asked Mr. Ku Lien-sung of the China Trust Corporation to make an assessment, to examine all those relevant issues including operations, management, loans, and so forth. The Hanhsiang Company has not been officially founded yet. There are still difficulties in this regard. We will try to get a better understanding of the situation. I boarded one of their helicopters. It wasn't bad at all. [Correspondent] Mr. President, in your opinion, will your unofficial visits to the three Southeast Asian countries help in the ROC's bid to join the United Nations? [Li] If the road to the United Nations is 100-km long, we have covered only one meter. So we have to continue working harder and harder. If we do not try harder, no country would help us. If we work hard, even some big countries will help us in the future.
