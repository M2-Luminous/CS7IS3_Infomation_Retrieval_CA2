In Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Socialism has two very important aspects. First, it takes public ownership as the mainstay. Second, it does not pursue polarization." He said: "Our reform adheres to public ownership as the mainstay while seeing to it that it does not lead to polarization. This is to adhere to socialism." At the same time, he also said: "In reform, we adhere to two fundamental principles from beginning to end: One is that we take the socialist public-owned economy as the mainstay. The other is that we pursue common prosperity. The utilization of foreign capital in a planned way and the development of some individual economies are subjected to the general demand of the developing socialist economy. The fact that we encourage a number of places and a number of people to get rich first is also intended to enable more and more people to get rich and attain the goal of common prosperity." These remarks tell us very clearly that upholding socialism is to uphold the public-owned economy as the mainstay, pursue no polarization, and attain common prosperity. Although Deng Xiaoping did not say that public ownership was the mainstay in his important remarks about the essence of socialism, which he made during his tour of southern China, in fact, they contain this fundamental principle. First, speaking on the essence of socialism, he said: "The essence of socialism is to liberate productive forces, develop productive forces, eliminate exploitation, eliminate polarization, and ultimately attain common prosperity." Here he really did not say that public ownership was the mainstay. But it is impossible to eliminate exploitation and eliminate polarization unless public ownership as the mainstay is taken as a precondition. Public ownership should be what was meant in the remarks. Second, speaking on the special economic zones, he said: "The special economic zones are socialist, not capitalist." Judging from the situation of Shenzhen, public ownership is the mainstay and foreign investment only accounts for one quarter. Moreover, we can profit from foreign investment in such areas as tax income and labor service!" The important proof he based his statement that the special economic zones are socialist, not capitalist, is that public ownership is the mainstay. Public ownership as the mainstay is the economic foundation of socialism. There is no denying that public ownership also exists in other societies, but we must make a concrete analysis of public ownership as we do private ownership because there are different natures of private ownership, as well as different natures of public ownership. Karl Marx once criticized bourgeois economics for equating two totally different types of private ownership, saying: The first type is based on the producer's own labor, and the other is based on the exploitation of others' labor. The latter has grown out of the grave of the former. Public ownership can also be based on the laborer's own labor and on the exploitation of others' labor. The public ownership of capitalist countries can be public ownership as well, but it has not changed the capitalist nature and still belongs to the entire bourgeoisie class. The public ownership of socialist countries is based on the labor of the laborers themselves. Ownership by the whole people is that which belongs to the laboring people as a whole (since the state is the representative of the whole people, this type of ownership can be called state ownership), and collective ownership is that which belongs to some of the laboring masses. These two types of public ownership have eliminated the exploitation system. Therefore, by saying that pubic ownership is the mainstay, we not only refer to ownership by the whole people, but also collective ownership. Taking public ownership as the mainstay is different from the unitary public ownership pursued in the past. Practice proves that, at least at the initial stage of socialism, pursuing the unitary system of public ownership will hinder the development of productive forces. Our present principle is that we take public ownership as the mainstay, while simultaneously developing a diversity of economic sectors. At the same time, we are also opposed to privatization. In the experience since China's reform, small state-owned enterprises can be sold to private owners and shareholding state-owned enterprises can have their shares sold to individuals, but the privatization of all or most state-owned assets is out of the question. Today, there is a wave of privatization across the world. In this wave, there are two different natures of privatization. In capitalist countries, both private ownership and state ownership are capitalist private ownership forms, so privatization will not shake capitalism to its foundation, but rather, it may possibly consolidate this foundation. This is not true of socialist countries, where privatization is in fact the exploitation of all the property owned by the laboring people, and will surely shake and disintegrate the socialist economic foundation. Therefore, in upholding socialism, we must uphold public ownership as the mainstay. II. Public ownership comprises ownership by the whole people and collective ownership. Large and medium-sized state enterprises, which are owned by the whole people, are the pillar of the national economy and take a leading role in economic development. At present, large and medium-sized state enterprises are encountering many difficulties in production and management, such as decreasing profit margins, the slow turnover of circulating funds, escalating costs, the persistently large losses....There is no consensus about how these difficulties are caused. Some say they are caused by the economic structure. Others say they are caused by the system of ownership. I am more inclined to agree with the former argument. No one denies that at one time, large and medium-sized state enterprises played a great role in the process of China's socialist construction and had glorious years. But since reform and opening up, faced with a new situation in which a diversity of economic sectors coexist and market competition arises, they have appeared to be rigid and to be lacking in vitality. What is the problem? In my opinion, the management mechanism that originally suited the planned economic structure no longer suits the market economic environment. For a while, many enterprises find it very difficult to produce in keeping with market needs, as they are used to producing in keeping with plans. In the process of the changeover from the old structure to a new one, state-owned enterprises lag behind in changing their management mechanisms and encounter many new difficulties. For example, given the coexistence of planned prices and market prices, some products are produced by state-owned enterprises in keeping with mandatory plans and are sold at planned prices, while energy resources and raw and processed materials are fixed at market prices. Some raw and processed materials are sold at planned prices and their product prices are, in fact, regulated by the market. In this way, enterprises are bound to suffer losses whether these materials are "bought at high prices and sold at medium prices" or whether they are "bought at medium prices and sold at low prices." This difficulty is not present in other economic sectors, however. The main weakness in the planned economic structure is that planning has control over enterprises. This produces two consequences: First, enterprises are rigidly controlled. Second, a huge economic management machinery is formed. There are 70 to 80, or even 100 organizations in charge of projects, finance, and materials in each of our provinces. While such organizations exist in higher-level authorities, they also exist in lower-level ones as a must. The key to changing the management mechanism of state-owned enterprises is to change government functions, separate government and enterprise functions, and ensure that enterprises have their own decisionmaking power. But is it easy to ensure that enterprises have their own decisionmaking power? Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, China's urban reform has begun with the expansion of the decisionmaking power of state-owned enterprises. By having enterprises assume complete responsibility for profits, replacing profit taking by taxes, using contracted responsibilities systems, and experimenting with the shareholding system, the decisionmaking power of enterprises has expanded to varying degrees. In this way, many enterprises in the coastal areas have been revitalized and a number of revitalized large and medium- sized enterprises have also appeared in the hinterland. Approximately one third of China's enterprises have comparatively good performance. But the management mechanism of most state-owned enterprises has not really been changed. There are many reasons it has not been changed. The main reason is that the change of government functions has proceeded slowly, government and enterprise functions are not separated, and interference in enterprises is too great. In the circumstances, it is very difficult to ensure that enterprises have their own decisionmaking power. A comprehensive analysis of 16 key enterprises in 11 provinces and municipalities made by relevant quarters in the first six months of 1993 shows that, of the 14 powers provided for in the "Regulations on Changing the Management Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People," only five are basically ensured, namely, making decisions about management, purchasing materials and supplies, selling products, distributing wages and bonuses, and amalgamations and mergers. Six others are partially ensured, and the remaining three are not ensured at all. Therefore, in order to revitalize large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, it is first necessary to change government functions so that enterprises can operate independently. The 14th CPC National Congress report points out: "This is a big question regarding the superstructure suiting the economic foundation and promoting economic development. If no substantive progress is made in this respect, it is difficult for reform to deepen and it is difficult to establish the socialist market economic structure." For a long time, the profits and taxes turned over by state-owned enterprises have been the main source of the state's revenue (in 1991, the taxes and profits turned over by state-owned enterprises within the budget accounted for 65 percent of the domestic revenue in the same period). Under the planned economic structure, there was no big problem with the unitary system of public ownership and with unified state control over the revenues and expenditures of enterprises. Since reform, the problem has become salient now that enterprises have to operate independently, assume sole responsibility for profits and losses, accumulate their own profits, and expand on their own. Accumulation and expansion on their own is intended to make enterprises the mainstay of investment so they are able to carry out reproduction on an extended scale. But before tax reform, the tax rate for state-owned enterprises was higher than that for other economic sectors. For a period of time, they even had to turn over the "two types of funds [liang jin 0357 6855]" with the result that profits they could retain gradually decrease. In 1990, the actual profits retained by state-owned enterprises across the country within the budget only accounted for 8.9 percent of the profits they made. With such little funds, reproduction on an extended scale was totally out of the question. Moreover, with the low depreciation rate of fixed assets and the rising prices of procuring new ones, some enterprises found it difficult even to maintain simple reproduction. With their equipment seriously outdated and without the money to acquire new technology, how can these enterprises be competitive? Furthermore, the old distribution structure has created a heavy social burden on state-owned enterprises. In market competition, non-state enterprises can easily compete while state-owned enterprises enter the market with a burden and cannot develop smoothly. Of course, the backward management of state-owned enterprises is another important reason that causes difficulties. In short, the reasons causing difficulties for state-owned enterprises are very complex. Some inevitably occur in the process of changing the economic structure. Some have been left over from the old structure and have not been resolved quickly. Some are caused by the failure of specific measures in the course of reform. Others are related to the quality of enterprises themselves and should not be simply summed up as ownership problems. Moreover, is it not true that many other state-owned enterprises obtain very good returns and are competitive? At present, the external environment for state-owned enterprises is improving. The "Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations" are being implemented, the income tax rate has lowered, and the "two types of funds" have been canceled. We should, in keeping with the direction affirmed at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, continue to change the management mechanism of state- owned enterprises and gradually establish a modern enterprise system which meets the requirements of the market economy, which clearly defines property rights, whose rights and responsibilities are clear, which separates the functions of the government from those of the enterprise, and which is scientific in management. This is the only right path. III. When establishing a modern enterprise system, we must clearly define the property rights relationship. The CPC Central Committee's "Decision on Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" points out: The ownership of state-owned assets in the enterprises belongs to the state; the enterprises, as legal entities, possess all rights over the asset formulated by investments from various sources including the state, and become legal entities that enjoy rights and shoulder responsibilities under civil law. Simply speaking, the state is the owner of state-owned assets and has ownership over them, and enterprises, as legal entities, have rights over assets. This both guarantees that state-owned assets are owned by the whole people and clearly defines the rights of enterprises over assets as legal entities. The realization of state ownership in the economic field is that enterprises have to turn over profits and shareholding enterprises have to turn over dividends and bonus dividends. As for enterprise management, shareholding enterprises can select and appoint directors and solely funded enterprises can choose, hire, and appoint managers. The right to use and manage state-owned assets belongs to enterprises. Enterprises have independent controlling right over the assets of legal entities, namely, they can renew, amalgamate, sell, or transfer them on the precondition of maintaining and increasing their value. The major form of a modern enterprise system is the shareholding system or the corporate system. By pursuing the shareholding system, state-owned enterprises will not have its public ownership nature changed. As an enterprise organizational pattern, the shareholding system can accept different types of ownership, and by holding shares, enterprises can maintain public ownership as the mainstay. According to a survey of listed companies in Shenzhen, Hainan, Shanghai, and Sichuan conducted by the State Commission for Economic Restructuring and other units in 1993, through straightening out the property rights relationships, these companies got out of the burdens of their traditional subordination to the government, achieved the separation of government and enterprise functions, and were able to operate independently. This is mainly reflected by the fact that they have straightened out the interest relationships with the government and changed from being responsible to their supervisory organs to being responsible to all shareholders. They now turn over taxes to the state and profits to their owners, thus achieving the separation of profits and taxes, and enterprises have complete right over the use of assets. The previous practice that enterprise leaders were appointed by the government has now been changed to appointment by the board of directors. Regarding an enterprise's investment and project development, the board of directors put forward investment proposals to the general meeting of shareholders for it to make decisions, so the enterprise has both the decisionmaking power and the money at its disposal. Managers of the listed companies maintained that, of the 14 powers to be delegated to enterprises as provided for in the "Regulations," all powers have been obtained by these enterprises except for the power to refuse exaction of fees. The majority of these companies, of course, have not succeeded in obtaining these powers, however. Some of these enterprises are unclear about the objective of adopting the corporate system, which is to change their management mechanism, and often are enthusiastic about having their shares traded on the market, pooling funds, setting up new businesses, and even setting up "renamed companies," taking to the beaten track with new shoes. Therefore, we must not agree that changing the name of a company is the same as making it a modern enterprise. After state-owned enterprises have practiced the shareholding system, there can be state shares and personal shares. That is, some are owned by individuals and others are owned by the state, but this is not to reinstate individual ownership. The individual ownership Karl Marx talked about in chapter 24, volume 1 of Das Kapital refers to the fact that consumer goods are owned by individuals on the foundation of the public ownership of the means of production, and does not refer to the means of production. Engels, in Anti-Duhring, clarified this question when he criticized Duhring for imposing a future society on Marx, which is a nebulous world owned both by individuals and by the public. Engels said it was not Marx, but Duhring who was in this nebulous world. He clearly pointed out: "The state of things brought about by the expropriation of the expropriators is therefore characterized as the reestablishment of individual property, but on the basis of the social ownership of the land and of the means of production produced by labor itself. To anyone who understands plain language, this means that social ownership extends to land and the other means of production and individual ownership to the products, that is, to articles of consumption." I think this is an important principle of Marxism. In a socialist society, or even a future communist society, the means of production are owned by the public, but individual consumer goods are owned by individuals. Many utopian socialists argue that, in a socialist society or a future society, the means of production are owned by the public, and so are the means of consumption. This view has also influenced some Marxists. In the process of agricultural collectivization in the Soviet Union, it happened that not only were the means of production publicly owned, but they also were consumer goods. In 1958, when the "wind of communism" prevailed, we also wanted to make consumer goods publicly owned. All this conflicted with Marxist principles. Engels also made a statement about Marx's use of negation as a negation. He said: "Marx shows in a simple historical way that, just as formerly petty industry, by its very development, necessarily created the conditions for its own annihilation, so now the capitalist mode of production has itself created the material conditions which will necessarily make it perish. The process is a historical one, and if it is at the same time a dialectical one, it is negation of the negation." He did not view the reinstating of individual ownership as the negation of the negation. Marx was still alive when Engels wrote the Anti-Duhring. Chapter 10 on the history of political economy in its second part was written by Marx. Therefore, we can maintain that Engels' explanation reflects Marx's viewpoints. Finally, we should point out that public ownership is the direction for the reform of the state-owned enterprise system. But it is impossible to change all of China's state-owned enterprises into shareholding companies. Only some of the enterprises of capitalist countries use the shareholding system, while the remainder are solely funded or in partnership. Of state-owned enterprises, large and medium-sized enterprises are suited for the shareholding system and should be gradually built into corporations according to law. Medium and small enterprises can be leased out, have its management contracted on, and changed into the cooperative shares system, or sold to private owners. This will not change the principle of taking public ownership as the mainstay.
