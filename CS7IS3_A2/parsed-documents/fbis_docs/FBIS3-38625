Juppe and Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou had a 30-minute meeting, which concluded a short time ago. Earlier today, Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias met the visiting French foreign minister and discussed the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They also discussed bilateral issues, Cyprus, and Skopje. Papoulias and Juppe again stressed the friendly Greek-French relations and added that they agreed on all issues. There were no points of disagreement, Juppe said. Papoulias described the exchange of views as positive and productive. On Bosnia-Herzegovina, the French foreign minister stressed that a last chance must be given for a peaceful solution of the problem based on the European Union plan. But he stressed that humanitarian aid should definitely be safeguarded and recalled UN Security Council Resolution 836 and NATO's decision on air strikes. On Skopje, Juppe said that the establishment of diplomatic relations between France and Skopje was not an unfriendly act toward Greece. He stressed that France will contribute to establishing the necessary conditions for a dialogue between Greece and Skopje. On the Cyprus issue, Juppe stressed that France desires a peaceful and just solution within the UN framework. Asked whether Greece expects an initiative by the United States on the dispute with Skopje, Foreign Minister Papoulias said he does not know if there is anything specific. Before his meeting with Papoulias, Juppe met Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos. The French foreign minister stressed again the excellent bilateral cooperation and friendship, and expressed his government's full support for the Greek Presidency of the European Union [EU]. Juppe and Pangalos discussed all EU-related issues, including implementation of the White Paper, EU expansion, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's proposal for a conference on stability in Europe, and completion of the GATT agreement. Regarding the accession to the EU of the four candidates Norway, Austria, Sweden, and Finland, Juppe expressed support for Greece's efforts to conclude negotiations by 1 March. The French foreign minister said he found views converged on all the issues he discussed with Pangalos.
