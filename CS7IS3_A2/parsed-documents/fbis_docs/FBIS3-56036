The program begins with a claim that it would avoid a direct comparison of Zhirinovskiy with Adolf Hitler, although film of Zhirinovskiy reviewing young uniformed volunteers was spliced in with footage of Hitler reviewing the Hitler Youth. An unidentified moderator notes that: "We are a long way from comparing him with Hitler, although, come to think of it, Hitler also started with a small party of dissatisfaction." However, at this point, the moderator notes there is a comparison between Zhirinovskiy and Mussolini, stating that: "If we are to speak of an external resemblance, we do not recall the Fuehrer of the Third Reich, but his great Italian friend, Benito Mussolini." At this point there are several minutes of spliced film clips of Zhirinovskiy and Mussolini speaking. Clips from Zhirinovskiy's election campaign are shown, with commentary repeatedly suggesting that his election promises are not realizable. At one point the moderator states that "He promises everybody everything...but only one thing is missing from each promise: an explanation of how exactly he plans to do it all." Alongside clips of LDPR election campaign material, Zhirinovskiy is repeatedly shown in an excited and incoherent state, including two scenes apparently shot in a nightclub. In one clip Zhirinovskiy states: "Yes, yes, it's a wolf's life." "Generally my favorite activity is howling like a wolf. People have different hobbies, like playing the recorder, but my activity is howling like a wolf." He then states: "I can try to howl like a wolf if you like, I'd be happy to." The final sequence of the program shows a campaign clip of Zhirinovskiy commenting on the overseas involvement of Soviet forces. He says: "Wherever our soldiers may have been, in the Soviet-Finnish war, or the troops in Afghanistan, or in any other area, in Africa or Cuba, they did everything correctly. All the soldiers and officers who fought, everything they did was legal and correct." His final comment is: "If all that was legal and correct, what awaits us tomorrow?"
