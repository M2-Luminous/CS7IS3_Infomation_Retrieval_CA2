He will carry out his policies, focused on globalization and openness, by strengthening the competitive power of the country. His government will push efforts to ease economic and administrative regulations and restrictions to make a second economic leap in the new economic order brought on by successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. The government will try to concentrate the national strength for economic revitalization and increased exports through stepped-up capital investment and stable industrial relations. To achieve these goals, President Kim believes, the political foundation has to be stable first. He will, therefore, continue to remove factors that breed irregularities and corruption while adopting legislation on unified elections, political fundraising, and political parties at an early date. At the same time, the administration plans to redraw election districts in preparations for next year's local elections and undertake local administrative reform. An official at Chongwadae [presidential office] said Monday that Kim contemplated the three basic policy directions of internationalization, economic revitalization, and reform during his two-day new year's holiday. Kim's ideas include strategies for internationalization and openness in the wake of the Uruguay Round, local elections in 1995, parliamentary elections in 1996 and the presidential election in 1997, the official said. He regards the North Korean nuclear issue as the key to inter-Korean relations. He plans to map out multilateral strategies for the resolution of the issue. His government will work out measures for economic cooperation with North Korea and establishment of diplomatic relations between Pyongyang and Washington and Pyongyang and Tokyo if, or when, the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved, the official said. President Kim will actively pursue summit diplomacy for closer coordination with the United States, Japan, China, Russia and others to maintain peace on the Korean peninsula. He is scheduled to visit Japan in the first half of the year to be followed by a visit to Jakarta for the second Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the second half. The president is expected to spell out his policies in detail at his first press conference of the year and on other occasions, the official said.
