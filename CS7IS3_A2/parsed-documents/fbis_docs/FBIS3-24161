It is incomprehensible to me. The decree adopted by the Ukraine Supreme Council hurts Kiev more than it does Simferopol. After all, circulation of the ruble in Crimea would be advantageous to Ukraine. But I am not certain the decree will be implemented in all its aspects. Pretexts can always be found. [NEZAVISIMOST] Do your Moscow predictions coincide with what you found on the peninsula? Will prosperity for the Crimeans soon be attained? [Saburov] My predictions coincide in the strategic sense. But many specific aspects I did not even imagine in Moscow have come up. Now my work will proceed in two directions--strategic (altering forms of ownership, taxation, etc.) and operational. Reform is no joy in and of itself. And 1994 is not the most propitious year for transformations. First there was the freezing cold of November, then the lack of snow and very poor water accumulation. For Crimea these are very serious problems, fraught with additional adverse effects. I will not dare to deceive people--we will not succeed in improving their lives over the short term. But we should work to benefit Crimea. To achieve this I am using all my Russian connections and the influence of friends back in the Russian Federation. [NEZAVISIMOST] Seven of whom you have now carried away with you to Simferopol. [Saburov] This is my great gift to Crimea. My "seven brave ones" are first-class experts in various spheres of the economy. Right now they are working on the Crimean budget that will be adopted after 11 March. [NEZAVISIMOST] It is implied that these experts will exert a great influence on the work of the Saburov government. Do they include citizens of Ukraine? [Saburov] They are all from Moscow, citizens of Russia. But several of them were born in Crimea or lived there a long time. [NEZAVISIMOST] Has Yuriy Meshkov already settled the question of your citizenship? [Saburov] The problem is still being resolved. Therefore, I will wait until the results are announced. [NEZAVISIMOST] This is not the only problem. According to the Crimean Constitution, the president is the head of the government. You would hardly be able to occupy the post of prime minister proposed by Meshkov... [Saburov] This prime minister business is just a joke. But I believe the position of prime minister is necessary--independent of the president. Its absence in the Crimean Constitution is a philological mistake that must either be removed or glossed over. [NEZAVISIMOST] You have already become acquainted with officials of the Crimean Government and Nikolay Bagrov. Do you expect to be able to work harmoniously with them? [Saburov] Nikolay Bagrov, like Yuriy Meshkov, has given me quite a warm reception and it would seem he has no intention of creating obstacles. His relationship with the president is far more strained. And one senses a slight aroma of sabotage in the "upper reaches" of the government. It is possible I will do a little personnel reshuffling in the leadership of the Council of Ministers. [NEZAVISIMOST] In the opinion of experts, the political situation in Crimea will not permit you to carry out your planned reforms. [Saburov] Indeed, the political situation in Crimea is not conducive to changes for the better. People are too politicized. Reforms will move forward to the degree that mass meeting activity is reduced. [NEZAVISIMOST] Is it likely that thanks to cooperation with you, the first decrees of Yu. Meshkov will be economic ones? [Saburov] I cannot tell the president where he should direct his first efforts. But I well remember when B. Yeltsin signed his first decree "On Education." The consequences dealt such a blow to the budget that to this day we have not managed to recover. I will try not to permit such "fine gestures" in Crimea. [NEZAVISIMOST] But most likely you will allow ones "not so fine." Crimea will request more grants from Ukraine. [Saburov] As I calculate it, Crimea cannot exist right now without Ukrainian grants. This is getting more expensive for Ukraine every year. The final amounts of 1994 assistance are being determined and will be presented for discussion in session of the Crimean parliament. [NEZAVISIMOST] In the meantime, do you intend to return to Moscow? [Saburov] I will leave Crimea in a few days. In Moscow I will work through the material I have collected and draft a program which will then be presented to Crimeans for their verdict. After that--I will wait to see how my status is determined.
