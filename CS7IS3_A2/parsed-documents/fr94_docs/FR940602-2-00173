Adj.=Cumulative Adjustment.) The above factors for fee years 1979&hyph;1986 were taken from Table 5, Price Indexes and the Gross National Product Implicit Price Deflator, as published in the Survey of Current Business by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, February 1986. These factors represent an annual rate, based on the percent change from the first quarter to the second quarter of the indicated year. The 1987 factor of 1.026 is the percentage change in the IPD&hyph;GNP index from the second quarter of 1985 to the second quarter of 1986 as reported in the July 1986 issue of ``United States Department of Commerce News,'' a publication by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The IPD&hyph;GNP index for the second quarter of 1985 is 111.1. The 1988 and 1989 factors, were determined following the same procedures, using the appropriate year's publication. The factors for 1979&hyph;1989 in Exhibit 01 are shown only to illustrate how the cumulative adjustment factor used to establish the 1989 fee is determined. The factor was determined by chain multiplying the factor for the years within the base fee year period (for 1982 this would be 1.050 × 1.032 × 1.038 × 1.033 × 1.026 × 1.028 × 1.029 = 1.261.) See exhibit 02 for examples of applications. Exhibit 02, Sec. 33.1_Examples of Use of IPD&hyph;GNP Table The following two examples illustrate use of the IPD&hyph;GNP adjustment factors in exhibit 01 in determining the 1989 fee: (1) Example 1. A fee of $412 that became established in 1982 (first year in the fee cycle) would be adjusted to $520 in 1989 ($412 × 1.261). This would be the fee amount owed by a holder who does not accept the new term permit and would remain constant until the end of the five year adjustment period. If a new term permit is accepted, the fee would be phased-in, and the holder would be charged $439 for 1989, instead of the full amount. (2) Example 2. A 1980 base year fee of $315 would be adjusted to $464 ($315 × 1.473) with the actual 1989 charge limited to $352 for a new term permit. A holder who keeps the old permit would pay the full fee of $464 in 1989. Under both examples, factors for the years 1990 and thereafter will be determined in the same manner as the 1989 factor. Using the 1989 factor as an example, the index for the second quarter of 1987 as reported in the July 1987 Bureau publication is 117.2; the index for February 1988 in the July 1988 Bureau publication is 120.6. The percentage change in the index to be used to determine 1989 fees is 120.6 minus 117.2 divided by 117.2. Thus, 1989 fees will be 2.9 percent higher than 1988 for those permits that are indexed.
