The commander of the Khalid Bin-al-Walid Camp, operating with the Yemeni Command, told an INA correspondent in Sanaa -- who was with a press mission on a visit to the region organized by the Yemeni Information Ministry -- that the Khalid Bin-al-Walid and 'Urubah Brigades had inflicted huge losses on the secessionist troops, forcing them to retreat and surrender. The commander said the 25th Mechanized Brigade, one of the strongest units of the secessionists, 50 km west of Aden, was among the secessionist troops that surrendered to the forces of legitimacy in the battles that erupted on 12 May. Several Yemeni military commanders have asserted that a large number of citizens were supporting the forces of legitimacy against the remnants of the secessionists. The Yemeni government's forces of legitimacy are advancing toward Aden, the secessionists' key stronghold, from the following axes: the Abyan-al-'Anad axis, from Abyan, al-Hawtah, and al-'Alam, 12-15 km east of Aden; from the northern axis, around 80 km from the al- 'Anad Base, which is around 60 km north of Aden; and from the west in the direction of the Aden garrison (Salah-al-Din Camp), which is around 15-50 km north and west of Aden in the direction of Bab el Mandeb. Military sources say the fall of the al-'Anad Base will signal the collapse of the secessionists' main point of strength. The forces of legitimacy are currently in control of regions 4 km away from the al-'Anad Base, which is expected to fall within the next 24 hours, according to official Yemeni military sources.
