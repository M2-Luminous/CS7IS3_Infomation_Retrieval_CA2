This is the basic and consensual analysis conclusion diplomats from industrialized countries sent to Washington, Paris, London, and Bonn in the last 48 hours. They stated that the institutional crisis -- apparently prompted by a minor administrative issue (salaries) -- served to consolidate the return of the Armed Forces to the decision-making focal point of the political power. There is the possibility of extreme military intervention: a coup entailing the closure of Congress and the Federal Supreme Court, which are the targets of the executive branch. The analysts noted that this possibility is part of the scenario, albeit remote. One fact considered most relevant in all reports sent abroad was the comment by Admiral Arnaldo Leite, chief of the Armed Forces Joint Staff, who said the highest judicial court had adopted an "illegal" administrative decision: It converted its payroll into URV's [Real Value Units] on the day it paid its personnel. Information collected at Congress, the presidency of the Republic, Itamaraty, and military units, show that diplomats have been trying since the beginning of the week to evaluate the course of the crisis under the perspective of elections and the constitutional reform. They are unable to answer questions that are being discussed in Congress, like: Although part of the military is willing to stage a coup with the discreet support of some important civilians, would a "strong" government have any legitimacy following an armed intervention? Apparently, the military chiefs are more intent on exerting governmental tutelage -- like betting on the future (presidential succession) -- than on trying to establish the conditions for a dictatorship based on a model instituted 30 years ago. The domestic and international scenario, apparently, would not look favorable on them under either possibility. They could lack legitimacy at home. A poll conducted in Sao Paulo by Toledo and Associates was published yesterday by O ESTADO. It shows that only 1.1 percent of those interviewed believe "military action" is necessary to solve the crisis. The main international obstacle to intensifying military intervention in Brazilian politics would be the U.S. Government's alleged desire to prevent nationalist movements in the Southern Hemisphere from taking power because they could eventually oppose the development of U.S. strategic interests in emerging Latin American economies. At the beginning of the week -- with the crisis in full swing -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore visited President Itamar Franco to confirm his government's Another issue shared by foreign analysts and Brazilian congressmen -- to which no one has yet found an answer -- is as follows: If the hypothesis of a coup is unrealistic, what possibility is there for Brazil to make its democratic process logical and functional during the closing stages of the Franco administration with a strong military presence at the epicenter of political decisions? Also highlighted among the common points of the evaluation by foreign embassies in Brasilia as well as Congress was the level of frustration felt by middle-ranking military officers who were aroused by demonstrations of force by the Army, Navy, and Aeronautics commanders last week, and which was publicly endorsed by the president of the Republic. The consensual conclusion is that the "coup" -- in other words, military intervention in the political decisions process -- tends to become consolidated in the day-to-day routine under President Franco's sponsorship. This domestic atmosphere would be favorable because we are witnessing a virtual dismantling of the institutions. Itamar Franco -- The president's feeling has been in keeping with that of the military. He recently became irritated by the legislative and judicial branches' decision to raise their own salaries. He believes this is the most serious crisis his government has experienced so far, but promises to continue to abide by "the law and the Constitution." Octavio Gallotti -- The STF [Supreme Federal Court] president has changed his habit of talking little. He issues daily official declarations and upheld the court justices' decision to convert their salaries into URV's on 20 March. He shows little desire to negotiate, insisting that the "STF abides by the law" and upholds the autonomy of the judicial branch. Fernando Henrique Cardoso -- After negotiating the provisional measure to create the URV with the STF, the minister was taken by surprise by the crisis. Like Itamar, he canceled transfering funds to cover the salary increases. The more difficult. Inocencio Oliveira -- The president of the Chamber of Deputies has become the mediator in the crisis. He failed in his first attempt to overcome the impasse between the executive and legislative branches, proposing that the salaries of the public servants be transformed into URV's on 25 March. He promised to annul the session during which the deputies approved the salary increase. Humberto Lucena -- The Senate president changed his mind after trying to get the vote on the salary increase for legislators included in the order of the day. He has participated in meetings to overcome the crisis and asked President Itamar to become involved in the negotiations. He still criticizes Itamar and Cardoso. Ivan Serpa -- The Navy minister has become the spokesman of the military unrest. He called the legislative and judicial branches salary increase "immoral." He believes the government must not yield to "pressure" or it will become the "slave" of other branches.
