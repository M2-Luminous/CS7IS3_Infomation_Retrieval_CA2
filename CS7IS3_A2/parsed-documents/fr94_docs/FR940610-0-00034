ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Delaware. This revision establishes and requires Stage II Vapor Recovery Regulations for Gasoline Dispensing Facilities throughout the State of Delaware. The intended effect of this action is to approve these regulations to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act (the Act). EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule will become effective on July 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107; the Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and Delaware Department of Natural Resources & Environmental Control, 89 Kings Highway, P.O. Box 1401, Dover, Delaware 19903. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Catherine L. Magliocchetti, (215) 597&hyph;6863. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6608), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Delaware. The NPR proposed approval of the addition of section 36 and appendix J to Regulation No. 24, Stage II Vapor Recovery Regulations, into Delaware's ozone SIP. Delaware formally submitted section 36 and appendix J of Regulation No. 24 to EPA as a SIP revision on January 11, 1993, to comply with the Stage II vapor recovery requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the Act. This rulemaking action is approving the addition of section 36 and appendix J into the Delaware ozone SIP. Section 36 and appendix J requires Stage II vapor recovery at gasoline dispensing facilities which dispense 10,000 gallons per month (gpm) or more. Further discussion of the applicability of this regulation, as well as the compliance schedule for Delaware's three counties are outlined in the NPR. Other specific requirements of the Stage II Vapor Recovery Regulations for Gasoline Dispensing Facilities and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No public comments were received on the NPR. Final Action EPA is approving the SIP revision to add Section 36&hyph;Stage II Vapor Recovery and Appendix J, Procedures for Implementation of Regulations Covering Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for Gasoline Dispensing Facilities to Regulation No. 24, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions'' submitted by the State of Delaware on January 11, 1993. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. This action had been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). However, in an October 4, 1993 memo, the Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, Michael H. Shapiro, revised these SIP tables so that Table 2 final actions on which no adverse comments were received on the proposed rule may be delegated to Table 3 actions. No comments were received concerning this action, therefore, under the new guidelines this final action may be classified as a Table 3 action. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this approval of Stage II Vapor Recovery Regulations for Gasoline Dispensing Facilities in the State of Delaware must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 9, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
