[passage omitted] Meanwhile, the Russian cosmonauts and their colleagues from other countries will have to work on the Russian "Mir" station. It is true that the shortage of funds has had its effect on the state of the orbital complex. Launched in 1986, the station was meant to exist in orbit for five years. The shortage of funds, however, has lead to the fact that setting up a substitute--the "Mir-2" station-- has been delayed. Regular work is being carried out on "Mir" to prolong its "life". The "old age" of the station is already having a negative effect. It was noted at one of the latest sessions of the interstate committee that 661 defects have been revealed, including 18 during the period of the 14th main expedition (from 1 July 1993). However, these defects do not pose any direct threat to the safety of the crew. [passage omitted]
