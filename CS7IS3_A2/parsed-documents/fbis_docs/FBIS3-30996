He did not rule out that he would link the voting on the privatization bill to the vote of confidence in the government. Kovac and Moravcik, who head the alternative platform within the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], proposed to form a new government in which opposition parties would also participate. However, it would be a government without Meciar. The prime minister also claimed that, of the 10 HZDS deputies who joined the Alternative of Political Realism, not all of them would vote for voicing no confidence in his government. Speaking about the Alternative's proposal regarding a broad coalition government without political leaders, he remarked that the real purpose of this was to remove political leaders from the government coalition between the HZDS and the Slovak National Party. Meciar said that a broad coalition would not last because the parties would be bound together only by material interest.
