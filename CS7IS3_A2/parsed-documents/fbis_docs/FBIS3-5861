"I am sure the joint statement we have endorsed will inaugurate a new chapter in the history of the relations between Romania and the Republic of Korea and will help raise the general level of our bilateral cooperation," President Ion Iliescu said, noting the similarity of standpoints expressed during the Romanian-South-Korean dialogue. "Both countries are resolved to promote understanding, cooperation and peace in their regions and the world over," he said, noting that the end of the Cold War has failed to bring about the stability the world's nations expected and that complex and sometimes contradictory processes of restructuring interstate relations are taking place in the international arena, as well as a search for new structures of cooperation on a bilateral, regional and international plane. President Iliescu recalled the efforts deployed by Romania for integration in the Euro-Atlantic economic, political and military structures, stressing that it has managed to remain a factor of stability in a zone powerfully marked by confrontations both in the West, in former Yugoslavia, and in the East, in the former Soviet Republics. Likewise, the Romanian head of state said, "we are heeding ever more the relations with the countries in Asia and the Pacific, that represent a region with very dynamic growth rates and greatest development prospects in the decades to come." President Ion Iliescu noted that the Romanian-South-Korean summit talks emphasized certain similarities as regarded the development of the Romanian and Korean peoples, and especially the two peoples' aspirations to live in a climate of peace and mutual confidence.
