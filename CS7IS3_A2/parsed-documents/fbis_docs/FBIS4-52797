[Takemura] Both Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito have come to the front, which makes it difficult for the well-rounded Tsutomu Hata to display his personal coloring. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The withdrawal of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the governing coalition was triggered by the formation of a new alliance called "Kaishin" [Innovation]. [Takemura] The claim that under the single-seat constituency system the ruling coalition parties must be unified had come to the surface since the latter half of the Hosokawa administration. They tried all possible means, such as the formation of another new party [shin-shinto], a parliamentary alliance, a policy study group, a basic problems council, "Kaikaku" [Reform] and "Kaishin." We had the impression that their way of doing things was rough and we could side with them. A glance into the formation of Kaishin shows that they lack reflection. Their contention that the continued existence of the powerful Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] across the river necessitates the unification of anti-LDP forces leads to the preservation and encouragement of the LDP forces despite the fact that a political realignment terminating the 1955 system has already begun. A bold political realignment, including the LDP, should be implemented. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your stance toward the administration led by Shinseito? [Takemura] We cooperate with the present administration from the outside. We cannot become an opposition party until a budget bill and other related bills submitted by the Hosokawa administration are passed. We will make our judgment after a close watch on the policies of the new administration and on its method of implementing them. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the basic policies of the ruling coalition parties? [Takemura] We are generally in favor of the coalition parties, because their fundamental idea is based on the continuity of reform. However, serious problems are lurking in their security measures and their policy toward North Korea. The word "universal security" they used sounds like collective security advocated by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. That idea is a big logical jump from the past governmental view that "collective security is doubtful from the standpoint of the Constitution of Japan." The statement that "Japan will actively participate in the peacemaking activities of the United Nations" could be construed to mean that "peacemaking activities" include the dispatch of peacekeeping forces or even peace-enforcement forces. Why was the word "keeping" left out? Concerning the North Korea issue, it is stated that "if the United Nations adopts a policy, Japan will follow it," which could be construed to mean Japan will follow it unconditionally. Former Prime Minister Hosokawa replied to parliamentary interpellations that "if the United Nations adopts a resolution, Japan will cooperate with it within the limits of the Constitution." Compared with Hosokawa's reply, the current coalition parties have taken a rather bold step, saying that "Japan will follow even the policy of the United Nations." [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your view on the behavior of Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa? [Takemura] He is a tough man. I have a feeling that he is a little hasty. Everyone makes a mistake. If a man makes a mistake, he should examine himself and make a fresh start, but Ozawa does not do so. He just dashes forward repeatedly with great vigor, and it is difficult for us to grow accustomed to such behavior. The basic principle of democracy is to recognize the existence of different opinions and to coexist with them. Ozawa's behavior has left a deep sense of incompatibility in the political world. Some criticize the existence of a dual power structure. The Hosokawa administration should have essentially reflected on the activities of the secretary generals meeting of the coalition parties, and the idea of the national welfare tax was symbolic of their activities. If the ruling coalition parties band together, they can encircle the LDP and win an overwhelming victory over it. There is a possibility that a one-party administration or the administration of one-party plus something will come into being. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The Hata administration will face great difficulty in conducting state affairs. [Takemura] The government and the ruling parties will settle the tax reform issue in June. However, since there is no guarantee that the Diet will pass the tax reform bill presented by some political parties, the United States will be distrustful. Since the basic principle of democracy is decision by the majority, a minority government will not last long. Both Shinseito and Komeito will contrive to gain a majority by luring some Dietmen from the LDP and the SDPJ. If they fail to do so, there are no prospects for them. Then, they have no alternative but to start over again. However, if the electoral redistricting panel can draw up an electoral redistricting bill through an extension of the Diet session, we had better aim at the passage of the bill. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Are you thinking of forming a parliamentary alliance with the SDPJ? [Takemura] We will act in concert with the SDPJ, but that does not mean we will form an alliance with them. Before the upcoming election, we intend to form new, firm political forces ranging from the LDP to the SDPJ. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your political idea? [Takemura] The protection of the Constitution has become a word that connotes a specific color. We are thinking of using the the word "chiken" [the appreciation of the Constitution] or the word "kakken" [the revitalization of the Constitution], but we have not found a proper word yet. We want to publish our party platform, because we will soon greet the first anniversary of our party. We want to fly a flag which is appealing to a wide circle of people.
