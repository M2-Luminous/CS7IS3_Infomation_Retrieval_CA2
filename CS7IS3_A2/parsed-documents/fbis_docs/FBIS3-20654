Guizhou is the coal bin for all of the nine southern provinces, and rapid development of its coal reserves will go a long way to solving the coal shortages in the other provinces. The new projects selected for construction are the 2.4 million ton Panbei coal-dressing plant, the 900,000 ton Dawan shaft mine, the 1.8 million ton Jinwa mine, and the 4 million ton Feitian mine at Zhijin. The decision has also been made to expand the Dahebian coal mine from 600,000 tons to 1.2 million tons, and the Tucheng mine from 1.2 million to 2.4 million tons. Guizhou has complementary advantages in coal and hydropower, which makes it a major source of energy for the south. Construction of the 1,200MW Anshun power plant will get underway next year, and ground breaking for the Hongjiadu power plant with 540MW of installed capacity is in sight. Early-stage preparations are also being made for the 680MW Sanbanxi power plant, 600MW Duyun power plant, 2,000MW Goubitan power plant, and the 840MW Silin power plant. On the transportation scene, accelerated construction of the Nan Kun rail line, work on the Xiaoyunshang to Shuicheng, and Huangtong to Zhijin lines, and early preparations for the Duyun to Maolan line are all going on at the same time. In addition to that, construction will soon be underway on the first-class highways from Shanghai to Wanding (passing through Yuping, Guiyang, Anshun, Xingyi in Guizhou and into Yunnan), and from Chongqing to Nanning (passing through Zunyi, Guiyang, Duyun, and Mawei in Guizhou, and on into Guangxi). National authorities are also interested in construction of airports, such as the Longdongbao international airport now being built, and which, it is hoped, will be open to traffic in 1996, and small airports in other places for which early preparatory work is underway. Progress has been slow on construction of telecommunications in Guizhou. It was decided that in the "Eighth 5-Year Plan," two major cable lines would be built through Guizhou, one from Nanning to Kunming (passing through Xingyi, Anlong and Ceheng in Guizhou), and from Fuzhou to Chongqing (passing through Tongren, Kaili, Duyun, Guiyang, and Zunyi in Guizhou). These two lines, and the line from Guiyang to Xingyi that Guizhou will build itself, will greatly improve telecommunications to most places in Guizhou, and efforts are being made to get an 800,000-user stored program controlled telephone system with telephone connections to all counties and towns in the province in place by the end of the century.
