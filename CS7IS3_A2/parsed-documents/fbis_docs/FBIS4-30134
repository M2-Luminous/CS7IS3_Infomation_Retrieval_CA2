FBIS4-30134 "dreas122__a94008" FBIS-EAS-94-122-A Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Business Sector Distressed by Yen Appreciation Business Sector Distressed by Yen Appreciation OW2406104694 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 23 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 6 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2406104694 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The export industries, which are directly affected by the appreciation of the yen and depreciation of the dollar, are greatly alarmed by the recent rapid rise in the yen exchange rate. They claim that, "This is a serious situation that may offset all our strenuous efforts at restructuring," (according to Hiroshi Saito, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation). Yen appreciation is not only seen to affect business performance. "We are just beginning to see partial signs of recovery in the Japanese economy as a whole, and in automobile sales. We have also hoped that the substantial income tax cut would really bring about economic recovery. This will seriously impair the signs of recovery," (according to Tatsuro Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association). Many business leaders are seriously concerned about the effects on the economic climate and domestic consumption. According to estimates by Yamauchi Securities' Economic Research Institute on the adverse effects of yen appreciation, if the yen- dollar exchange rate goes down by one yen per dollar for a year, this will cut total profits of the 11 automakers by 30 billion yen, profits of the five computer companies by 16 billion yen, and those of the five home appliances makers by 11 billion yen. All Japanese companies claim that "the only way out is to cut costs by importing manufactured goods, engaging in overseas production and expanding overseas procurement," (according to Hideo Hirotsu, vice president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries). While they seem ready to take further measures to deal with yen appreciation, most of these businesses have already been grappling with this problem. They grumble that "this is beyond our self-help efforts," (according to Reiichi Yumikura, chairman of the Japan Chemical Fibers Association). Furthermore, many point to the vicious circle of further measures to deal with yen appreciation harming the economic conditions and business profitability in turn. Some assert that, "If this situation continues, it will accelerate the hollowing-out process in the manufacturing industries," (according to Hajime Murata, chairman of the Japan Petrochemical Industry Association). Others maintain that, "The prices of internationally competitive products will have to be raised, and as a result, this will further delay the recovery of business profitability," (according to Yoshihiko Wakumoto, managing director of Toshiba Corporation). For the above reasons, the business sector is asking the monetary authorities to "work for the stability of the exchange rates through the cooperation of the advanced nations" (Takeshiro Miyashita, chairman of the Japan Paper Association) in order to stop the further appreciation of the yen and depreciation of the dollar. It also wants the government to take additional economic stimulation measures, and implement steps to correct the trade imbalance as soon as possible. Toyoda says, "We want definite measures to vigorously expand domestic demand, such as continuing the income tax cut and additional investment in social infrastructure."
