The Iranian-born policeman and occasional legal translator had noticed -- being a professional -- that he was being shadowed. The stalker was identified: Mojlabi Mashady, a peculiar Iranian -- married to a French woman -- who specializes in import and export activities, is apparently known in drug dealing circles and is currently in jail. Above all, he is allegedly an Iranian intelligence agent in Paris, in charge of eliminating opponents to the Tehran mullah regime. Informed of the policeman's adventure, Judge Bruguiere set the DST [Directorate for Territorial Surveillance] and the Criminal Brigade on the trail of the "special agent." A proven technique which had already made it possible to identify the murderers of Chapour Bakhtiar in Paris, it proved once again remarkably effective. It revealed that Mojlabi Mashady, with an accomplice called Hossein Yazdan Seta, had also been "blacklisting" other Iranian political dissidents living in Paris, as well as on a family member of the former Shah of Iran. The small commando apparently intended to act quickly against one of the "targets," whose life was probably saved by preventive action by the police. A systematic inquiry conducted into Mojlabi Mashady's activities showed that the team had probably done some damage already. One of Mashady's contacts, incarcerated for drug-related activities, was questioned in his cell by the police. He revealed that he had been contacted by Mashady and taken to Tehran, where he had been offered a respectable amount of money to kill a dissident living in exile in Paris: Cyrus Elahi, a doctor and founder of the ODJ (Organization for Iranian Freedom) and a former lecturer at Tehran's Melli University. The young man had refused the highly detailed contract. However, shortly thereafter, on 23 October, Dr. Cyrus Elahi was indeed assassinated -- shot four times in the head in the entrance hall of his apartment building, located in Bourdelle street in Paris's 15th district. This testimony, confirmed by other evidence, was enough for Judge Bruguiere to jail Mojlabi Mashady and Hossein Yazdan Seta on Tuesday [21 December], for "complicity with murder in relation with terrorist activities." This is one more bone of contention between France and Iran, at a time when Judge Bruguiere is about to finalize his investigation into Chapour Bakhtiar's murder and has referred to the Assize Court the four persons imprisoned in France in connection with this affair. Moreover, two suspected murderers of an Iranian dissident shot in Lausanne have been arrested in Paris and Switzerland wants them extradited. So matters are turning more litigious and "sensitive" between Paris and Tehran. But can one let the henchmen of a foreign state "settle accounts" with impunity in France, turning the capital into one large shooting range against political opponents?
