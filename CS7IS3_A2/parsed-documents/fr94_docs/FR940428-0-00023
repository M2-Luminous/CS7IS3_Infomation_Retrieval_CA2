FR940428-0-00023 FR940428-0-00008 The limitation on the type of vessel navigation which would be allowed an opening will be removed; however, there is not expected to be an increase in the number of openings since the level of navigation on the waterway is limited to small recreational vessels. The rule will also reflect the bridge owner's name change from Seaboard System to CSX Railroad. Discussion of Comments No comments were received. The owner of the bridge CSX Transportation, concurred with the proposed change prior to the publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking. Regulatory Evaluation This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. We conclude this because the drawbridge has not been opened during the past twenty years. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Since the drawbridge has not opened since 1970, the increase in advance notification requirements will not affect commercial navigation. Because it expects the impact of the proposal to be so minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g.(5) of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusive Determination is available in the docket. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges.
