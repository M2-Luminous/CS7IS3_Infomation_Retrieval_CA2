One such friend of India is the president of the Czech Republic, Mr. Vaclac Havel, who is at present visiting this country. In no uncertain terms Mr. Havel has opposed the attempt to internationalize the Kashmir issue, thereby endorsing India's stand. Mr. Havel has asserted that the best way out is through peaceful bilateral negotiations as envisaged in the Shimla Agreement. Mr. Havel's stress on bilateral talks and peaceful negotiations stems from his abiding faith in the philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi, which revolves around the concept of nonviolence. This is obviously not the case of those who would like to violate India's territorial integrity. Needless to add, the greatest threat on this front is today faced from Pakistan, which has been waging a low intensity proxy war in Kashmir for the past four years. How else does one explain the fact that even as Mr. Havel was prescribing bilateralism as the best option, Pakistan's representatives were busy trying to move a blatantly anti-India resolution at the ongoing UN Human Rights Conference in Geneva. Is Islamabad really interested in the welfare of the Kashmiri people, or is it more more bothered about embarrassing New Delhi? It would appear that it is the second point that interests Ms. Benazir Bhutto's government more than anything else. That is to harass India. For if India had anything to hide about the reality in Kashmir, it would not have allowed foreigners access to the valley. Over the past year more than a 100 foreign journalists and legislators have visited Kashmir. As recently as last Monday, four ambassadors to the European Commission representing the Netherlands, Greece, Belgium, and Germany were flown to Kashmir for an on-the-spot assessment of the situation. Let there be no mistake about the purpose of sending a so-called fact-finding mission to Kashmir, which Pakistan has been pressing for time and again both in the UN and now at various human rights conferences. What Pakistan wants is a team of its own choice, preferably constituted by individuals who are favorably inclined toward promoting Islamabad's designs on Kashmir. Such a mission would serve the dual purpose of furthering the Pakistani cause and whitewashing Islamabad's nefarious game plan. It would no doubt try and suppress the fact that the Inter-Services Intelligence--ISI--has a finger in the Kashmir pie; that, had it not been for arms and material assistance from across the border, terrorism would not have flourished in the valley. Neither would such a team take note of the ISI training out-of-work Afghan mojahedin and then sending them into Kashmir to lend a helping hand to the separatists. Given this backdrop, it is becoming increasingly imperative for India to mobilize international opinion against Pakistani designs on Kashmir. Thankfully, given India's record as a leading members of the Nonaligned Movement and its democratic credentials, not to mention the role the country has played in promoting the cause of the developing world--something which Pakistan can never boast of--there are numerous people who are willing to lend their voice against Islamabad's perception. For instance, last week the U.S. assistant secretary of state, Miss Robin Raphel, who had audaciously suggested a couple of months ago that Kashmir's accession to India was not final and binding, was taken to task by two senators, Mr. Daniel Patrick Moynihan -- a Democrat and a former ambassador to India--and Mr. Hank Brown--a Republican. They did not mince words in criticizing the U.S. Administration for its South Asia policy as reflected in comments and statements on the Kashmir issue. Mr. Moynihan will soon be visiting India and it is hoped that the impressions he will carry back will improve awareness of the reality as it exists in Kashmir. *
