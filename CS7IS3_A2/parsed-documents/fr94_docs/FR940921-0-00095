FR940921-0-00095 FR940921-0-00016 45. Section 86.106&hyph;96 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §86.106&hyph;96 Equipment required; overview. (a) This subpart contains procedures for exhaust emissions tests on petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, and for evaporative emission tests on gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. Certain items of equipment are not necessary for a particular test, e.g., evaporative enclosure when testing petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles. Alternate sampling systems may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator. Equipment required and specifications are as follows: (1) Evaporative emission tests. The evaporative emission test is closely related to and connected with the exhaust emission test. All vehicles tested for evaporative emissions must undergo testing according to the test sequences described in §86.130&hyph;96; however, the Administrator may omit measurement of exhaust emissions to test for evaporative emissions. The Administrator may truncate a test after any valid emission measurement without affecting the validity of the test. Further, unless the evaporative emission test is waived by the Administrator under §86.090&hyph;26, all vehicles must undergo both tests. (Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from the evaporative emission standard.) Section 86.107 specifies the necessary equipment. (2) Exhaust emission tests. All vehicles subject to this subpart are subject to testing for both gaseous and particulate exhaust emissions using the CVS concept (see §86.109), except where exemptions or waivers are expressly provided in subpart A of this part. Vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' (i.e., phase-out) standards described under subpart A of this part are exempted from testing for methane emissions. Otto-cycle vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' standards are waived from testing for particulates. For vehicles waived from the requirement for measuring particulate emissions, use of a dilution tunnel is not required (see §86.109). The CVS must be connected to the dilution tunnel if particulate emission sampling is required (see §86.110). Petroleum- and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehicle testing requires that a PDP-CVS or CFV-CVS with heat exchanger be used. (This equipment may be used with methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles; however, particulates need not be measured for vehicles that are waived from the requirement). All vehicles equipped with evaporative canisters are preconditioned by loading the canisters with hydrocarbon vapors. Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from this requirement. (3) Fuel, analytical gas, and driving schedule specifications. Fuel specifications for exhaust and evaporative emissions testing and for mileage accumulation are specified in §86.113. Analytical gases are specified in §86.114. The EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) for use in exhaust emissions tests is specified in §86.115 and Appendix I of this part. * * * * * 46. Section 86.107&hyph;96 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraph (b)(1) to read as follows: §86.107&hyph;96 Sampling and analytical system; evaporative emissions. * * * * * (b) * * * (1) For gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles a hydrocarbon analyzer utilizing the hydrogen flame ionization principle (FID) shall be used to monitor the atmosphere within the enclosure (a heated FID (HFID)(235 ○ # 15 ○F (113 ○ # 8 ○C)) is required for methanol-fueled vehicles). For natural gas-fueled vehicles, the FID may be calibrated using methane, or if calibrated using propane the FID response to methane shall be determined and applied to the FID hydrocarbon reading. Provided evaporative emission results are not effected, a probe may be used to detect or verify hydrocarbon sources during a running loss test. Instrument bypass flow may be returned to the enclosure. The FID shall have a response time to 90 percent of final reading of less than 1.5 seconds. * * * * *
