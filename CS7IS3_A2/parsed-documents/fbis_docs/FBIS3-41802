An epidemic of the disease has caused a run on supplies, and yesterday Regent Laboratories, the sole importers, said it would have no more before October. A combined tetanus and diphtheria vaccine has been available from Merieux UK, but has also run out. Cases of diphtheria in Russia rose from 1,876 in 1991 to 3,897 in 1992. From January to May this year, 2,828 cases were reported. The epidemic is centred in Moscow, St Petersburg and Kaliningrad. The risks are greater for people likely to come into contact with Russian families than tourists staying in hotels. Diphtheria caused 2,400 deaths among 45,000 cases in Britain in 1940 but the disease has been beaten by vaccination. Dr. Peter Barrett, of the Medical Advisory Service for Travellers Abroad, said yesterday that although revaccination was recommended, the risk was not enough to justify cancelling visits to Russia.
