The most important change is supposed to be that BIS acquires the right to actually build a unit that uses intelligence technology. This means a unit that installs bugging devices of various types, monitors telecommunications, opens and examines correspondence, uses identification technology to control movement, etc. So far, BIS has depended on the Interior Ministry service in the performance of intelligence tasks. The ministry used its own equipment when BIS requested it, just as it did when the police requested it and formerly with the agreement of the prosecutor--today, the judge--and it passed on the results only to BIS. Of course, in this way, the Interior Ministry was well informed about the activities and subjects of interest of the Security Information Service. That apparently is the main reason for the endeavors leading to BIS's having at its disposal its own division of intelligence technology. According to the Interior Ministry Press Department, a transfer of these divisions from the Interior Ministry to BIS so that BIS would provide the services using the intelligence means for the Ministry is out of the question. That way, the situation would turn around, and BIS would be informed about police actions, which, in turn, quite understandably, the Interior Ministry does not want. So, it is most likely that two divisions with intelligence technology will be formed, one to remain with the Interior Ministry and the other to be formed by BIS. In addition to its being a rather costly affair, even BIS cannot prevent the participation of the Interior Ministry staffers in telephone wiretapping, for instance--namely, the Interior Ministry controls the so-called seventh chambers, which have been built in the telephone exchanges. The wiretapping usually takes place in these rooms. Hence, BIS will be independent only in the use of some other intelligence tools. It must be observed here that, in comparison with telephone wiretapping, the other intelligence operations are used less frequently. Moreover, despite the possible technical perfection, their application is more demanding on the professional qualities of the secret service agents. Is there another solution that would not be so costly and yet remain effective? There is one, although it may seem rather utopian and organizationally and legislatively demanding: to separate the divisions with intelligence technology from the Interior Ministry and not form them at BIS. The existing divisions would be transferred as a special section to the Supreme Court, the judges of which are currently deciding on the employment of the intelligence technology, or, possibly, to the State Attorney's Office. This unit would then, upon the approval of the employment by the judge, conduct its own service, including the use of the intelligence tools for both the police and BIS. In addition to the obvious financial saving, another thing would be achieved: a substantial reduction in the possibility of an eventual illegal application of the intelligence technology by the secret service and the police.
