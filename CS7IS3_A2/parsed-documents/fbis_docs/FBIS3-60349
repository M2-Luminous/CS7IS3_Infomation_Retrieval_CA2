Even though it is believed that serious effects of acid rain have not occurred in Japan, the acid rain recorded in Japan has been detected to have acidity equivalent to that in Europe, where serious effects of acid rain have been reported. The agency expects to monitor the conditions in detail by strengthening its monitoring system. Although the locations of the new stations have not been finalized, they are expected to be established to improve the monitoring network in some urban areas, some mountainous areas, and areas on the coastline of the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea to monitor the effects from China. At the moment, there are 30 monitoring stations in major cities, on distant islands, etc., with 10 additional stations to be established during the current fiscal year. The increase of 7 more stations beginning in FY94 will make a total of 47 monitoring stations across Japan.
