(and all assets, leases, properties, business and goodwill, tangible and intangible, utilized in the distribution or sale of groceries at the listed locations) or to any other relevant information, as the trustee may request. Respondents shall develop such financial or other information as such trustee may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the trustee. Respondents shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestitures. Any delays in divestiture caused by respondents shall extend the time for divestiture under this Paragraph in an amount equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or, for a court-appointed trustee, by the court. 6. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract that is submitted to the Commission, subject to respondents' absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at no minimum price. The divestitures shall be made in the manner and to the acquirer or acquirers as set out in Paragraph II. of this order; provided, however, if the trustee receives bona fide offers, for any particular supermarket to be divested, from more than one acquiring entity, and if the Commission determines to approve more than one such acquiring entity for such supermarket, the trustee shall divest to the acquiring entity or entities selected by respondents from among those approved by the Commission. 7.

After approval by the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court, of the account of the trustee, including fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of the respondents, and the trustee's power shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part on a commission arrangement contingent on the trustee's divesting the assets to be divested to satisfy Paragraph II. of this order. 8. Respondents shall indemnify the trustee and hold the trustee harmless against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses arising out of, or in connection with, the performance of the trustee's duties, including all reasonable fees of counsel and other expenses incurred in connection with the preparation for, or defense or any claim, whether or not resulting in any liability, except to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, or expenses result from misfeasance, gross negligence, willful or wanton acts, or bad faith by the trustee. 9. If the trustee ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute trustee shall be appointed in the same manner as provided in Paragraph III. A. of this order. 10.
