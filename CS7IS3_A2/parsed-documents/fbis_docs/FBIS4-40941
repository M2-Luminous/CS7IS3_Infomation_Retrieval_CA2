It Is Charged With `Overseeing' the Treaty on Accord"] [Text] There are already 863 signatures on the Treaty on Social Accord. Social organizations and parties account for 265 of these, entrepreneurial, commercial, and banking structures for 285. Fifty-two trade unions, 65 scientific organizations, 17 mass media sources, 10 creeds, six parliamentary factions, and others, have signed. These figures were cited at a routine session of the Russian Federation President's Public Chamber 18 June by Sergey Filatov, leader of the Presidential Staff, who was recently appointed leader of the conciliation commission implementing the treaty. Sergey Filatov said that, first, the agreement on civil peace is still open for people to join and, second, work on signing it is being stepped up in the regions. The operation of the treaty itself is already becoming apparent, in the Presidential Staff leader's opinion: At any rate, even the intransigent opposition has been forced to take account of public opinion and change tactics, giving its "protest actions" a more respectable look. Since the signing of the treaty is only the first stage of the journey down the road of civil peace, a conciliation commission is being formed to implement it; it includes representatives of all the branches of power. Independent experts will be involved in its work. Both cochairman from the Public Chamber (A. Sobchak and B. Topornin) will sit on the commission, as will the leaders of five newly created commissions: for political stability; for socioeconomic problems; for questions of federative structure and national relations; for security; and for problems of science, education, and culture. According to the president's idea, these Public Chamber commissions are necessary to analyze progress in fulfilling the Treaty on Social Accord and to elaborate recommendations for its implementation. Despite the optimism with which Sergey Filatov and Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin tried to infect members of the Public Chamber, many of the sociopolitical movement leaders present in the Kremlin expressed doubt as to the Public Chamber's prestige and political weight. The sufficiently trenchant but constructive criticism expressed in particular with regard to the president's edict on fighting organized crime also suggests that the Public Chamber does not wish to be a eulogistic chorus of "courtiers." If the chamber wants to be a truly prestigious body, one participant said, it should not only criticize the president's unsuccessful steps but also have the possibility of averting them.
