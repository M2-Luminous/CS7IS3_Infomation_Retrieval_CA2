The plan, known as the "professional insertion contract" (contrat d'insertion professionnelle, CIP), had aroused widespread opposition, particularly among young people themselves, who staged a number of demonstrations in various French cities against the plan. The announcement said the decision to withdraw the measure was based on "the results of discussions" held since Monday with representatives of unions, young people and employers by the head of the National Employment Office, Michel Bon. It added that government aid would be paid to any company hiring, for at least 18 months, "a young person who has not yet had a stable job." The aid, 1,000 francs ($174 a month) will be paid for nine months, and "the aid will be doubled for any hiring before October 1."
