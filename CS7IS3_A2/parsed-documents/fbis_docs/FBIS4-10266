FBIS4-10266 "drlat069_e_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-069 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AMERICA Costa Rica Minister Decries DEA Handling of Bolivian Minister Decries DEA Handling of Bolivian PA0804150394 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2229 GMT 5 Apr 94 PA0804150394 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] San Jose, 5 Mar [date as received] (NOTIMEX) -- Luis Fishman, the Costa Rican government and public security minister, said today that the DEA had brought alleged Bolivian drug kingpin Edgar Fernandez Lozcano into the country. DEA officials brought Fernandez Lozcano into the country without consulting local authorities, on a private flight on 16 March, Minister Fishman said at joint news conference with Rafael Angel Guillen, director of the Judicial Investigation Agency (OIJ). Fishman and Guillen ended 12 days of silence when Attorney General Jose Maria Tijerino announced that he was initiating an investigation on "the mysterious conditions under which the South American citizen entered" the country. Bolivian drug officials believe Fernandez Lozcano to be the right-hand man of Isaac "Oso" Chavarria's -- Bolivia's most prominent drug trafficker -- who is charged with bribing important politicians in that South American country. Fishman said the Bolivian drug trafficker "arrived in Costa Rica aboard a U.S. Government plane with registration number N55949." The authorities explained that Bolivians do not require a visa to enter Costa Rican territory, but they asserted that "we do not know why (the Costa Rican Government) was not informed of this matter." According to the Costa Rican officials, the drug kingpin stayed at the luxurious San Jose Palace Hotel accompanied by DEA officials and three unidentified Bolivian police officers. Fishman said that "the DEA's actions are a blatant abuse by this organization" because they did not report Fernandez Lozcano's arrival to Costa Rican authorities. Fishman said that Roberto Mendez, director of the Drug Investigation and Control Center, has requested an explanation of DEA activities from the DEA head in this country. The minister also warned that "we will not allow any more of their arbitrary actions." Fishman revealed that Fernandez Lozcano had left for the United States, escorted by DEA officials, on TACA Airlines flight 40 last Sunday. The Costa Rican officials said DEA officials had taken Fernandez from Bolivia to Panama, where local authorities denied him entry because he did not have a visa. They thus decided to bring him to Costa Rica, where Bolivians do not need a visa. The minister justified his office's previous silence on the case by saying that "Fernandez is a great witness who apparently knows a lot about the ties between drug traffickers and politicians in his country. That is why we could not reveal the details of his stay in Costa Rica."
