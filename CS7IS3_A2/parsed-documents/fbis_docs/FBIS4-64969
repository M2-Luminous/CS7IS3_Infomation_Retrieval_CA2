FBIS4-64969 "drweu091aa_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-091 Daily Report 11 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS EU, Russia Reach Agreement on Trade Accord EU, Russia Reach Agreement on Trade Accord AU1105121494 Paris AFP in English 1156 GMT 11 May 94 AU1105121494 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Brussels, May 11 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] and Russia have reached agreement in principle on a wide-ranging new trade, partnership and cooperation agreement, an EU spokesman said here Wednesday [11 May]. He said the accord had been reached by EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokin. It must still be ratified by the Russian Government and by the EU Council of Foreign Ministers which will discuss the proposed accord at a meeting here Monday. "The agreement is very ambitious," the spokesman said, adding that it was much better than a trade accord signed with the old Soviet Union in 1989 and could be formally signed within a few months. The accord offers Russia the prospect of a free trade area with the EU sometime after 1997 if Moscow has made satisfactory progress towards a market economy by then. It would immediately give Russia better access for its products to the EU market, lead to the abolition of many quotas and boost trade in such services as civil engineering, consultancies and telecommunications. The agreement includes regular economic and political dialogue and meetings at presidential level twice a year. One clause states that respect for democratic principles and human rights is an essential element of the partnership. The EU spokesman said the two sides had overcome two obstacles -- banking regulations and trade in nuclear fuel -- which had held up the accord for about a year. He said Moscow had pledged to exempt five western banks -- two Dutch, two French and one German -- from a recent decree that foreign banks could not accept deposits from Russians. The five banks were set up in Russia before the decree was announced by President Boris Yeltsin last November. The spokesman said the restriction would fall away altogether in 1995. Moscow also pledged to moderate its exports of nuclear fuels, while the EU will retain the right to act against sudden surges of the nuclear imports from Russia until the issue is reviewed in 1997. France has opposed inclusion of the nuclear fuel issue in the accord because it wants to protect its own nuclear industry from cut-price Russian competition.
