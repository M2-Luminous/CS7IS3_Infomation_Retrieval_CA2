Mr. Kantor failed to extract a "political decision" from Japanese leaders on setting numerical targets and the 6 trillion yen in income tax cuts, that the prime minister announced in the early dawn of 3 February, fell short of fulfilling U.S. expectations. Some U.S. Government officials are hinting at the possibility of the United States slapping sanctions against Japan, saying: "Now that Mr. Kantor's Tokyo visit failed to move forward Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, we have no choice but to take hard-line measures." Hence, the Japan-U.S. summit slated for 11 February is highly likely to be held in an uncomfortable atmosphere. At meetings with Prime Minister Hosokawa and Finance Minister Fujii, Mr. Kantor highly spoke of the government's decision to cut the income tax, but a U.S. Government source in Tokyo complained about the size of the income tax cut, saying: "The income tax reduction is short 1-2 trillion yen from what the U.S. Government expected." The prevailing view is that Mr. Kantor refrained from expressing his unhappiness with the size of the income tax cut after concluding that any further U.S. pressure on the Hosokawa government, beset with the issue of securing financial resources to make up for a fiscal shortfall incurring from the income tax reduction, will not serve the interests of the United States. For the United States, Prime Minister Hosokawa is the only Japanese leader who can decide on Japan's concessions at the talks. During his Japan stay, Mr. Kantor took a very tough attitude at a series of meetings with the prime minister and cabinet ministers. At a 2 February meeting with Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, the American official said: "Japan and the United States are engaged in the three pillars of economy, security, and international cooperation." His statement meant not to stress the importance of bilateral matters other than the bilateral economic issue, but to suggest that if the bilateral economic issue is not resolved, it would undermine the entire Japan-U.S. relationship, including international cooperation and security. His statement can be taken as a strong U.S. resolve that it will not hesitate to review Japan-U.S. relations that [President Clinton once called] the "most important bilateral relations in the world."
