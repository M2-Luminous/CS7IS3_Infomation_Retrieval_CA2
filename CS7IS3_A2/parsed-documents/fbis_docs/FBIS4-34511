The Advisory Group for Nicaragua said the two $75-million financial aid installments for 1994 and 1995 will be used to boost the economic development of that Central American nation. At the conclusion of a two-day, closed-door meeting, Edilberto Segura, World Bank director for Mexico, Central America, and Panama, remarked on Nicaragua's democratic progress in 1993. The donor countries asked the Nicaraguan Government to focus on fighting poverty, reducing the foreign debt, modernizing the public sector, and settling property disputes. Mark Schneider, deputy director of the U.S. Agency for International Development's Latin American and Caribbean division, said: "The poorest of the poor must be the main beneficiaries of this financial aid." The World Bank said the main challenge for Latin America "is to promote and sustain balanced growth while maintaining economic stability in view of possible reductions in international financial aid." Nicaraguan Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo, who headed the Nicaraguan delegation, said "the only war we can wage now is a war on poverty," adding that "the armed conflict, totalitarianism, and backwardness must be left behind." The government official asked the World Bank and the IMF to expedite their disbursements and increase their co-financing. Lacayo emphasized that it is necessary for them to provide $60 million annually to increase funds to invest in rural production, especially small-scale production. The Advisory Group meeting took place at the Paris World Bank quarters and was attended by delegates from Germany, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, and Mexico. Representatives from Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, the United States, and Venezuela were also present, as were World Bank and IMF officials. The Pan-American Health Organization, UNICEF, the OECD, and the International Agricultural Development Fund also attended the meeting.
