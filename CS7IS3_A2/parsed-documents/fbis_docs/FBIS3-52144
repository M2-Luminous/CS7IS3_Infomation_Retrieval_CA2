Thousands of artillery shells, bullets, and rockets have hit various districts of Kabul, leaving hundreds dead. Here is our colleague with a telephone report from Kabul on the situation: [Unidentified correspondent] I am reporting from Kabul. The battle between the warring factions intensified this morning. As a result of artillery fire, Kabul radio's transmitter is out of action. Forces of Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] have joined General Dostam's forces, and forces loyal to Hezb-e Ettehad-e Eslami [Islamic Union of Afghanistan] of Rasul Sayyaf have joined those of President Borhanoddin Rabbani, and have turned Kabul into a battle arena since dawn this morning. Another report from Kabul's hospitals indicate that 650 wounded people, mostly civilians, are hospitalized in two city hospitals. Reports from the southeastern district of Kabul, the main area of concentration of General Dostam's forces, indicate that the intensity of the clashes prevents the people from evacuating their dead and wounded from houses. Columns of thick smoke cover the sky above Kabul and in the city itself nothing but the fire of artillery exchanges is visible.
