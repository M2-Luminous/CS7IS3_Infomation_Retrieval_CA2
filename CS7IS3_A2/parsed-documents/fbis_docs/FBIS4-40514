The establishment of Ukraine as an independent and sovereign state is only possible under conditions of a reliably functioning economy. It should be based on an integral and effective economic system. It is promoting the creation of this economic system that these main principles, as the legal basis of (strengthening) control of the economy by the state, are called upon. The methodological approaches that the main principles are based on envisage a systematic and comprehensive nature of setting up the state regulation of the economy, taking account of its organic synthesis with market regulators and the developed countries' postwar historic experience of overcoming crisis. The main principles originate from objectively analyzing the cause, nature, and scale of the systemic crisis in Ukraine and the persistently continuing trend of its deterioration. After two years, state authorities have failed to make effective use of Ukraine's high scientific and technological level, rich land resources, and its people's great industriousness. The analysis shows that the state of the economy endangers Ukraine's sovereignty. Large-scale deindustrialization of the economy is being carried out, with hi-tech industries degrading most of all. The average annual rate of the decline in the production sphere is more than 13 percent, and almost 30 percent over the first six months of this year. The production indices have decreased by 50 percent as far as the 50 most important kinds of products are concerned. Construction has been sharply curtailed. The average annual decline in agricultural production exceeded 18 percent. As to the consumption of animal husbandry products, Ukraine has been thrown back 30 years. As compared with the developed countries, the production of meat, milk, and eggs per capita amounts to only 60 percent. The main causes of the crisis are the absence of a clear-cut political and socioeconomic strategy of Ukraine's development, the chaotic destruction of the planned-administrative system of management without it being adequately replaced by the market mechanisms and infrastructure, the collapse of the USSR national-economic complex, and the fact that the mechanisms of Ukraine's independent economy functioning have not been formed, distorted formation of a market economy by means of a mechanical implantation of the other countries' experience in the national soil, ill-considered liberalization of prices and foreign economic activity and privatization, boosted by the inadequacy of the legal basis and the absence of a reliable state regulation, the unskillful sale and appropriation of national property, penetration of crime elements into the economic activity, partial merger of the state apparatus with the shadow structures, absence of an economic mechanism of the mixed economy functioning, groundless hopes that in conditions of a transition toward market economy the state alienates itself from the economy. [passage omitted] I believe that the state withdrawing from control over the economy and the role of market self-regulation being groundlessly exaggerated in the economic policy of Ukraine's power structures, were some of the main causes of the economic crisis. The main principles make provision for the necessary adjustments in the government's actions in order to establish the optimal ratio between state and market regulators in the economic system. The aims and sequence of state regulation are as follows: The main and the nearest objective of the state control over the economy, which is determined by the main principles, is to stop the crisis and stabilize the socioeconomic situation in Ukraine. The strategic objective of the socioeconomic transformations in all spheres of life is to bring Ukraine to the way of building a society of progressive development with the state being subordinated to citizens's interests in real terms. Generally speaking, in terms of economy this means the creation of highly developed production, financial, scientific and technical infrastructure of Ukraine's economy, ensuring highly technological energy and resources-saving and ecologically safe development of all its industries and their competitiveness on the world market, ensuring Ukraine's accession to the world community on an equal footing with other states. As far as the protection of the state is concerned, the objective is to ensure the high enough military might of the country and the ability to protect and defend its territorial integrity and national interests. In the social and cultural spheres the objective is to ensure the modernization of the high scientific and technical level of production, consolidation of the positions of Ukraine's science in the world on the basis of raising the general education level of citizens, guaranteeing possibilities for them to receive proper education and qualification, creating conditions for the all-round development of all the branches of culture, literature, and the arts, multiplying the features of high spirituality inherent in the people of Ukraine. [passage omitted] The socioeconomic transformations will be implemented in three stages. A considerable part of the tasks, envisaged at these stages, will be simultaneous, i.e. will coincide and be held as a set. The first stage is the determination of the state priorities and mechanisms to ensure them, a gradual transfer from chaotic economic relations to regulated market relations. The task of this stage is to stop the decline in production and begin to raise it, stabilization and implementation of an effective employment program. During the first stage it is envisaged to create by the end of 1995 favorable economic conditions for the effective industries and enterprises of all forms of ownership that determine the economic potential of the state. At the same time production units lacking prospects will be closed down gradually, with those employed at these production units being socially protected. [passage omitted] The second stage is stabilization. At this stage a reliable stabilization of production is achieved approximately by the end of 1997. A gradual increase in output begins. At the end of this stage the output of industrial and agricultural products, most probably excluding animal husbandry products, should reach the level of the late 1980's, with the improved structure of these products and their significantly higher quality. During this time it is necessary to create the required industrial capacities to ensure the priority trends in the development of the economy, especially for agriculture and the processing industry, to stimulate an increase in the volume of capital construction and modernization of enterprises, housing construction, the development of the social and market infrastructure with conditions being created for the involvement of the money of the enterprises that do not belong to the state. [passage omitted] The third stage is socioeconomic growth. The effective implementation of the tasks of the first two stages should create a reliable basis for the country's entry to the next stage of the socioeconomic development. In general terms, its main task is to complete the structural reorganization, to form an effective, competitive, socially-oriented market economy, develop and introduce the world standard technologies along the main trends of the scientific and technical progress, to bring the Ukrainian citizens' living standards closer to the level of the industrially developed countries. The main prerequisites of state regulation policy are these: Laying the main foundation of state regulation in the economy must take account of certain social, political, and organizational conditions of principal importance. Among them the category of social conditions should include such areas as the social security of the population, maintenance of its living standards at a level no lower than the poverty line, and provision for constitutional and social guarantees of this. The political conditions are state independence, international cooperation, and good-neighborliness, developing democracy and self-government, strengthening society's legal basis, and political accord in society. The organizational and economic conditions are ensuring the stability of the economic system, averting shock methods in economic transformation, supporting economic, scientific and technological priorities, stopping the fall and ensuring an increase in the productivity of agriculture, and production in society in general. The state management of the economy must be carried out comprehensively and extend to all spheres of production in society, i.e. production proper, distributive relations, the sphere of monetary circulation and eventual consumption. Let us look at the directions and methods of influencing economic development. The menacing depth of the crisis requires the lack of state control over the main economic processes in Ukraine to be ended. The effectiveness of the following changes depends upon the precision of the steps opted for at the first stage. It is exactly these steps that the document focuses on. The aim and form of implementing structural changes is as follows: The main form of making structural changes is a policy of state priorities based on drawing up national programs and the state stimulating them. The aim of the state priorities policy is supporting the quicker development of the national economy industries and enterprises manufacturing competitive goods of priority importance. One should remember that the real state of Ukraine's economy in the past and at present, its unique level of concentration and integration with neighboring countries, combined with the incomplete technological cycles, naturally requires the use of large-scale (organizational) and economic formations, including between industries, functioning on the basis of diverse forms of ownership and up-to-date scientific and technological policy. [passage omitted] Ensuring a balanced development of regions, with their speciality and orientation taken into consideration; overcoming structural deformations, which of late have become worse and, under these conditions, Ukraine retaining productivity; organizing effective cooperation in production between enterprises and industries within Ukraine, and restoring the necessary economic ties within the framework of the CIS and with other world countries, and establishing new relations. The policy of restructuring must be consistent and gradual and make use of pin-point investment; (a new type of) cooperation between enterprises, targeting complete technological cycles within the state; institution of national and transnational companies on the basis of various forms of ownership; competition between enterprises of raw materials and semi-raw material industries, on the one hand, and machine building industries, including those with the participation of foreign investors, on the other; diversification of industries and (purposeful) programs of restructuring; and gradual shutdown of unproductive enterprises. [passage omitted] Provision is made for transforming facilities, and, at the same time, forming a normative basis to restructure the machine-building complex in order for it to manufacture components for common use in industry, agriculture, and processing; and ensuring a rise in the volumes of enterprises' reconstruction, housing construction, and the social infrastructure. [passage omitted] In view of Ukraine's economic, scientific, and technological potential, the needs of its population and the task of entering the world market, the following industries should be identified as a matter of priority at the first stage of restructuring: These are agriculture and the processing industry, the fuel and energy complex, industries making extensive use of science and capital construction, including housing construction. Taking account of world competition and social orientation of consumer goods -- I emphasize consumer goods -- and food, agriculture, regardless of its forms of ownership, is heading for specialization and greater industrialization by way of developing the sphere of the agro-industrial complex, preserving, processing and selling produce, thus stimulating production in low-cost production regions. To that end, the structure of agro-industrial production in Ukraine should be optimized. At issue is a really complex and topical task. In particular, the structure of grain production should be revised, not only from the viewpoint of (requirement by) agro-industrial complex industries but also from the standpoint of its energy consumption. [passage omitted] This task [optimization of agricultural production] is also important because agricultural production and rural areas in general -- on the basis of the mentality of the people and the traditional system of family life -- recreate the sources of the viability of society and the state, and improve the demographic situation. This was addressed the other day at a meeting with the leadership of the city of Kiev, and the conclusion that is being made today by local authorities is that resolving the housing problem by the methods used before has no future. So, individual construction should be more widespread. To put it rudely, people should be sat on the land and given an opportunity themselves to resolve this problem. The formation of energy policy comprises measures on energy saving and the wider-ranging use of renewable energy carrier sources. At issue is liberating the agro-industrial complex from its energy dependence primarily upon, indirectly, Russia. The development of industries making extensive use of science is based on the experience of world trends, Ukraine's achievements and possibilities, the state's strategy and scientific and technological policy being determined. The development of general machine-building industries, adapted to world standards, is acquiring particular significance, of which I have already spoken. [passage omitted] As for reforming ownership and privatization relations, the implementation of privatization must make provision for setting up a mixed economy in Ukraine, with the economy's state and nonstate sectors clearly delimited; legislatively distinguishing the state-owned industries and facilities forming the foundation of Ukraine's economy and economic security and not subject to privatization; safeguarding the interests of large and medium-size enterprises and protecting them from their ruination as integral property complexes; and privatizing social infrastructure enterprises and facilities, with their profile and jobs retained. [passage omitted] Provision is made for regulating a mechanism for the workforce to exercise its priority to choose a form of privatization and ensure its implementation at the same time as ensuring the principle of all Ukrainian citizens' equal access to property; determining conditions for foreign capital to participate in privatization processes and the methodology of assessing the market value of facilities being privatized, with account taken of inflationary processes; the state mandatorily supervising the privatization of state property; legislatively determining a procedure of receiving earnings from privatization and ways of using them. [passage omitted] Provision is also made for settling the issues of social security of those working at the facilities being privatized; improving the methods of assessment and control of the legitimacy of the privatization processes; a possibility of privatizing state and municipal property with the guaranteed use of all the privatization papers by the workers engaged in the budget-supported sphere, pensioners, youths, as well as compensation with the state property of the citizens' indexed deposits in the savings bank, with their consent; liquidating opportunities for corruption and uncontrolled privatization. [passage omitted] The right to private ownership of land is granted by way of privatizing plots of land to be used as personal subsidiary farms or gardens, for individual housing construction or for the construction of garages, with the right of buying and selling the above plots of land. The right to private ownership of land is granted to the citizens of Ukraine only. Land can be provided to foreign legal and natural persons and to persons without citizenship for use only, including the use of land on conditions of a lease and, first and foremost, on conditions of a long lease. Farmers use land for their production needs on condition of a long hereditary lease or under condition that the land will be sold to the state, as is being done in the majority of countries. The right of citizens to housing is ensured through the privatization of the apartments belonging to the state housing fund and accelerated cooperative and individual construction of housing. [passage omitted] As for the state regulation of economic processes, it, as a rule, has to do with price formation, the finance and credit policy, the taxation, credit, budget, currency, and wage policies, regulation of investments, scientific and technical policy, and foreign economic activity. Let us look at each of them in turn. Pricing: The state policy is to stop the chaos in price formation, to take measures to stimulate [as heard] the price rise and achieve stabilization of prices, to remove distortions within the price system so that prices could become a stimulating regulator of production, registration and consumption of goods and services. The pricing policy must ensure support for an intersector pricing parity, particularly between agriculture and other sectors; and a close connection between prices and tariffs on the most important goods and services, on the one hand, and the level of the minimum pay and pensions, on the other. The regulation of prices for consumer goods should be effected through the margin of profit and the size of trade brokerage mark-ups, acknowledging the need to reduce superfluous brokerage operations and, probably, superfluous brokerage structures. Financial, credit, and taxation policy: Reforming the taxation system in Ukraine must aim to stimulate the development of the national economy, increase the gross output, form a fully fledged budget, and settle social issues. Profit, land, immovable property, and citizens' incomes should be liable to taxation. The tax rates should be substantiated. It is envisaged to improve the mechanism of the annual declaration of incomes by all the subjects of taxation, carry out strict control and step up responsibility for the fullness of the taxes paid by all the legal and natural persons. Credit policy: Credit policy is to be aimed at creating favorable economic conditions for the effective use of the credit resources, the acceleration of the structural reorganization of the economy and its social orientation. [passage omitted] The population's deposits should be index-linked in line with the actual rates of inflation. They could be further used as additional means for the privatization of property or returned on another basis, which is to be stipulated by law. At any rate, it seems to me the time has come to turn to using citizens' funds in deposits, which will act as deposit accounts. Otherwise, we will never be able to protect the citizens from a loss of their savings or restore their trust in the state. Strict economic sanctions should be introduced for delays in payment for the products delivered, work performed, and services provided. A mechanism of control by the National Bank over the policy of interest rates should be worked out. Commercial banks should -- in economic terms -- be made more interested in crediting priority industries and the sphere of production by way of reducing the rates of payments to the budget as taxes on their incomes from such crediting. Separately, there is the issue of commercial banks in general. They are now in a state of anxiety, caused, on the one hand, by the uncertainty as to what the attitude of the legislature and authorities as a whole toward their fate will be, i.e. whether they will be somehow oppressed and so on; and, on the other, by the impossibility of investing the colossal monetary resources they are sitting on, because what is in fact happening is that they are looking to inflationary processes in expectation of another round of inflation so that money could then produce more money, which mechanism is now well-known to everybody. Everything possible should be made to involve the credit resources, the possibilities of commercial banks in the production sphere, to make them finance production, provide people with jobs, ensure the profitability of production and therefore, consolidate and stabilize the finances in the state and the budget in particular. We should set up special funds within the state budget to provide credits and finances for priority industries by means of state contract and state order, which above all concerns agricultural produce and raw materials; and increase state control and the responsibility of the National Bank and commercial banks to ensure that credits are used for the purpose intended. [passage omitted: Moroz emphasizing the need for the Supreme Council budgetary commission to establish greater control over credits to prevent their misuse] Budgetary policy: In budgetary policy, the state's actions should be focused on rationally using budgetary funds, combined with stimulating a reduction in the deficit. Increasing the budget revenues should be based on an (effective) taxation and tax collection system at the same time as essentially reducing concessions in taxation and issuing state securities to cover the budget deficit etc. Decreasing budgetary expenditure must be achieved by reducing the cost of maintaining the state government apparatus, transferring many of its structures to the system of profit and loss management, stopping subsidies to loss-making -- and I would like to emphasize loss-making through no fault of the state -- enterprises and stopping financing capital investment in the production that has no future. The use of social programs funds for the purpose intended and the correspondence of budgetary allocations to social norms should be monitored more closely. Also, our foreign trade deficit should be eliminated and the state's debt reduced by stimulating export and optimizing import. It is envisaged that the stability of the financial system will be improved through strictly delimiting the state and local budgets and the budgets of state enterprises. This can also be viewed as a way toward the regionalization of the economy. Currency regulation: At the first stage it is necessary to set the exchange rate of the national currency in relation to hard currencies and to the ruble proceeding from the real purchasing capacity of the currency. I would only make one remark at this point. It is necessary to stop using the Russian ruble as an oil- ruble, because this will finally destroy our economy. This distorts the entire price policy and all economic relations as a whole. It is necessary to regulate the circulation of foreign currencies on Ukraine's territory ensuring the exchange of currencies through banks and their representatives only, and this can be done immediately without waiting for any special conditions. The system of registration and constant control over currency circulation should be sorted out, strengthening its normative and legislative basis and stimulating the use of currency for the purpose intended and ending the granting of concessions to enterprises in terms of their currency relations with the budget. A tax on earnings in currency or the sale of 100 percent of it should be introduced. At present, 50 percent are sold at a fixed exchange rate and even through the mechanism of tenders -- which seems to be necessary for the state as it has to control and concentrate currency -- however, this undermines the interest of the commodity producers in export activities and, generally speaking, their earnings in currency only result in losses. I believe, this must be radically changed. Forming the appropriate stabilization fund is a prerequisite of carrying out a monetary reform. Wages and incomes policy: A state policy in the sphere of labor and wages will presuppose that the minimum wage at enterprises of all forms of ownership cannot be lower than the minimum subsistence level. We are not publishing any data on the consumer basket anywhere today because it will only confirm that we will not be able to provide anything for that basket. In the deputy prime minister's speech and questions yesterday [14 June], the opinion was voiced that it looked as though the economy was stabilizing. All earnings of citizens today, however, are in fact being used to procure food, which is the first sign of the population's total impoverishment. Pay should be regulated by the state by way of developing recommended differentiated ratios between wage rates, salaries of the post, and certain additional payments, taking account of the conditions and complexity of labor affecting the cost price of products. Bonuses and additional payments at enterprises of all forms of ownership are to be paid from the profit made without limitations, after the production funds, required by them, are formed. This must stimulate conscientious, inspired labor. A mechanism of monthly index-linked wages and payments according to the level of inflation is being worked out. Conditions for a changeover to paying wages and salaries weekly are being prepared. Here, strictly speaking, we are talking about the implementation of the law on index-linking wages that was already passed. The tariff system of a directive nature is (becoming more widespread). It is regarded as a reference point for the intersector and interqualificational differentiation of pay, except, certainly, for the budget-supported sphere. Investment policy: The main objective of the state's investment policy, at the first stage, is to channel resources to developing and setting up production, above all in priority industries, at enterprises manufacturing competitive goods, which would be needed by the consumer. I would like to underline here that we previously, in the past months, made a mistake in concentrating on support for products that would be competitive on the external market. What we need to do is to focus our attention on protecting the producer supplying goods to the internal market. [passage omitted] The main sources for financing city investment projects should be state, enterprises', and the people's funds. With the aim of stimulating investment activity, a mechanism of encouraging a mixed form of financing investments should be elaborated that would include foreign investments and they should be protected from inflation. The state, first and foremost, promotes foreign investments that are directed at manufacturing, construction, and agriculture. [passage omitted] Scientific and technical policy. At the first stage the state should direct its efforts at overcoming the innovation inertia of enterprises. To do this it is necessary to considerably increase state support and improve the economic mechanism of managing scientific and technical progress in all stages. It is necessary to envisage the creation of an integrated system of stimulating innovation activity by corporate bodies. The financing of scientific programs should be carried out on a competitive basis. It is necessary to carry out an inventory of all of Ukraine's scientific potential, renew scientific schools in the main areas of science and technology. [passage omitted] Foreign economic activity. With the aim of state regulation of foreign economic activity, it is necessary to regulate the system of control in the following areas: To ensure the timely receipt of hard currency earnings and payment of customs duties, taxes, and other payments that would benefit the state. It is necessary to guarantee state control over the quality of imported goods and that they comply with international standards. It is necessary to ensure that all corporate bodies fully abide by the hard currency regulation. It is necessary to stimulate an export hard currency policy and create a reliable mechanism for protecting and forming an internal market. It is necessary to argue for critical imports and to protect the domestic producer from imports that could be manufactured in Ukraine. [passage omitted] Regulation in the sphere of consumption. The main criterion for the state regulation in the economy should be to raise the living standard of the people of Ukraine as well as to increase the population's consumption of goods and services. The main principles envisage defining the subsistence level based on the people's minimum necessary requirements and on the possibilities of fulfilling them in the present phase. The legally fixed minimum consumer budget is guaranteed by the state and is reviewed with the purpose of increasing it in accordance with the improving economic situation in Ukraine. The state guarantees the legislative regulation of protecting consumer rights, promotes the involvement of a broad mass of the public in carrying out public control over maintaining legislative demands with regard to prices, the range of products, their quality, and the terms on which they are offered for sale and so on. We are talking about control over the organization of imports so that we do not have the situation that we have today. I will not talk about this phenomenon. The state's stimulation of increasing mass demand and consumption is an absolute precondition for raising production, successfully overcoming the crisis and laying the foundations of the principles of Ukraine's national economy. The strategy of legal policy with regard to stabilizing the development of Ukraine's economy is closely intertwined with these tasks and is precisely the subject of our activity. For this reason, I will dwell in greater detail on this section. The legal policy in the formation of a new stage in Ukraine's statehood is based on the principles of its economic independence. Politically and legally it is fixed in the declaration of state sovereignty of Ukraine, which announced that the policy of the legal act was approved by the people at a referendum and cannot be abolished. In spite of this, instead of introducing the necessary changes to the basic law of Ukraine in October 1990, a law on suspending the activity of 19 articles of the Constitution was adopted, Section II, Articles 16 and 17 with regard to the basics of Ukraine's economic system, the legal regime for forms of ownership, the constitutional guarantee of citizens on sources of their well-being through socially useful work, a planned economic and social development of society, forming Ukraine's state budget. [passage omitted] The main aim for a strategy of legal policy is to guarantee state regulation of economic relations in the state sector, a parallel implementation of legal reform to formulate a mixed economy; the creation of a legal base for regulating the activity of various corporate entities that compete with each other and that have diverse forms of ownership, the consistent and legal guarantee of the state market regulation of the market with its social orientation. The realization of the strategy of the legal policy and carrying out reforms is directed at an effective use of actions, object economic laws in an optimal ratio of various forms of ownership and later the growth in production with a view to the stage-by-stage introduction of a mixed economy. In order to implement these stages it is envisaged: To repeal the law on suspending the activity of Section 2, 16, and 17 of Ukraine's constitution and the corresponding introduction of changes and additions; to firmly strengthen the equality of all forms of ownership -- state, collective, private; to regulate legislation and to guarantee the accessibility of law-abiding acts; to improve adopted laws, to review first generation market legislation that cause discord in the market today; to complete the organizational and legal building; to form an institution of legislation and so on. [passage omitted] The legal methods of ensuring stabilization of the development of the economy in Ukraine, it is necessary to adopt the following: Codifying economic legislation as one of the main ones with which to legally regulate the economy; liquidating the heritage of the administrative-command system, which is based on various instructions and legal acts; using agreements in various spheres of the economy and promoting socially useful entrepreneurship, and improving the structures of legislation and maintaining the hierarchy of legally binding acts, using contracts in various spheres of the economy and promoting socially useful business activity, and improving legislative structures. The key problem was building a model of a new constitution for Ukraine and the move away from the concept of the new constitution adopted in June 1992, and also abolishing the constitutional regulation of the economy on the part of the state, the establishment of democracy, the protection of human rights, free education, health-care, social guarantees, and the formation of economic conditions for the people's well-being. [passage omitted] Apart from adopting a new constitution, it is expected to complete work on Ukraine's civil and criminal procedure, and trade codes, as well as on various other administrative codes and on the issue of the military and Ukraine's national defense. Particular attention should be paid to corporate bodies; the procedure for destatifying ownership, legislation on foreign investments; on privatization; on securities and the stock exchange; on banking activity; intellectual property on stimulation of production through taxation; assets funds; transport and customs legislation. The carrying out of measures envisaged by this document envisions a sharp increase in the responsibility of officials who break the law. A real fight against organized crime, corruption, and the shadow economy is envisaged. We are talking about a certain purge of the apparatus depending on the current demands and the specifics of the situation in the economy. It is time to renew state control for using state property, rationalizing privatization, and subordinating it to criteria of economic effectiveness. Increasing state discipline and bringing order to all spheres of social life does not necessarily mean increasing control over the actions of the Cabinet of Ministers. It should have the freedom of actions as defined by the law. The Supreme Council together with the higher level executive structures should take upon themselves the responsibility for carrying out the stabilization of the economy and are obliged to speed up the creation of a system of legal instruments to adapt civilian and economic legal norms, the taxation and budgetary systems, state regulation, and supporting economic activity in order to legally guarantee a normal economic environment that would motivate productive work by all participants in the process of production, distribution, and consumption. This is the main content of the basic principles, which is being proposed for your attention. [passage omitted] I would just like to stress one more thing. We, the Supreme Council, will use our constitutional right to confirm the candidate for the post of prime minister, which will be proposed by the president, and we should also proceed on the basis to what extent he agrees with such an economic policy. At the same time we should divide the responsibility for implementing this policy between the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the Supreme Council. I think that such an approach is also expected by the electorate because they do not divide the authority of deputies, members of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, and the president. You are in the constituencies and therefore, you are responsible for it. Thank you for your attention.
