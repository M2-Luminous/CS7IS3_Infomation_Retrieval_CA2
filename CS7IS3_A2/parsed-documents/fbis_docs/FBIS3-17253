The candidates came from two electoral districts--Moscow District No. 24 and Volga District No. 27. Yuriy Voronin spoke first at the press conference, telling of crafty maneuvers that affected the outcome of the election in the Moscow district. In the first place, the number of ballots arriving at the polling stations did not coincide with the number issued to the voters and canceled--there was a difference of about 7,000. Secondly, ballots from portable ballot boxes were often dumped into the common "kettle" without drawing up separate official documentation. Thirdly, hardly any of the authorized candidates for deputy were present for the tallying of the vote. Fourthly, only following intervention on the part of the Central Electoral Committee did the district commission permit the former contenders for a deputy seat to familiarize themselves with the control documents. Each of the press conference participants added his own contribution to the overall picture of the election just held. Vladimir Belyayev, for example, reported that according to information from observers from the Accord movement, from 40 to 80 percent of city-precinct voters voted for him, but the official statistics show somewhere around one-third. Mars Rameyev shared his impressions from meetings with rural residents, who were given a "directive" to show preference to Oleg Morozov. Volga District No. 27 was no different in this respect, judging from the comments of its two candidates. As Aleksandr Sapiy related, data from the district commission and 18 precinct commissions did not coincide, and a mysterious "juggling" occurred at eight precincts, as a result of which 500 votes were "pulled away" from the candidacy of the leader of Tatarstan's Communist Party. But perhaps most categorical of all was the assessment of Munavir Murtazin (who is, incidentally, senior assistant to the procurator for military matters), who stated that the procuracy must institute criminal proceedings with respect to the facts uncovered in accordance with Article 133 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code, which envisages serious punishment for those who participate in the forgery of election documents. The candidates for deputy participating in the press conference believe it would be advisable to establish a commission that would carefully examine all the "delicate" aspects of the present election campaign and subsequently publish the results. In addition, the intention to apply to the procuracy was also clearly stated.
