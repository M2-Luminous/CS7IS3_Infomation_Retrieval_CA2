Speaking at a press conference today, Strasky said the ODS was interested in a rapid agreement. The party still insists that only the state be the obliged person, and that the issue be not described as restitution but "equipping of church organizations with the property they need to carry out their activities," Strasky emphasized. The ODS also keeps to its proposal that the return of the church property be not settled by a law but through individual government regulations, he said. Strasky said the ODS supported the prior return of those buildings from the state property which could continue to serve the spiritual and administrative purposes of individual churches, or as accommodation facilities for church representatives. The buildings and premises which have been serving social, cultural, and education purposes, should be returned where churches were ready to carry out these activities serving the public, under the same conditions -- including the amount of state subsidies -- as everybody in this sphere, Strasky said on behalf of the ODS.
