In the clauses signed by Brazil and its international creditors, the Brazilian Government is unable to break or modify the repayment contracts. The agreement was signed in April. Under the terms of the agreement, guarantees cover 68 percent of the debt. This is equivalent to $23.8 billion of the $35 billion that was negotiated. In practice, this amount is already in the hands of creditors. The guarantees are in the form of U.S. Treasury bonds that were deposited to the name of creditors at the BIS (the Bank of International Settlements, in Switzerland, which operates like a central bank of central banks around the world). Eduardo Suplicy, the PT senator for Sao Paulo who is a party spokesmen for foreign debt affairs, has admitted that renegotiating the debt will require the approval of creditors. Suplicy explained that the PT government will try to "persuade" international bankers. "We will show them a plan against misery, for which we will need a reduction in payments." The party program states: "If creditors remain intransigent, the PT government will suspend interest payments" (a moratorium). If this happens, creditors may take the guarantees at an earlier date. If interest is paid normally, the bonds will be withdrawn in 2024. The debt agreement falls under New York law, which allows creditors to obtain compensation if Brazil fails to make payments. The PT program has still another obstacle: The current foreign debt agreement was approved by the Senate, which will have to approve other agreements. Brazil has tried to renegotiate its foreign debt since 1983. If complied with, the most recent agreement will normalize Brazilian international relations. The foreign debt was the most controversial subject during the PT National Meeting on 30 April and 1 May, which designed the program of government. Suplicy believes Brazil will be unable to achieve development under the terms of the agreement signed in April. He said the first action by Lula's government in connection with the debt will be to ask creditors to negotiate. The total debt amounts to $135.4 billion. The $35 billion portion that was negotiated in April was reduced, the interest was also reduced, and the repayment term was extended. The $35 billion portion dropped to $32.5 billion. This reduction was also caused by the fact that the Dart family, a U.S. family to whom Brazil owes $1.4 billion, did not join the agreement.
