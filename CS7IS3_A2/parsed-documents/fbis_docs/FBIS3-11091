President de Leon Carpio issued the order today before leaving for Mexico on a two-day official visit, during which he will meet with Mexican counterpart Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The National Police also plan to intervene in the next few hours at the courts of justice, the Supreme Court, and attorney offices, the employees of which have been on strike since 11 March, demanding a 40-percent salary increase. Public security agents have been posted at the main gates of the Finance Ministry to keep them open and to allow entry for people who want to pay their debts to the Treasury. Last night, de Leon Carpio signed an agreement with the National Federation of Public Employees Unions to establish a monthly bonus for public employees of 110 quetzales, or the equivalent of $17. The largest unions in the country, such as the Workers Unitary Organization [IUT] and the National Federation of State Workers Unions [Fenasteg], did not sign the agreement. IUT and Fenasteg proposed that the salary increase amount to 300 quetzales, or $52, which the government rejected on the basis that it does not have enough funds to give public employees a salary increase. Public employees earn some $82 a month.
