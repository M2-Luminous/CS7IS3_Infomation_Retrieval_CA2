Security Council [UNSC] in talks Tuesday [29 March] with Japanese counterpart Morihiro Hosokawa, Foreign Ministry officials said. The officials said Ziaur, who arrived in Tokyo on Monday for a five-day visit, told Hosokawa that Bangladesh "strongly supports" a permanent seat for Japan on the Security Council. She said Bangladesh is prepared to encourage other countries with which it has close ties to similarly support Japan to that end. The officials said she was apparently referring to other Islamic countries, members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and so-called least developed countries (LDC's). Ziaur called for continued Japanese economic assistance and expressed gratitude for Japan's agreement earlier in the day to extend a 22.9 billion yen loan, including some 21.5 billion yen for construction of a five-kilometer road-cum-rail bridge over the Jamuna River. The bridge, expected to serve as a vital link between the eastern and western parts of the country, is being cofinanced by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, each contributing 200 million dollars. The officials said Hosokawa urged that the Bangladeshi Government ensure the residents of the area where the bridge is to be constructed are treated satisfactorily. They said it is estimated by the World Bank that 40,000 people will have to be relocated. A second Japanese loan, worth some 1.4 billion yen, will go to fund a project to supply natural gas to the principal port city of Chittagong and its surrounding area. The pledge of the two official loans, covering fiscal 1993, ending March 31, was formalized in an exchange of diplomatic notes between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Bangladesh Finance Minister Saifur Rahman. Japan is Bangladesh's top aid donor, providing 300 to 400 million dollars a year in financial aid and other assistance. Foreign Ministry officials said Ziaur expressed a hope for more Japanese investment in her country, saying the investment environment is good and has received favorable reviews internationally. In response, Hosokawa announced Japan's readiness to begin negotiations to conclude an agreement with Bangladesh on the promotion and protection of investment. The officials said the expressed intention of the Japanese Government should be an important "signal" for the Japanese private sector to go ahead and boost investment in Bangladesh. Japan presently has concluded such agreements with only four countries -- China, Egypt, Sri Lanka and Turkey. In addition to the talks with Hosokawa, Ziaur is scheduled to meet various Japanese business leaders and deliver a speech at an investment seminar Wednesday, they said. In a speech at a dinner hosted by the Japanese premier, Ziaur urged Japan offer Bangladesh "special and differential opportunities for market access in Japan and in securing Japanese investments in our country." She said Bangladesh is planning to set up a special export processing zone "for Japanese investments alone." Referring to the Security Council issue, Ziaur said, "The economic miracles achieved by Japan deserve to be translated into... (an) enhanced international political role." "Bangladesh will continue to support the legitimate aspirations of Japan in the United Nations," she said. "To be more explicit, we are totally behind you in your effort to be a permanent member of the Security Council."
