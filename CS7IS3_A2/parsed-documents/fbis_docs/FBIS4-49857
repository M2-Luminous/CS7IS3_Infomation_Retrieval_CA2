State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing told officials of the Foreign Trade Ministry that in the process of reforming China's foreign trade policy, care must be taken against foreign corporations squeezing the prices of Chinese exports. He was speaking at the 57th anniversary of Guangzhou Stock Exchange. Mr Li said that as China reformed its economy and become more open, exporters' profit margins might be squeezed as their suppliers took advantage of the booming export levels and charged unreasonably high prices. He also said exporters should guard against foreign investors reducing the prices of China's exports. Without commenting on the current situation, Mr Li said that price squeezing could adversely affect the country's balance of payments and thus the foreign exchange system. Mr Li called on the Ministry of Foreign Trade to guard against any price squeezing by foreign investors. He said privatization of state-owned enterprises, which would improve their efficiency, needed to continue as a way of preventing such price squeezing. He said China had been very successful in attracting foreign investment in the 10 years since it started its open-door economic policy. Many former trade restrictions had been lifted and foreign investment has soared rapidly in recent years. The foreign trade policy reform, in which international corporations were invited into the China market, had brought the country wealth and improvements, Mr Li said. The State Statistics Bureau said foreign investment in the first quarter of the year alone had increased to U.S.$5.4 billion (HK$42.1 billion), spread among 11,800 projects. In the past 10 years, China had approved 186,062 foreign investment projects with total contractual investment of U.S.$241.5 billion, of which U.S.$67.2 billion had been put to use. But state-owned corporations also needed to pay attention to improving product quality and to human resources in order to better compete in the market, Mr Li said. As a first step to improving export quality, he urged a faster introduction of the International Standards Organizations ISO9000 product certification system.
