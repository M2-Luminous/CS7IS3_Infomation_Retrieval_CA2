Mr. Khan had been invited to a roundtable organized by the European Socialist Deputies' Group. A Western intelligence service had been informed of this visit, passed on the information to the Belgian Criminal Investigation Department, which passed it on to the gendarmerie. Although Mr. Khan had a Pakistani passport and a visa issued by our embassy in Islamabad, he was reported to Interpol by India, which accused him of heading a terrorist group. The case caused a sensation at the time but, after two months of detention, Amanullah Khan was expelled by the Belgian Government to Pakistan. Case closed? Not really. A few days ago a letter -- the existence of which had been kept a close secret until now -- written on behalf of the JKLF and apparently signed by Mr. Khan, reached Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. Its author demands, in the name of the JKLF, the payment of compensation of $10 million (350 million Belgian francs) for the arbitrary detention which Mr. Khan suffered in Belgium. If this sum is not quickly paid into a bank account in Rawalpindi (Pakistan), the author of the letter states that the JKLF militants will regard Belgium as a hostile country. According to information from reliable sources, this letter did reach the prime minister's residence (which has said: "no comment") and was passed on to the Criminal Investigation Department and to the Joint Forces Antiterrorist Group (GIA). It is being taken very seriously, although its authenticity cannot be guaranteed. Indeed, Belgian analysts think that, for various reasons, the arrest and subsequent release of Amanullah Khan generated only anger and frustration among all those involved in this case: The JKLF and its president, Pakistan and India, the United States (which has a great influence in that region of the world), some European Socialists, and several intelligence services. It is therefore not impossible, analysts think, that this letter is a forgery by one of these parties and is aimed at reviving tension by bringing the Khan case back into the news (through the media). In other words, whether genuine or a forgery, the "Khan letter" is still important and significant. Does this mean that there is really a threat of attacks on Belgium? "No, not really," the intelligence services say, "at least not at present." However, one thing is certain: Jean-Luc Dehaene does not intend to pay the 350 million Belgian francs into the account indicated by his correspondent.
