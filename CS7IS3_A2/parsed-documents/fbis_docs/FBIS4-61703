The statement talks of threats addressed to Mykola Seredenyk, head of the Borislavskiy rayon Rukh and editor of the NARODNYY VISNYK BORYSLAVSHCHYNY. (Incidentally, the investigation into the murder of Ivan Seredenyk, his brother, which was committed a year ago, has not yet been completed.) The statement's authors drew Leonid Kravchuk's attention to the fact that the terror, which gained momentum during the election campaign, has not stopped, even though the election campaign has finished. Svyatoslav Mohylivskyy, a former candidate for people's deputy, and Hryhoriy Tkachenko, a member of the regional Rukh leadership, were recently attacked. The regional Rukh has warned the president, Oleksandr Melnykov, his representative in the oblast, and Vyacheslav Chornovil, head of Rukh: "If an end is not put to the political gangsterism, then we reserve the right to take resolute measures to defend our members and supporters."
