Charges were brought under Article 72 of the criminal code, the minister of population, Peeter Olesk, said. Olesk told a BNS correspondent that Rozhok now cannot be deported from the country -- and that there is no reason to do so -- before the case is brought to a conclusion. The issue also stood on the agenda of today's meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers. The Cabinet heard the opinion of Interior Minister Heiki Arike on the issue. The director general of the Defense Police, Juri Pihl, said it was his department that had initiated the criminal case. "He has not been arrested so far," Pihl said. Rozhok in an interview with BNS at about 4 p.m. today said he knew nothing of the charges brought against him. He said he had no contacts with the security police recently. The representative of Zhirinovskiy's party in Estonia said he had no intention to leave the country. "But why?" he asked, explaining that he is living on a territory that is Russia's domain for ages. Vasili Ostapchuk, adviser at the Russian Embassy in Tallinn, said Rozhok had not turned to the embassy for help. "If Rozhok appeals to us for help, we can act under the consular convention and the legal assistance agreement," he said. The criminal code's Article 72 foresees punishments ranging from fines to one year in prison for activity aimed at instigating ethnic, racial or religious hostility. Rozhok in his public statements on several occasions has expressed views hostile toward Estonia. In an interview with the SILLAMAESKI VESTNIK newspaper of the northeast Estonian town of Sillamae last month he called on Russian army veterans to form paramilitary units "for defending the (Russians') honor and dignity" and again claimed Estonia was Russia's traditional domain. Rozhok is legally a citizen of Russia since May 28, 1992.
