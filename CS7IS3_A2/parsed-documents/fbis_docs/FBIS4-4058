The draft of the Law on Negotiable Instruments has been completed and will be submitted to the State Council for deliberation soon, said Li Shishi from the council's Legislative Affairs Bureau. As indicated in the draft, negotiable instruments will include bills of exchange, promissory notes, bearer shares, bonds and negotiable certificates of deposits, Li said at an international seminar in Beijing. The law is intended to ensure the proper handling of transactions involving payments, exchanges, credit, and financing and dissolving debts. The introduction of a socialist market economy in China has led to the increasing use of various negotiable instruments for finance, investment and international trade. The growing role these documents play calls for a timely law to regulate their use . The lack of such a law has resulted in disputes and crimes, such as circulation of bad checques and fake bills, he said. According to the draft law, these crimes will be severely punished. The law will stipulate the pattern of negotiable instruments and the information that they must include. It also will establish details about the transfer of holders' rights and cash deposits and the effectiveness period for the documents. Research for the draft began in 1990 and was mainly compiled by experts from the People's Bank of China, he said. After deliberation at the State Council, the law will be submitted to China's legislature for approval. Li spoke at a two-day seminar on negotiable instruments, which was organized by the China Chamber of International Commerce and the International Chamber of Commerce. The organizers said they wished to draw useful experiences from other countries through the seminar to provide perspective for China's compilation of its law. Analysts at the seminar said the draft law is expected to be passed this year.
