At a press conference in Kaliningrad, Matochkin said such authorizations were promised at his meeting with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in Moscow this week. Commenting on relations with Lithuania, Matochkin said Russia introduces "strict requirements" for Lithuania this year. He noted, however, that Russia's policy may be milder if Lithuania treats Kaliningrad in a more favorable way. In his words, the region already made its move with respect to Lithuania. Matochkin said "further advancement" and a more favorable trade status for Lithuania in the greater Russia will be possible only then. Matochkin said this year the region will focus on the development of its relations with Scandinavian and Baltic countries. Discussing a scheduled visit to Kaliningrad April 19 by the German finance minister, Matochkin said the visit was arranged on the initiative of the German side. "We will not ask anything from Germans, we will only suggest," he said. "As regards credits, we already have three foreign credit lines for 50, 8 and 10 million dollars," but he declined to specify any potential creditors.
