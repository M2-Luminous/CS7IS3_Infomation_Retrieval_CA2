How does it correspond to reality? Owing to the fact that officially published data from Russia's State Committee for Statistics do not consider the seasonal impact, they have economic meaning only when compared with the previous year's corresponding period. Different procedures for determining the physical volume and seasonal leveling are used for the purposes of a practical appraisal of the current situation. A group of specialists from the Russian Federation Government's Economic Situation Center, Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for Market Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences' Computer Center, and the RSPP [Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs] Institute of Experts regularly acquaint the public with one of these systems and the results obtained as a result. The Russian Federation Government's Workers' Center for Economic Reforms has also conducted a seasonal leveling of the physical volume index of industrial production calculated by Russia's State Committee for Statistics. The main components of the calculation procedure are similar in both cases. At the same time, it is necessary to point out differences that exist. 1. The mentioned group of specialists constructed the physical volume index on the basis of 40 (later 42) representative commodities. Russia's State Committee for Statistics used a set consisting of 372 commodities in 120 industrial branches and sub-branches, which embraced 70 percent of the total volume of industrial products. 2. The group of specialists constructed the physical volume index as the average geometric value of 42 rows. In our case, a weighting method in constant prices based on the actual production structure, which has been accepted in international practices, was used. 3. The 42 commodities selected by the group of specialists reflected the structure of industrial production and also the proportions between Groups A and B in accordance with conditions in 1990. In our calculations, the production structure changes annually as a result of the deferent production dynamics in the various branches depending on the actual change in the relationships between them. The results obtained were subjected to dual verification. First, they were compared with the data obtained from a total accounting of the enterprises. Second, the results of the seasonal leveling were compared with the results of a direct comparison with the corresponding period of the previous year. In both cases, the magnitude of the deviation did not exceed 1.5 percent. This is completely acceptable with the present state of our domestic statistics. The results of our calculations are reflected in the table. It is not difficult to see that these results differ noticeably from the data obtained by the mentioned group of experts. In May 1993, the experts pointed out a substantial reduction in the rates of decline (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 36) and in June -- even a stabilization in the level of production (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 40). According to our data, an evident acceleration in the industrial decline occurred during May-June. The experts called the production decline in August 1993 an "absolute record for all the time of observations -- a decline which had not existed before" (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 49). True, they had already tacitly rejected this thesis a month later, judging from a graph published in FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 54. According to our data, the decline in August, although it was extremely deep, unquestionably did not yield to the August 1992 slump in its scale. In September 1993, the experts again fixed "high menacing rates of decline" (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 53). At that time, there was not only no decline in fact but a so-called compensating industrial upsurge was present. Finally, the experts noted a "slowing down in the rates of decline" (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 54) in October, at a time when our data simply testified to the stabilization of industrial production. Moreover, the experts did not once note any industrial production growth during the two years, at a time when they set the rates for its decline from minus 5 percent to minus 44 percent during various months converted to a year's rate (cf. the graph in FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 53). These data contradict not only our calculations but also real life. Generally speaking, the picture of industrial production dynamics during the last three years looks as follows. During the first half of 1991, a gradual reduction in the level of industrial production was noted. The first sharp drop came during August 1991 when the putsch occurred. After a certain rise in September, the disintegration of the old economic and political system, which had begun, caused an accelerating decline during the fall of 1991, which concluded with a sharp decline in January 1992. It is evident that the price liberalization, which was implemented at the time, was not able in principle to have a decisive impact on the decline in the level of production. Rather long time lags between the change in consumer demand and the reaction of the production supply to it exist. Accumulated factors from the production, political and administrative disintegration during the fall of 1991 played the main role in the decline during January 1992. The absence of an impact on production dynamics from the freeing of prices is also confirmed by the February-April 1992 data, when industrial production remained at a stable and even higher level during the three months than in January. It was only in May under the influence of a really reduced demand and the heightened crisis of nonpayments that production began to be curtailed, reaching its maximum level of decline in August 1992 (minus 13.6 percent by July 1992). All told, production declined by 25.4 percent during the four months (April to August). The mutual crediting of nonpayments, which was done in the summer of 1992, along with massive credit pumping caused a compensating increase in production of 11.5 percent in September 1992. Thanks to the vigorous credit support, the production level subsequently remained practically stable for eight months -- up to April 1993; however, it was paid for by Russian consumers in the form of 25-30 percent monthly inflation. The decline in January 1993 is not included in the calculation because it was caused not by economic but by purely calendar reasons -- the Christmas holidays were celebrated on a large scale for the first time in the country. The next stage in the cut-back of production was connected with the new stage of the government's crucial financial and monetary policy, which began during the first months of 1993. Production fell by 19.6 percent from April to August, including 9.7 percent in August 1993 when compared to July. The new period of industrial production stabilization (September-December 1993), which then began with the stricter monetary policy and real lowering of inflation rates (to 13 percent in December), is evidence of exceptionally important changes in the economy. This means that industry had basically already discarded production volumes oriented toward an artificially exaggerated inflationary demand and had really begun to draw nearer to a rational level that did not need to be supported by credit drugs. It was from this or a slightly lower level that the revival stage and then healthy industrial growth could begin this year with the insuring of strict financial limitations. Thus, the statements, which have recently been heard about the production catastrophe that has begun, are unfounded. The expected sharp decline in production during January 1994 in no way differs in its nature from the one in January 1993. The only difference is that instead of having two days off as a year ago, the country preferred not to work two weeks this year. It is possible to expect that compensation will occur in February for the January decline. At the same time, the coming change in the government's economic policy and the next enthusiasm for a credit emission will exert a depressing affect on the level of industrial production. The inflation caused by this will deprive the producers of incentives to even maintain the production process. Then (but not now as some are hurrying to declare), the country could really find itself in a so-called "stagflation trap" where the incentives for production provided by an additional credit emission are more than stifled by the inflation unleashed as a result of it. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.
