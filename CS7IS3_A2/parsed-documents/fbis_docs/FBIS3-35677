Vytautas Landsbergis said in a statement circulated Friday that Russia tries to preserve its military bases in Latvia and wants to inveigle Lithuania into a post-Soviet union. To attain its goals, he said, Russia employs the imaginary need for a huge army in its Kaliningrad region, as well "the weakness and the conformity of the current Lithuanian leadership," and pressures it to sign an agreement on Russian military transit through Lithuanian territory. The opposition leader said an agreement on military transit would give Russia if a better pretext to interfere, to accuse and to demand "rights" for itself, just like in 1940. Military transit would be a constant threat to Lithuanian independence. Landsbergis said the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party does not have any right to "step over" the June 8, 1992 constitutional act that bars Lithuania from any post-Soviet unions.
