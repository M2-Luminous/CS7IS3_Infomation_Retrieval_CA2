Kim made the remarks when he telephoned Hata to convey his congratulations on his assuming the premiership and forming the cabinet Thursday, Japanese officials said. "Through those close relationships (among the three nations), we can prevent North Korea from developing nuclear (weapons)," Kim was quoted by Japanese officials as telling Hata. Hata replied, "Japan will not change its policy of opening a window for dialogue with North Korea while showing the international society's steadfast stance toward it," the officials said. "As the (nuclear issue) has been approaching a serious phase, (Japan) will continue keeping close relations with South Korea and the U.S.," Hata said. North Korea has refused to accept full inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), increasing suspicions that it is trying to develop nuclear bombs. Kim also said, as in the case with the cabinet headed by former Premier Morihiro Hosokawa, that South Korea will proceed with its efforts to establish future-oriented relations with Japan. Hata replied that the new government will succeed Hosokawa's foreign policy which "aims at establishing future-oriented Japan- Korea relations by facing up past history."
