In article 3 of the agreement, Israel, without mention of Jerusalem, "recognises the Catholic Church's right to practise its authority." The fact that the negotiations leading to the accord were conducted in Jerusalem and the agreement itself was signed in the city can only reinforce that conclusion. We understand that the Vatican had come under immense pressure to conclude such an agreement with Israel by constantly having been reminded of all the atrocities that were committed against the Jews in Europe over the centuries, with the blessing of the church on many occasions. True, the Vatican is certainly not a superpower in the physical sense of the word. Yet, being the spiritual leader of 1,000 million Catholic faithfuls, the Pope, in whatever action he takes, serves as a guiding example for those millions. It is therefore disappointing to see the Vatican turning a blind eye to Israel's description of the occupied Arab lands as 'disputed territories." equally disappointing is to witness the Vatican's deputy foreign minister, Monsignr Claudio Celli, sign the document of mutual recognition with his Israeli counterpart Yossi Beilen in Jerusalem. The Vatican cannot claim, as it did when it signed the agreement Thursday, a stranger to all temporal conflicts," because it is not. In the past decade and during Pope John Paul's reign, the Vatican was party to almost every single "temporal conflict" in Europe, Latin America and Africa. It chose to oppose and fight communism in Eastern Europe. It sided with the U.S. in fighting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. And Pope John Paul himself did not hesitate to scold his Sudanese hosts last year for the brutal war in south Sudan. Muslim and Christian Arabs are disheartened therefore to see the Vatican take a step towards legitimising Israel's occupation and annexation of the city and the Holy See's backtracking in commitment pledged to Arabs and Palestinians. This move at this crucial time will only strengthen the hands of Israel and weaken the Palestinian cause at a time where every genuine effort should be exerted to solve the Middle East peace conflict justly and honourably.
