The effect of waiving the attainment date for a moderate area is to relieve it of the serious area requirements. Therefore, special considerations apply to the determination of whether nonanthropogenic sources contribute significantly to violation of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in a moderate area and whether such area therefore qualifies for an attainment date waiver. The significant disparity between the legal tests set out in section 188(f), as discussed above, may lead to an absurd result. In particular, if a moderate area met the less stringent attainment date waiver test and the attainment date for the area was actually waived, the area would never be reclassified. 23 The result would be that a moderate area would be effectively relieved from the serious area requirements without having met the more stringent test that Congress expressly required be met as a prerequisite to a waiver of such requirements. In such an event, the more stringent test for determining whether to waive serious area requirements would be rendered meaningless. Moderate areas would qualify for the attainment date waiver, be effectively relieved of all serious area requirements and never have to meet the required test for such waiver. 23 If EPA waives a specific attainment date for a moderate area consistent with its authority under section 188(f), the attainment date for the area will be vacated. Therefore, the moderate area would not be subject to reclassification under section 188(b) because there simply would be no attainment date that the area cannot practicably meet or that the area fails to meet. However, since section 188(f) authorizes waiving only the attainment date, the moderate area would still be subject to all the remaining moderate area SIP requirements. Therefore, the moderate area SIP submitted to meet the applicable requirements of subparts 1 and 4 must, among other requirements, continue to provide for implementation of RACM.
