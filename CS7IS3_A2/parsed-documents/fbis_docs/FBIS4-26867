"Such organizations will not only help protect the legal rights of workers, but also promote cooperation between employees and employers, and be conducive to the prosperity of the enterprises," Zhang Dinghua said. Zhang, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, was speaking at an on-going national work conference on trade unions in foreign enterprises held in the capital city of north China's Hebei Province. Trade unions in overseas-funded enterprises numbered 8,200 by the end of 1993, taking in more than 1.32 million members, according to Zhang. He said that most overseas enterprises with trade unions abide by Chinese laws and regulations in protecting the rights of their employees and achieve good economic results due to harmonious labor relations. "However, some serious problems still remain," Zhang said, noting that some small manufacturers neglect safety in production, and some overseas investors force workers into unreasonable overwork and then underpay them. "Some even treat employees in a disrespectful and illegal manner," he said. In November last year, 84 woman workers were burned to death in a fire in a Shenzhen toy-making factory run by a Hong Kong businessman, because all the exits were closed for fear the workers might steal his toys. One month later, 62 workers were killed in a Taiwanese-invested factory in Fujian Province for the same reason. Zhang stressed that trade unions play an indispensable role in protecting laborers' rights and adjusting laborer-employer relations in ways that other organizations can not. But only 12 percent of the overseas-funded enterprises in China have trade union organizations, Zhang said. "Overseas-funded enterprises, especially those in development zones and coastal cities, must establish trade unions in their enterprises by the end of this year," Zhang pronounced, reading from a recent decree by the State Council. "From now on, such enterprises must establish trade unions in order to open for business, and the deadline is one year from the start of business," the decree said. Zhang called for the legislature to issue laws and regulations on the protections of laborers' rights and set up relevant supervisory bodies to ensure that they are observed. Zhang said his federation will also help township enterprises in the countryside to establish trade unions. Some 400,000 township enterprises have already met the requirements for setting up trade unions for their 25 million workers. But not more than 5 percent of the enterprises have trade unions and less than 8 percent of workers have memberships, Zhang said.
