Today, some people are asking: Now that we have switched to a market economy, that is, an economy that operates based on the laws of value, supply and demand, and competition, why do we need the leadership of the party? They say that on many occasions, party leadership has hindered and interfered with the operation of the economy. In many places, the party organizations are falling apart but the economy has managed to hold its own and even expand well. Those with such ideas look at just one aspect of the problem, and more importantly, they do not understand the nature and contents of building a market economy in our country. As we all known, the party advocates expanding the market economy (in place of a state-subsidies economy involving bureaucratic centralism type control), but this is not an undisciplined market economy but a state-controlled market economy with a socialist orientation. That is, it is an economy whose real purpose is to foster a "wealthy people, strong state, and fair and civilized society." In the past, there were times when we did not correctly understand the meaning of a market economy, and a market economy was thought of as being synonymous with capitalism and incompatible with socialism. But reality has helped us to gradually understand that a market economy is not completely synonymous with capitalism and that switching to a market economy does not necessarily mean that you are following the capitalist path. Socialism must develop a commodity economy and apply market mechanisms. However, for socialism, a market economy is not everything but just a formula and measure for expanding the production forces. Expanding the production forces must go hand in hand with building suitable production relationships and building good relationships between people and a prosperous, compassionate, and kind society. Today, there are various theoretical issues that we must continue to study in depth. Only based on reviewing the realities can we gradually improve and clarify things. But concerning the basic points, it can be said that a socialist-oriented market economy differs from a capitalist market economy in the following ways: The ownership system: Under capitalism, the foundation is private capitalist ownership. But in our country today, we are varying the forms of ownership based on a system of public ownership of the main means of production. Economic elements: Under capitalism, there are many forms (including a state economy, joint enterprises, state capitalism, and so on) that are controlled by the bourgeois state and directed by private capitalists. In Vietnam today, there are many forms, too, but they are controlled by the socialist state--meaning a state that is truly of the people, by the people, and for the people--and the state and collective economies are playing a greater and greater pivotal role and directing things. The management system: Under capitalism, the markets are characterized by spontaneous and free competition. Even though the state regulates things, intervenes, and formulates plans, this is not the basic tendency. In our country today, while steps must be taken to stimulate and create the conditions for exploiting the positive role of the market mechanism, there must also be strong and positive intervention by the state (through plans, policies, laws, and economic strength) in order to regulate and guide things and limit the negative aspects of the market mechanism. The distribution system: Under capitalism, distribution is based primarily on capital and serves the interests of the capitalists. In our country today, we are using many forms of distribution, primarily distribution based on labor and economic results. We are both encouraging the laborers and providing basic social welfare services. Social policy: Capitalism came into being by initially accumulating things through plundering. Because of this, it "has much blood on its hands." Today, the capitalist countries have made some changes, but because of its nature, capitalism cannot resolve the basic conflicts, do away with the cruel exploitation of laborers, narrow the gap between rich and poor, or end the cruel injustices. In our country today, while the market economy is expanding, exploitation must be limited and economic growth must be tied to social fairness. Also, encouraging people to become wealthy legally must be tied to eliminating poverty. From the very beginning when the economy is not highly developed, attention must be given to social policies and to maintaining the morals and color of the national culture. In summary, we advocate expanding the market economy, but it must not be allowed to operate spontaneously and blindly. Instead, it must be led, guided, and regulated. The positive aspects must be exploited, and the negative aspects must be limited for the interests of the majority of the laboring people and for a just and civilized society. The entity with the ability to do this is none other than than the communist party, a party that struggles for socialist and communist ideals and that really represents and protects the interests of the working class and laboring people. The leadership of the party is the decisive factor in maintaining a socialist orientation for our market economy and the entire development of our country. Recently, some people were very happy when Vietnam switched to expanding a market economy, but they hoped that that would be a "free, privatized market economy," that is, a capitalist market economy. People have done everything they can to push us into the capitalist orbit. They think that by encouraging Vietnam to have a "market economy," the economy will determine politics and that changing the economic system will lead to changes in the political system. On one hand, they praise a market economy, and on the other hand, they actively criticize and reject the leadership of the communist party. Enemy forces are implementing "peaceful changes" and trying to attack the leadership of the communist party with the aim of doing away with the socialist orientation of our market economy and eventually eliminating socialism. In Vietnam and among a number of Vietnamese living abroad, some people have openly demanded that the Communist Party of Vietnam abandon its leadership role. The realities in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe show that once the communist party collapses, socialism will disappear and the economy will not have a socialist orientation. The Western capitalist countries are very pleased by this. They are doing everything possible to foster this tendency. Unfortunately, among our ranks, a number of people are vacillating, and they have been fooled by these tricks. Why is there just one leading party here? Some people have argued that a market economy is a multi-faceted economy. Each element corresponds to a particular class or stratum and each class or stratum has a corresponding party or political organization. Thus, in Vietnam, why do we advocate having just one leading party? Having a multi-faceted economy but just one leading party is a "contradiction," a "paradox." They have demanded that we implement political pluralism and eliminate one-party leadership. According to them, this is the only way to bring about democracy. First of all, it must be noted that we have not just said "oppose party pluralism." Because there are many things about pluralism, understood in its broadest and fullest sense, that must be opposed and avoided. We are varying the ownership forms and forms of distribution and pluralizing foreign relations. We advocate developing a multi-faceted economy and having multi-faceted information. Our country has had many parties. If the parties have the same goal and focus on the same basic interests (for example, the communist party, the democrat party, and the socialist party all survived in our country for a long time) and they accept the leadership of the communist party, there is nothing to reject. But we cannot accept political pluralism and opposition parties. That is, we cannot accept opposition organizations and factional tendencies that would destroy the unity of the party and the revolution of the people. We have not used the word "oppose." Because in each country, the situation at any given time is different, and the level of democracy and specific conditions are different. There may be countries that need to use a "pluralistic" and "multi-party" system. That is the internal affair of each country. What we have said is that Vietnam does not have the objective conditions to accept political pluralism and opposition parties. This is because the political situation, socioeconomic standards, people's standard of culture, and laws in our country do not permit this. The war here ended just recently. Our country needs political stability, solidarity, and unity in order to build and expand the economy. The enemy forces are watching, implementing a policy of encirclement, and trying to destroy the just cause of our people. Within the country, there are reactionary elements who were punished by the revolution. If we accept political pluralism and opposition parties, that would be tantamount to enabling these reactionary forces to rise up and legally carry on activities opposing the fatherland, the people, and the system. That is something that the people certainly cannot accept. In recent interviews and speeches in the United States, even Nguyen Cao Ky, a strong anti-communist who once served as the premier of the Republic of Vietnam, said that "if a poor and backward country like Vietnam follows the American model of democracy in all respects, that will just lead to disorder, smuggling, and prostitution." He said that 30-40 years ago, Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore "arose from a single-party system," and they "did not tolerate opposition." The main purpose of such a system was to enable them to create political and social stability and create the necessary preconditions for developing a market economy. Those countries have "succeeded brilliantly and built a strong economy." "They have become democratic and progressive countries that serve as a model for underdeveloped, third-world countries." [Footnote 1] [See TIME, 7, 8 November 1992 and VIETNAM, 7 November 1992] Reality shows that in countries that have implemented political pluralism and that have allowed opposition parties, there is often instability or there may be coups. A number of people who have studied international political systems have summarized and revealed figures proving that of the 23 countries that have a one-party system, 19 are stable countries and 4 are relatively stable. None were unstable. Of the 26 countries that had a multi-party system, 11 were stable, 2 were relatively stable, and 13 were unstable. In a number of Eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union, after they implemented political pluralism and permitted opposition parties, there was great turmoil and bloody warfare. These countries experienced a serious economic crisis and were unable to develop, and the standard of living of the people declined. Recently, some people have said that not implementing "party pluralism" is undemocratic and that the level of democracy of a country is manifested by the existence of many parties. In my view, such a view is incorrect. The existence of many parties is not an index of whether a society is or is not democratic or how democratic it is. South Vietnamese society during the American-Diem period had many parties such as the Can Lao, Nhan Vi, Duy Linh, and Democrat parties, and there were hundreds of political and social organizations. But it cannot be said that that society was democratic, and it cannot be said that that society was more democratic than the present society. In my view, the democratic character and level of a country and society are determined primarily by the degree to which the ownership rights of the majority of the people are manifested and the degree to which the interests and will of the majority of people (meaning the laboring people) are implemented in society. Democracy is a manifestation and implementation of the ownership rights of the people. The administration is in the hands of the laboring people, and it defends and serves the interests of the laboring people and exploits the intelligence, energy, and creativity of the people. Democracy has nothing to do with how many parties there are. We are switching to a multi-faceted economy, but as mentioned above, this is a socialist-oriented multi-faceted economy that is controlled and regulated by the state. Because of this, just because there are many economic elements, there doesn't have to be many opposing classes and many political parties. The "many party" arguments of the anti-communist forces are actually aimed at reducing or eliminating the leadership of the communist party, creating turmoil and disorder in the country, and toppling the regime. That is their only objective. People have spread rumors and demanded "democracy," "pluralism," "many parties," and "human rights" as a front for implementing their insidious plot of creating turmoil and destroying things from within. Moreover, do those countries and people who are calling for "pluralism and many parties" really accept those organizations and forces that oppose them? Why do they advocate killing communist leaders, annihilating those who oppose them, and suppressing movements opposing the regime? Before they seize power, people praise "democracy," "pluralism," and "many parties," but after they have seized power and eliminated the leadership of the communist party, they immediately ban activities by the communist party, place communism outside the law, demand that the assets of the party be nationalized, close the offices of the party, burn down the offices of the party central committee, and look for ways to take revenge on and eliminate communist party members. Why is this? After they seize power, they no longer talk about "pluralism and many parties." The Communist Party of Vietnam has never imposed its monopolistic leadership role. To have the people recognize it as the leader, the party has undergone a long and difficult struggle filled with challenges and sacrifices. Hundreds of thousands of outstanding people of the party and nation have fallen. Establishing the leadership of the party is the fruit of the revolutionary struggle waged by the working class and the entire Vietnamese nation. Although there have been times when the party made mistakes, because it promptly admitted and corrected its shortcomings, the party still has the trust of most people. To date, no one can refute the leadership role of the Communist Party of Vietnam, and there is no other political force besides the Communist Party of Vietnam with the capabilities and conditions to lead the Vietnamese revolution. Only the imperialists and reactionaries are slandering the party and trying to reduce its prestige and eliminate its leadership role. Only a dolt would reject the revolutionary achievements scored by his people and want to create opposition parties, thinking that that is democratic freedom. The leadership contents and methods of the party in a market economy: As the only party with the power to lead all of society in market economy conditions, the Communist Party of Vietnam clearly recognizes its responsibilities to the country and people and the honor given it. The party is responsible for correctly determining the direction, targets, and path of the country, and it is responsible for the prosperity of the nation. It leads the entire political system and social apparatus, above all the state and organizations, in hitting the targets and fulfilling the tasks pointed out, leads the systematization and promulgation of party resolutions as laws, designs the apparatus, trains and assigns cadres, controls and trains cadres to support carrying out the political tasks, controls the implementation of the party's policies and lines, reviews practices, and revises and perfects the lines and policies. Everything is aimed at maintaining a correct political character and orientation on the country's path forward and on the nation's path of development. In the economic sphere, the party points out economic development lines and strategies, ensures the political character in the development of the economy, enables the economy to grow at a rapid pace, have high labor productivity, and have larger and larger production forces in line with a socialist orientation, limits injustices and exploitation, and looks after and protects the interests of the laboring people. This is manifested not only at the central echelon and in the macrocosmic leadership and management activities but also in each party cell. Every party base and every cadre and party member is responsible for ensuring that the party's political guidelines are understood thoroughly in all economic and social activities. These are functions that no one but the party can carry out. The leading tasks of the party committee echelons are to lead and control things and directly struggle to implement the policies and lines of the party effectively and to ensure that all the economic elements follow the socialist guidelines and do not slip out of the socialist orbit. The party committee echelons, party chapters, and party members at the state enterprises, collective economic units, and joint and private enterprises are responsible for leading the masses and mass organizations in striving to put the party's resolutions into life, struggling to implement the stipulations of the party and the laws of the state, protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the workers and laborers, opposing barbaric acts of exploitation, and opposing beating laborers or treating them harshly. Naturally, in today's conditions, the party cannot lead and operate using the old formulas. The party must maintain its leadership role. It cannot relax or reduce its leadership role. At the same time, it must exploit the role of the administrative organizations, economic organizations, and mass organizations. A distinction must be made between the leadership of the party and the management of the administrative organizations and between administrative management and management of commercial production. The party committee echelons must not become overly involved in or perform the daily management functions of the administration or economic organizations. The party provides concrete and close leadership but it must not become involved in carrying out things and giving orders. It must lead through the party members and party organizations. Party members who are assigned to state organizations and economic organizations must act in accord with the program and line of the party and implement the principle of democratic centralism. The party's organizational system must be solidified and streamlined, and it must provide clear, quick, and dynamic leadership in accord with the market mechanism. The party must lead using democratic methods and persuasion. The cadres and party members must set an example in implementing the resolutions of the party and the laws of the state, and they must regularly mobilize and persuade people outside the party. The party organizations must renovate their activities and operations to make them more dynamic, reduce the number of unnecessary meetings, strengthen on-the-spot control and guidance, and monitor the bases closely. The basic and decisive conditions for ensuring that the party provides good and effective leadership are that the party must be really pure and strong politically, ideologically, and organizationally, and it must be very close to the people and have the trust and support of the people. In the present situation, the party must have strong political capabilities, adhere firmly to the targets and ideals, have intelligence and knowledge, have adequate information, and have the ability to handle complex problems promptly and correctly. The party must build a tight organizational system with a small but strong apparatus, including a system of law-governed state organizations and mass organizations. The party must have excellent and loyal staff organizations to help do the work. These must have the ability to analyze and integrate things, propose solutions, and control and evaluate projects. The party must build a rank of loyal and devoted cadres and party members who have good moral qualities and leadership and managerial capabilities, who are knowledgeable about and can manage the economy, who are knowledgeable about the law and can manage the state using the laws, and who can adjust to markets quickly and enthusiastically. All cadres and party members must give attention to improving their political quality, adhere to the guidelines and paths decided on, improve their intellectual standards and work capabilities, study regularly, improve their revolutionary ethics, live a wholesome life, and strive to eliminate corruption and other degenerate phenomena within the party. Only by resolutely removing the tumors in its own body (regardless of how painful this is) can the party develop in a wholesome and vigorous manner. Once the party is strong and robust, has internal solidarity, unity and tight discipline, and has the trust and support of the people, there will not be any obstacle that the party can't overcome or anything that the party can't do.
