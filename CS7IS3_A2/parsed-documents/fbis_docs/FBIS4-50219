One after another, the various departments are beginning to operate with their new functions and organizations. The implementation of local institutional reform has also been kicked off on a full scale, with a dozen or so provinces and autonomous regions such as Liaoning, Jilin, Anhui, Shandong, and Guangdong having embarked on their institutional reform programs ahead of schedule. To further deepen administrative reform, the General Office of the Central Organization Committee [COC] recently sponsored an international seminar on administrative reform and management in Beijing. Experts, scholars, and government officials from Thailand, Hong Kong, France, the United States, Britain, India, Australia, and China attended the seminar. Zhang Zhijian, deputy director of the COC General Office and vice minister of personnel, told the meeting that over recent years, China has concentrated on changes in various social and economic fields to unfold -- from top to bottom -- a round of reforms in the administrative system and in institutions, to meet the needs of building a socialist market economic system. These reforms yielded first fruits in changing the functions of government institutions, smoothing working relations, streamlining organizations and personnel, and improving efficiency, to bring about a major step forward in shaping a new administrative and management system suited to the socialist market economy. According to Zhang Zhijian, in the process of reforming the administrative system and institutions, China met with some protruding problems in areas such as building a macroeconomic regulation and control system and making administrative rules. He said: This international seminar will have a very important affect on further summing up the current practice of reform, better drawing on useful ancient and modern experiences at home and abroad, and vigorously advancing the next step of administrative reform. Gu Jiaqi [7357 1367 7784], deputy director of the COC General Office, gave a special speech to the seminar on the planning and implementation of administrative reform by the Chinese Government.
