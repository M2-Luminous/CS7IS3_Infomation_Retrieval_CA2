It [is] not a question that New Delhi is asking itself, but a hope it is cherishing. The manner in which it handled the Hazbatbal crisis and the fact that some people are fed up with militancy have boosted the government's optimism, though casualties among the troops are increasing. But there is little in common between Punjab and Kashmir, except the gun. "Equating the two is doing us great injustice," says Prof. Abdul Gani of the Muslim Conference. "Punjab is an integral part of India, the Sikh's was a cultural revolt against the Hindus. Here it is a political problem. We don't say we are Muslims and so give us certain rights." This view finds wide support in Srinagar. The people point to J&K's [Jammu and Kashmir] disputed status, and the international interest in it, which were absent in Punjab's case. And they bluntly reject any package, economic or political, saying that they had never demanded concessions of any kind. There is a host of other differences. Pakistan never claimed a right on Punjab, though it helped the militants, and the people of Punjab and Pakistan had nothing in common. Pakistani infiltration of Punjab was a fraction of what it has been in J&K. While buses from Lal Chowk have taken boys to Rawalpindi and Muzzaffarabad, no such buses had gone from Punjab. The sealing of Punjab border was effective but it is impossible on the Kashmir border, from where one can trek to Muzzaffarabad overnight in summer. The Punjab militant may have been far more deadly than the Kashmiri but he was backed by no more than 15 percent of the population. In Kashmir the security forces assess the support to be 60 percent. Till two years ago, the Kashmiri militant seeking shelter was given a hero's welcome, completed with a 36-course wazwan (feast) and there would be nightlong wunwun (music). The Punjab militant got nothing like that. The police sympathise with the militants, the government officers give them a day's salary every month, and the politicians have decided to keep out. Even the judiciary is suspect. Without the help of the police the security forces can do little. In Punjab it was J.F. Riberio and K.P.S. Gill who had called the shots, the security forces were merely assisting them. In Kashmir the army, BSF [Border Security Force] and CRPF [Central Reserve Police force] handle the law and order--a task for which they are not equipped. But they are confident of ending the problem in less than a year if the police really start working. In Punjab the turnaround came when the difference between criminals and militants disappeared. In Kashmir the militants have not lost their heroic aura. For fear of agents provocateurs infiltrating their ranks and dirtying their organisations, militant leaders like Shabir Shah have ordered a thorough screening of every recruit. The people who are ready to take on the militants are just a handful, says a security officer. Some do it out of grudge, some are fed up with atrocities, some rat for a consideration. Punjab was easier terrain. Most showdowns and encounters were in the open fields. There was not much chance of innocent citizens getting caught in the crossfire. In Kashmir, the militants fire from the windows and the security men are forced to shoot back at the buildings, harming innocents. "Even when they come out in the open and fire, they do it from behind a human shield, often of small children and women. We try not to harm the people, but if a jawan is killed, the others don't care," said an officer. The demographic profiles, too, vary. In Punjab, the Hindus are only marginally fewer than the Sikhs, but in Kashmir the Muslims have overwhelming majority. Even Ladakh has 48 percent Muslims, and Jammu 34 percent. In Punjab, elections could be held with good Hindu and urban turnout; it preempted criticism that the government was unrepresentative. Any such effort in Kashmir will have little success. Besides, there is the political vacuum. The politicians are reluctant even to visit the valley. In Punjab, at least a few parties carried on their campaign and shaped the public opinion. The CPI [Communist Party of India], the Congress and the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] paid a heavy price, but remained staunchly anti-terrorist. Kashmir requires a different touch. Right now, no solution is possible without the involvement of the Huriyat Conference or some of its constituents. Hurried elections may only deepen the mire in a place where rigging has fuelled the fury. Governor K.V. Krishna Rao has been trying to push the politicians into the valley. "They have been making all kinds of excuses, out of fear," he says. Gulam Nabi Shaheen, the Srinagar block president of the National Conference who lives in Jammu, believes that his party can play a mediatory role. But "for a political process to be successful, it is imperative that the government talks to Shabir Shah, Yaseen Malik and others. First, the guns have to be silenced, and all detainees released unconditionally," he says. "Elections now will achieve nothing." Ali Mohammad Sagar, minister in Farooq's cabinet, too, lives in Jammu. "At least 20 ex-MLAs [members of Legislative Assembly] have been killed," says Sagar who believes that bringing Farooq will not help. "Listen to people like Shabir Shah," he tells the government. "Many militant leaders are seasoned, educated, qualified and have a following. There are those who abhor the gun culture. If Laldenga and Prafulla Mahanta can be won over, why not these people? Don't make it a prestige issue, take a humane view." Others too want Shabir Shah and Yaseen Malik to be won over, though they don't say it in so many words. Veteran Congressman Sardar Rangeel Singh, who was in the cabinet of Syed Mir Qasim and Sheikh Abdullah, says "the old leadership has become redundant" and former party general secretary Mangat Ram Sharma is for harnessing Muslim nationalist forces. Says BJP leader Chaman Lal Gupta: "If we eliminate the gun and hold elections, leaders will be thrown up. If Shabir Shah and Yaseen Malik are elected to power under the Constitution of India, we should accept it. But it has to be a very fair and free election." Members of the Huriyat pooh-pooh the talk of political process. "Any political process will have to be in a country outside India and Pakistan, with international guarantees," says Javied Ahmed Mir, acting chief of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front. Prof. Gani calls it a political prattle since a political process that does not address the basic issue of the dispute will serve no purpose. According to Mian Abdul Quayoom, another member of the Huriyat, the only acceptable process involves demilitarisation of the region. UN trusteeship of it for five years, election of an interim government, and self-determination by the people. Huriyat chairman Mirwaiz Maulvi Umar Farooq too rejects a political process and Shabir Shah himself calls it nonsense. Interestingly, there are people who assert that Farooq Abdullah is the de facto chief of the JKLF [Kammu Kashmir Liberation Front] and that it will do what he wants. Says Mushtaq Ahmed Lone, former National Conference MLA: "Dr Farooq Abdullah is a founder of the JKLF movement." The JKLF, however, has dismissed it as a canard. Is Dr Abdullah, who recently paid a visit to Kashmir, still relevant otherwise? To New Delhi, he, being a nationalist, is a trump card to be played at international fora. Besides, people over 45 still have a sympathy for his party. And as Mangat Ram Sharma says he is a bird in hand and is better than two in the bush. Whatever it be, most people believe that 1994 cannot be the election year in the valley. "Give me the choice between my job and being a returning officer, and I will quit," says a bureaucrat. Even the security forces say no elections will be possible in the very near future. "The people are too petrified to go to the polls," says an officer. All the same, New Delhi may not depend on the advice of the security forces, partly because it feels that they have developed vested interests in militancy--even though it does not give credence to allegations that border tracts are put to auction for collecting fabulous sums offered by the militants as bribes to let them cross the border. Besides, with mounting international pressure, India may have to force certain things, as Home Minister S.B. Chavan has put it. ABDUL GANI: MUSLIM CONFERENCE The 56-year-old professor of Persian was dismissed from government service in 1986, on the grounds that he was a potential threat to the security of the country. "A professor is a professor. He enjoys the academic freedom to talk, to express himself sufficiently on any subject," he says. "In that capacity, I called a spade a spade. I considered all along that the Kashmir dispute would not only bring untold misery to the people of the state but also lead to wars between India and Pakistan. You can keep the people against their wishes for a time, not all time. That's a lesson I learnt from history. "The professor is unequivocal about his preference: accession to Pakistan. MD ASHRAF SAHRAI: JAMAIT ISLAMIA The Jamait Islamia of J&K may not be the biggest political party or constituent of the Huriyat Conference, but its power lies in the fact that its military wing, the Hizbul Mujahdeen, is the most dreaded outfit, with a cadre whose fire power is matched by its motivation. Though the Islamia talks about the Kashmiris' right to self-determination, it is in favour of Kashmir's merger with Pakistan. That is why Mohammad Ashraf Sahrai, general secretary of the Islamia, has been attracting attention. "The only political parties in the war zone," he says, "are the Jamait Islamia and the Awami Action Committee." Incidentally, Sahrai is proud of protecting temples in Kupwara from an angry procession. *
