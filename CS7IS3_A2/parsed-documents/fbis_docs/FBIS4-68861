Panov, correspondent: "Nuclear Power Engineering Has No Right To Exist if It Is Unsafe for People's Lives!"; place and date not given] [Text] [Panov] You and I have known each other for a long time, since 1974--when you came to work at the Technical Administration of the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy and Electrification. And later all I heard about you concerned your precipitous upward flight to the country's highest echelon of power--the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers. [Kopchynskyy] I started out at the Physics Institute of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences, then I moved to the Ministry of Energy and Electrification, and in 1976 I was sent to the Chernobyl AES, at first in the post of deputy chief engineer for scientific matters, and then--for operations. I took part in the start-up of the first units there. Then I worked for three years as director of the Smolensk AES, and in 1983 I was transferred to the post of chief of the Nuclear Power Engineering Sector under the Department of Heavy Industry and Power Engineering within the CPSU Central Committee. After M. Gorbachev did away with the sectorial departments within the CPSU Central Committee, I moved over to the post of chief of the Department of Nuclear Power Engineering and Industry under the USSR Council of Ministers. My sphere of competence there encompassed all the facilities engaged in nuclear power engineering, including the gigantic centers of the USSR Ministry of Medium Machine Building and the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1991 I returned to Kiev. This decision took a long time to ripen within me, but with the disintegration of the Soviet Union made it final. [Panov] Did you know about the activity of the "Greens" in Ukraine? [Kopchynskyy] I certainly did. This was one of the reasons why I began to devote more time and effort to studying safety problems at AES's. The principal reason was, of course, the Chernobyl catastrophe, as well as the continued, conscious yearning to develop nuclear power construction at any price. If you recall, even after the Chernobyl disaster and the shutting down of the Crimean, Odessa, and Kharkov AES's, the people at the State Plan insisted on a figure of 36 million kilowatts of nuclear capacity in Ukraine. A group of scientists at the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences headed up by B. Paton requested that this figure be lowered to 28 million; whereas the "Greens" insisted on a moratorium. The then deputy chairman of the Ukrainian SSR Council of Ministers, V. Hladush, the minister of energy and electrification, V. Sklyarov, and I endeavored to persuade the people at the State Plan that it could not ignore public opinion and that this could lead to unforeseen consequences. Unfortunately, most of the highly placed persons in Moscow failed to understand this; they behaved incorrectly in their relations with people, and this simply caused an outcry. The habit of a command style, secrecy, and a certain conscious exclusivity could not be overcome even by Chernobyl. Nobody wanted to consciously acknowledge that the nuclear power people were to blame for Chernobyl and that exerting pressure on public opinion had no future prospects. [Panov] Today the president of Ukraine has signed an Edict on the development of nuclear power engineering without a public discussion on the matter; it even bears the designation "Not for Press Release." Doesn't it seem to you that this is a return to the old days?.... [Kopchynskyy] I don't think that this was done on the president's initiative. More likely it was activated by certain departmental structures with the active support of certain officials from the apparatus of the Cabinet of Ministers. But as to a return to the old days, this situation certainly is very reminiscent of the pre-perestroyka period, when safety problems were put on the back burner. What was put on the front burner was kilowatt-hours. Come on, come on, let's have more and more.... There was a demand for increasing capacity no matter what the price. And this tendency is now manifesting itself in Ukraine--all nuclear matters are to be gathered into one pair of hands, everything kept behind a curtain of secrecy, decisions made without coordination or reconciliation with specialists and with the general public. I have observed this tendency over the course of a year, and the decision with regard to Chernobyl was a serious argument for submitting my resignation. [Panov] It's a well-known fact that construction of the Chernobyl AES was carried out at an intensive pace: The builders were hounded, and the units had to be started up as soon as possible. And so how do you assess the quality of this construction? [Kopchynskyy] Of course, there were problems, but the quality of the construction at the Chernobyl AES was far from ranking last in comparison with certain other nuclear power stations. The construction chief, A. Klyzyma, was a wonderful leader, and V. Bryukhanov was a high-principled director; he was not afraid to argue with his superiors. But the RBMK [uranium-graphite, heterogenous, single-loop, boiling-water reactor] units themselves were too heavy from the viewpoint of physics, thermohydraulics, and dynamics. The construction of the safety systems in the design of these facilities was inferior. The safety and control systems were solved in an academically incorrect manner. On the whole, the level of safety standards here in our country is significantly lower than in the West. Nowhere abroad is there such a cavalier-type attitude toward the positive effect of the capacity to react in a timely and eficient manner as there is in our country. [Panov] But how did it happen that--when the Supreme Council adopted the decision to lift the moratorium and continue operations at the Chernobyl AES--there were essentially no opponents, nor was there a principled approach to this matter on the part of the Derzhatomnahlyad? [Kopchynskyy] The fact of the matter was that we were not even forewarned that such a decision was about to be taken, and at the previous session of the Supreme Council Presidium nobody spoke except for Derzhatom. Neither the Derzhatomnahlyad, nor the Ministry of Environmental Protection, nor the Ministry of Health. There was a tendency.... And at the session of the Supreme Council itself nobody was interested in listening to opponents. There was a clamor, and that was all there was to it. We submitted several notes to the Cabinet of Ministers and to the president in which we expressed our opinion. It boiled down to this: During the wintertime maximum utilization of power it was impossible to shut Chernobyl down, but after the winter this must be done. It should be done gradually, as other, alternative capacities come on line. But when the motion was made to revive Unit No. 2 at the Chernobyl AES, this became utterly incomprehensible. Why was it necessary to do so? This unit is an old one, and the safety systems are insufficient. Furthermore, we have no problems of power-generating capacities at present. There is no need for additional electric power because the economy is in a state of crisis. All this attests to the fact that what is a work here is a consciously extered pressure; the government is returning to its old-time procedures. [Panov] Heorhiy Oleksiyovych, here in Kiev you held a solid post as first deputy chief of the Derzhatomnahlyad. Just what was it--after all--that made you leave it? [Kopchynskyy] That's a long story, Anatoliy Mykhaylovych, and quite a complicated one. When the USSR Derzhatomnahlyad was created in 1984, there were many obstacles from various quarters. We had to struggle and to prove that such a committee was necessary. Because, you know, prior to this there had been only departmental monitoring controls; the attitude toward the problems of nuclear safety was--to put it mildly--cavalierish. I was badly bruised along this path and was frequently in conflict-type situations. Then the Chernobyl catastrophe occurred, and after that--after the initial shock had worn off--the leading officials of the Union-level departments again manifested the same old tendency to belittle safety problems; it became evident that there was a return to the old ways. I decided to move to Ukraine and to attempt to accomplish something here. The chief of the Ukrainian Derzhatomnahlyad, M. Shetynberg, and I reached a mutual understanding, and we set to work. We prepared draft laws on radiation protection and the use of nuclear power, a program for building up the infrastructure of nuclear power engineering, a whole series of normative documents, and various proposals regarding the modernization reconstruction of AES's. In time, however, it became obvious that the Government leaders had begun to look askance in our direction; they were beginning to express the thought that the main thing for Ukraine nowadays was to survive. It was evident that that the organ for the state regulation of safety at AES's was becoming a burden for these leaders. We ceased to be invited to deliberations where the fate of nuclear power engineering was being decided. All our endeavors to create a safety system based on world approaches evoked active opposition from the government. The final straw in this matter was the decision to continue operations at the Chernobyl AES. I decided that I had had enough. I don't want to remain in a 1986-type situation anymore. I went through a great deal that year, superhuman pressure--psychological, physical, and moral. I was hounded by the following thoughts: What had happened and why? What must be done to make sure that such things do not happen again?... I don't want to remain anymore in such a situation. I don't wish to be in the Ukrainian Derzhatomnahlyad if all the decisions are being made without it, if these decisions contradict that concept of safety which should prevail in Ukraine--a country where the greatest technical-type catastrophe in the history of humankind occurred. We must be ensured and re-ensured against any such catastrophes. Nuclear power engineering does not have the right to exist if it is unsafe for people's lives. I don't want to bear responsibility for the Supreme Council and the Government of Ukraine. Therefore, I decided to leave. I have never maintained that nuclear power engineering is completely unnecessary. But I am categorically opposed to a lack of responsibility and and a conscious lack of principles on the part of the departments concerned.
