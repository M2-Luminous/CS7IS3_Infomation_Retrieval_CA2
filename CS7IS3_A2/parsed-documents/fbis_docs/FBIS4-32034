Even though everything was ready for the continuation of the negotiations in Krajina and in Plitvice, the failure by the Croatian delegation to turn up has practically blocked the negotiating process. What was in fact happening during the consultations shortly before the talks were supposed to take place? There were plenty of comments, but we sought the answer from Borislav Mikelic, head of the government and the Krajina negotiating delegation. [Mikelic] Their rejection of the continuation of the negotiations and failure to come to Plitvice, because we had allegedly not agreed to allow five journalists to come here, is a transparent thing and cannot be the reason as to why there are no negotiations. It appears to me that the central thing in all this is that Sarinic [chief Croatian negotiator] had realized that he would not be the host in Plitvice, but us, that he would not be able to promote himself in Plitvice, and that he would not be able to manifest what he wants, that he would be under the completely equal conditions, like us. He had realized that, in the presence of the international community, the talks would be held in the way they should, that there would be no pressure, nor agreements prepared in advance according to which the Serbs would allow this and that, without at the same time seeing what is behind this. [Sarac] What should be done next? Will the negotiations continue? [Mikelic] In our view, everything that we had prepared, the platform that had been prepared by our government, we are prepared to continue the talks tomorrow. We have therefore not disrupted the talks. We have not given up the negotiations. We were not the cause of the talks' failure either. Those who did not come to Plitvice, because of the journalists, I think that they are responsible for not coming to Plitvice.
