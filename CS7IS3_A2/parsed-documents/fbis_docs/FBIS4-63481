It says: "On 20 May, the Supreme Soviet of Crimea adopted a law on `The restoration of the constitutional bases of the statehood of the Republic of Crimea,' thus making an attempt to restore Crimea's Constitution to its 6 May 1992 form. This law is unconstitutional and illegal. It is leading to tension in interethnic relations on the peninsula and in Ukraine as a whole, and brings into question the legal status of the Republic of Crimea as a constituent part of Ukraine, which represents a direct threat to the territorial integrity of Ukraine and peace and stability in the region." In this connection A.M. Zlenko, Ukrainian foreign affairs minister, has sent letters to the UN secretary general, chairman of the Security Committee, CSCE chairman, NATO secretary general, heads of other international organizations, and foreign affairs ministers of other countries. In his letters the head of the Ukrainian foreign policy department stresses, in particular, that this unlawful decision, provoked by irresponsible policies of the present Crimean leadership, is aimed at undermining Ukraine's constitutional structures and its territorial integrity, and cannot be qualified as anything other than an open attempt by separatist forces to jeopardize internal political stability in Ukraine and bring about tension in relations between Ukraine and Russia. This puts in danger peace and stability in the region and in the whole of Europe, which, taking into account a complex current situation in this part of the continent, can have grave negative consequences. "Today, when the European countries participating in the Conference on the Pact on Stability in Europe have agreed on the exceptional importance of the unconditional preservation and consolidation of the principles of territorial integrity, and the inviolability of existing borders as a guarantee of peace and security in Europe, such separatist strivings by the leadership of the Republic of Crimea could lead to the further erosion of these fundamental international legal principles, upon which European stability is based. "In the event of the situation escalating further as a consequence of irresponsible steps by extremist forces in Crimea, Ukraine reserves the right to adopt all necessary measures to ensure unconditionally the territorial integrity of the state in accordance with its constitution and existing legislation, while observing the norms of international law."
