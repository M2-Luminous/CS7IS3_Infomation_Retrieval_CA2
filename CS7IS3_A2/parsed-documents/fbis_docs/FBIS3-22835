The "quadripartite agreement" allows the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEO) to inspect nuclear installations of partners to the agreement. The Brazilian Senate ratified the agreement last Wednesday [9 February], apparently under the Federal Government's pressure. On Friday [11 February], the Foreign Ministry in Bonn said that this "will create a stronger non-proliferation basis to allow continued cooperation in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy." The Federal Government hopes that Brazil will shortly ratify the Tlatelolco Agreement on creating a nuclear-weapons-free zone in Latin America and the Caribbean, the Ministry said. The German company Siemens-KWU is building the Angra II nuclear power plant near Rio de Janeiro. According to reports in the Brazilian press, the Federal Government threatened to stop nuclear cooperation after 1995 unless Brazil admits IAEO inspectors. At the moment, routine inspections can only be carried out on appointment and in certain installations. If there is a founded suspicion of radioactive material being used for military applications, the IAEO may also examine the sensitive area of uranium enrichment. Brazil had repeatedly been suspected of being far advanced into building an atomic bomb.
