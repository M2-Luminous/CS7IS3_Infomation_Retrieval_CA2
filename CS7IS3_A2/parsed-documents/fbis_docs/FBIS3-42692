A day before this, Mr. Fedorov did not accept Viktor Chernomyrdin's official proposal to retain for himself the post of chief financier, with direct subordination to the prime minister and broadened powers at the expense of a cut in the functions of Aleksandr Shokhin (negotiations with the West on debts). It was not the lowering of his status as deputy prime minister as such that Boris Fedorov considered "insulting" to himself, but the background against which it occurred: the purely formal, from his standpoint, reorganization of the Cabinet of Ministers and the more and more apparent departure from the reform policy of 1993. "If the policy is being changed, evidently another minister of finance is needed," he said at a press conference. Commenting on Viktor Chernomyrdin's statement heard four hours earlier on the transition to "the fight against inflation through nonmonetary methods," Boris Fedorov said that he did not know what this was, implying by this a hopeless attempt to raise production through inflationary emissions. "Even given three times as many big infusions, production will fall in 1994 by 5 percent," he said. Monetary emissions in the past year, according to Ministry of Finance calculations, amounted to 30-35 percent of all expenditures of the republic budget. Not one economy in the world had such a ratio. If this share is raised, which, apparently, the government and the Central Bank intend to do, then, according to the conviction of the ex-minister of finance, "we are on the threshold of Ukrainization." In this case the country, in the words of Boris Fedorov, "is being doomed to a pitiful existence." He noted though that in January-February of 1994 the factors of a tough financial policy for the four last months of last year will still restrain the acceleration of inflation. However, as early as in March-April, "an explosion will occur." A monstrous increase in prices, a drop in the real incomes of the population, and an unavoidable breakdown in production will be the result for the year. "I was the minister of finance, and the country had a financial policy," said Boris Fedorov. "But where is our industrial and agrarian policy, and where were those who in their positions were responsible for them?" The ex-minister proved to be true to himself in the straightforwardness of his political formulations, and he did not decline a personal assessment of the activity of the agrarian deputy prime minister, M. Zaveryukha, and the chief banker, Mr. Gerashchenko. He defined their role as "destructive" for reform. Boris Fedorov responded just as harshly to the statements of Professor Yasin and ex-ministers of the economy Saburov and Nechayev who claimed that allegedly in 1993 the ruble rate of exchange was held in check by monetary interventions on the stock exchange. Mr. Fedorov attributed these conclusions to the fact that the economists were poorly informed: "We supported the exchange rate of the dollar and not of the ruble, in order to preserve the effectiveness of our exports. He cited this fact as evidence: out of $4 billion given by the Ministry of Finance to the Central Bank, the latter used only $1.5 billion at the auctions of the MMVB [Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange]. The report of the Ministry of Finance, "Russian Finances for 1993," according to the assurances of the ex-minister, will show the real economic policy and its results. In this connection, the former deputy prime minister subjected Strobe Talbott--the second person in the hierarchy of the State Department of the United States and a personal friend of President Clinton--to sharp criticism. He called Mr. Talbott's recommendation--"less shock and more therapy"--inexpert. "In what did he see the shock?" asked Boris Fedorov. "In the fact that inflation was 20-30 percent, that in one year there was only a total of five bankrupt enterprises, and that the level of unemployment amounted to 1 percent of the number of those employed? We are moving to the market rather softly, and let Mr. Talbott cite another example." The minister, who is resigning, sees the main danger precisely in the departure from a moderately tough policy. This, in his words, is even more regrettable, because "the time for radicalism in economic policy has ended, it is not necessary in 1994 to make even one major radical decision." The main things have been done: favorable credits and import subsidies have been canceled, prices for bread and coal have been liberalized, and the refinancing rate of the Central Bank has practically become positive. The question now concerns only the creation and reinforcement of the market institutions. The time has arrived for professional and "conservative" work, according to Boris Fedorov's observation. He is not convinced that the current staff of the Cabinet of Ministers, a coalition in composition, conforms to these tasks. It reminds Mr. Fedorov "of something like Silayev's cabinet, where there was movement neither forward, nor backward." To the question concerning the prospects of Mr. Chernomyrdin's government, "resigner" Fedorov answered with meaning: "The president has the right to change the government. I hope that he will use it."
