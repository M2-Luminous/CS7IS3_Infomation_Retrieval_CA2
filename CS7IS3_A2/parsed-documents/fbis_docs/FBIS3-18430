Denktas said that by this attitude the United Nations had paved the way for an endorsement of all the evil that this side has done over the past 30 years to the Turkish Cypriots. Denktas was addressing a conference in Kyrenia on Saturday organized by the Turkish United Nations Association and entitled "The United Nations and the Cyprus question." Denktas said that the United Nations today was still an organization that the larger countries saw as a platform for promoting their own interests. He added that these countries were trying to solve the Cyprus problem without having analyzed it properly, and were putting forward proposals which had been prepared without sounding out the actual parties to the dispute. "(Former Cypriot President Archbishop) Makarios tried in 1963 to destroy the republic of Cyprus, which was based on a partnership, by force of arms and to establish a Greek Republic. The Turkish Cypriots never consented to the administration of Makarios. This is the dispute," Denktas said. He added that as long as the usurpation of the Presidency of Cyprus by force of arms is not ended then a solution to the problem of Cyprus could not be found, "because this problem had been created in order for the Presidency to be occupied by force." Denktas said that the Greek Cypriots had hidden behind the title of "the legitimate government of Cyprus" and repeated that the Cyprus question was the result of this usurpation by the Greek Cypriots. "The moment you get rid of the usurper the Cyprus problem is solved" he insisted. The Turkish Cypriot President went on to add that the Greek Cypriot side was making all its calculations on the assumption that it would be accepted as a member of the European Union, mainly in order to get rid of Turkey's right of guarantee over the status of Cyprus. If such membership is granted the Greek Cypriots, he went on to say, this would tip the balance on the island. Providing an example for the attitude of large countries, Denktas cited the case of the United States, and pointed out that in the bimonthly report presented by President Bill Clinton to Congress the Greek Cypriot leader was always referred to as the President of Cyprus. Denktas said that they had always objected to this. He added that when he had brought the matter up with the U.S. ambassador in Nicosia the previous day the ambassador, "in a very honest and friendly manner," had said, "I do not want to mislead you on this. This is the way matters stand and this is the way they will remain. There exist neither the means for the conditions to change this." Denktas declared: "It becomes clear in this manner how U.N. principles are implemented and where they want to take us. We never mentioned this before but we are in a position to oppose if from now on." Referring to the package of confidence building measures put forward by the United Nations, Denktas said that this also revealed an attempt to deprive the Turkish side of its basic rights. "They are doing everything in their power to implement the scenario in their own minds and to pressurize us, as if the things we are saying are not important," Denktas said. He went on to underline that a solution for the Cyprus problem was something that was necessary for the Turkish side in the first instance, because it was the side that was faced with an embargo whereas the Greek side was availing itself of all the advantages of the world. "For the Cyprus problem to be solved means for the Greek Cypriots to step down from the claim of legitimate government," Denktas added.
