So far, some 100 citizens have made purchases under the new credit system, buying color televisions, air conditioners and refrigerators. After paying one-sixth of a product's purchase price, customers should pay off the balance owed within a year. The service is staged by Shanghai Yintong Trust Ltd., jointly funded by the Shanghai Investment and Trust Corporation and other local and Hong Kong partners. It is stipulated that customers with monthly incomes above 600 yuan can apply for the installment plan. They may begin to buy goods on credit after passing a Yintong Ltd. capital and credit assessment. Shanghai First department store, which experimented with installment sales last November, has offered consultancy to more than 2,000 interested customers. Many consumers think that the plan can help them make reasonable family economic arrangements and relieve their worries over price hikes. This month, three other shops in the city have also adopted the measure.
