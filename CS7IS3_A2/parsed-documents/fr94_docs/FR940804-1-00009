FR940804-1-00009 FR940804-1-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Parts 36 and 91 [Docket No. 25109, Notice No. 86&hyph;16] RIN 2120&hyph;AC22 Civil Supersonic Airplane Noise Type Certification Standards and Operating Rules AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Proposed rule; withdrawal. SUMMARY: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is withdrawing a previously published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to amend the Federal Aviation Regulations to revise the airplane type certification standards and operating rules. The proposed amendments would have required that future civil supersonic airplanes meet noise limits consistent with those required for future civil subsonic airplanes. The FAA is postponing development of a final rule because it cannot ensure that the final rule would be economically reasonable and technologically practical at this time. The FAA will continue to gather technical information and analyze suggested recommendations for test and measurement conditions. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Laurette Fisher, Policy and Regulatory Division (AEE&hyph;300), Office of Environment and Energy, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591, telephone (202) 267&hyph;3561. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 30, 1986, the FAA published Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking No. 86&hyph;16 (51 FR 39663), announcing its tentative intention to amend 14 CFR parts 36 and 91. The comment period for Notice No. 86&hyph;16 was reopened on March 12, 1987 (52 FR 7618) to allow interested parties additional time to comment. On May 30, 1990, the FAA published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) No. 86&hyph;16 (55 FR 22020), proposing to amend 14 CFR parts 36 and 91. These revisions were intended to aid the development of next-generation supersonic airplanes by establishing a notice standard for supersonic airplanes that is consistent with noise limits for conventional (subsonic) airplanes. In the NPRM, the FAA requested that the public comment on the following issues: (1) Requirement that future supersonic airplanes (SST) meet noise limits consistent with those required for future subsonic airplanes, (2) recommendations on test and measurement conditions and operational characteristics appropriate for future SST's, and (3) cost of the proposed rule. After analyzing the comments received on the NPRM, the FAA has determined that further investigation and research is necessary before developing the final rule. The FAA will continue to gather technical information and analyze suggested recommendations for test and measurement conditions. A statement concerning FAA policy on this matter is published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . Accordingly, Notice No. 86&hyph;16, Docket No. 25109, published in the Federal Register on May 30, 1990 (55 FR 22020), is withdrawn. Issued in Washington, DC on July 29, 1994. Paul R. Dykeman, Acting Director of Environment and Energy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18905 Filed 8&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
