Morales told reporters after the meeting that the government "agreed with us" that greater assurances should be offered concerning the 10.75 percent of Nuovo Pignone stock that will be sold on the stock market via a public purchase offer (ppa). He said he expected these assurances to be forthcoming at a further meeting at the premier's office on Thursday between the government and trade unions. In the partial privatisation deal agreed last week, General Electric heads two other U.S. companies -- Ingersoll Rand and Dresser -- taking over 49 percent of the Florence firm; ENI maintains 20.25 percent, and a consortium of Italian banks are parcelling out a further 20 percent, leaving 10.75 percent for the ppa. The continued presence of the Italian banks was the other point on which Morales said local bodies and the firm still want assurance -- despite Industry Minister Paolo Savona and Treasury Minister Piero Barucci's optimism that "the banks may stay even longer" than the four-year duration of the business plan GE has lined up, since the plan is "so strong". Morales said he spoke for Nuovo Pignone's management and workers in asking for "written guarantees" that the banks' 20 percent will not leave the country at some future stage. He also revealed that an article in the ENI-GE accord envisages five percent of Nuovo Pignone stock being offered to the company's employees, in the wake of the coming ppa. As for the merits of the business plan itself, Morales restricted himself to reporting that "the government and ENI believe that this plan will ensure company growth, employment and technological research". Official sources at the premier's office later denied Morales' assertion that government-union talks on Nuovo Pignone will take place on Thursday at the premier's office. The unions -- who seemed certain that the encounter had on the other hand been set -- meanwhile echoed Morales in calling for changes to the ENI-GE accord to ensure an Italian majority emerges after the ppa, and to ward off "the possibility of direct competitors like Dresser and Ingersoll beefing up their share in four years' time, when the Italian banks may leave the field." The Tuscan regional commissioner for labour, Enno Ghiandelli, revealed this evening that Industry Minister Paolo Savona had issued invitations for the Thursday meeting, which will again be held at the industry ministry in Rome and not at the premier's office.
