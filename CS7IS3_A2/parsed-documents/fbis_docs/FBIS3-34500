The visitors denounced the continuation of the blockade as a crime, since Iraq has fulfilled its obligations toward the so-called United Nations. They also condemned the crimes caused by the blockade, such as the death of children and old people due to shortage of food and medicine. The members expressed their admiration for Iraq's mighty resources, which have contributed to the rebuilding of what was destroyed by the evil aggressors. They noted that these resources are not just for Iraq, but for the entire Arab nation, which the enemies seek to undermine. Dr. Ahmad 'Aziz, director general of the Libyan Cultural Affairs Department, said: The resources we have seen in Iraq confirm the nation's vitality and ability for sacrifice and creativity. Had the Arab countries been given the opportunity to solidly unite together, they would have become a great nation, contributing to the building of human civilization and asserting its place among world nations, thus realizing its ambitions and will. Dr. 'Aziz added that the blockades imposed on Iraq and Libya show that the imperialist states do not want the Arab nation and the Arab people, whether in Libya or Iraq, to assert their Arab identity. They want to suppress the Arab nation's aspiration for unity and power, he said. Regarding the prospects for cultural cooperation between the two fraternal countries, Dr. 'Aziz said that cultural activity in Iraq is as good and distinctive as it is in the Libyan Jamahiriyah. Holding Libyan cultural functions in Iraq such as these, he added, will mark a new beginning, God willing, for further interaction in the cultural and media fields between the two fraternal countries.
