FBIS4-32051 "dreeu118_p_94004" FBIS-EEU-94-118 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 POLAND Poll on Election Preferences Reviewed Poll on Election Preferences Reviewed WS1706143994 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 17 Jun 94 pp 1-2 WS1706143994 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA Polish BFN [Article by R.W.] [Text] A week before the self-governmental elections, 60 percent of adult Poles intended to take part in the voting (35 percent of them knew this for certain). Over 40 percent still had no idea who they would support. The most numerous group of respondents intended to support nonpartisan candidates; as for political parties, the most popular was the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], followed by the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Union of Freedom [UW]. Almost every sixth respondent did not know the party to which "his" candidate belongs. The poll was carried out by the Sopot Public Opinion Research Institute [PBS] at the request of RZECZPOSPOLITA. Even though 60 percent of respondents declared that they are willing to go to the polls, the final voter turnout should be estimated at a considerably lower level. Opinion researchers have already often noticed that actual voter turnout is indeed closer to the number of people whose answer to the question concerning their intention of voting was "definitely yes." There are 35 percent of them, so we can expect a turnout of approximately 40 percent. These calculations are also confirmed by specialists from the Center for Research on Public Opinion [OBOP]; this center has obtained almost identical results as the Sopot institute. Among those who will go to the polls in the greatest numbers are people with higher educations (nearly 60 percent of them are absolutely sure they will vote), the richest people, people employed in the budget sector, white-collar workers of higher and medium levels, and parliamentary voters of most of the well-known parties. This particularly concerns the former "Fatherland" coalition, of which the Christian-National Union is the main component, as well as the Union for Real Politics, the former Democratic Union, and the Polish Peasant Party-Peasant Accord. More than 50 percent of representatives from these groups say that they will certainly go to the polls. The greatest reservations can be observed among poorly educated respondents, rather poor people, manual workers, especially unskilled workers, and housewives. People who declare the desire to vote very frequently do not yet know which name they will choose on 19 June. Total lack of knowledge is declared by 44 percent of respondents in this group; 22 percent have their favorites but are still hesitant. Only every third respondent knows for certain who he will support. Most disorientated are young people, with vocational education, with low incomes, the unemployed, school and university students, and those who supported the former Liberal-Democratic Congress and the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR] in the parliamentary elections. The least doubts are expressed by respondents between the ages of 40 and 59, with higher education, well-off individuals, and peasants and representatives of the managerial cadre. Every fifth respondent (20 percent) says that the candidate he is going to support does not belong to any party; every sixth (17 percent) person is not able to identify himself with any particular grouping. The rest are going to support a candidate fielded by one of the political organizations. Most frequently mentioned are the SLD, the PSL, and the UW (which received much lower preference ratings than during the parliamentary elections). Between 1 and 2 percent of respondents are going to vote for each center-right party. * * * A PBS poll for RZECZPOSPOLITA, conducted on 11 and 12 June; a 1,043-person representative sample of adult inhabitants of Poland. The OBOP poll, conducted between 20 and 25 May, consisted of 1,079 interviews conducted with a random sample of adult inhabitants of Poland. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Are you going to vote in the self-governmental elections? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Definitely not |18 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Probably not |16 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Probably yes |25 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Definitely yes |35 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hard to tell |6 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Which political grouping does the person you are going to support in the sel-| |f-governmental elections represent? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |20 percent |Nonpartisan | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |16 percent |SLD | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |14 percent |PSL | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |9 percent |UW | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |5 percent |Union of Labor | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |3 percent |Independent Self-Governing Trade Unio-| | |n "Solidarity" | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |3 percent |BBWR | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Note: Table includes only those parties that were most frequently mentioned | |by respondents. | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
