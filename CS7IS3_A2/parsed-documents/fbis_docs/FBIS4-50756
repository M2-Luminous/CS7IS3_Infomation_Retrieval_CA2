The official said Thursday [19 May] that Beijing turned out 9.2 billion yuan (about 1.1 billion U.S. dollars) in electronics products in 1993, which resulted in 1.8 billion yuan (200 million U.S. dollars) in profits. The electronics industry was tabbed as one of the three pillar industries in Beijing in 1988. Since then, the municipality has reorganized more than 10 loss-making electronics enterprises to make the best use of resources and developed such advanced products as telephone switchboards, color tv tubes, color television, microcomputers and video cassette recorders. As a result, the city has established itself in the development of telecommunications, broadcasting and television, computers, electronic circuits and electronic instruments. It has also become China's largest producer of telephone switchboards and microcomputers. Foreign investment has played an important role in this development. Now some 100 foreign-funded electronics joint ventures are located in Beijing, bringing in a total investment of 65 million U.S. dollars last year alone. Beijing Matsushita Color CRT [Cathode-Ray Tube] Co. Ltd., one such joint venture, has entered China's 10 best foreign-funded enterprise list by producing 1.56 billion yuan in output value. A Sino-German joint venture also established itself as the largest producer in telephone switchboards in the electronics industry. Besides the foreign-funded enterprises, a number of computer giants like "Stone," "Jinghai," and "Kehai" are engaged in the production of computers, softwares, printers, Xerox machines, and fax machines. Board card sales by the "Legend Group," another blue chip computer company, make up 10 percent of the international market. The Chinese version of "Express Publisher" by the Beijing University Founder Group Corporation is hailed as one of the top publishing software programs in the world. Currently, the software covers 60 percent of China's domestic market and has also sold well in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan.
