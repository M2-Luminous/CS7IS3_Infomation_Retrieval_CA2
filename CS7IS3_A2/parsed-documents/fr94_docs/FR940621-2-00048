FR940621-2-00048 FR940621-2-00038 Health Resources and Services Administration National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program; List of Petitions Received AGENCY: Public Health Service, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Public Health Service (PHS) is publishing this notice of petitions received under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (``the Program''), as required by section 2112(b)(2) of the PHS Act, as amended. While the Secretary of Health and Human Services is named as the respondent in all proceedings brought by the filing of petitions for compensation under the Program, the United States Court of Federal Claims is charged by statute with responsibility for considering and acting upon the petitions. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For information about requirements for filing petitions, and the Program generally, contact the Clerk, United States Court of Federal Claims, 717 Madison Place NW., Washington, DC 20005, (202) 219&hyph;9657. For information on the Public Health Service's role in the Program, contact the Administrator, Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, 5600 Fishers Lane, room 8A35, Rockville, MD 20857, (301) 443&hyph;6593. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Program provides a system of no-fault compensation for certain individuals who have been injured by specified childhood vaccines. Subtitle 2 of title XXI of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 300aa&hyph;10 et seq. , provides that those seeking compensation are to file a petition with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and to serve a copy of the petition on the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who is named as the respondent in each proceeding. The Secretary has delegated his responsibility under the Program to PHS. The Court is directed by statute to appoint special masters who take evidence, conduct hearings as appropriate, and make initial decisions as to eligibility for, and amount of, compensation. A petition may be filed with respect to injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths resulting from vaccines described in the Vaccine Injury Table set forth at section 2114 of the PHS Act. This Table lists for each covered childhold vaccine the conditions which will lead to compensation and, for each condition, the time period for occurrence of the first symptom or manifestation of onset or of significant aggravation after vaccine administration. Compensation may also be awarded for conditions not listed in the Table and for conditions that are manifested after the time periods specified in the Table, but only if the petitioner shows that the condition was caused by one of the listed vaccines. Section 2112(b)(2) of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 300aa&hyph;12(b)(2), requires that the Secretary publish in the Federal Register a notice of each petition filed. Set forth below is a partial list of petitions received by PHS on October 1, 1990 through January 29, 1991. Section 2112(b)(2) also provides that the special master ``shall afford all interested persons an opportunity to submit relevant, written information'' relating to the following: 1. The existence of evidence ``that there is not a preponderance of the evidence that the illness, disability, injury, condition, or death described in the petition is due to factors unrelated to the administration of the vaccine described in the petition,'' and 2. Any allegation in a petition that the petitioner either: (a) ``Sustained, or had significantly aggravated, any illness, disability, injury, or condition not set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table (see section 2114 of the PHS Act) but which was caused by'' one of the vaccines referred to in the Table, or (b) ``Sustained, or had significantly aggravated, any illness, disability, injury, or condition set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table the first symptom or manifestation of the onset or significant aggravation of which did not occur within the time period set forth in the Table but which was caused by a vaccine'' referred to in the Table. This notice will also serve as the special master's invitation to all interested persons to submit written information relevant to the issues described above in the case of the petitions listed below. Any person choosing to do so should file an original and three (3) copies of the information with the Clerk of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims at the address listed above (under the heading For Further Information Contact), with a copy to PHS addressed to Director, Bureau of Health Professions, 5600 Fishers Lane, room 8&hyph;05, Rockville, MD 20857. The Court's caption (Petitioner's Name v. Secretary of Health and Human Services) and the docket number assigned to the petition should be used as the caption for the written subission. Chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, related to paperwork reduction, does not apply to information required for purposes of carrying out the Program.
