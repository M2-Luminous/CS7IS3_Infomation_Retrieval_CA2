Hospital sources in Ba'labakk said that the number of martyrs is likely to increase because of the presence of serious injuries among the wounded. In a statement on the brutal raid, Lebanese security sources said that at least three Israeli helicopters took part in this raid, using machine guns and rockets, and that other planes were flying at high altitudes to protect them. Reports say that Lebanese Army ground defenses confronted the raiding planes and prevented them from staging any landing. MENA said that a six-plane squadron was supporting the Israeli helicopters and dropped heat balloons in a precautionary measure to avoid the Lebanese army's ground defenses. [passage omitted]
