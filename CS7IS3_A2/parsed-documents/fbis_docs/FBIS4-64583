[Bossi] Of course I am insisting, and I have two candidates: Roberto Maroni and...Maroni Roberto. If we want to remain friends, they had better choose the former. [Caprettini] However, there is talk of a [President] Scalfaro veto on the subject.... [Bossi] Not that I am aware of. In any case, according to the Constitution -- and I have been doing some homework on the Constitution -- all the head of state can do is countersign the list. Moreover...that is not how things stand. [Caprettini] Well, tell us how they do stand, then. [Bossi] I asked for an explanation last week. I asked if there were problems regarding the Viminale.... [Caprettini] You asked Scalfaro? (Bossi nods). And what was his reply? [Bossi] He said no, there were no objections. Therefore.... [Caprettini] Therefore it is up to Berlusconi to decide.... [Bossi] It is up to us in the first instance. [Caprettini] Regardless of the claim to the Viminale, there is the Treasury issue. Do you not want Dini? [Bossi] Dini...the problem is different! Dini is all right at the Treasury, but we must have the former state holdings. We, and not those ministers who have always shored up Mediobanca must run the privatization program! [Caprettini] You have your sights set on Interior and the Budget -- which is to handle privatization. Any other targets? [Bossi] We have always said that we want to have direct control over the changeover process. Interior, Budget, and Industry too serve this purpose. Do they really want a change? Then let them prove it, otherwise there is.... external support. However, I do not believe that they are not paying attention to us. They need legitimation in Europe, and we have the means to bestow it, to safeguard other countries from the risks represented by Berlusconi and that nonexistent party called Forza Italia, in which there has never been an election, not even once.... [Caprettini] But was it not the MSI [Italian Social Movement] that constituted the danger? [Bossi] The danger is the delay that there has been in political change, which has fostered Forza Italia's success: the delays in National Alliance [AN], which has problems with its flag; the delays in a left wing that is sluggish in its adoption of laborism; the delays, too, in a League that is split over federalism. People wanted stability, governability...and these delays worked in favor of Forza Italia, which has filled a void. The only thing is that, at this point, we must go all out for change, because the risk is one of a return to the past. We have change on one side and restoration on the other. At the end of the day, whoever manages to occupy the center in the pole for freedom, forcing AN to state clearly where it stands and the Left to free itself of the past, will emerge as the winner. It will be a hard-fought battle, and it will last at least a year, but the League will come out on top in the end, not the least because I have an ace up my sleeve. [Caprettini] It would appear that you see Mediobanca in particular as a feature of the old system. Why? [Bossi] We have always called for a law providing for the creation of public companies. We have had enough of [Mediobanca President] Cuccia, who makes and breaks all the deals with the big families! [Caprettini] And what do you think of Previti as a potential minister of justice? Would this be change or restoration? [Bossi] Previti? Yes, he will do. There are those who want a republic ruled by judges, like in ancient Israel, but I am like Samson, and I will not have my hair cut, okay? [Caprettini] Do you catch a whiff of burning in the examining magistrates' moves? [Bossi] They must carry on doing their part, but I am afraid that there is a very political, politicized part. In Milan they are putting us in the dock as if the Bribery City affair were our fault...ours! The force that created the prerequisites for the "Clean Hands" pool! And they try to use an allegation that Sama makes just at the right time to delegitimize us before the polls.... There are allegations emerging at intervals here, clockwork justice that leaves us very puzzled. [Caprettini] Look here, Bossi, one of the objections voiced against the League's claim to the Viminale is that you would then spy on your friends and opponents.... [Bossi] Rubbish! I am not a man who cultivates suspicions. Just ask my wife...women know everything. [Caprettini] You will be having a meeting with Berlusconi in a few hours. However, the two of you do not see much of each other. Funny, is it not, for two allies? [Bossi] Not at all! We see little of each other...as two great friends do. That is all there is to it.
