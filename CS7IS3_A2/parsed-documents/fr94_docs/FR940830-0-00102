FR940830-0-00102 FR940830-0-00013 (e) Contents of Annual Submission. The Annual Statement for each year must include, for each development or on a PHA-wide basis for management improvements or certain physical improvements for which work is to be funded out of that year's grant: (1) A list of development accounts with an identification of major work categories; (2) The cost for each major work category, as well as a summary of cost by development account; * * * * * (4) For each development and for any management improvements not covered by a HUD-approved MOA or management improvement plan, a schedule for the use of current year funds, including target dates for the obligation and expenditure of the funds. In general, HUD expects that a PHA will obligate its current year's allocation of CGP funds (except for its funded replacement reserves) within two years, and expend such funds within three years, of the date of HUD approval, unless longer time-frames are approved by HUD due to the size of the grant, the complexity of the work, and other factors; * * * * * (8) A PHA resolution approving the Annual Submission or any amendments thereto, as set forth in §968.320(d)(7). (f) Additional submissions with Annual Submission. A PHA shall submit with the Annual Submission any amendments to the Comprehensive Plan, as set forth in §968.320(e), and such additional information as may be prescribed by HUD. HUD shall review any proposed amendments to the Comprehensive Plan in accordance with review standards under §968.325(b). (g) HUD review and approval of Annual Submission. (1) General. An Annual Submission accepted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section shall be considered to be approved, unless HUD notifies the PHA in writing, postmarked within 75 calendar days of the date that HUD receives the Annual Submission for review under paragraph (c) of this section, that HUD has disapproved the Annual Submission, indicating the reasons for disapproval, the modifications required to make the Annual Submission approvable, and the date by which such modifications must be received by HUD. HUD may request additional information (e.g., for eligibility determinations) to facilitate review and approval of the Annual Submission during the 75-day review period. HUD shall not disapprove an Annual Submission on the basis that the Department cannot complete its review under this section within the 75-day deadline; (2) Bases for disapproval for Annual Submission. HUD shall approve the Annual Submission, except where: (i) Plainly inconsistent with Comprehensive Plan. HUD determines that the activities and expenditures proposed in the Annual Submission are plainly inconsistent with the PHA's approved Comprehensive Plan; * * * * * (h) Amendments to Annual Statement. The PHA shall advise HUD of all changes to the PHA's approved Annual Statement in its Performance and Evaluation Report submitted under §968.305. The PHA shall submit to HUD for prior approval any additional work categories (except for emergency work) which are not within the PHA's approved Five-Year Action Plan. (i) Failure to obligate formula funds and extension of time for performance. _(1) Failure to obligate formula funds. If the PHA fails to obligate formula funds within the approved or extended time period, the PHA may be subject to an alternative management strategy which may involve third-party oversight or administration of the modernization function. HUD would only require such action after a corrective action order had been issued under §968.345 and the PHA failed to comply with the order. HUD could then require an alternative management strategy in a corrective action order. A PHA may appeal in writing the corrective action order requiring an alternative management strategy within 30 calendar days of that order. HUD Headquarters shall render a written decision on a PHA's appeal within 30 calendar days of the date of its receipt of the PHA's appeal. (2) Extension of time for performance. A PHA may extend the target dates for fund obligation and expenditure in the approved Annual Statement whenever any delay outside the PHA's control occurs, as specified by HUD, and the extension is made in a timely manner. Such revision is subject to HUD review under §968.345(a)(2) as to the PHA's continuing capacity. HUD shall not review as to a PHA's continuing capacity any revisions to a PHA's Comprehensive Plan and related statements where the basis for the revision is that HUD has not provided the amount of assistance set forth in the Annual Submission, or has not provided such assistance in a timely manner. (j) ACC Amendment. After HUD approval of each year's Annual Submission, HUD and the PHA shall enter into an ACC amendment to obtain modernization funds. The ACC amendment shall require low-income use of housing for not less than 20 years from the date of the ACC amendment (subject to sale of homeownership units in accordance with the terms of the ACC). (k) Declaration of trust. As HUD may require, the PHA shall execute and file for record a Declaration of Trust as provided under the ACC to protect the rights and interests of HUD throughout the 20-year period during which the PHA is obligated to operate its developments in accordance with the ACC, the Act, and HUD regulations and requirements. (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577&hyph;0157) 24. Section 968.335 is amended by revising paragraph (a) introductory text and paragraph (b), to read as follows: §968.335 Conduct of modernization activities. (a) Initiation of activities. After HUD has approved a Five-Year Action Plan and entered into an ACC amendment with the PHA, the PHA shall undertake in a timely, efficient and economical manner, the modernization activities and expenditures set forth in its approved Annual Statement or substitute work categories from within the approved Five-Year Action Plan, subject to the following requirements: * * * * * (b) Fund requisitions. To request modernization funds against the Annual Statement, the PHA shall comply with requirements prescribed by HUD. * * * * * 25. Section 968.340 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b)(2); by removing paragraph (b)(3); by redesignating paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(7) as paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(6), respectively; by revising the newly redesignated paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(6); and by adding the OMB control number to the end of the section, to read as follows: §968.340 PHA Performance and Evaluation Report. (a) Submission. For any FFY in which a PHA has received assistance under this subpart, the PHA shall submit a Performance and Evaluation Report, in a form and at a time to be prescribed by HUD, describing its use of assistance in accordance with the approved Annual Statement. The PHA shall make reasonable efforts to notify residents and officials of the appropriate governing body of the availability of the draft report, make copies available to residents in the development office, and provide residents with at least 30 calendar days in which to comment on the report.
