The two main aims of this are European integration and the legal protection of Hungarians living beyond the borders. Gyorgy Csoti stressed that there is no better security guarantee than economic interconnections; for this reason the ruling party urges cooperation between the regions. In this endeavor, there is agreement between the parliamentary parties. The politician does not consider it likely that the Hungarian-Romanian and Hungarian-Slovak treaties will be signed in the near future because the two neighboring countries are not willing to accept minority protection guarantees.
