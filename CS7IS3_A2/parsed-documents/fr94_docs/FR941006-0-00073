FR941006-0-00073 FR941006-0-00020 The Service identified recovery criteria required for the reclassification of Isotria medeoloides from endangered to threatened in the 1992 recovery plan. Reclassification would be pursued when a minimum of 25 percent of the known, viable sites (as of 1992) is permanently protected. A site is considered viable if it has a geometric mean (over 3 years) of 20 emergent stems, of which at least 25 percent are flowering stems. Though not discussed in the recovery plan, an alternative viability definition has since been developed for sites located in the southern part of the range. This definition was based upon information provided by botanists familiar with these small, yet persistent populations (B. Sanders, U.S. Forest Service, pers. comm. 1993). Viability for smaller populations may be considered for those sites where less than 20 stems have persistently emerged for over 15 years. A determination of viability based on a stem count of less than 20 stems would require a long-term commitment to monitoring a site. In addition to site viability and protection, reclassification necessitates that the protected, viable sites be distributed proportionally throughout the species' current range. Site protection should include a sufficient buffer zone around the populations to allow the potential for natural colonization of adjacent, unoccupied habitat. As defined in the 1992 recovery plan, protection can be accomplished through_(1) Ownership by a government agency or a private organization that considers maintenance of the I. medeoloides population to be a management objective for the site, or (2) a deeded easement or covenant that effectively commits present and future landowners to protecting the population and allowing the implementation of management activities when appropriate. This high level of landowner commitment to site protection may be critical if it is determined that the species needs management to counteract the loss of nearby unoccupied habitat. The need for habitat management would be reviewed on a site-by-site basis, and be dependent upon the completion of Task 2.1 of the 1992 recovery plan, which is to determine appropriate management strategies. Adequate protection for the purposes of reclassification has been achieved for approximately 50 percent of the viable New England center populations; 57 percent of viable populations in the Virginia center; and 100 percent of the viable populations in the Blue Ridge center. No populations in the outlying States are considered to be viable, though 4 of the 6 extant populations are protected. As a result of meeting the reclassification criteria outlined in the 1992 recovery plan, the Service published a proposed rule to reclassify Isotria medeoloides from endangered to threatened in the Federal Register on October 19, 1993 (FR 53904). The ultimate goal of the 1992 recovery plan is to ensure long-term viability of Isotria medeoloides, facilitating the removal of the species from the Federal list. This objective would be reached when a minimum of 61 sites (75 percent of the number of viable sites known in 1992) are permanently protected. As in the reclassification criteria, the distribution of these sites must be proportionate among the three geographic centers and the outliers. Viable sites for delisting the species are those sites with self-sustaining populations having an average of 20 emergent stems (over a 10-year period), of which an average of 25 percent are flowering stems. The extended period of monitoring time is required to ensure long-term viability, and should factor in the potential for naturally induced dormancy of individual plants. An alternative definition for viability of smaller populations in the southern portion of the small whorled pogonia's range may be considered and substantiated through the recovery process for sites where less than 20 stems, of which an average of 25 percent are flowering, have persistently emerged for over 15 years. Ideally, unoccupied habitat adjacent to existing colonies must also be protected to allow for natural colonization and maintenance of a self-sustaining population. In some cases, only the immediate area encompassing Isotria medeoloides populations has been protected, while surrounding habitat has been destroyed. For these sites, management strategies to maintain self-sustaining populations may need to replace the historical availability of additional habitat. The management strategies would be dependent upon completion of Tasks 2.1 and 5.2 of the 1992 recovery plan. Summary of Comments and Recommendations In the October 19, 1993 proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspaper notices that invited general public comment were published in_ The Kennebec Journal (Maine), The Portsmouth Daily Times (Ohio), and The New Jersey Herald (New Jersey) on November 3, 1993; The Richmond Times-Dispatch (Virginia), The State Journal-Register (Illinois) and The State (South Carolina) on November 4, 1993; The Portland Newspaper (Maine) and The Atlanta Journal (Georgia) on November 5, 1993; The Herald-Palladium (Michigan) and The Chattanooga News-Free Press (Tennessee) on November 8, 1993; The New Journal (Delaware) and The Wilmington News-Journal (Delaware) on November 9, 1993; and The Asheville Citizen-Times (North Carolina) on November 10, 1993. Eleven letters were received, nine supported the ruling, one was in opposition and one did not support or oppose the reclassification of I. medeoloides, but did provide comments. Comments questioning the soundness of reclassification are discussed below.
