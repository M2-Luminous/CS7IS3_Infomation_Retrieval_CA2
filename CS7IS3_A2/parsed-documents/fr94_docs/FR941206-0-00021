SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Statement Section 2 of DIDRA, 12 U.S.C. 3352, authorizes the agencies to make exceptions to statutory and regulatory appraisal requirements for transactions with respect to real property located in areas in which the President has determined, pursuant to section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5170, that a major disaster exists, provided that the exception would facilitate recovery from the major disaster and is consistent with safety and soundness. 1 Such exceptions expire not later than three years after the date of the President's determination that a major disaster exists in the area. 1 The agencies must make the exception no later than 30 months after the date on which the President determines that a major disaster exists in the area. Since October 18, 1994, and continuing, the President has declared several areas as Major Disaster Areas in certain Texas counties because of the extensive flooding that occurred and is continuing. The agencies believe that granting relief from the appraisal requirements for certain real estate transactions in all such areas affected by this flooding is consistent with the provisions of the DIDRA. The agencies have determined that the disruption of real estate markets in all such affected areas interferes with the ability of depository institutions to obtain appraisals that comply with statutory and regulatory requirements and, therefore, may impede institutions in making loans and engaging in other transactions that would aid in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the affected area. Accordingly, the agencies have determined that recovery from this major disaster would be facilitated by excepting transactions involving real estate located in the area directly affected by the flooding from the real estate appraisal requirements of Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) as amended, 12 U.S.C. 3331 et seq., and regulations promulgated thereto. This has the effect of excepting certain transactions from the definition of ``federally related transactions.'' The agencies have also determined that safety and soundness would not be adversely affected by such exceptions so long as the depository institution's records relating to any such excepted transaction clearly indicate either that the property involved was directly affected by the major disaster or that the transaction would facilitate recovery from the disaster and there is a binding commitment to fund the transaction within three years after the date the major disaster was declared. In addition, the transaction must continue to be subject to review by management and by the agencies in the course of examination of the institution under normal supervisory standards relating to safety and soundness, though the transactions need not comply with the specific requirements of Title XI of FIRREA and the agencies' appraisal regulations. Expiration Dates Any exceptions provided under the order shall expire not later than three years after the date on which the President determines, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 5170, that a major disaster exists in the area. Accordingly, exceptions for the major disasters declared due to the flooding expire on October 18, 1997. Exceptions for any other counties that have been declared major disasters by the President as a result of the flooding that began in Texas on or about October 11, 1994, expire three years after the date of such declaration. Order In accordance with section 2 of DIDRA, relief is hereby granted from the provisions of Title XI of FIRREA and the agencies' appraisal regulations for any real estate-related financial transaction that requires the services of an appraiser under those provisions, provided that: (1) The transaction involves real estate located in an area that the President has determined, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 5170, is a major disaster area as a result of the October 1994 flooding in Texas, and has been designated eligible for Federal assistance by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); 2 2 The Texas counties affected are listed in the appendix to this order. The exception would also include any other such areas that the President subsequently declares are major disaster areas as a result of the flooding.
