The Labor and Personnel Ministries have offered the following explanation regarding these "Provisions": The provisions give workers and staff members more time to study, educate their children, and attend to household chores. They will surely further arouse the initiative of workers and staff members in socialist construction, preserve and inspire their enthusiasm for production, and increase their vitality in production and construction. These provisions appropriately shorten the work hours, scientifically and rationally schedule work and rest hours, and carry great significance for protecting the health of workers and staff members; for improving work efficiency and labor productivity; for promoting better management in organizations, enterprises, and institutions; and for advancing the development of production. There will be a unified system of work hours throughout the country. The State Council "Provisions" apply to workers and staff members in all organs, mass organizations, enterprises, institutions, and other organizations in the PRC. Enterprises include those under various single-mode or mixed economic ownerships, such as state-owned, collectively owned, privately run, individually run, and foreign-funded enterprises. They also include mines; factories; and construction, communications and transportation, logging, farming, commercial, and service entities. Our country used to implement special provisions regarding the work hours of workers and staff members working under extraordinary conditions and those whose circumstances were special. For instance, the chemical industry implemented a system consisting of "three work days and one day off," as well as a system of six or seven work hours, for workers engaged in operations involving toxic and harmful substances, based on the distinctive aspects and conditions of production. Coal mines implemented a four-shift system, consisting of six work hours per shift, for operations in coal pits. The textile industry implemented a system of "four shifts with three workers working and one resting on each shift." Female workers and staff members who had babies under one year old were given an hour for nursing each work day. If the work hours of workers and staff members working under extraordinary conditions or those whose circumstances are special still need to be shortened appropriately following the implementation of these provisions, they should be handled according to relevant state provisions. The work and rest hours of state organs and institutions must be unified. Beginning the day the "Provisions" are implemented, rest days will fall on Saturday and Sunday in the first week and on Sunday in the second week, with the cycle continuing regardless of which month or year it is. This will facilitate the normal operation of all endeavors in all sectors of society. In light of their actual conditions, enterprises may make provisions in accordance with the requirement for an average 44-hour work week consisting of eight hours each day. State organs aside, hospitals, kindergartens, primary schools, and units having a bearing on people's livelihoods must also unify their work and rest hours. Therefore, we will unify the work and rest hours of both institutions and state organs. Although workers and staff members in the civil aviation and railway sectors may work for more than eight hours each day, their average work week will not exceed 44 hours. In implementing the "Provisions," all units should strengthen management, strictly enforce discipline, and strive to tap their potential to ensure the completion of their production tasks and work without increasing personnel and spending. They should not let the implementation of the 44-hour work week affect their normal operations and economic performance; nor should they reduce the salaries of their workers and staff members. No enterprise or individual may extend the work hours of their workers and staff members without authorization. We should remedy the practice of fulfilling production tasks through overtime. If special circumstances and urgent tasks require the extension of work hours for workers and staff members, we should follow relevant state provisions. All social service units -- such as commercial, catering, public transportation, postal and telecommunications, and transportation units -- must consider people's interests in rescheduling production and work hours. They should take effective measures to solve problems arising from such rescheduling, and create more convenient living and working conditions for people. Labor and personnel departments all levels should supervise and inspect progress in implementing the "Provisions." If the "Provisions" are violated, they should mete out punishment in accordance with relevant provisions.
