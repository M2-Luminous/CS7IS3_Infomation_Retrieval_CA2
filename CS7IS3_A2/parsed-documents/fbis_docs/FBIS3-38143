Yesterday the police had to discontinue the search for the wreck of a crashed Cessna aircraft because of a storm. Josef R. (54) and Klaus E. (54), nuclear dealers from Berlin, were on board the aircraft. In October they bought 70 kg of cesium from the Russian mafia in Riga. They agreed on a price of 2 million German marks. Since they did not pay, the mafia took Josef R. hostage. The German Embassy in Moscow asked the Russian police for help. After 26 days, Josef R. was freed from prison. Shortly afterward, the nuclear smugglers took the cesium to Prague. According to police investigations, Klaus Peter N. (48) from Berlin, former lieutenant colonel of the GDR criminal investigation department and Mielke's confidant, organized the deal. Since Monday night he has been detained and he is being interrogated. On Monday, Pilot Rudolf W. (44) from Cologne flew from Hannover to Prague. There the two nuclear smugglers from Berlin went on board with two young Czech women. They headed for the West. According to the tower of Friedrichshafen Airport, the radio contact broke off at 1912. A little later, the Cessna presumably crashed into Lake Constance. Marlis R. (39), the pilot's companion in life, said: "The flight was first bound for Switzerland and then for Paris. The two businessmen had a date there -- in a laboratory, as my boy-friend said." Question: Did the smugglers want to have the cesium examined there by an expert? Were the customers waiting there? The causes of the crash are still unclear. However, the police think that an act of revenge by the Russian mafia is possible. It had threatened the Berliners: "You will not live long." The search for the wreck with the radioactive cargo will be continued today.
