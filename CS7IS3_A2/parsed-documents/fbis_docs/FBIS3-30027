Diplomatic sources in Washington said that Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean Mission to the United Nations, and Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for Asian and Pacific affairs, met somewhere other than the UN headquarters. The sources said the two sides could not agree on an exchange of special envoys between South and North Korea and other problems, adding that they would meet again on Friday. It is highly likely that they will reach an agreement by Feb. 25 at the latest, given that the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] strongly urged North Korea to issue visas for IAEA inspectors and that Pyongyang told Washington it would allow inspections from March 1, according to the sources. The sources expected that North Korea would issue the visas as soon as an understanding was reached with the United States on the content of their written agreement. "I expect that the inspection team will enter North Korea on Feb. 28," one source said. Meanwhile, North Korea proposed to the United States at Wednesday's bilateral contact that it would allow nuclear inspections to ensure the continuity of nuclear safeguards from March 1 and that the two sides should agree on taking four simultaneous steps, a North Korean official in New York said. Shortly after Tuesday's contact with Washington, Han Song-yol, councilor at the North Korean Mission to the United Nations, told YONHAP in a telephone interview that the four simultaneous measures include joint announcement of the third round of high-level talks by Pyongyang and Washington. The other three are Washington's suspension of this year's "Team Spirit," the joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise, North Korea's positive consideration of working-level contacts with South Korea if the South makes such a proposal, and North Korea's acceptance of IAEA nuclear inspections, Han said. Han accompanied Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean Mission to the United Nations, at the contact with U.S. officials including Hubbard and C. Kenneth Quinones, North Korea desk officer at the State Department. U.S. officials have conditioned the third round of high-level talks on North Korea exchanging special envoys with the South, so the contact failed to reach agreement, according to Han. "There is no change in our position that South and North Korea should exchange special envoys. But we oppose the U.S. intention to make the issue a precondition for the third round of high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington," Han said. He added, "The U.S. side should be held responsible for the delay in issuing visas to the inspection team, because it is asking the unfair condition of an exchange of special envoys. But I think the nuclear inspections will progress well after all."
