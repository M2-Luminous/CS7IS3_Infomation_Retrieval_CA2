Mr. Qendro, who held the report on the trade union's activity during the 1992-1994 period, emphasized the significant role played by trade union in protecting rights and interests of the workers. President of Albania Sali Berisha, who hailed the congress, appreciated the trade union's great contribution in democracy's victory and its consolidation in Albania. President Berisha ranked three main directions in which the trade union's role has been especially important and the anticommunist spirit in destructing the dictatorship where its contribution has been theoretically and practically great. Its very creation as an opposition power revealed the hypocrisy of the former party in power which claimed to be an workers party. The second direction, President Berisha said, is the great trade union's role in protecting the rights of the workers. The first delegation I received when I was elected president, was a trade union one, who told me that we will no more be allies and that they would continue their fight to defend the workers's rights being an opposition to the government. The third direction, Mr. Berisha pointed out, was the confrontation of corruption. "It was you and your newspaper SINDIKALISTI," president addressed to participants, "who raised the voice against the corruption of the communists. Now you confront without compromise the any kind of corruption." Trade union representatives from 30 international trade unionist organizations centred in Brussels, representatives from Italy, Bulgaria, Turkey, Egypt, Greece, Albanian representatives from Kosova and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] took part in the first congress of the Albania's Trade Union. The congress will continue its settings on March 22 as well.
