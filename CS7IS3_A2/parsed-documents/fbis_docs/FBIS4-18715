Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel said today that Bonn was obliged to investigate whether material from German deliveries to Turkey was being used in Turkey's conflict with the Kurds. Vogel said the government is in possession of reports to this effect from Germans who were recently in Turkey. He admitted, however, that it would be difficult to prove whether the suspected items from stocks of the former GDR National People's Army in fact originated from German supplies, and not from sales by former Warsaw Pact states. The government spokesman at the same time confirmed that Bonn favors, in principle, the deportation of militant Kurds from Germany. It must, however, be guaranteed that the expellees are threatened neither with the death sentence nor with torture in Turkey. If a relevant agreement is signed with Turkey, the German Government has "not the slightest doubt" Ankara would adhere to it.
