According to Brigadier Miroslav Jezercic, the college commander, this generation includes 400 soldiers who have proven their abilities in the homeland war and will broaden their knowledge acquired in the war so as to discharge their future tasks with even more success. The college cadets were addressed by Army General Janko Bobetko, the-Croatian Army chief of staff. He first remarked that among those attending the college there were members of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council], which is now part of the Army of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation. Then he pointed out that the members of the Croatian Army had caused several incidents in small towns, which sometimes even the directly responsible commanding officers had tried to cover up. "Nothing will make the Croatian people as angry as impertinent and violent behavior by Croatian officers, because they do not expect it from them. Such actions will not get us very far. We should understand that many people have lost relatives and friends in the war, which is why they are sometimes depressed. However, the Croatian people have entrusted you with their sons, and you are responsible for them, and every wrong move that you make ruins the image of the Croatian Army. This is why discipline should constantly be increased and everything should be done to avoid such incidents," General Bobetko emphasized. Speaking about the present situation in Croatia, the chief of staff said that the war was not over yet. "There are several hundred thousand people who are still not in their homes, and they have been demanding increasingly often to return to their towns, so we will probably have to force the occupying forces out of Croatian territory. What we attack we absolutely must occupy, because there can be no more excuses. Therefore, learn as much as possible so that you can carry out all the tasks that you will be assigned," General Bobetko told the cadets at the officers school. "No one has the right to a position for which they are not qualified any longer, and there will be no more cheating as there was at the beginning of the war, when the Croatian Army consisted of volunteers. There will be no more leniency or arbitrariness. The enemy, with whom we will square our accounts, must know that the Croatian Army is capable of carrying out anything that it is asked to. We have a lot of work ahead of us," said General Bobetko at the end of his speech.
