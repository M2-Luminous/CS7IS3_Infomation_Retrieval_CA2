I. Serkov, N. A. Tseligorov, Rostov on Don; UDC 62-503.4] [Abstract] The criteria of multidimensional nonlinear pulsed automatic systems are obtained on the basis of w transforms which require a positive determination of the Hermitian conjugate matrix. These criteria are modified so that analysis of the absolute stability of the system is reduced to computer verification of the strict continuation of the real polynomial.
