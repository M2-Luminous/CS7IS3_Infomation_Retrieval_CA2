FR940511-0-00018 FR940511-0-00007 (B) City A pays 90 percent of the rebate amount ($407,189) to the United States within 60 days of January 1, 1999. (iii) Second computation date. (A) On the next required computation date, January 1, 2004, the future value of the payments and receipts is: ␣ 1Date 1Receipts (payments) 1FV (7.0000 percent) 1/1/99 $452,432 $638,200 n,s Rebate amount (1/01/04) 638,200 (B) As of this computation date, the future value of the payment treated as made on January 1, 1999, is $574,380, which equals at least 90 percent of the rebate amount as of this computation date ($638,200 × 0.9), and thus no additional rebate payment is due as of this date. (iv) Final computation date. (A) On January 1, 2009, City A redeems all the bonds, and thus this date is the final computation date. The future value of the receipts and payments as of this date is: ␣ 1Date 1Receipts (payments) 1FV (7.0000 percent) 1/1/04 $638,200 $900,244 1/1/09 (1,000) (1,000) n,s Rebate amount (1/01/09) 899,244 (B) As of this computation date, the future value of the payment made on January 1, 1999, is $810,220 and thus an additional rebate payment of $89,024 is due. This payment reflects the future value of the 10 percent unpaid portion, and thus would not be owed had the issuer paid the full rebate amount as of any prior computation date. Example 2. Calculation and payment of rebate for a variable yield issue . * * * (iii) *␣*␣* (D) If the yield during the second computation period were, instead, 7.0000 percent, the rebate amount computed as of July 1, 1999, would be $1,320,891. The future value of the payment made on July 1, 1999, would be $1,471,007, and, therefore, City B would have overpaid the rebate amount by $150,116. * * * * * Par. 3. Section 1.148&hyph;10(d) is amended by revising the ninth and tenth sentence of Example 1 as follows: §1.148&hyph;10 Anti-abuse rules and authority of Commissioner. * * * * * (d) *␣*␣* Example 1 . *␣*␣* The Bank note and the 1994 issue have different prepayment terms.

Section 1.149(e)&hyph;1 is amended by revising paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (e)(4) as follows: §1.149(e)&hyph;1 Information reporting requirement for tax-exempt bonds. * * * * * (e) *␣*␣* (3) *␣*␣* (i) Bond. The date of issue of a bond is determined under §1.150&hyph;1. * * * * * (4) Issue price. The term ``issue price'' has the same meaning given the term under §1.148&hyph;1(b). Cynthia E.
