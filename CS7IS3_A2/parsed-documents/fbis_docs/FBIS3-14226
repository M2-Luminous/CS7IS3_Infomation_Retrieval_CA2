This was learned by our correspondent Qobi Mandel, and he is on the phone with the initial details: The 20-year-old Syrian soldier, Jasim Khadir, was captured two days ago on the Israeli-Syrian border after he crossed the border fence. The soldier underwent commando training with al-Sa'iqah, a pro-Syrian organization. He told his interrogators that he decided to defect to Israel and ask for political asylum here because he was mistreated by his Syrian commander, a ranking Major. My commander deprived me of my military rights, he said today in the 'Akko Magistrates Court. The representative of the Minorities Squad of the Galilee District Police said at the court that the soldier's version still needs to be verified through the appropriate channels. Justice Faris Falah accepted the police request, and ordered that the Syrian soldier's remand to custody be extended by 15 days.
