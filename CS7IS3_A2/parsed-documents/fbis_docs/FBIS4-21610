A spokesman claiming to represent 16 scientists admitted this week the threat amounted to blackmail. "We want a settlement but negotiation has failed and we don't want to have to take this to the industrial court. Our disclosures will prove embarrassing for Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa], Denel (an off-shoot of Armscor) and the Nationalist government," he warned. The group has unreleased details about South Africa's past co-operation with Israel on missile technology. Some of this challenges claims by President F.W. de Klerk last year that he had come clean on the country's nuclear story. The 16 scientists are preparing an appeal to the industrial court in which they are demanding two years' salaries and benefits from Denel. They were retrenched with two months' notice from Advena, a Denel subsidiary, on April 15 last year. They claim they were promised another two year's work. The spokesman, who asked not to be named at present, said their firsthand information would identify sources of specialised equipment for nuclear bombs in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. He also claimed Israel supplied rock technology and details of a process which transformed a satellite launcher into a nuclear ballistic missile. And in a move which could realise the arms industry's greatest fear -- nuclear weapons scientists selling secrets to rogue nations or terrorists -- the spokesman said the group would construct bombs for anyone, if their salaries were guaranteed. When Mr. de Klerk announced the destruction of South Africa's nuclear capability a year ago, he was adamant that no foreign help was used in the weapons' programme. But he made no mention of missile delivery capability. Now the spokesman for the maverick scientists claims South Africa's defunct space programme was originally intended to use a clone of the Israeli Jericho II two-stage solid fuel missile to deliver nuclear weapons. Two all-terrain mobile launchers were built and tested at Armscor's proving group at Advena in 1988 and 1989. They were never used. The missile, last codenamed RSA3, was only fired in static tests. The spokesman said more than 200 South Africans visited Israel covertly and worked on the missile programme between 1989 and 1992. In a multi-million rand deal, Israel had sold South Africa a system of explosives that could stop the missile in mid-flight at a predetermined point, allowing it to fall on to a target city with an accuracy of less than one kilometre. In October 1989, publicly expressed concerns by U.S. officials, including President George Bush, about Israeli and South African collaboration on a medium-range nuclear missile were denied by both countries. The spokesman said that after the initial 18-kiloton (18,000 tons of TNT) "dirty" bombs were completed, development of more powerful nuclear weapons continued in secret at SADF (South African Defense Force] insistence until late 1989 when Mr. de Klerk ordered that the programme be stopped. These more powerful nuclear weapons included thermo-nuclear hydrogen bombs. "What is the deterrent value of a 20-kiloton bomb when your enemy is threatening you with a 100-kiloton bomb?" the scientist asked. The spokesman, who identified himself as a supporter of the right wing, said: "Some of us and many in the SADF [South African Defense Force] strongly believed that a couple of bombs should have been held back and kept in white hands." The spokesman said: "I am not ashamed of what we did, but I cannot get a job. We are treated like outcasts. We are South Africa's nuclear casualties." He had applied for 50 jobs and five of the rest of the group were unemployed. The international implications of the scientists' threats are severe. Revealing suppliers would tarnish South Africa's credibility in the secrecy-obsessed international arms market and cause controversy in the countries involved. The involvement of South African expertise in outlaw weapons programme would raise great international concern and possible conflict with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has overseen South Africa's nuclear rehabilitation. A Denel spokesman confirmed yesterday that 16 employees were contesting termination of their service. Negotiations had failed because of their "unfounded and unreasonable claims and expectations". Intimidation through the media left Denel disillussioned at the conduct of people "with high technology standing for whom Denel has only the highest regard and sympathy," the spokesman said.
