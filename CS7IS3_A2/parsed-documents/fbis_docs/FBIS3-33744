The most striking feature of the elections was the failure of the candidates to gain the votes needed to prevent the holding of a second round of voting, which will take place on 4 February in all the municipalities where candidates were unable to gain more than 50 percent of the votes cast. According to the official preliminary results, the Republican Democratic and Social Party and the Union of Democratic Forces [UFD] gained an equal number of votes, especially in the capital Nouakchott and the financial capital Noudibu. In Nouakchott, the party of Mauritanian President Maaouiya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya gained 44.77 percent of the votes cast, while its rival the UFD, which is the most important opposition grouping, gained 42 percent of the votes in the capital. The Union for Democracy and Progress obtained 15 percent of the votes cast in a total of 208 municipalities in Mauritania.
