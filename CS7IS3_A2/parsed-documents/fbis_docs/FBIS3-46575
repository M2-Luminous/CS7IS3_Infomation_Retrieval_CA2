One of the important problems in advocating and adhering to socialism of our own style from the antirevolutionary offensive of the imperialists and reactionaries is to awaken the party members and workers to class consciousness. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: At a time when the situation is very complicated, it is important to carry out class indoctrination well so that the party members and workers can be awakened to class consciousness. Awakening the party members and workers to class consciousness involves the enhancement of class consciousness to make them hate the exploitative system and exploitative class, resolutely struggle against the exploitative system and exploitative class, advocate and adhere to the gains of socialism, and struggle to the end to complete the socialist cause. The importance of awakening party members and workers to class consciousness as an important demand in advocating and adhering to socialism of our own style lies in making it possible to strengthen the main force of our revolution and enhancing its role. Strengthening the main force of the revolution and enhancing its role is a fundamental problem in the struggle to advocate and adhere to socialism of our own style. The main force of the revolution is directly in charge of the struggle to advocate and adhere to socialism and a powerful driving force in the socialist cause. It is important to awaken the party members and workers to class consciousness in strengthening the main force of the revolution and enhancing its role. To strengthen the main force of the revolution the popular masses must be firmly armed with the independent revolutionary ideology and the socialist and communist ideology, and firmly unite them through ideological will around the party and the leader. To achieve this, they must be awakened to class consciousness. The working class' class consciousness is the core in socialist ideology and the basis in socialist indoctrination is class indoctrination. Therefore, class indoctrination must be strengthened among the party members and workers so that when class consciousness is awakened they can all the more be firmly armed with the socialist and communist ideology and all the more firmly unite around the party and the leader to extraordinarily strengthen the main force of the revolution. The class consciousness of the party members and workers must be awakened so that their revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity can be enhanced to heighten the role of chuche. Class consciousness is a decisive element in regulating the people's role in carrying out the revolution and construction. Class consciousness also regulates the characteristics of class consciousness in the behavior of the people taking part in the revolutionary movement and on how much they are manifesting the strong will and struggle might. The role of the ideological will in the revolutionary movement is dependent on its characteristics and content. Only people who are armed with the ideology of advanced class and the revolutionary ideology of the working class can have a correct class position in the revolutionary struggle and construction work, and struggle to the end by overcoming all kinds of difficulties and trials. Therefore, when the class consciousness of the party members and workers is raised, they can demonstrate high revolutionary enthusiasm and positive creativity in the struggle to defend and maintain the socialist cause and victoriously advance it to significantly enhance the role of chuche. Another reason why awakening the party members and workers to class consciousness is an important requirement for defending and maintaining socialism of our own style is that it enables us to firmly adhere to revolutionary principles in carrying out the socialist cause. Adhering to revolutionary principles in carrying out the socialist cause is an important issue in defending and maintaining socialism. The revolutionary principle on defending and embodying the popular masses' demand of independence must be consistently maintained to defend and maintain the socialist cause and advance it. Only when the class consciousness of the party members and workers is raised, they will consider socialism to be their belief and persistently adhere to revolutionary principles in carrying out the socialist cause. Socialist, communist construction is being carried out amid a fierce class struggle. For the popular masses to defeat all obstructionist maneuvers by the imperialists and reactionaries and defend, maintain, and complete the socialist cause to the end, they must have a firm belief in socialism. People will believe in socialism only when their class consciousness is raised. Party members and workers will consider socialism to be their belief and constantly adhere to revolutionary principles in carrying out the socialist cause when we further strengthen indoctrination in class consciousness among the party members and workers and when, as a result, they have a full understanding of the reactionary nature of capitalism and imperialism and the inevitability of their ruin, the justness of the socialist cause, and the inevitability of the victory of socialism. Another reason why awakening the party members and workers to class consciousness is an important requirement for defending and maintaining socialism of our own style is that it enables us to thoroughly crush [chippusilssuikke] the antirevolutionary maneuvers of imperialists and class enemies. The struggle to carry out the socialist, communist cause entails a fierce class struggle against all sorts of class enemies. Those imperialists are continuously clinging to the policy of strength and threatening the socialist countries militarily. They are also perpetrating all sorts of cunning maneuvers to disintegrate socialist countries politically and economically, ideologically and culturally. Inspired by the imperialists, the remnants of the hostile classes of socialist society [sahoejuui sahoe naebue namainnun choktaegyegubui chanyobunjadul], are also maneuvering overtly and covertly [umuro yanguro chaektong] to overthrow the socialist system and revive a capitalist system. This is a fierce class struggle of who beats whom [igussun nuga nugurul hanun chiyolhan gyegup tujaeng imnida]. In this struggle, the people cannot defend and maintain socialism, a revolutionary achievement which was won with blood, without thoroughly crushing [chippusiji] the antisocialist maneuvers of imperialists and the remnants of the overthrown class of exploiters. Enhancing the awakening to class consciousness of the party members and working people is important to smashing the anti-socialist maneuvers of the imperialists and class enemies. It is necessary to strengthen class indoctrination of party members and working people to uncompromisingly wage a struggle to correctly differentiate friend from foe, endlessly hate the imperialists, landlords and capitalists, oppose the exploiting system and class enemies, and defend and adhere to the socialist system. Thinking that people would naturally possess socialist ideology if the socialist system was firmly established and people's material and cultural lifestyles were enhanced, the ruling parties in the former Soviet Union and eastern European countries did not work hard enough at the work to enhance people's awakening to class consciousness. As a result, individualism and egoism seriously developed among party members and working people, and anti-socialist ideology flooded in from outside bringing about ideological permutation. It was inevitable for these countries not to be able to overcome the antirevolutionary offensive of the imperialists and bourgeois welfarists and for socialism to be frustrated as the parties of these countries gave up the ideological indoctrination works of enhancing the awakening to class consciousness for their party members and working people. Socialism is a society where ideology is its life. Socialism wins if the party of the working class strengthens class indoctrination-based socialist ideological indoctrination work so that the popular masses are armed with socialist ideology and unite as one on that basis. Socialism collapses if the party gives up ideological indoctrination work and the popular masses become ideologically ill. Taking the enhancement of the awakening to class consciousness for party members and working people as one of the important problems related to socialism's destiny, our party has ceaselessly deepened the class indoctrination work for them. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forth a policy concerning the strengthening of class indoctrination early in the days of basic socialist construction and wisely led us to strengthen class indoctrination work for the party members and working people in conformity with the demands of revolutionary development. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il put forth the unique ideology to further strengthen the class indoctrination work in conformity with our revolutionary development's new, higher-stage demands of modelling the whole society after chuche idea, and wisely led us to carry it out in diverse forms and ways. Today in our country, single-hearted unity of the leader [suryong], the party, and the popular masses is strengthened as iron and the people's awakening to class consciousness is being heightened as the socialist ideological indoctrination work based on class indoctrination is being vigorously carried out among the party members and working people under the wise leadership of our party. Coping with imperialists and reactionaries' antisocialist and antirepublic maneuvers which is becoming more severe with each passing day, we should further strengthen our class position and better prepare the party members and working people for becoming resolute revolutionary fighters who defend, adhere to, and elucidate socialism of our style with their lives by ceaselessly deepening the ideological indoctrination work to awaken their class consciousness.
