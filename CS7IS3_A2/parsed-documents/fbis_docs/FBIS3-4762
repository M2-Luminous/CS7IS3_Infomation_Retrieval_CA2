The March 1st, 1919, popular uprising was an all-people resistance against Japan, in which the Korean people rose up and undauntedly fought to take back the country lost to the Japanese imperialist aggressors and restore national sovereignty. In his report at the meeting, Chong Tu-hwan, Presidium member of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, said the uprising dealt a heavy blow at the colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists and had a great inspiring impact on the national-liberation movement of the oppressed peoples in colonies. "It is 75 years since the participants in the uprising fought for independence, shedding their blood of patriotism, and it is nearly half a century since our country was liberated from the colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists, but their desire for independence and sovereignty of the country has yet to be realised nationwide," he said. He said in South Korea under the military occupation by the U.S. imperialists, the people's demand for independence, democratic rights and even their elementary right to existence are ruthlessly violated. "South Korea remains a forward base of nuclear war because the Kim Yong-sam `regime' sticks to the anti-national policy of dependence on outside forces," the reporter said, and added: "To establish national sovereignty in South Korea and reunify the country independently and peacefully is a noble cause of realising what the participants in the March 1st popular uprising desired and the supreme national task facing the entire Korean people." He called on the South Korean people to launch a courageous struggle to overthrow the puppet government, saying that with the "civilian"-veiled traitor Kim Yong-sam left alone, neither the independence and democratisation of South Korean society nor the independent and peaceful reunification of the country can be expected and nothing but the scourge of war will be inflicted on the Korean nation. He demanded that the United States renounce the policy of "strength" and approach DPRK-U.S. talks with a sincere attitude in the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement, if it really wants to find a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. He urged the Japanese reactionaries to discard the foolish dream of gaining something from their involvement in the anti-DPRK campaign of the United States and the South Korean puppets and make a sincere apology and adequate compensation to the Korean people for their past crimes. The meeting was attended by Yang Hyong-sop, alternate Politburo member of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly.
