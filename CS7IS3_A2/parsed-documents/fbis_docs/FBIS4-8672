Oleksy described the president's threat to dissolve parliament as "harmful" and added that this might cause an increase of tension in relations between the coalition and the president. Oleksy described the deputies' initiative to introduce amendments to the Small Constitution and to limit the president's competences as a normal legislative initiative to which you should not react by sulking but by having talks about it. "I invariably call on the president and the coalition to have talks," Oleksy said and stressed that as a result of divergencies between the government and the president the image of Poland on the international arena could be damaged.
