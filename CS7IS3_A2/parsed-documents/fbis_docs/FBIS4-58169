FBIS4-58169 "drnes084_s_94026" FBIS-NES-94-084 Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 SOUTH ASIA Iran Paper Calls For Resolution of Differences With Iraq Paper Calls For Resolution of Differences With Iraq LD3004100594 Tehran IRNA in English 0734 GMT 30 Apr 94 LD3004100594 Tehran IRNA English BFN [Text] Tehran, April 30, IRNA -- An English daily here Saturday commented on the desire that both Iran and Iraq have expressed in recent years to improve mutual ties and called on the two countries to iron out differences. The idea of "trust" as pointed out by Iraq's deputy foreign minister, who recently paid a visit to Iran, is a key word in the absence of which nothing can be accomplished between the two countries, wrote 'KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL' in its editorial. "In fact", the paper said, "since a year or two after the termination of active hostilities between the two countries, both Tehran and Baghdad have tried to bring about that needed atmosphere of trust so that as a next step dialogue can be established to resolve the many outstanding issues between them". If up to now there has been little or perhaps no advance in the resolution of issues it must be because there has been a pronounced failure in the efforts to establish that element of trust, the daily noted. The article then referred to the bomb explosion in Tehran on April 19 and said that the Iranian disciplinary forces have blamed, for the first time, Baghdad for having been behind the incident. "No country should support terrorist activities jeopardizing the lives of innocent people in other countries. That holds specially true about Baghdad in view of its ongoing economic and political isolation under the U.N. sanctions." The daily advised Baghdad to open a new chapter in its foreign relations with other countries based on understanding and trust to help alleviate the suffering of its people as a result of the past two wars. The element of trust is specially of great importance in Baghdad's relations with Iran in view of the nature and magnitude of the unresolved issues, the paper noted. The approval of bomb planting in a busy Tehran street goes directly counter to the spirit of desire for normalized ties with Tehran, the daily said adding that Baghdad has more enemies on its hands than it can handle and there is no reason why it should want to aggravate ties with Iran. The paper concluded by saying that Iran and Iraq have a lot in common and Tehran can become a helpful future friend for Iraq if differences are ironed out.
