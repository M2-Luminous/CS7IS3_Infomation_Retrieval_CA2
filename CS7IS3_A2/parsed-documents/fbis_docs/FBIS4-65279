Speaking at the opening, Vaclav Klaus, the head of the Czech Government, welcomed the increased presence of foreign banks in his country. The Prague branch, which is headed by Gerd-Dieter Griese and Jaroslav Kudena, is the first Deutsche Bank branch in one of the neighboring states in the east. "We not only want to give Czech companies access to the international capital market, but also assist them with local capital market transactions," said Kopper. The opening of the branch in Prague comes a few months after the opening of the Prague Stock Exchange. In view of the bank's long-term business strategy, the fact that these events are so close in time can only be a coincidence, but the Deutsche Bank's heightened presence comes "at the right time in light of the development of the capital market also." Over the past few years, foreign investors have made direct investments totaling 5 billion German marks in the Czech Republic, stressed Vaclav Klaus. Germany is among the largest investors. "This figure shows how companies and investors from all over the world view this country's prospects." The economic transformation process in the Czech Republic has followed a particularly straight course so far. It has only taken four years for a private sector to emerge which already accounts for a large part of GDP. Numerous plants have been privatized in the meantime, but what is even more impressive for foreign observers is the great number of new business that have been formed. Deutsche Bank, which has had a representation in Prague since 1990, wants to provide better support in the Czech Republic for investors from Germany and other countries. Finally, there is a growing demand for banking services from Czech companies, especially with respect to leading companies into the European single market. Deutsche Bank will make a resolute effort to ensure that "the EU's [European Union] markets will be opened up even more." If the states of Central Europe are rapidly drawn into the international division of labor, this will serve to bolster political stability on the continent. "We need an EU that is open to all Europeans."
