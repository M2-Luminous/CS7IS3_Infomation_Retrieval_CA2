Talking to journalists in Shchelkovo, a town near Moscow, on Thursday [6 January] Zhirinovskiy said, addressing Japanese reporters: "You'd better not raise the Kuril Islands issue, otherwise we'll bring up the issue of compensation for the 40 years of the illegal use of Sakhalin by Japan." "We'll drive everyone out of the Sea of Okhotsk -- the Japanese, the Koreans, the Filipinos... The Sea of Okhotsk will be a closed Russian sea. We'll establish a 200-mile zone, and you'll be fishing in Australia," Zhirinovskiy said to the Japanese journalists.
