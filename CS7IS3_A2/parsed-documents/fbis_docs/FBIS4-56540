The announcement was made by acting Finance Minister Luis Javier Grisanti who explained that the tax will be levied on all operations carried out by individuals or legal entities at the country's financial institutions. The banks will act as withholding agents and will notify the financial authorities of the total amount collected, one day following the collection date. According to the decree, the states, municipalities, Central Bank of Venezuela [BCV], investment funds, the National Savings and Loans Bank, the autonomous and academic institutions, and foundations are exempted from paying the tax since these organizations are considered state institutions. Exempt operations also include those related to BCV's legal reserve accounts, operations between PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum] and the BCV, and those related to financial intermediation in mortgage banks as well as savings and loans banks. Likewise, exemptions include all transfers related to a same account holder within the same bank institution, or between his deposit and his liquid asset funds. Diplomatic missions, consular and international organizations, and the personnel assigned to these offices are also exempt from paying the tax. [Begin Grisanti recording] Article 13 of the decree law establishes a very important guideline whereby in those cases of bank accounts opened for payroll purposes, employers will not be allowed to transfer to the workers amounts paid as a result of the tax. In other words, anytime the payroll account is debited by the total wages to be paid to the employees, it has been clearly determined that the employer will deduct the corresponding amount. Of course, debits caused by the account holder after having received payment will be taxed. [end recording] The acting finance minister stressed that because of the provisional nature of the tax, payment will not entail a decrease in the taxes to be paid the following year by taxpayers.
