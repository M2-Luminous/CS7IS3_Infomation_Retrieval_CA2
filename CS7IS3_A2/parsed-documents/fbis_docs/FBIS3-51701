The attack occurred shortly before 0900 [1200 GMT] on Manuel Canas Street in Vitacura, where U.S. citizen (David Soto Barcelo) has his residence. Soto had parked his car in front of his house. Two unknown persons threw a bomb under the car and escape on foot. Minutes later, the bomb went off, damaging the vehicle. Carabineros GOPE [Special Police Operations Group] personnel went to the scene and discovered that the bomb was a fragmentation grenade. David Soto, who declined to comment on the incident, is renting a building in Vitacura. The building is being remodeled for housing the LA Rock nightclub. One of the possibilities police are considering is that the attack might have something to do with intimidation because of Soto's commercial activities.
