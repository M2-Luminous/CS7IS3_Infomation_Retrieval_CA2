Former Shimizu Vice Chairman Hiroyuki Koyama gave the money to Otsuka in December 1990 after he persuaded a building lease company to drop its objection to the redevelopment of a 5.9-hectare area in Tokyo's Nagatacho District, the sources said. The lease company yielded to pressure from Otsuka, 64, whose Tokyo No. 1 constituency in the House of Representatives is home to the company, they said. Shimizu, which won a consulting contract with nine corporate land owners in the area, had to secure the consent of the building lease company, which owned land inside the area covered by the redevelopment project. The redevelopment project received official authorization from the Tokyo metropolitan government in April 1993. The project will be completed around 2000. After Otsuka managed to persuade the company to drop its objection, Koyama delivered the 3 million yen to Otsuka, the sources said. Koyama was indicted last October on charges of giving a 10 million yen bribe to former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi to secure public works contracts. Otsuka's political office declined to comment on the allegation. Otsuka, who served as construction minister from December 1990 to November 1991 in the Cabinet of then Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, lost his Diet seat in last July's general election. A Shimizu Corp. executive in charge of the project told KYODO NEWS SERVICE, "our company has not submitted any request to former Construction Minister Otsuka in connection with the project, although we have donated a small amount to him in the annual summer and year-end gift-giving seasons."
