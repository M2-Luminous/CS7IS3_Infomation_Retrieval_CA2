[Text] A report recently appeared in the press that it has been decided to base the nuclear missile power of the future Russia on missiles of the "modernized SS-25 type." The optimum nature of such an important decision was confirmed by the opinion of the editor's office of the newspaper that is most read by intellectuals, which considers the SS-25 to be "one of the most successful mobile ground missile systems," and also by statements from a top scientist, an acting member and a corresponding member of several academies. I admit that the decision to enter into polemics with respect to the correctness of such a choice did not come about immediately. Disturbing were the great authority of the indicated opponents, the author's lack of the corresponding scientific titles, and the difficulty that most readers would have in following the unavoidable factual details in the arguments. But should one remain silent if the consequences of this decision affect all of us in the most direct way? Especially since the references to authority are less convincing in comparison with the conclusions obtained below with the help of certain facts and laws. Is Rearmament Necessary at All? I remind you that in the event of the ratification of the treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation on the reduction of strategic offensive arms (START II) we will have to reduce the total number of nuclear warheads to 3,000-3,500, of which 1,700-1,750 nuclear warheads will have to be deployed on submarines and the rest on heavy bombers and single-warhead ground-based missiles. The traditional superiority of the United States in aviation and the navy will force Russia to do all it can to preserve the combat capability of ground-based missiles even to the point of arming them with the maximum allowed 1,300 nuclear warheads. At the present time, however, we do not have that many single-warhead missiles and will scarcely be able to produce them by 2003. Taking into account the approximately 300 mobile land-based single-warhead SS-25 missiles now in existence and 195 multiple-warhead SS-18's and SS-19's permitted for conversion, Russia will be forced to build approximately another 800 new missiles. Alternative decisions may be the following: Not to build any new land-based missiles but limit ourselves to the 500 that exist now and the same number of nuclear warheads on old bombers; begin to build new single-warhead missiles, not all 800 but half that many. My opponents favor precisely the latter version, proposing that 60-70 percent of the missiles be in the form of modernized mobile SS-25's and the rest in silos. The questions arise: Do we need the fortunately still unratified START II Treaty and in developing a new nuclear missile program should we proceed on the basis of its injunctions that are unacceptable for us? Who really needs SS-25 missiles that the media have praised? Can it really be that we cannot do without these "safe to operate" and "very economical" mobile complexes, which "do not burn in fire," "do not break apart on rocky ground," and "cannot be penetrated by various kinds of weapons"? And is not this campaign just the latest monstrous disinformation inflicted on the public? In response to these questions, we will point out still another alternative--to refuse to ratify START II until there has been a thorough investigation of all the peculiarities of the rearming that it imposes, a comprehensive evaluation of the real performance characteristics of the SS-25, and an elucidation of the possibility of its improvement through modernization. At the same time, it should be remembered that the only reliable means of deterring an aggressor in the next 10 years is our multiple-warhead missiles in silos rather than the aging submarines and strategic bombers. The SS-25's under review here are inferior to such missiles in every parameter without exception--safety in operation, economy, and survivability; we will become convinced of this in a systematic way. Are the SS-25's Really So Safe for Us? The most significant shortcoming of mobile land-based (ground and railroad) strategic missiles is the danger from the nuclear warheads that they have and from the extremely toxic and explosive missile fuel. The threat of the occurrence of accidents with catastrophic nuclear contamination of the terrain was the reason why every country except Russia renounced such missiles. For a fire is possible in a collision with an SS-25 and this is the most probable cause of the explosion of the conventional explosive material in the nuclear warhead and the dispersion of radioactive plutonium. A burning nuclear warhead of a land-based missile cannot be extinguished by on-board water, as at sea, and cannot be dropped, as from an airplane. And this will take place on well-traveled roads rather than in the "far seas" or "way up in the sky." It can also be asserted that fundamentally missiles of the SS-25 type cannot possess a high degree of safety while on the move. At least their safety is always less than that of naval and air delivery systems of nuclear warheads, not to mention stationary missiles in silos. Indeed, for the SS-25, it is significantly more difficult to preclude collisions with outside means of transport or the intentional or natural destruction of the road surface--at least because of the great accessibility of these missiles for outside persons in comparison with submarines on patrol and bombers. Just as obvious is the threat of other preconditions for accidents (driver error and breakdown of the vehicle) that do not exist in silo launch facilities where there are no people around. In this connection, the arguments for the safety of the present SS-25's linked with the mention of eight submarine disasters and the absence of such in the Strategic Missile Forces seem strange. The significantly larger number of submarines on patrol and the duration of these patrols is thereby ignored and no mention is made of the fact of serious accidents with the overturning of more than 10 missiles of the SS-25 type that took them out of action, fortunately without nuclear warheads burning or exploding. The quantitative assessments of the probability of accidents with SS-25's that the opponents have presented are quite erroneous: They have been underestimated by a factor of more than 10 in terms of one system per year and by a factor of 40 for the entire grouping of 500 missiles. It is likewise impossible to agree with the assertions about the so-called safety of solid-fuel SS-25's and SS-24's. Why, then, is it recommended to personnel that they quickly abandon them in the event of a fire and move away to a distance of 2.5 km? Nor have people forgotten the explosion of the solid-fuel boosters of the American "Challenger" with the loss of seven astronauts and the tragedy in 1988 at the SS-24 assembly plant, which had to stop its work for a long time. The most frightening thing, however, as specialists at Arzamas-16 have shown, is the spontaneous start-up of the engines of the solid-fuel SS-25, for it is impossible to stop or knock down this monster flying over the earth. And it can fly to Moscow from that same Teykovo Kostromskaya Oblast. Basically this could not happen with liquid-fuel missiles. About the Economy of Operation of the SS-25 Another argument in favor of the optimum nature of the building of new mobile missiles of the SS-25 type, in the opinion of their supporters, is their high degree of economy compared with the cost of stationary missiles. Such an assertion is fair, but only in part. It is not difficult to be convinced of this by examining in turn the expenditures necessary for the building and operation of different types of missiles and comparing them. Yes, the deployment of SS-25's in the position areas of the silo missiles SS-17 and SS-18 to be destroyed will provide for a certain saving of funds: There are roads, towns, engineering structures, and communications. Instead of expensive silos, it will be necessary to build only ground garages with movable roofs for the launch of the missiles in the event of an extreme emergency. But is such an economy necessary if the volume of the previous network of roads is inadequate for the dispersion of SS-25's at safe distances and if you cannot move very fast on dirt roads? In such a case, all of the SS-25's will be the easy prey of naval "Tridents" even with less accurate and powerful nuclear warheads. And the assertions of the low operating cost of single-warhead ground-mobile missiles do not stand up to any sort of criticism. Taking into account the depreciation costs of the vehicle chassis, the network of roads, and the engineering structures as well as the expenditures for fuel and lubricants and the development and guarding of the patrol routes, the loses from disruptions in the transport of freight needed in the national economy, and the results of possible disasters, the operation of the SS-25 will be just as devastating as the use of strategic bombers and nuclear submarines. A special category of expenditures has to do with need for a large number of operating personnel, which one must not fail to consider with the growing shortage of service members. Where can Russia obtain additional tens of thousands of people and what will they cost? Nor should there be any illusions with respect to the low cost of converting SS-25 launch silos. For the reconstruction of a huge silo to suit a small missile will be just as costly as the construction of a new one. This will require work to uncover and revise numerous communication lines, the replacement of obsolete equipment, and the use of colossal amounts of concrete and the best kinds of cement and metal. And it is all senseless, because it will not give the silo the required survivability: The smaller the silo is, the more resistant it is to external influences. Are SS-25's Dangerous for the Enemy? Is it possible that the shortcomings noted above are more than compensated by the potential merits of the SS-25--its high degree of protection against any counteraction by the enemy and timely maneuvering? Indeed, in principle the mobile means of basing strategic missiles guarantees their invulnerability but under these conditions: If they are small in size, protected against outside influences, placed in containers camouflaged as normal freight, dispersed throughout Russia, and constantly or periodically change their location randomly. Precisely this was the original intention of the creators of the SS-25 and it is precisely this desirable feature that its advocates are striving to present as reality. As a matter of fact, they were not successful in keeping it small and the camouflaging and continuous patrolling is impossible in principle and forbidden by the START I treaty that we have already ratified. Also, it is doubtful whether one can speak of random changes in the location of these missiles. The cross-sectional stability is quite unsatisfactory, the extremely high axial loads have rigidly restricted them to a limited number of roads for dispersal, and the great weight of the missiles along with the small power of the traction engine prevented flexible maneuvering through speed. We note that everything enumerated above is also fair for the railroad SS-24's that again exist only in Russia. Hence it follows that with the knowledge of the permanent deployment sites (provided by START I), the unique unmasking features of ground-mobile missiles (this same treaty prohibits changes in form), and the existing means of space reconnaissance, the enemy has no problem in determining the present location of our ground-mobile missiles and in forecasting their coordinates in the next 15 minutes. Under these conditions, the SS-25's and SS-24's are more vulnerable than stationary missiles in silos and even bombers and submarines in ports. Indeed, the enormous size of the transport-launch container with the missile (the area of the external surfaces is more than 120 square meters) did not permit their being made of metal, which would require an additional increase in weight of hundreds of tonnes and would definitively deprive these missiles of mobility. In turn, the large lateral "sails" estimated at an area of 100 square meters or more as well as the inadmissibly narrow width of the track greatly facilitated the overturning of our ground-mobile missiles through excessive aerodynamic pressure. All of this made it much easier for them to be disabled through a powerful electromagnetic pulse, all sorts of firearms, and even simple overturning. But it is easiest of all to achieve the destruction of the patrolling ground-mobile missiles with the help of sabotage. For this it is sufficient to have several specially trained "switchmen" or explosive devices set up in advance near the probable routes that are tuned to the emissions of the moving SS-25's and activated from space. And in the most extreme case, for the destruction of the mobile missiles that have miraculously survived, it is possible to utilize missiles of submarines cruising near enough to deliver their nuclear warheads to the position areas of the SS-25's within 15 minutes. Calculations show that in this time they will be unable to leave the range of their destruction through shock wave factors. A comparison of the survivability parameters of mobile and stationary land-based strategic missiles indicates the preferability of the latter. Indeed, silo missiles are guaranteed protection against the electromagnetic pulse, firearms, and highly accurate conventional and nuclear weapons: Their reliable destruction requires an average of 10-15 cruise missiles with conventional explosive charges or 2.4 nuclear warheads. Taking into account the impossibility of destroying silos simultaneously through several nuclear warheads ("fratricidal effect"), the preclusion of their delivery through high-speed low-angle trajectories (which reduces the possibility of hitting and destroying hardened launchers), the high combat readiness of stationary missiles, and their great distance from the borders of Russia, the multiple-warhead SS-18's that we have in silos are capable of fulfilling their intended purpose even if it is just 5 percent of those left for the retaliatory strike, not to mention preventive and counter [otvetno-vstrechnyy] strikes. The ground-mobile SS-25 and SS-24 missiles now in existence are suitable at most for a first strike. So are not they (rather than multiple-warhead silo missiles) the "destabilizing" missiles that the United States so fears? Is Modernization of the SS-25 Realistic? Since the new nuclear missile program involves modernized missiles of the SS-25 type, it is appropriate to analyze the possibilities of a fundamental improvement of existing ground-mobile complexes. Otherwise the arguments presented above may be rejected as not corresponding to the systems under development. The unconditional acknowledgement of the reality of their qualitative improvement is fraught with the danger of senseless economic outlays that are completely unacceptable in our time. I dare to assert that the task of freeing mobile missiles of the SS-25 type from their shortcomings is not soluble in the next decade. The reasons for this are not only economic but also technical, organizational, and political. If we do not understand this, then once again the billions required for the modernization of the SS-25 will be totally wasted. In the foreseeable future, we will be technically unable to build a miniature intercontinental missile and guarantee its invulnerability through the means examined above. The reason for this is the more and more frightening technological backwardness of the military-industrial complex and the prohibitions in START I. Organizationally, it is presently impossible to raise the discipline of the movement of traffic on the roads of Russia or to improve the state of the roads and the safety standards for the entire population of the country. It is likewise impossible to interfere endlessly with the movement of national economic transportation or to establish an alienation zone around the patrol routes to reduce the danger of sabotage and the severity of possible accidents. It is equally unreasonable to keep mobile missile complexes at bases permanently and hope that they will be allowed to leave them in a threatening period. Politically, it is hardly admissible to contribute to an increase in social tension--to raise the degree to which the people living near bases and the patrol routes of SS-25's are informed about the serious danger that threatens them. It is equally obvious that is unethical to keep citizens permanently ignorant of the terrible threat against them and not to prepare them in time to take action under the conditions of possible extreme situations. The question arises: Why did the advocates of the SS-25 ignore these rather important aspects? Or is it possible that the author of these lines is wrong and there is no problem with the SS-25? Then why does no one refute him in a public discussion? But to be fair, I will note that that there were three published articles denying the danger of these missile systems for us. True, their authors presented incorrect arguments to justify their positions, but on the other hand, they did not forget to stress their own high scientific and official rank and in some cases involvement in the creation of the SS-25. Still, in the opinion of independent experts, the problem with the SS-25 is extremely pressing. Moreover, every effort is being made to hush it up, which suits very influential forces: Our "partner" in START II, who is prepared to utilize them as his own "Colt" that is already aimed at the heart of Russia; the generals from industry and the army who still hold their high posts; the corporate interests of a well-known group in the military-industrial complex that receives orders amounting to many billions for a mobile missile technology that is needed by it but not by the taxpayer; and the command of the Strategic Missile Forces that is striving to maintain the size of its staff and the number of generals' billets. No, Russia has no need for START II and the SS-25 that are being imposed on it, neither for those in existence nor for modernized versions. Their acceptance will plunge the country into the next spiral of rearmament. The result is obvious--two zeros at the same time: The final destruction of the economy and the total loss of the country's defensive capability. So is it not better to realize what is happening in time and not to allow such a prospect? The time is not yet past.
