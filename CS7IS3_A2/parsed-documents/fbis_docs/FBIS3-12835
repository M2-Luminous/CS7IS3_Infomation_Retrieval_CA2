Yes. These are the normal relations as seen by a gang that has usurped our territories and established a state. It knows that it was established through terrorism and that it will continue to exist through terrorism. Thus is normalization. Palestinians kneeling in prayer to God in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron are killed by the Israelis' bullets. This picture is an accurate representation of Israeli terrorism and a summing up of the Arab tragedy. Countless Arab revolutionaries and rulers had earlier knelt in Washington seeking protection and offering their obedience and loyalty in hopes that thrones and regimes whose lifespans ended several years ago might continue to exist and in the hope that "leaders" who have gone bankrupt and whose roles have come to an end might find some new role, even if it means serving Israel. The massacre has now come to expose the truth of everything. It comes in the midst of a big clamor selling illusions of peace and depicting the agreements for total capitulation as historic solutions. The massacre reminds everyone that even total capitulation will not make them show mercy to anyone but merely gives the enemy a wonderful opportunity to practice terrorism. They have not and will not abandon their Zionism. Hence, in their view, the battle will continue until they establish their "promised" kingdom from the Euphrates to the Nile and until they control the water, resources, oil, and land. Everything is permissible for this purpose and nothing outside this design is of any value. The massacre also reminds those who have forgotten or pretend to have forgotten of the real relationship between Israel and the United States. They are saying that the killer is American, mad, and an Israeli. Regardless of the naivity of the claim that the crime was committed by a single person acting amid the tight security thrown around the site, the truth that should be apparent to us is this: the real criminals in this crime, as in other crimes, are the U.S. and Israeli governments. It is the Israeli government that has been built on terrorism, that constructed the settlements, armed the settlers, gave them money, weapons and protection, and pushed them into practicing terrorism against the Arabs, and then released the killers following nearly farcical trials. It is the U.S. Administration which has supported all this and turned the Jewish gangs into a state and the state into a gang that takes all it wants from the United States -- ranging from financial, military, and political support, and even the tools of terrorism such as Goldstein and his ilk used, to atomic power and missiles. What will happen after the massacre is very well-known -- advice for self-restraint and this U.S. call: "Forget what happened, and let us play, or negotiate, so that the peace process will not stop!" As for self-restraint, we have practiced it, willingly or unwillingly, for many years, and now we see the result. When we hear the Likud leader, who is a candidate for prime minister after Rabin, expressing appreciation that there are many people like Goldstein among the settlers, what can we say to those who shout in our faces saying: We demand the blood of our sons' killers in every case and regardless of the place; anyone allied with them is a traitor; revenge is a must; there are plenty of guns available and also madmen. As regards the negotiations, everybody knows they will only lead to further concessions. Those who want peace must return to international legitimacy. Let the beginning be a full withdrawal from all occupied territories, removal of all the settlements, and the recognition of the Palestinian people's rights. Without this, any talk about peace and stability in the region is nothing but a mirage. The leadership of the organization that was established to liberate Palestine should return to the right course and stop what it began in Oslo. Otherwise, it should leave the scene rather than lead its people to be massacred without resistance. And the trumpets here that call for turning the cold peace with Israel into a warm one should stop. Let them tell us how peace can be established between the killer and the victim, and how do Israeli bananas taste in their throats when they are stained with the blood of the martyrs [reference to the agriculture minister's admission that Egypt imports bananas from Israel] As for us, we have no choice but to resist to the end. Therefore, we call upon all those who believe in a just and comprehensive peace and who refuse to surrender to Israeli hegemony to engage in serious work to establish a popular organization that will serve as a spearhead in the prolonged battle against the Zionist presence on the soil of Egypt in all its shapes; an organization opposed to normalization and a Middle East market; an organization that will muster all efforts to support the Palestinian intifadah and mobilize the masses against the Israeli-American conspiracy against our national security and pan-Arab interests. We have only two choices: To resist despite difficulties in order to impose a just and honorable peace of the strong, or to submit to the status quo, eat Williams bananas, entertain ourselves with what they call "the challenge" [catch phrase in articles by the chief editors of government newspapers that call for a warmer peace with Israel], place our fate in the hands of Israel and the United States, and receive congratulations for self-restraint while turning ourselves into a nation of refugees and martyrs.
