"During the talks important and unimportant things are said. I understood this offer as Meciar merely tossing out the possibility," Kanis says. Asked why he did not put his signature under the proposal for a confidence vote in the government, which was signed by the majority of SDL deputies, Kanis says: "The SDL strategy places the decision on an early election date above other things, and I am bound to comply with the party strategy. I am expecting that others will also behave in harmony with the party's line," he adds. Kanis says that the statement by Slovak National Party (SNS) Chairman Jan Slota that he could leave the government coalition to the benefit of the peace in the state could be described without exaggeration as "a statement by a real statesman."
