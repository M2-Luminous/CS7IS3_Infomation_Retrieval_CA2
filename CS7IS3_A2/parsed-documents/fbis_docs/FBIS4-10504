Liendo] [Text] Merida--President Rafael Caldera has said that Venezuelans who want something that a majority of the country does not are behind an anti-Venezuela campaign. He said this at a news conference in Merida where he was attending the ordination of Monsignor Juan Maria Leonardi Villasmil, the auxiliary archbishop of Merida. President Caldera asked the media "to stop echoing foreign campaigns and publicizing this negative campaign because it is detrimental to the country and its interests." He added that such campaigns come from very unimportant U.S. concerns [empresas] and organizations that are not well recognized. The president addressed media concerns about the national economy and reports that circulated regarding the risks that the country could entail to foreign investors. That campaign has repercussions in Venezuela because certain sectors are echoing it with intentions and interests unknown to me, he added. "Actually, behind the campaign are certain Venezuelans who want something that a great majority of the people do not: to see the government that I head fail to comply with commitments made to the Venezuelan people." The U.S. Government, he added, as stated explicitly by its ambassador accredited in our country, has no role in or the slightest liking for that negative campaign, because this government recognizes and proclaims the efforts that my government is making for Venezuela, democracy, and the entire American Continent. Caldera said that in the United States Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB], "has very clearly recognized the efforts being made by the current government, and this is confirmed at meetings with important government officials. Iglesias made this statement after having serious and thoughtful study; morover, the IDB, World Bank, and IMF have also conducted similar studies of the Venezuelan situation." He added: Thus, I urge my country's media, which sometimes publishes excessively large headlines on any opinion issued by any unimportant organization that is virtually unknown in the United States, to realize that they could hurt the country and the very interests they represent. Taxes [Reporter at news conference] How will your government control any wave of speculation? How will it control tax money to ensure it is truly channeled to solving the country's important social and economic problems? [Caldera] No one likes to pay taxes; it is not pleasant to collect them either. The need for them is determined by the serious budget crisis facing the country that is worsened by a drop in the price of our main product, petroleum. The measures that will be adopted are important, and they very clearly reflect the concern for social justice that governs this government's activities. He recalled his commitment to eliminate VAT [value-added tax] at the consumer level and to shift the burden of taxes to those who are economically able to pay them. Salary Increases The president said that he trusts that there will be no price increases because, in his opinion, it would be unjustified. We think, he added, that it is an indispensable obligation to increase the minimum wage of all Venezuelans who do not earn enough to meet their basic needs. He said that the economic guarantees were supressed and that the powers granted to the government by those measures have not been exercised with much prudence, but we know that there are prospects for eliminating any outrageous abuses that might further worsen the already difficult economic situation facing Venezuelan households. When asked whether his government will define a true policy for foreign investments, Caldera said that very important people in the international economic world and in developing countries trust our economy, the course it is following, and the guarantees it offers. [Reporter] Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry] fears inflation will result from the announced increase in wages and salaries; the CTV [Confederation of Venezuelan Workers] demands them. When will that announcement be made? What is your opinion on the position of the business leadership? [Caldera] Salary increases are not enacted to create inflation but because there is inflation. My administrations's main goal is to fight inflation.
