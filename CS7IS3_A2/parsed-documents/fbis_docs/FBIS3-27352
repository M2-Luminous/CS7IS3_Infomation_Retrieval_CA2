The conference was held by the provincial party committee and government. Its major tasks were to summarize and introduce Shandong's experiences in sports work gained in the past few years and to discuss the major plans for developing Shandong's sports work in order to upgrade its level of competitive sports and build Shandong into an advanced province in sports as soon as possible. Jiang Chunyun said in his speech: Like other work, Shandong's sports has also yielded notable results over the past few years. Compared with advanced provinces, however, there is still a large gap, which is manifested conspicuously in the slow pace in upgrading the level of competitive sports, the failure in emphasizing key sports, too small a number of outstanding athletes, especially first-rate ones, the small contributions to the state, the outdated concepts on sports, the weak sense of competition, the weak scientific and technological forces related to sports and the lack of personnel, inadequate investment in sports, and the lack of complete and extensive necessary sports facilities. We should give in-depth reflection over this issue, unify our thinking, and have great determination to promote our sports undertakings as soon as possible. Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Developing sports is a long-cherished strong desire of the people of the province. Shandong totally has the conditions and ability to promote sports. It has no reasons, whatsoever, to fall behind. Based on the requirements on sports work put forward at the sixth provincial party congress, we have defined a strategic target of building Shandong into an advanced province in sports and ranking it among the strong provinces in sports in seven years. Shandong's sports work for the present and for some time to come should be dominated by reform, focused on competitive sports, and led by the endeavor to achieve technological progress. It should learn from the advanced experiences at home and abroad, seize the opportunity to bravely conduct explorations, go all out to catch up with others, and blaze a new road for sports development with Shandong's characteristics as soon as possible. Jiang Chunyun emphasized: Strengthening leadership over sports work is the basic guarantee for attaining the strategic target of building Shandong into an advanced and strong province in sports. Party committees and governments at all levels across the province should regard sports as an important component of the socialist modernization drive, include it on their agenda, and study and resolve the issues on sports reform and development. The province, as well as prefectures and counties, should establish the leadership responsibility system at every level, enhance their work, implement specific measures, and promote sports work in a realistic manner. Leaders should be held responsible in the localities where sports cannot be promoted for long periods. From now on, achievements in sports work should be taken as a criterion for appraising party and government leaders at all levels. We should be willing to send competent personnel to work in sports departments, increase investment in sports undertakings, formulate and implement sports standards and plans, and strive to build Shandong into an advanced province in sports and rank it among the strong provinces in sports. Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of the province, also spoke at the conference. Vice Governor Wu Aiying read the decision to commend the personnel who had made contributions to the seventh national games and advanced units. Responsible persons of the provincial trade union council, the provincial women's federation, the provincial commission for physical culture and sports, and the work committee of the organs of the provincial government also read the decisions to commend the personnel and units who had achieved outstanding results at the seventh national games.

Attending were Lu Maozeng, chairman of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Ma Zhongcai and Miao Fenglin, vice chairmen of the provincial people's congress standing committee; and Ma Changgui, special adviser to the provincial government.
