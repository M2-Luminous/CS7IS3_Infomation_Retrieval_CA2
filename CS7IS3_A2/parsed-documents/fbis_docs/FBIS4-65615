But he refused to lay the blame solely on extreme-right supporters, adding that "all form of extremism is shameful for our country." His comments in the AUGSBURGER ALLGEMEINEN followed incidents last week in Magdeburg when a crowd of skinheads and other youths chased a group of Africans through the town. In the ensuing clashes five people were injured, all Germans. Kohl said he had "so often been to funerals of victims of the extreme Left that I refuse to put the problem down solely to violence by the Right." "We must combat energetically all forms of violence," he said. Kohl said he was not opposed to tightening the law but he said "the courts often hand down the lightest sentences." The 49 people arrested after the Magdeburg clashes were later released by police.
