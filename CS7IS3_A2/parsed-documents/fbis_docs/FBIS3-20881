Has anything important happened within the center-right bloc in the meantime? As we recall it, after getting over their first shock in response to that disaster, the center-right parties had declared that they would draw the proper conclusions from that experience and begin to build a common program and rally round it all their forces, so as to defeat the Left in the next elections. What have they done about it so far? What shape is being acquired by that common program with which the united center-right intends to court the society? On observing what has been happening in that domain in recent months, a characteristic shift in emphasis should be pointed out. The formula of the center-right, adopted and propagated before the elections, presupposed a kind of coalition of diverse forces, both rightist and centrist, erected on the soil of joint acceptance of democracy, the free market, and patriotic and Christian values. Yet this precarious balance between the rightists and centrists is being upset by their nascent postelectoral programs. The rightist parties, certainly exploiting that radicalization of attitudes so natural for defeated political parties, are becoming more active than the centrist ones, seizing the initiative, setting the tone, and offering the most catchy programs. This impression is strengthened by their language. Nowadays, they hardly ever speak of the "center-right"; instead, they stress more and more "the integration of the Right." Thus, in the public's eye, the center-right is increasingly often reduced to its right wing and viewed as the Right alone. The rise of such an image of the center-right has been greatly promoted by the entry of the Union for Real Politics (UPR), formerly a a party that went it alone, in that coalition after the elections. The "Constitution of the Right," drafted by UPR, is a set of cohesive program planks influencing the political thought of other parties. One example of such influence may be the "Program Declaration of the Right," adopted on 17 December 1993 by a coalition of four parties--namely, the Party of Christian Democrats (PChD), the Conservative Party (PK), the Christian Peasant Party (SLCh), and UPR, which was published in LAD on 9 January 1994. Thus, the existing bloc of parties championing the antileftist alternative has developed an explicitly rightist orientation in the absence of an offsetting centrist orientation so far (since the latter is not represented by the program of the PC-PL-ZChN [Center Accord, Peasant Accord, Christian-National Union], a coalition that still cannot decide whether to adopt a rightist or a centrist orientation). This tilting of the balance within the center-right in the rightist direction, many portentous consequences, both for that bloc of parties and for its future electoral chances. What Is Rightist and What Centrist Since we employ the concepts of the right and the center, it is high time to define them. The principal and extremely clear criterion for their differences is, in my opinion, their attitude toward the counsel offered by John Paul II to the postcommunist societies in his "Centesimus Annus." Addressing these societies, which after 1989 had regained the freedom to choose their own road, the pope states, as known, that man's present-day problems, in various countries and even more so for the planet as a whole, can be solved neither by real socialism nor by capitalism such as it exists in the modern world. Hence, neither of these ready-made models is acceptable. While distancing itself, in accordance with the entire tradition of the social teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, from the errors made by both sides, this encyclical encourages exploring a socioeconomic model that, whether called capitalism or another name--this really is not the issue--would most fully merit the name of a system of society tailored to the measure of human beings. It would combine the values of private ownership, private enterprise, and the free market, with respect for the common good and the dignity of working people, placing the state and the economy in the service of the whole man and everyman. The attitude toward this fundamental tenet of "Centesimus Annus" may differ among the political groupings of the postcommunist world. Those meriting the appellation "centrist" are the ones that, in the spirit of the encyclical, distance themselves from both the "real socialism" risen on the soil of Marxism and "real capitalism" risen on the soil of liberalism and lacking respect for the human dimension. The rightist groupings, on the other hand, are those that, evading the simultaneous condemnation of both these errors, confine themselves to criticizing "real socialism" alone. They readily support the pope's criticism of collectivism and communism, but they gloss over and fail to draw conclusions from the criticism, offered by the present as well as previous popes, of individualism and liberalism, from the warnings against "...the peril of the spread of a radical ideology of capitalism" ("Centesimus Annus," 42), and against blind faith in the solution of all problems through the free interplay of market forces ("Centesimus Annus," 42)--that is, against the adoption of "an `idolatrous' attitude toward the market, in disregard of the fact that material boons are by their very nature mere chattels" ("Centesimus Annus," 40). Thus, in this sense, the parties who signed the "Program Declaration of the Right" have to be viewed as rightist (and that is how they define themselves anyhow). In the preamble to that document, they declare, "Poland can no longer be a laboratory for socialist experiments," but, at the same time, they fail to add that it should not be a laboratory for liberal experiments, either. This omission is not, of course, fortuitous. The Right and the Social Teachings of the Roman Catholic Church The issue of the attitude of rightist groupings toward the basic tenets of "Centesimus Annus" reflects a general pattern: The stance of rightist parties, even those that include the adjective "Christian" in their appellations, toward the social teachings of the church is ambivalent. Even when they refer to these teachings in their programs, they always do so in a selective manner, stressing those aspects of the teachings that are convenient to them and glossing over the others. This clearly undermines the credibility of their "Christian" declarations because it is reminiscent of the churchgoer who follows only those parts of the sermon that suit him. But this applies to only a few of the rightist parties because most do not even refer in their programs to the social teachings of the church. At most, they mention among their highest values, next to the free-market economy, the desire to preserve the Christian heritage and the traditional moral standards, as expressed, for example, on behalf of the Conservative Party, by Aleksander Hall (RZECZPOSPOLITA, 17 November 1993). This also applies to the ideologists of UPR. Similarly, the aforementioned "Program Declaration of the Right" avoids, perhaps owing to the impossibility of reaching a consensus on this matter, any explicit reference to the social teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. At most, that coalition "affirms the Christian nature of our civilization, whose elemental aspect is tolerance," and the consideration, in public life, "of the good of the family and the protection of human life and moral order." This is, we must admit, much less than is required of Christians by the social teachings of the church. Shortcomings of "Symbolic" and "Antiabortion" Christianity Let us be fair. We bear in mind and appreciate the fact that nearly all of the rightist deputies, including those belonging to UPR and to the subsequently established Conservative Party, did manage, at difficult moments facing the Sejm, to support the inclusion of the provisions on Christian values in the [laws passed concerning] radio and television, and they also championed the teaching of religion in schools and prolife values. They deserve to be praised for it. But Christian humanism in public life cannot be confined to just a symbolic championing of Christian values. A genuine Christian presence is something more than displaying a cross in the Senate deliberating room or including an appropriate provision in a law. It is achieved chiefly through being present in men's attitudes, through a Christian humanism that is inseparably linked to sensitivity not just to symbols but to the fate of living human beings. Catholicism, as declared by Cardinal Suhard in his famous pastoral letter of 1947, is either social Catholicism or no Catholicism at all. Similarly, the prolife attitude, although highly important, does not exhaust in its entirety that testimony that Christianity demands of those professing it because Christianity commands caring not only for the fate of the unborn but also for that of our neighbors who may suffer and need our help. In the language of the modern church, this refers to "the preferential option for the sake of the poor." But the "poor," whom it is our duty to be aware of and help, are those who are poor not only in the material sense; they also include the homeless, the incapacitated, and people deprived of human rights and of hope for a better future. They include as well those threatened by unemployment, those who already lost their jobs and cannot support their families, school graduates who have no prospects for a decent life, and ill-paid pensioners who cannot afford the rising rents and the prices of medicines. They include all of the social groups that, during the current transition era, are unable, through no fault of their own, to make a living and need assistance from others. Solidarity with their fate should be expressed not only through private charity (as desired by 19th-century liberals) but also as a behest of social justice (as demanded by social Catholics [as published] in discussions with them). Hence, this requires state interventionism and a deliberate social policy of the state; this requires such institutional reforms as will assure for all an adequate social safety net. Reducing Christian humanism in public life to a struggle for symbols or to antiabortion efforts without, at the same time, showing sensitivity to the fate of the social strata and groups expecting our assistance makes a travesty of that humanism. It causes public opinion to form a distorted and false image of the Roman Catholic Church, which the public views as standing behind the rightist politicians, because the church is being accused of focusing on the fate of the unborn and ignoring the fate of those already living. We know that this accusation is painfully unjust. But don't we Christian politicians somehow warrant it, owing to shortcomings in our own Christian testimony? Attitude Toward the Social Rights of Citizens Thus, one issue dividing the rightist and centrist groupings is the attitude toward the social rights that should be vested in citizens in the legislation and the Constitution. Unless it is analyzed more thoroughly and leads to a reasonable compromise, this issue may complicate the center-right consensus in the debate on the [new] Constitution. The aforementioned "Program Declaration of the Right" views freedom, ownership, and respect for national traditions as the sole foundations of social order and does not mention such fundamental aspects of the Christian vision of social order as social justice or solidarity. It is significant that the declaration in question makes no mention of such problems as unemployment; it is as if the signatory parties are blind to it. The declaration limits state interventionism solely to "what is indispensable to the protection of life, freedom, or the property of others," and makes no provision for any social policy to be pursued by the state. (That is certainly due to the influence of UPR, mentioned in SLOWO by its spokesman, Rafal Ziemkiewicz: "We are resolutely opposed to the pursuit of any social policy whatsoever by the state. UPR also demands the privatization of health care and education, meaning their profitable operation." How is this to be reconciled with the concern for "the good of the family" mentioned further on in that declaration?) The declaration supports the elimination of the progressive tax system. While it champions [protection for] farmers, which is an exception (and certainly the sole concession made to Mr. Slisz's SLCh), the declaration does not support tariffs protecting domestic manufacturing; instead, if supports "the free flow of people, capital, and goods, free international trade." Along with rejecting state interventionism, the declaration is also opposed to trade union privileges. And, in opposition to the postulates of Polish crafts guilds, it champions the principle that business and professional activities should not be restricted by the requirement of compulsory membership in associations of businessmen and professionals. Final Conclusions The above evolution of the center-right bloc into essentially a rightist bloc is pregnant in grave consequences to it. There is the threat of the narrowing of its political stance and social base of support. There is also the threat that its program is diverging from the road outlined by the latest [papal] social encyclical, which is bound to result in losing the support of a substantial segment of the Catholic electorate. Guiding itself by the social teachings of the church, that electorate sees no reason that it should support parties that treat these teachings selectively. The rightward shift of the programs of the existing center-right bloc also harbors the threat that broad public opinion will view it as a force oriented toward one-sided support of the interests of employers and propertied strata. This is bound to result in losing the support of the other segments of the bloc's electorate, such as employees facing the threat of losing their jobs, welfare recipients, trade union sympathizers, and those championing state interventionism. Thus, instead of turning away from the needs and demands of these segments of the society, as is being done in the Right's program, these problems should be faced and their constructive and effective solutions explored. Only this approach reflects genuine Christian testimony in public life. Only this approach will enable the center-right to establish ties to broad segments of the world of work and groups seeking social protection, and thus prevent their exploitation by the Left in future elections. In Poland, where nearly 3 million people are unemployed, where 1.5 million lack housing of their own, and where 40 percent of families live below the social minimum, these segments of the electorate are very large and decisive, as demonstrated by the elections of 1993. Thus, if the center-right camp is indeed to deprive the Left of votes and defeat it in the next elections, it will have to get rid of its "rightist" program. It needs the living presence and proactivism of a sociopolitical "center," formed chiefly by Catholic-social and trade union forces deriving from Solidarity. By analogy with the "Constitution of the Right," a "Constitution of the Center" should be drafted and presented to broad public opinion. At present, this is an unusually important and urgent task because only the coexistence of both these currents, differing in their sociopolitical postulates but inspired by the same Christian and patriotic orientation and the desire for mutual compromise, can lay the foundations of electoral victory and turn Poland away from its present crooked road.
