The use of force will "not solve any problems but will produce bigger ones," Ambassador [Vladimir] Terechov said on Saarlaendischer Radio today. Discussion in the West has concentrated "much too heavily" on the use of military means, the diplomat said. There was no better way to peace than through negotiations. Terechov said the Russian Government is optimistic that a demilitarization of Sarajevo could be achieved "very soon" with "the good will" of the conflicting parties. His country is in constant touch with Serbia, Bosnia, and Croatia. "I believe Russia is doing good work," the ambassador stressed.
