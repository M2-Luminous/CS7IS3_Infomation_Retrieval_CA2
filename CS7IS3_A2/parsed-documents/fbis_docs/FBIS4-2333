The French delegation immediately demanded explanations from the Chinese authorities, only to be told that these arrests had not taken place. Here is the reaction of French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe: [Begin Juppe recording] We demanded an explanation, and that explanation was given to us by the minister who is accompanying Mr. Balladur, by the deputy mayor of Shanghai, and by the Chinese ambassador in France, who all formally told us that no dissidents had been arrested in Shanghai in the last few hours. This is what was told to us by official sources. We have taken note. [end recording] Things are not, however, as simple as that. Journalists pressed Juppe to comment on the fact that the dissidents' families had said they had been arrested, but at this point the prime minister himself stepped in to put an end to the conversation: [Begin recording] [Balladur] To convince you once and for all, I would advise you to get in touch with the Chinese ambassador in Paris, and if perchance he should say the same thing as the French foreign minister, then you will be perfectly informed and reassured. I hope so at least. [Unidentified correspondent] Are you convinced by their explanations? [Balladur] Yes. [Correspondent] Is that a diplomatic yes? [Balladur] Those are your words. Why do you ask? How would you describe your lack of conviction? [end recording] What has happened exactly? The Chinese authorities deny that there were any arrests. We spoke, however, to the father of Bao Ge [not further identified by name], who insisted that his son was arrested in Shanghai: [Begin recording] [Bao Ge's father, in Chinese with superimposed French translation] He was taken away this morning at 0900 by eight policemen, and he has still not come back to his home in Shanghai. [end recording] That interview was carried out by our Chinese service.
