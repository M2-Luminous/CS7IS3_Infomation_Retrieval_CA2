FR940916-2-00012 FR940916-2-00010 COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND OR SEVERELY DISABLED Procurement List Addition AGENCY: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled. ACTION: Addition to the Procurement List. SUMMARY: This action adds to the Procurement List a service to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, Crystal Square 3, Suite 403, 1735 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202&hyph;3461. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Milkman, (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 13, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 FR 25038) of proposed addition to the Procurement List. Comments were received from the current contractor, which alleged that loss of the ability to provide this service to the Government would have a severe impact on the company. First, the portion for the janitorial services that will remain available for the current contractor to compete for if the Committee adds this service to the Procurement List represents more than 70 percent of the value of the commenter's current contract. Second, the commenter, which was informed by the Government contracting activity in 1993 of its plans to divide the service requirement in its current contract into two contracts and offer one to the Committee's program, has not held contracts for the service for a long period, so it can not be considered to be especially dependent on contracts for this service. For these reasons, the Committee has concluded that addition to the Pro curement List of the services specified in this notice will not have a severe adverse impact on the commenter. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the service, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the service to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the service. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the service to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46 &hyph;48c) in connection with the service proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following service is hereby added to the Procurement List: Janitorial/Custodial Norfolk Naval Shipyard Portsmouth, Virginia for the following buildings: 1SJ, 2SJ, 3SJ, 4SJ, 6SJ, 7SJ, 8SJ, 11SJ, 12SJ, 14SJ, 19, 26SJ, 38SJ, 41 & 42SJ, 51, 59, 67, 69SJ, 79SJ, 82SJ, 89SJ, 91SJ, 94SJ, 124SJ, 164SJ, 165SJ, 166SJ, 167SJ, 168SJ, 170SJ, 171SJ, 172SJ, 174SJ, 183SJ, 185SJ, 193 & 194SJ, 201SJ, 202SJ, 203SJ, 213SJ, 217SJ, 252SJ, 277, 277SJ, Trailer 39, 41, 305SJ, 307SJ, 310, 316, 384SG, 400SJ, 491, 492, 1439, 1480, 1500, 1502, 1503, 1510SC, 1555SJ, HSJ, M&hyph;1SJ, M&hyph;4SJ, IUSSD Trailer 1 & 2, IUSSD Guard Shack, 674SH, Trailer 1700&hyph;1 This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this addition or options exercised under those contracts.
