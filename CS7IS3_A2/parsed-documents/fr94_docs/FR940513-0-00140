FR940513-0-00140 FR940513-0-00034 ii. Average initial lumens vs. average mean or average lumens. In general, the light output in lumens of a given lamp product is greatest at the beginning of its life ( i.e. , its ``initial lumens''). Light output in lumens degrades over the lifetime of the lamp. According to generally accepted industry standards, the light output for a lamp can be measured and expressed in terms of average initial lumens (at or near the beginning of the lamp's life), as average or mean lumens over the duration of the lamp's real or projected lifetime, or as a range of lumens. In determining the most appropriate lumen disclosure for each type of lamp product, the Commission has considered the comments concerning the effect of degradation on the different lamp types and the measure of light output in lumens that will give purchasers the most accurate and uniform information on which they can compare competing products and make purchase decisions. There was considerable discussion in the written comments and at the Workshop about how and at what point or points in a lamp's operation light output should be measured. 83 Some comments suggested that the required disclosure should be of mean or average lifetime lumens, 84 while others believed that lumens should be expressed as initial lumens. 85 83 See, e.g. , Tr., 66&hyph;86. 84 Philips (Tr.), 74 (a rating based on a long-term average of tested lumens that would be rounded); NEPS (Tr.), 67, 72; SCS, GG&hyph;16, 1&hyph;3 (details reasons for disclosing ``mean lumen output range,'' including differing lumen depreciation and lumen output values and differences in lumen output from differences in fixtures, installations, sensitivity to temperature, and/or ballasts). 85 See, e.g. , Osram (Tr.), 68; NEMA (Supp.), G&hyph;10, 15&hyph;16; Philips (Supp.), G&hyph;12, 2; LBL (Supp.), GG&hyph;22, 3. During the Workshop, representatives of GE and Osram explained in some detail how lumens are measured under current industry methods. One of the issues discussed was the extent to which lumens degrade (or diminish) over the life of a lamp. 86 There was general agreement among most of the Workshop participants that the extent of degradation of competing general service incandescent lamps and of medium base compact fluorescent lamps over the average lifetime of a compact fluorescent lamp (10,000 hours) is substantially the same. 87 Accordingly, most Workshop participants concluded that it would be appropriate for the Commission to require disclosure of average initial lumens. 88 Because it is easier to measure the light output of lamp products as initial lumens, and a requirement to disclose light output in initial lumens is consistent with the requirements of the Light Bulb Rule, the Commission has determined to require disclosure of average initial lumens on the packages of these products. 89 See ยง305.11(e)(1)(A)(iv) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below. 86 See Tr., 66&hyph;86. 87 Because compact fluorescent lamps have longer lives than incandescent lamps, this comparison requires that several general service incandescent lamps be considered for the comparison. Specifically: Over the life span of a compact fluorescent product, generally speaking, after the first hundred hours_and the initial lumens are measured at one hundred hours burning_the product declines in output slowly over a life of perhaps 10,000 hours. If you look at what happens for the equivalent number of incandescent lamps, then obviously every time you replace an incandescent lamp say after 750 hours, your light output goes up to the initial again, and then drops off to some lower figure. If you take the difference in the averages between what you get from that whole bunch of incandescent lamps and what you get from the single curve with the compact fluorescent, it is not a very big percentage. It is perhaps around five percent. That is far less than you will get by differences in light output from incandescent lamps due to fluctuating voltage. Osram (Tr.), 80&hyph;81. 88 See GE (Tr.), 67 (``Whether I would want product A or product B from a light output or an efficiency standpoint, you'll still make the same decision.''); Osram (Tr.), 81 (``Our procedures, both nationally and internationally for rating products at initial value is something that we can live with as an industry, and something that we can measure with some consistency, and can be enforced.''); NEMA (Supp.), G&hyph;10, 15&hyph;15; LBL (Supp.), GG&hyph;22, 3 (``There was considerable discussion at the Workshop on whether initial lumens, or mean or maintained lumens, should be reported on lamp labels. LBL concurs with the position that the difference between the lumen depreciation of general service incandescent lamps and compact fluorescent lamps is small enough that initial lumens (per the standard test procedure) are acceptable.''); Philips (Supp.), G&hyph;12, 3. But see MA AG (Supp.), GG&hyph;24, 2, fn. 1 (``Manufacturers should disclose if a compact fluorescent lamp or an energy efficient incandescent lamp's lumen degradation is faster or further or both than the degradation of a conventional incandescent lamp.''). 89 This requirement is consistent with the Light Bulb Rule. 16 CFR at 409.1(a)(2). d. Average lamp life . Lamp life refers to the lamp's average life or lifetime, measured under laboratory conditions ( i.e ., average laboratory life). 90 In the NPR, the Commission proposed requiring disclosure of average life (in hours). During the proceeding, two issues emerged relating to the proposed requirement to disclose lamp life: (1) How to determine the life of the product; and (2) whether to express life in years (based on an average usage period, such as three hours per day) or hours. 90 In EPCA, as amended by EPA 92, the terms ``life'' and ``lifetime'' mean ``length of operating time of a statistically large group of lamps between first use and failure of 50 percent of the group in accordance with test procedures described in the IES Lighting Handbook-Reference Volume.'' 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(P) (West Supp. 1993).
