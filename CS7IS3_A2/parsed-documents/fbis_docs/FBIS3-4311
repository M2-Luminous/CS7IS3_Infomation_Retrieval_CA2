They have apparently already moved to head off any settling of scores which might take place after the death of patriarch Deng Xiaoping. Chinese sources said that in recent internal addresses, Mr. Jiang made repeated reference to the way in which the student movement in Shanghai had been defused in a "peaceful" manner. Mr. Jiang was party boss of Shanghai before his elevation to party general- secretary on June 24, 1989. The speeches were made in the context of measures the leadership was taking this year to prevent an outbreak of massive social disorder, the sources said yesterday. "The central leadership must be careful and judicious in handling national disturbances," said Mr. Jiang in a thinly-veiled reference to June 4. "We in Shanghai were able to neutralise the trouble- making elements without upsetting stability." The leadership decided soon after the crackdown to freeze the "Tiananmen Square issue", particularly the question of responsibility, until the death of Mr. Deng. While the military side of the operation was supervised by Mr. Deng and Yang Shangkun, respectively the chairman and secretary- general of the Central Military Commission, Mr. Jiang played a sizeable role in crisis management, including ousting then-party chief Zhao Ziyang and other "bourgeois liberals" in the party. "Technically, Jiang remained Shanghai party boss till late June 1989, and he can claim credit for the way the Shanghai leadership, including then-mayor Zhu Rongji, managed to put out the rebellion without bloodshed," a source said. Diplomats in Beijing said that after Mr. Deng's death, three politicians would be susceptible to be made scapegoats: Premier Li Peng, Beijing party boss Chen Xitong, and his predecessor, Li Ximing. "For the sake of unity, Deng's successors will not finger their patron," said a senior Western diplomat. "However, just as the Gang of Four were accused of misleading Chairman Mao, the two Li's and Chen might be stigmatised for giving Deng the wrong advice." According to party sources, Li Ximing, who retired from the Politburo and his position of Beijing party boss in late 1992, recently tried to exonerate himself in a seminar on recent party history. "Historical events, including those in the party, were never caused by a small group of people," Mr. Li reportedly said. The party sources said Mr. Deng's assessment of the severity of the student demonstrations in April and May 1989 were partly based on verbal accounts given to him by Mr. Li and Mr. Chen, then mayor of Beijing. Premier Li became the symbol of the suppression partly because he declared martial law in Beijing on May 20, 1989. However, the sources said, because he was not as close to Mr. Deng as Mr. Yang, Mr. Jiang or Mr. Li, his role in the decision to use drastic measures against the students might have been less than expected. The sources said National People's Congress chairman Qiao Shi could benefit most from the "blame game" that would be played after Mr. Deng's demise. At a crucial meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee in late May, Mr. Qiao abstained from a vote on whether to move the troops to the capital.
