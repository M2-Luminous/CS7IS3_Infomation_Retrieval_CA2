He was a cochairman of the party jointly with Vyacheslav Shostakovskiy. Yesterday, the congress introduced changes to the rules, introducing the posts of chairman and deputy chairman instead of the institution of cochairmen. Both Lysenko and Shostakovskiy are State Duma deputies. They are members of the Yabloko faction. Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the faction, reported several days ago that within the next few days the faction would discuss the question of expelling Lysenko from the faction, because his actions run counter to the stand of the majority. At the congress yesterday, Lysenko spoke out against the party going into opposition on a course pursued by the president and the government. Shostakovskiy favored a democratic alternative to this course.
