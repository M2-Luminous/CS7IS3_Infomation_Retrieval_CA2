Mohamed Hasan, chairman of the Business Council for Sustainable Development (MUIPB), addressed a meeting on enforcing the eco- efficiency program in current industrial development in Jakarta on 23 November. [passage omitted] Professor Dr. Otto Sumarwoto, executive director of MUIPB, said an industry must improve its production efficiency and comply with enviromental regulations as required by the society. The environmental expert from the Bandung-based University of Pajajaran said that lately the government has been encouraging industrialists to advocate the principles of environmental protection by adopting environmental regulations and making structural changes in their production processes. However, members of the international community who are consumers should also boycott goods whose production processes produce environmentally harmful waste. [passage omitted] According to Otto, basically, the eco-efficiency program is an effort to urge industries to use efficient raw materials that will reduce pollution output. In this way, the industries are minimizing the environmental impact. In view of this, the eco-efficiency program not only requires industries to abide by the people's demand for environmental protection, it also provides the industries with competitiveness and increases their profits over the long term.
