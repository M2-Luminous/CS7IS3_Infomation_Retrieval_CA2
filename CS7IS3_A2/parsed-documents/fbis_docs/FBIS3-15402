In an interview with INTERFAX, he motivated his decision by saying that as a result of the recent parliamentary elections the Social Democratic Party, which nominated him for the republican parliament did not obtain the right to pursue its policy. "As the head of the executive, the president cannot base his moves on a representative of any political course which has failed to receive the support of the majority of citizens," Chubotaru made clear. Asked whether the parliamentary majority is able to stabilize the situation in the country, he pointed out that this depended on how to understand the stabilization and what methods will be used to achieve it. "We believe that the retention of sovereignty by the republic's people is the main aspect of Moldova's retention of independence as a state. This means achieving an economic sovereignty, e.g. a possibility to pursue an independent economic policy, free from pressure from outside," Chubotaru was quoted as saying. In his opinion, the new government's actions within the next six months will not affect Moldova's relations with international financial and economic institutions, in particular, the implementation of a memorandum signed by the Moldovan government, National Bank of Moldova, IMF and World Bank for the period until July 1 1994. Chubotaru believes that the state program for privatization developed by the Social Democratic Party will not be drastically amended within the next six months. At the same time, he did not rule out the possibility of other than original interpretations of the key provisions of the law and the privatization program.
