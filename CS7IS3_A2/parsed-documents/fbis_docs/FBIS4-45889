Especially alarming is the number of cases of diphtheria (a 3.2-fold increase since 1992), measles (up 2.8-fold over the last year), and Flexner's dysentery (a 1.7-fold increase). There has also been a 1.6-fold increase in the number of people who have contracted whooping cough. The number of people infected with the herpes virus has increased 34.92%, and there has been a 24% rise in the number of tuberculosis patients. The total number of cases involving acute intestinal illnesses has dropped 10%, but clinical physicians attribute this to the fact that fewer people are seeking medical help.
