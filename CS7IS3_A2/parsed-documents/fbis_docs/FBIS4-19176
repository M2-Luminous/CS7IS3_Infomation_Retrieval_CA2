This was, however, a purely personal view, Butrus-Ghali said after a talk with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in Bonn today. The decision on this issue lay with the UN General Assembly, he said. Butrus-Ghali underlined the United Nations' desire that Germany should play a greater role in international UN missions. He hoped that the constitutional clarification needed for this is achieved soon and that Germany will then also be able to participate fully in UN missions.
