This unity should be preserved and reinforced, and an end should be put to the in-fighting. Such is the goal which the brother leader of the 1 September Revolution [Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi] has endeavored to achieve with his continuous efforts to bring about reconciliation and protect unionist gains, particularly under the current circumstances in the Arab region and the world and in view of the challenges facing our Arab nation. Therefore, the duty is to spare the Yemeni Arab people the tragedies resulting from an armed conflict, to resort to reason, and to choose the path of dialogue in order to implement the Pledge and Accord document and also to respond to the will of the Yemeni Arab people to preserve unity and reject in-fighting and the collapse of this unity, which benefits only the enemies of unity and the enemies of the Arab nation. The unionists and pan-Arabists today have the historical responsibility to preserve the Yemeni unity, which we regard as a prelude to the unity of the Arab nation, to protect its existence and safeguard its independence. The General People's Committee for Unity in the Great Jamahiriyah calls on the Yemeni leaderships, who have achieved unity, to make efforts to preserve that unity for this is an historical responsibility which they should assume.
