The National Intelligence Service [NIS] director, Mr. Mike Louw, says spies are streaming into the country to try and track these scientists down. They are also checking on South Africa's capacity to produce dangerous weapons. He was speaking before the joint standing committee on finance in what has been described as a symbol of the new openness on the workings of South Africa's civil intelligence agency. Mr. Louw admitted openly that the NIS had spied on many of the community's members in the past. He also said that once the United States had closed 13 of its CIA missions in Africa, South Africa would probably conduct the work of these missions.
