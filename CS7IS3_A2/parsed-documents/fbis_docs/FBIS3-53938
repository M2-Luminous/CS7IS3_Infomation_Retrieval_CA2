Addressing the members of the Parliamentary Consultative Committee attached to the Defense Ministry in New Delhi, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao said the motivation for diversification in defense production units does not mean any reduction in defense production, but aims at increasing their turnover and exposing them to commercial culture. It was disclosed in the meeting that as part of the diversification drive during 1993-94, 22 percent of the sales of the ordnance factories are expected to be to nondefense customers. The chief of the Army Staff, General B.C. Joshi, informed the committee of the Army's decision to induct the indigenous main battle tank Arjun in its fold. Expressing full faith in the capability of the tank, General Joshi said it meets all the requirements of the Army.
