However, all of a sudden, China's rulers found Liu Gang, the 38-year-old former activist of the 1989 students' protests, useful to a certain extent again. Relations between Beijing and Washington are slightly strained because President Clinton is taking aim at human rights violations in China. A conciliatory gesture vis-a-vis the United States was needed. Thus, Beijing's propaganda experts remembered Liu Gang. On Thursday of last week [3 March], Beijing selected five U.S. correspondents, picked them up from their homes in a minibus, and put them on the train from Beijing to Lingyuan. On Friday morning, they were allowed to visit the work camp Lingyuan Number Two -- one of six retraining camps in the godforsaken village 300 km northeast of Beijing. "Through a tinted window on the second floor, we were allowed to see Liu Gang, who crossed the courtyard once with a guard," one of the reporters stated. "It is impossible to say anything about the state of his health." In a letter smuggled out of the camp about one year ago, Liu Gang mentioned torture and a festering rash on his face. When the U.S. journalists wanted to speak to Liu, his guard, Xin Tingquan, stated: "We are not afraid of your seeing him. Yet Liu Gang tells lies. For this reason, he is not allowed to meet with anybody." Thus, it was only possible to see Liu from a distance, like a panda in the zoo. The propaganda show culminated in the presentation of a prisoner dance group that hopped to Michael Jackson's pop song "Bad." Liu Gang's presentation was the most tasteless example of what the human rights organization Asiawatch describes as China's new "hostage policy" -- the release or the presentation of well-known political prisoners at important political moments that promise the greatest possible journalistic effect. The largely anonymous majority of prisoners of conscience is being forgotten, Asiawatch complains. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will certainly expect some gesture, no matter how dubious it may be from a moral viewpoint, when he arrives in Beijing this Friday. "Human rights are a priority on the agenda of my visit to China," Christopher announced a few days ago. U.S. President Clinton has linked the extension of the most-favored-nation status, which is renewed every year, with "significant progress" in Beijing in the sphere of human rights. Christopher's report on his visit to China will be Clinton's major basis for a decision. The status grants China normal customs tariffs. If it should not be extended, China's textile exports to the United States would become much more expensive. Billions of dollars in bilateral trade would be in peril and tens of thousands of jobs would be lost in the United States and in China. Thus, this step would be tantamount to trade sanctions. The debate about the most-favored-nation clause has been part of the summer show in the U.S. Congress since 1989. So far, the Sword of Damocles always hung over the Chinese for a few weeks without descending completely. The losses for U.S. and Hong Kong enterprises would have been too big. Year in year out they are paying the fees of a group of professional lobbyists who fight for a renewal of the clause and against sanctions against China. This year, the variable is the new President. How serious is Clinton about human rights, which he advocated strongly during his election campaign against George Bush? He is now the President and "jobs, jobs, jobs" is all his compatriots are interested in. China might take revenge by discriminating against U.S. companies when placing orders for large economic projects. Beijing followed this principle recently when France concluded a weapons deal with Taiwan. Neither of the two sides shows any flexibility. Clinton declared three weeks ago that China has made "some limited progress," which, however, is not yet sufficient. U.S. Human Rights Commissioner John Shattuck recently visited Beijing to remind the Chinese once again of all the individual points in Clinton's "executive order" on the most-favored-nation clause for China. The presidential decree of May 1993 calls for "significant progress" in the following areas: Release or information on the fate of political prisoners, guarantees for the humane treatment of prisoners -- by allowing inspections by international organizations, for example -- and the protection of the cultural and religious heritage of the Tibetans. It also demands an end to the jamming of international television and radio programs, freedom of emigration, and a ban on the export of goods to the United States that have been produced in Chinese prisons. So far, China has hardly made any concessions, apart from propaganda videos and propaganda trips. Initial cautious negotiations with the International Red Cross on visits to prisons have not yielded any results. Officially, China rejects U.S. pressure on every occasion as "interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state." Referring to human rights, Prime Minister Li Peng told the National People's Congress on Thursday that "China is against any kind of hegemonism." His statement was welcomed with strong applause by the approximately 3,000 puppet delegates. In a seeming effort to express its defiance vis-a-vis the United States, China's police arrested over a dozen dissidents in the runup to the visit and the session of "parliament" that began on Thursday. Some were released after the hour-long interrogations designed to intimidate them, but at least three are facing several-year prison terms. China's most well-known dissident, Wei Jingsheng, with whom Christopher would like to meet, has "departed" from Beijing under mysterious circumstances. A clear change of course of the Chinese leadership in the sphere of human rights is unlikely in the near future, irrespective of the outcome of the visit by U.S. Secretary of State Christopher. After all, the power of the CPC depends on the intimidating effect of the Chinese gulag, as the 89-year-old patriarch Deng Xiaoping knows very well. To achieve this goal, the security organs frequently have to carry out raids during the night, and the fearless few like Liu Gang are arrested, sentenced, and forgotten.
