FR940707-2-00074 FR940707-2-00049 The comments ranged from requests for copies of the final application solicitation to general support to substantive, insightful responses for this year's proposed funding priorities and recommendations for other priority areas. Few of the comments provided specific guidance on the development of the final priority areas. Rather, the majority were supportive of and expanded upon what we proposed in the announcement, in addition to relating specifically to the program goals and priorities of the particular agencies submitting the comments. The comments received were helpful in highlighting the concerns of the developmental disabilities field and have been used in refining the final priority areas. Comment: 24 letters were submitted to ADD recommending additional funding priorities for FY 1994. Suggestions included best practice and systems change, development of standards, and training in Personal Assistance Services (PAS); projects that focus on the integration into community activities of families who have a child who is medically fragile and severely disabled; a project that cares for children with HIV/AIDS; projects on home ownership; dissemination of information to families and practitioners; and aging and developmental disabilities. Response: ADD funded five PAS projects in FY 1993. We continue to fund those projects and support a variety of other activities in the area of personal assistance services. Although ADD has not funded any recent projects on community integration of individuals with severe disabilities or medically fragile children through the PNS program, we continue to support projects and activities in this area through the university affiliated program. ADD funded five HIV/AIDS projects from FY 1990&hyph;1992. We continue to support HIV/AIDS projects and activities through the university affiliated program. ADD funded two projects on home ownership from FY 1991&hyph;1994. We also awarded a five year grant in FY 1993 to the university affiliated program at the University of New Hampshire to establish a national information network on consumer based housing. ADD supports a number of grant-related activities that focus on dissemination of information on issues relating to developmental disabilities. It has become a requirement of each grant award made. We continue to fund projects on elderly persons with disabilities through the university affiliated program's Training Initiative component. ADD appreciates the suggestions for additional priority areas for this fiscal year. While we are unable to add new priority areas at this time because of budget constraints, we will consider these suggestions and recommendations for future grant announcements. Comment: ADD received 34 comments on Proposed Priority Area 1, Leadership Education and Development of Individuals with Disabilities and Their Families from Culturally Diverse Backgrounds. The majority of the comments received in this priority area were supportive of what was proposed in the published notice. However, some of the comments provided recommendations for project design and specific suggestions for how the projects should be funded (based on the particular focus of the organization submitting the comments). There was also a letter writing campaign from advocacy groups supporting strong linkages to and between ADD's national network associations. That writing campaign also included adding a qualifier to the grant requirements regarding composition of the funded agencies board of directors (at least 51% individuals with disabilities or family members of individuals with disabilities). Another letter writer suggested that we collaborate our activities with other Federal and State agencies. There was a suggestion that the requirements of the final priority area be specific about how information would be disseminated as well as how the project would be evaluated. There were also numerous recommendations for ADD to specifically focus its FY 1994 efforts on Youth Leadership Development.
