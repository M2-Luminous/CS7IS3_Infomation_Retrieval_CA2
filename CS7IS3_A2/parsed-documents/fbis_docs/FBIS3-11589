The modesty and realism of the six recommendations drafted by diplomats and military from the Americas can be put down to the nefarious legacy of the past, which consisted of a continental security system designed on the basis of the existence of a cold war and the division of the world into two blocs. Many nations of the hemisphere, especially those having democratic governments, cannot forget that the United States' interventionist hegemony was enshrined in the region in the name of anticommunism, and that to this effect, dictatorships of different leanings were supported and coups d'etat by the military encouraged. Another sad heritage from those decades is the idea that the OAS simply rubber stamps and follows Washington's policy dictates. This explains the great reluctance evinced by some delegations to approve any multilateral security program that entails a limitation of their decisionmaking power. It is an open secret that Brazil, for example, accepts collaboration in aspects pertaining to bilateral and regional security, but takes a stand against any scheme that seeks to go beyond these limits. Hernan Patino Mayer, Argentine ambassador to the OAS and chairman of the Special Commission for Hemispheric Security, played a crucial role, but his presentation propounding "an all-encompassing" scheme was slashed to the necessary minimum limits for reaching consensus. Proposals for holding periodic meetings between defense ministers from the hemisphere, turning the Inter-American Defense Board into an advisory body to the Council, or establishing a permanent center for solving conflicts, therefore came to nothing. One of the six recommendations that were finally approved urges member countries "to regularly inform the appropriate OAS organs about the implementation of measures to foster trust." It seemed evident that the "intercourse" between Argentina and the United States -- as well as the fact that the former's Armed Forces are those that are most subordinated to the political power of any in the region -- placed our country in a special situation. Nevertheless, there are those who think that an essential stimulus is lacking for establishing a new security system -- the existence of a new common threat to the countries of the Americas, an enemy whom at present nobody is in a position to define.
