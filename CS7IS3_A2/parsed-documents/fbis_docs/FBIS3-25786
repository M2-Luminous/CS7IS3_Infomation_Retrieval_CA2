Addressing a national work conference on ideological and media work which ended here today, Ding Guangen, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said that the reform must also conform to the law governing the development of cultural and media undertakings. He stressed that in carrying out the reform, it was imperative to pay close attention to the promotion of cultural and ideological progress; follow the principles of democracy and providing guidance to the people and focus on mobilizing their initiative; rely on all sectors of society and be good at employing modern mass media. It was also imperative to step up macro-management of cultural and media undertakings; cultivate a socialist cultural market; study and draw on outstanding cultural achievements and managerial expertise in other countries; restructure the management of cultural and media undertakings; and systematize and standardize cultural and media work. Ding, who is also a member of the Secretariat of the party Central Committee, said: "To implement various tasks put forward by the party Central Committee on the ideological and media front, it is essential to have a competent contingent." According to Ding, the holding of the conference demonstrates that the party Central Committee persists in placing equal emphasis on both material progress and cultural and ideological progress. The conference was also intended to mobilize the whole party to strengthen and improve ideological and media work in order to provide a "powerful ideological guarantee" and a "fine public opinion environment" for the reform, economic expansion and stability in China, the leader told the closing session. Ding, who is also head of the Propaganda Department of the party Central Committee, expressed the belief that the conference would certainly help to improve the ideological and media work and make sure that all tasks assigned by the party Central Committee will be implemented to the letter. Delegates to the conference pledged to implement the tasks on the ideological and media front and to improve their work. To this end, it was necessary to further emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts and take the road of the reform and opening to the outside world, they noted.
