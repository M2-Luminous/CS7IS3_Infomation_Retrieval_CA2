Ordinary "zaito" investment programs mainly to finance housing projects, public works and projects by government-affiliated financial institutions are allocated 39,147.9 billion yen for the year starting April 1, up 7.0 percent from the original fiscal 1993 zaito budget. The ministry budgeted 10,186.5 billion yen for housing-related projects, an investment category believed to underpin the Japanese economy amid the long slump, up a sharp 22.6 percent. In fiscal 1993, such spending growth was set at 10.4 percent. Outlays of 5,979.0 billion yen, up 10.1 percent, go to lending and other programs for struggling small companies, the ministry said. It allots 7,949.4 billion yen, up 12.2 percent, to local public organizations and local public financial institutions as a way to improve livelihood-related infrastructure in regional areas. The 7.0 percent growth in ordinary zaito programs compares with a 13.4 percent gain in fiscal 1993 and a 10.8 percent rise in fiscal 1992. But including 994.9 billion yen in fiscal investment newly secured under the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, the sum will total 40,142.8 billion yen for a growth of 10 percent. The extra budget to fund the government's record 15.25 trillion yen pump-priming package, released Tuesday, was adopted Thursday. Next year's zaito program should have maximum effects when combined with the extra zaito program for the current year, a ministry official told a press conference. The concept reflects the need to ensure continued budgetary implementation for 15 months from January 1994, he said. The official said the ministry set out an economy-boosting zaito program for the fourth consecutive year. It appropriated a 5.1 percent increase to 48,097.9 billion yen for overall zaito investment, or a sum including programs managed by the ministry's Trust Fund Bureau. The growth compares with a 12.2 percent gain in fiscal 1993. The draft for the fiscal investment and loan program, often called the second national budget, was shown to ministries and agencies concerned after getting the cabinet's approval Thursday afternoon. Of the housing-related budget, the ministry set aside 8,763.2 billion yen for the Housing Loan Corp., up 26.9 percent. Under this program the corporation would, for example, raise its basic lending amount for an individual home purchaser by 200,000 yen to 8 million yen. Housing investment for fiscal 1994 accounted for the highest-ever 33.4 percent of the total ordinary zaito program, eclipsing the preceding record rate of 32.6 percent in fiscal 1991. Loan programs for small companies include an 8.3 percent gain to 4,089 billion yen by the People's Finance Corp. and a 9.4 percent growth to 2,852.5 billion yen by the Japan Finance Corp. for small business. The ministry earmarks 156.0 billion yen in loans to manufacturers striving to launch new businesses under restructuring efforts, up 15.6 percent. The zaito program secured a lending quota of 620 billion yen for the Japan Development Bank for urban infrastructure improvement projects, up 9.9 percent, and a quota of 277 billion yen for the same bank for information and telecommunications infrastructure, up 20.4 percent. Outlays of 6.5 trillion yen for local public organizations, up 14.0 percent, are intended to upgrade sewerage, disposal and health facilities. The ministry increased by 26.0 percent to 325 billion yen the allocation for lending by the Export-Import Bank of Japan as a way to expand Japan's exports of manufactured goods. The official said fiscal investment and loan programs for livelihood, culture and small business-related areas represented a record 72.9 percent of the total ordinary zaito program, up from last year's 68.8 percent and the previous high of 71.4 percent in fiscal 1991. The zaito program does not include stock investment under new "shiteitan" accounts, a portfolio with no investment limits on stocks, the official said. New shiteitans were created in 1992 as a means of spurring the sluggish stock market. Whether or not new shiteitan will be financed in the fiscal 1994 zaito has yet to be decided, the official said. The draft is scheduled to be formalized by the government next Tuesday after negotiations between the Finance Ministry and other ministries and agencies seeking restoration of budget allocations the ministry deleted from their original requests.
