Kinkel told the Cologne newspaper EXPRESS (Friday [4 February] edition) that he recognized the financial difficulties and the concerns of Defense Minister Volker Ruehe. However, in his view it is "imperative to maintain" a troop strength of 370,000 men. If the Bundeswehr is reduced any further, it would be difficult, sooner or later, to meet the constitutional obligation to meet defense requirements, he explained. "We must establish what sort of troop strength we need for which tasks, and then money can be discussed. It should not be the other way round, under the motto `How much money do we have, and how many soldiers can we afford on that.'" Regarding plans by the defense minister not to take part in any more international UN missions on cost grounds, Kinkel said that if the United Nations should ask the German Government to participate in another mission such as Somalia this year, "we cannot say no from the start on cost grounds." Such a request must be thoroughly considered on an individual basis and in the light of the constitutional situation and all the circumstances involved.
