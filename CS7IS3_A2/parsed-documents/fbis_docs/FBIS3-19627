Pangalos also warned that the possible election of an extreme right coalition in Italy, which would be neofascistic, could cause a big political problem for Europe. Despite the fact that Pangalos chaired the successful negotiations for the accession of four new members to the European Union, he stressed: Now that this is over, now that I have done my duty, I honestly want to say that this decision was a mistake. [Begin recording] [Pangalos] I want to say that the decision on the expansion of the European Union was wrong and premature. The European Union should not have proceeded to assume new responsibilities before the EU's structure was deepened, before we made substantial institutional and economic changes, and before we finished implementing the Maastricht Treaty.
