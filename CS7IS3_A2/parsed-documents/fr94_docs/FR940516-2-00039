FR940516-2-00039 FR940516-2-00033 Office of Energy Research Energy Research Financial Assistance Program Notice 94&hyph;17; Medical Applications Program AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice inviting grant applications. SUMMARY: The Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER) of the Office of Energy Research (ER), U.S. Department of Energy, announces its interest in receiving applications to support one specific research area, Receptor-Targeted Cancer Imaging and Therapy with Genetically Modified Radiolabeled Probes, within the Medical Applications Program. The research applications should address the use of antibody-based molecular strategies to develop new radiolabeled molecules which will significantly advance the current state of tumor imaging and therapy for potential human use. Appropriate consideration should be given to receptor mediated localization and stability of the administered molecular form in vivo, its rate of clearance, selective delivery to the target in high yield with target-binding affinity, and specificity and selectivity for effective imaging and killing of cancer micrometastases. A well integrated multi-disciplinary team effort combining the areas of radiopharmaceutical chemistry, molecular immunology, and oncologic nuclear medicine to achieve the projected goals will be important. DATES: Formal applications submitted in response to this Notice must be received 4:30 p.m., EDT, September 15, 1994, to be accepted for a merit review in November 1994, and to permit timely consideration for award in Fiscal Year 1995. ADDRESSES: Formal applications referencing Program Notice 94&hyph;17 should be forwarded to: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Research, Acquisition and Assistance Management Division, ER&hyph;64 (GTN), Washington, DC 20585, Attn: Program Notice 94&hyph;17. The following address must be used when submitting applications by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail, any commercial mail delivery service, or when hand carried by the applicant: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Research, Acquisition and Assistance Management Division, ER&hyph;64, 19901 Germantown Road, Germantown, Maryland 20874. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Prem C. Srivastava, Office of Health and Environmental Research, ER&hyph;73, U.S. Department of Energy, GTN, Washington, D.C. 20585, telephone: (301) 903&hyph;4071. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Potential applicants are strongly encouraged to submit a brief preapplication in accordance with 10 CFR 600.10 (d)(2), which consists of two or three pages of narrative describing the research project objectives and methods of accomplishment. These will be reviewed relative to the scope and research objectives of the Medical Applications Program. Preapplications referencing Program Notice 94&hyph;17 should be received by June 15, 1994, and sent to Dr. Prem C. Srivastava, Office of Health and Environmental Research, ER&hyph;73, Department of Energy, GTN, Washington, DC 20585, FAX: (301) 903&hyph;0567. Telephone and FAX numbers are required to be part of the preapplication. A response to the preapplications discussing the program relevance of a formal application will be communicated by July 15, 1994. It is anticipated that approximately $3 million will be available for grant awards during FY 1995 contingent upon availability of appropriated funds. Previous awards have ranged from $100,000 per year up to $400,000 per year with terms lasting up to 3 years. Similar award sizes are anticipated for new grants. Funding of multiple year new grant awards is expected, and is also contingent upon availability of funds. Information about development and submission of applications, eligibility limitations, evaluation and selection process, and other policies and procedures may be found in the Application Guide for the Office of Energy Research Financial Assistance Program and 10 CFR part 605. The Application Guide is available from the Office of Health and Environmental Research, ER&hyph;73, U.S. Department of Energy, (GTN), Washington, DC 20585. Telephone requests may be made by calling (301) 903&hyph;5349. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number of this program is 81.049. D.D.
