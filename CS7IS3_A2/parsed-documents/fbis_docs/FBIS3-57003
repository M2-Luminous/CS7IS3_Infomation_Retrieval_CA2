It is said in the appeal, in particular, that in the time that has passed (since gaining autonomy) the course taken toward the Crimea gradually attaining statehood has proved to be right. "With the interests of all the peoples populating the Crimea taken into consideration, a possibility for the Crimea to become a bridge uniting Russia and Ukraine, with and peace and civic accord on the peninsula preserved and not undermined, the will of the Crimeans, has been realized. Recreating the republic, adopting its own constitution, delimiting powers between itself and Ukraine, and signing economic agreements are all difficult but necessary means of creating preconditions for the Crimea to be economically independent. The elections of the president and Supreme Council of the Crimea will complete this rather short but important stage in the history of the Crimea. The future destiny of the republic is in the hands of the Crimeans themselves," the statement notes.
