An IAEA spokesman said so on 15 February: This is good news. The news has been awaited since last March when Pyongyang declared its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and refused international inspections on North Korean nuclear facilities. I recall that such measures proclaimed by Pyongyang had an effect of a suddenly exploded bomb. Many capitals, particularly in Asia-Pacific countries, expressed worry over the measures. This was because, eventually, nuclear weapons would keep proliferating in the world. The DPRK was, and is still suspected to have developed nuclear bombs. Such suspicion has been strengthened after Pyongyang took the step. The IAEA applied pressure on North Korea with a view to resuming nuclear inspection. A sound way of thinking was superior in Pyongyang. The inspection will begin after two or three weeks. It is clear that the decision of the DPRK leadership will exert affirmative influence on the situation on the Korean peninsula and in its surrounding areas. First of all, it will open a road for North-South dialogue. In addition, the decision will bring about a possibility of proceeding talks between North Korea and the United States and between North Korea and Japan for normalization of relations. Most importantly, people hope that the result of inspection will remove the suspicion on the intent of the DPRK to develop its own nuclear weapons. Washington and Seoul have already expressed their support for Pyongyang's agreement on IAEA's nuclear inspection. Pyongyang's agreement will also arouse a similar reaction from the entire world.
