The [word indistinct] clique in collaboration with some members of the military leadership have continued to deceive and misguide the Army into fighting a suicidal war and committing atrocities against innocent civilians. The clique has time and again carried out propaganda that the Army should fight to the last man. The clique is using the Army to protect themselves from the consequences of the atrocities they have committed. This propaganda has been carried out notably by some privileged officers and men as a result of discrimination. These are responsible for atrocities. They have, for example, continued to tell lies that the government Army is winning the war when you know the reality because you are the ones who are fighting. Soldiers should not be fooled. They should use their intelligence to see that they have had many defeats and should not allow themselves to be finished for the sake of the clique. 2. The Rwandan Patriotic Army is aware that there are some good elements in the government forces who have continued to be misled and misused. It is for this reason that we call upon all the good elements to reject being used and fighting desperate wars. 3. The Rwandan Patriotic Army calls upon the good elements within the government forces to dissociate themselves from the clique and find ways of joining the Rwandan Patriotic Army. 4. The Rwandan Patriotic Army receives anybody who chooses to defect or desert the group of criminals. The propaganda by the clique that we kill those who cross to our side or that we kill prisoners of war is absolutely false and is aimed at discouraging you from isolating the criminals. We already have members of the government Army who have defected to our side and prisoners who have later chosen to join hands with us. The interviews of these people will pass over Radio Muhabura. Those of you who may not be convinced by this assurance can send a few people to the areas we control. 5. Political party youthwingers who have been compelled to join hands with the notorious Interahamwe [militias] for fear of losing their lives should denounce this association and find ways of going to safe areas. Finally, all those who may wish to cross over to our side are assured that they will be safe.
