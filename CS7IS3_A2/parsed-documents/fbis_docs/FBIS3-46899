NODONG SINMUN today, commenting on that, says: The South Korean warlikers incited confrontation and war from the beginning of the year because they intend to continue to seek confrontation, not national unity and reconciliation, and make more vicious military adventures against the North on the ground and the sea and in the sky this year. The news analyst goes on: It is ill-boding that the puppet military bosses of South Korea dared let out bellicose outcries from the beginning of the year. What draws particular attention is that the South Korean puppets cried for "maintenance of firm relations of military cooperation" with the United States and "effective operation of the quick deployment deterrent force." Thus, they revealed their intention to commit more undisguised criminal acts against fellow countrymen this year in collusion with outside forces. The traitorous nature of Kim Yong-sam hell-bent on doing harm to fellow countrymen in conspiracy with outside forces far from working for reunification through national reconciliation and unity has been brought to light from the beginning of the year. If the puppets persist in confrontation and war like a puppy knowing no fear of a tiger, they will get nothing good.
