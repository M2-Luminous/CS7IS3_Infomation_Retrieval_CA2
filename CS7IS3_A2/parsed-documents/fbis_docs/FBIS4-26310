This will be the first time the UNC research panel has met since the March 31 Qiandao lake travel disaster in Mainland China, in which 24 Taiwan tourists were murdered, said Raymond Tai, deputy secretary-general to the president. "We hope all UNC researchers will pool their wisdom to work out ways to boost cross-strait mutual trust and rapprochement," Tai, himself a UNC member, told a regular presidential news conference. The UNC is an advisory body under the presidential office that helps formulate the country's policy and blueprint for China's unification. After more than four decades of separation, Tai said, Taiwan and the mainland lack mutual understanding and trust even though bilateral civilian exchanges have increased in recent years. As a result, he said, cross-strait relations have been full of suspicions and misunderstandings, which resulted in bilateral ties coming to an abrupt halt in the aftermath of the Qiandao lake tragedy. Tai said President Li declared in his new year's message that 1994 will be the year for Taiwan and the mainland to forge mutual understanding and trust to pave the way for future cross-strait cooperation. "We hope mainland authorities will make a goodwill response to Li's call for the well-being of all Chinese people," Tai said, adding that maintaining steady, peaceful relations is in the interest of both sides. He also said Li is concerned about the recent floods in southern China and has ordered relevant government agencies to study ways of getting relief aid to the victims there. Tai refused comment on a wave of sharp personal attacks on Li launched by the mainland media in recent days, saying the presidential office would not respond to such criticism. The diplomat-turned spokesman said the Republic of China [ROC] has never changed its ultimate national goal of promoting China's reunification. While seeking to expand its diplomatic frontiers, Tai said, the ROC will continue to forge good will and rapprochement with the mainland. The ROC has unveiled the national unification guidelines to promote the "phased" development of cross-strait ties and eventual national unification, Tai noted.
