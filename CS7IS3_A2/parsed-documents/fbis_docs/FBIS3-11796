He gave assurances that the electoral process will continue under the guiding principles of legality, impartiality, security, and objectivity. This important statement to the news media, especially after the tragic events we have experienced, means that the people who are in charge of domestic policy are ensuring stability and that the conditions are given to continue the electoral process leading up to the election of the Republic's next president and congress. Dr. Carpizo urged the political parties to assume the pledge the moment demands. He said that according to the law problems should not lead to undesirable confrontations, the results of which affect everyone. Differences should be settled through dialogue and reason and within the framework of the law. Dr. Carpizo explained that the Mexican people are opposed to impunity and are demanding justice and security. [Begin Carpizo recording] Let us close a tragic page of our history and cling to the hope of a better fatherland, one that is firm in its convictions and zealous about its pledge of loyalty to the most noble human ideals. The time has come to prove that Mexico's values are firm, that it possesses the necessary maturity to function cohesively and with absolute respect for the law, and that it can behave in a manner that is consistent with its convictions concerning the preservation of peace and the democratic institutions that guarantee our social coexistence. All of this, of course, within the de jure state that governs us. [end recording] Mexico, Dr. Carpizo added, is a strong country and will unquestionably emerge from this tragedy as a stronger country. I also spoke with Federal District Attorney General Diego Valades, who held a private meeting with Government Secretary Carpizo. During an interview this afternoon, Valades told us that the authorities will take all the time that is necessary to resolve Colosio's assassination. He added that there is no threat of instability in Mexico. [Begin Valades recording] The country is lining up and ought to line up behind a progressive awareness of unity. Moreover, and this is very important, we Mexicans should have confidence in ourselves. The tragic and regrettable events you referred to have certainly been a source of worry for the community, but we Mexicans should not lose our self-esteem. That would be the worst thing for us to lose. [end recording] Valades concluded that at 1700 this afternoon the Attorney General's Office will release a statement on the progress that has been made in the investigation of the assassination.
