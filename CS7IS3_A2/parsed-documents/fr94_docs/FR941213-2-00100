FR941213-2-00100 FR941213-2-00061 b. The Field Office must determine that there is a need and a market for the proposed household type and bedroom sizes, taking into consideration the documentation submitted by the PHA on housing supply and demonstration of need, any local plans, and other assisted housing (e.g., HUD or FmHA) existing and proposed (including housing funded but not completed). D. Threshold Approvable Applications Applications in categories 1, 2, and 3 will be determined approvable if they successfully pass the threshold review. Threshold-approvable applications in category 4 (``other'') will be reviewed and analyzed by the Field Office. E. ``Other'' Development Applications Threshold approvable ``Other'' applications will have points assigned by a Rating Panel(s) on the basis of Field Office analysis and PHA documentation relating to the following criteria. ‚ê£ 1Criteria 1Points 1. Relative Need. The application proposes a project for a locality which has been previously under-funded for the household type (family or elderly) requested, relative to the need for housing for the same household type in the respective metropolitan or non-metropolitan portion of the Field Office's jurisdiction. [Select (a), (b) or (c)]: (a) Housing need in the locality specified in the application has been severely under-funded. (A locality with a percentage of need served that is equal to or less than one-half the Field Office percentage will be determined to be severely under-funded.); or 20 (b) Housing need in the locality specified in the application has received a proportionate share of funding or has been moderately under-funded. (A locality with a percentage of need served that is equal to or less than the Field Office percentage, but greater than one-half that percentage will be determined to be moderately under-funded.); or 10 (c) Housing need in the locality specified in the application has been over-funded. (A locality with a percentage that is greater than the Field Office percentage will be determined to have been over-funded.) 0 2. Vacancy Rate. [Select (a) or (b)]: (a) The vacancy rate in public housing projects under management is not greater than 5 percent, indicating that the PHA will and can fully utilize the units for which it applied; or 20 (b) The vacancy rate in public housing projects under management is greater than 5 percent but less than 6 percent (or two units if that is greater) 10 3.

The application proposes scattered site development to expand housing opportunities 10 6. PHA Development Experience. 1 [Select (a), (b), or (c)]: (a) The PHA scored at least 90 percent (``A'') in Indicator 12 (Development) of PHMAP; or 20 (b) The PHA's latest PHMAP score for Indicator 12 (Development) is between 80 and 89 percent; or the Field Office has no information on the PHA's previous development experience to rate the PHA under paragraph (a) above; however, the application demonstrates the capability for, and the expectation of, expeditious quality or other development experience, or submitted a development management contract with an experienced PHA); or 15 (c) The PHA's latest PHMAP score for Indicator 12 (Development) is between 60 and 79 percent; or the PHA has no development experience under either paragraph (1) or (2) above, but the PHA has evidenced staff capability and organization that demonstrates the PHA has the capability for, and the expectation of, expeditious quality development or has submitted a proposed development management contract 5 7. PHA Management Experience. 2 [Select (a), (b), or (c)]: (a) The PHA's latest PHMAP score (excluding development) is 90 percent or better; and there were no Inspector General audit findings during the PHA's last fiscal audit; and there are no outstanding HUD monitoring findings; or 20 (b) The PHA's latest PHMAP score (excluding development) is between 80 and 89; and Inspector General audit findings (if any) have been addressed; and outstanding HUD monitoring findings have been resolved; or 10 (c) Choose (1) or (2): (1) The PHA's latest PHMAP score (excluding development) is between 60 and 79; and Inspector General audit findings (if any) have been addressed; and outstanding HUD monitoring findings have been resolved; or 5 (2) The PHA has no public housing in management, but has management experience in the section 8 program and management reviews or Inspector General audit findings (if any) are being addressed satisfactorily 5 8.

F. Field Office Reports 1. Category 1, 2, and 3 Applications Each Field Office shall forward its lists (by category) of fair-share exempt threshold-approvable applications to Headquarters within two weeks of the deficiency ``cure'' period. The lists shall include the project number, total number of units and units by bedroom size, structure type(s), cost areas, funding required and the metropolitan/non-metropolitan designations for each application. Category 1 and 2 applications shall also identify the underlying project and its current status (e.g., approved (date), under review in Field Office, etc.). 2. Category 4 All Field Office reports to Rating Panels on threshold-approvable ``other'' applications shall be submitted within four weeks of the deficiency ``cure'' period and include the information described in F.1., above, the analysis of each application, and Field Office recommendations for funding. V. Rating Panels A. Rating Panels 1. General The Rating Panel(s) shall ensure that all category 4 applications have been properly determined to be threshold-approvable. The Rating Panel(s) shall compile data furnished by Field Offices for category 4 (other) applications, and rate each application based on Field Office analyses, comments, and recommendations. A list of rated applications shall be forwarded to Headquarters, with copies of Field Office reviews and recommendations, and justifications for Rating Panel rankings. Headquarters shall not modify ratings of category 4 (``other'') applications unless a gross error has occurred. Examples of ``gross errors'' include, but are not limited to, errors in calculating the vacancy rate in the proposed community, or assigning points for development/management experience based on a PHMAP score that was successfully appealed, or simple errors of arithmetic.
