Background This document contains final Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 1398 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). On November 9, 1992, the IRS published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking designating passive activity losses and credits under section 469 and unused section 465 losses as attributes that pass from the debtor to the bankruptcy estate under section 1398(g) of the Code and that, upon termination of the estate, pass from the bankruptcy estate to the debtor under section 1398(i). Corrections to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking were published in the Federal Register on December 22, 1992 (57 FR 246). A public hearing was held on January 25, 1993. After consideration of the public comments regarding the proposed regulations, the final regulations adopt the rules contained in the proposed regulations without substantive change. A discussion of the public comments is set forth below. Public Comments The comments received by the IRS were generally favorable, welcoming the designation of attributes under section 1398(g)(8). Several commentators suggested that the regulations be modified. These suggestions are discussed below. I. Expansion of the Proposed Regulations to Include Additional Attributes The proposed regulations designate passive activity losses and credits under section 469 and losses under section 465 as attributes that pass from the debtor to the estate. Several commentators suggested that the scope of the proposed regulations be expanded to include additional attributes of the debtor, either by specifically listing the additional attributes or by providing that attributes of the debtor pass to the estate if they are related to property passing to the estate or are in the nature of a carryforward. These suggestions were not adopted in the final regulations. The treatment of other unenumerated attributes under section 1398 (g) and (i) is more appropriately provided in a separate regulation project. This would provide taxpayers with an opportunity to comment before additional attributes of the debtor are designated, by final regulation, as attributes that pass to the estate.
