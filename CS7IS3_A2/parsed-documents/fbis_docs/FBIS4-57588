In remarks to PRENSA LATINA, Alarcon said that in view of this reality, the Ibero-American countries, the presidents of which will meet in the Colombian town of Cartagena de Indias in June 1994, will have to make a clear commitment to strengthen such an integrationist movement. Alarcon added that if a specific program of Latin American and Caribbean integration is achieved, and if progress is achieved toward that objective, those invited will go to the Miami conference with the assurance of being a strong group in an unprecedented case of Ibero-American relationship. Alarcon added that the fourth Ibero-American summit will become a moment of reaffirmation and consolidation of the movement it represents. He also referred to the Cuban exclusion from the invitations extended by the United States for the Miami summit, and called it an attempt to return international reality to the situation that prevailed 20 years ago. Alarcon will leave tomorrow, 21 May, for London to comply with an official invitation extended by the two chambers of the British Parliament. He will stay one week in the UK.
