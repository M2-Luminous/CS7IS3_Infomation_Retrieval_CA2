Yohei Kono, president of the No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party, accused Hata of trying to please everybody by avoiding specific statements on "urgent" controversial issues. Kono told reporters Hata "stopped short of commenting on how to grapple with problems that require urgent responses under the current extraordinary situation." Tomiichi Murayama, head of the second largest opposition Social Democratic Party, told reporters Hata should have offered a more explicit explanation on "a statement by his cabinet minister on collective security arrangements." "The public has come to question the stand of this administration in the wake of a statement by a cabinet minister on collective security rights," Murayama said. He was apparently referring to a recent statement by Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa that Japan should rethink its current constitutional interpretation, taken as banning collective security arrangements, to allow Japan the right to join an offensive if an ally were attacked. Japanese Communist Party Presidium Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa told reporters that Hata's expression of the government's readiness to respond to a contingency on the Korean peninsula in concert with the United States and South Korea was "a dangerous declaration." New party Sakigake [Harbinger] leader Masayoshi Takemura said, "Although he emphasized the pacifist nature of the Constitution, it does not correspond with arguments by his cabinet ministers about the need to enact laws to deal with military contingencies or collective security rights."
