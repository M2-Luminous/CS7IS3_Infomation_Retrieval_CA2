The period from 1978 to 1984 was one of high speed growth during which peasant net income increased from 115.9 yuan to 298.71 yuan a year in a 157.7 percent increase, or 17.1 percent per year. The period from 1985 to 1988 was one of low speed growth in which peasant net income increased from 298.71 to 480.22 yuan per year in a 60.8 percent increase, or 12.6 percent per year. The period from 1989 to 1992 was one of slow growth during which peasant net income increased from 480.22 yuan to 618.72 yuan per year in a 28.8 percent, or 6.5 percent per year. Despite the sustained increase in total peasant income during these three periods, the speed of income increase slowed markedly. This was particularly true for the period 1989 to 1992 when, after deducting for price increases, real income fell 2.9, 0.7, and 1.7 percent respectively. A series of bad effects chain reactions ensued, the first of which was a widening of the gap between peasant income elsewhere in the country. In 1980, the gap between peasant net income in Ningxia and peasant net income nationally was only 16.23 yuan. In 1990, it was 60 yuan; in 1991, it was 100.50 yuan; and in 1992, it widened to 165 yuan, Ningxia's income ranking falling from eighteenth place in the country in 1990 to twenty-third place in 1992. The second effect was a widening the gap between city and countryside. In 1978 the gap between the region's average per capita peasant net income and city and town residents' income spent on living expenses was 1 to 2.78. This narrowed to 1 to 2.04 in 1988, but widened to 1 to 2.5 in 1992. Third was an increase in the number of low income needy families. In 1992, 21 percent of rural households in the region had an income of less than 300 yuan; and 9.4 percent had an income of less than 200 yuan. Of the households having an income of less than 300 yuan, 47 percent were in mountain regions, and of the households having an income of less than 200 yuan, 22 percent were in mountain regions. This was a 9 and 6 percentage point increase over 1991. Fourth was a decline in income from production and sales. In 1990, investment in fixed assets used for production declined 21 percent, peasant per capita spending for the purchase of fixed assets used in production declining from 61.70 to 48.40 yuan. Fifth was slow increase in total rural commodity retail sales. Between 1990 and 1992, the annual increase in total rural commodity retail sales fell from 16.5 to 6 percent in a 10 percentage point decline. Between 1989 and 1991, peasant real consumption fell about 50 yuan. The deep-seated reasons for the decline in the speed of peasant income growth in the region since 1989 are primarily as follows: 1. Failure To Eliminate Longstanding Notions That Emphasize Grain Output Rather Than Cash Income. Frequently, rural areas are judged in terms of their grain production, and rural work is judged in terms of whether grain production has increased, so much so that slight fluctuations in grain production greatly intensify the chain reaction of fluctuations in peasant income. The guiding thought in rural work emphasizes increase in agricultural product output and supply to the neglect of increase in peasant income. Up until 1978, the demand for farm products greatly exceeded supply. Farm products were in short supply, so the development of production to increase supplies and fill the markets became the focus of rural work. Since 1988, farm product production and supply largely satisfy needs, but the guiding thought has not been promptly readjusted. As before, it departs from the goal of increase peasant income. This is a subjective reflection of the decline in the speed of increase in peasant income. 2. National Economic Development Policies Do Not Favor Agriculture Sufficiently. Investment in agriculture has declined, infrastructure has aged, and reproduction capacity has become weak. The distribution of social benefits favors industry and the cities, and sacrifices the interests of agriculture and the peasants. The long emphasis only on applying agricultural accumulations to the development of industry ignores the role of industry suckling agriculture in turn. Despite several readjusts of agricultural product prices, the price scissors between industrial and farm products tends to widen, the peasants suffering a serious loss of benefit. Up until 1988, agricultural and sideline product procurement prices rose faster than prices of the means of agricultural production, so the price scissors narrowed and peasants gained real benefit. In 1988, the overall agricultural and sideline product procurement price level rose 1.75 times over 1978 in an average annual 10.6 percent increase. Meanwhile, during the same period prices of the agricultural means of production rose 50.2 percent over 1978 in an average 4.2 percent annual rise, which was 6.4 percentage points lower than the agricultural and sideline products procurement price. Peasants benefitted to the tune of 150.70 yuan, which was 41.4 percent of the increase in net peasant income for the same period. Since 1989, the rise in prices of rural industrial goods has exceeded the rise in prices paid for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. Between 1988 and 1991, the price scissors between industrial and agricultural goods widened 31.5 percent in an average annual 7.9 percent increase, the peasant gaining little but losing much. Comparison of 1992 with 1988 shows a peasant per capita loss of 124.95 yuan as a result of the rise in prices of agricultural means of production. This is 90.2 percent of the 138.50 yuan increase in peasant per capital net income for the same period. In addition, because of the restraints of the traditional planned economy, development of the rural economy did not follow the path of the market economy. It emphasized production and slighted commodity circulation. Markets did not develop in a sound manner, channels for the circulation of agricultural products did not work well, and difficulties buying alternated with difficulties selling, large quantities of agricultural products piling up in inventory, the increase in peasant income suffering as a result. 3. Irrational Rural Economic Structure. With the advent of rural reform, the structure of rural industry has gradually changed from the heavily weighted emphasis on primary industry, on farming within the primary industry, and on grain production in farming to the joint development of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, farming, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and the fishing industry. These changes in the rural industrial structure have changed the sources of peasant income, and increased peasant income. Peasant family net income from the primary industry declined from 83.2 percent in 1983 to 78.1 percent in 1988. The percentage derived from farming, the primary source of income within the primary industry, fell from 79.8 to 72.6, while peasant net income from forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and the fishing industry rose from 20.2 to 27.4 percent. Peasant net income rose from 175.10 yuan in 1980 to 480.22 yuan in 1988. This included 91.69 yuan more from secondary and tertiary industries, which was 30 percent of the total, and 53 yuan more from forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and the fishing industry, which was 25.7 percent of the total. Since 1989, rural tertiary industries have had hard going. Rural industry restructuring languished. Between 1989 and 1992, output value of rural primary, secondary, and tertiary industries stood still at around 68, 22, and 10 percent respectively, and the output value of farming, forestry, and animal husbandry stood at 70, 5, and 22 percent respectively. Peasant family net income secondary and tertiary industries, and from forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishing declined. At the same time, growth of the primary industry and farming slowed markedly. Between 1989 and 1992, net income from the primary industry and farming increased 2.3 and -2 percent, an increase far lower than the 16.5 and 46.5 percent of the period 1985 to 1988. Since readjustment of the peasants' industrial structure was in limbo, problems in increasing peasant income became greater and greater causing a steady year-by-year decline in peasant income. 4. Irrational Peasant Employment Structure. Since the advent of rural reform, the development of rural non-agricultural industries has enabled a large amount of surplus rural manpower to move out of agriculture into non-agricultural pursuits. Consequently, the structure of rural employment has entered a new stage. Changes in the make-up of peasant employment have widened the sources of peasant income. The peasants have moved from dependence on the distribution of income from agriculture to dependence on distributions of income from both agricultural and non-agricultural pursuits, which has increased their income. Between 1978 and 1988, peasant income derived from non-agricultural production increased from 2.08 to 95.69 yuan in a 45-fold increase. This was an average annual 46.6 percent increase and accounted for 28.9 percent of the increase in peasant income from production. Thanks to the effects of state macroeconomic improvement of the economic environment and rectification of the economic order since 1989, large amounts of manpower have returned to farming. In 1990, manpower employed in non-agricultural pursuits fell five percentage points from the previous year. As a result of the return of manpower to agriculture, peasant income from production fell 4 and 7.2 percent respectively in 1989 and 1990 in comparison with the previous years, and the increase in income from non-agricultural pursuits slowed appreciably. Between 1989 and 1992, net income from non-agricultural pursuits increased by an average 14.6 percent per year, 32 percentage points lower than during the previous 10 years. Large amounts of manpower continue to linger in rural villages, restricting increase in peasant income. 5. Slow Development of Town and Town Enterprises. Since the beginning of rural reform, town and township enterprises have suddenly come to the fore to become a main integral part of the rural economy and the entire national economy as well. They have also become an important means for increasing peasant income. Peasant income obtained directly from town and township enterprises nationwide amounts to 193 yuan per capita, or 24.6 percent of annual per capita income. In Ningxia, it is 116 yuan, or 18.85 percent of annual peasant net income, 77 yuan less than the national figure. 6. Peasant Burdens Heavy. First of all, agricultural production costs have increased. During 1991 and 1992, 64 and 62 percent of the increase in peasant earnings in Ningxia was eaten up by increased costs. Second, taxes have increased. In 1992, peasant tax payments in Ningxia averaged 9.80 yuan per capita, a 6.7 and 13 percent increase respectively over 1990 and 1991, and higher than the increase in peasant net income for the same period. Third is an increase in collective withholdings. In 1992, withholdings averaged 15 yuan per capita, up 36.2 and 35.4 percent over 1990 and 1991. Like taxes, withholdings increased faster than peasant net income. Fourth is other unjustifiable burdens, which add to peasant burdens, causing a severe loss of peasant income. The whole point of rural reform and development during the 1990's has been to increase peasant income and to bring rural villages up to a comfortably well-off standard of living. Peasant income is the main indicator of a comfortably well-off rueral standard of living, the speed of its increase having a direct bearing on rural progress in achieving a comfortably well-off standard of living. Therefore, the guiding thought and approach in our work must take the goal of a comfortable well-off standard of living as the be all of rural work. We must make peasant income increase the key element in development of agriculture and the rural economy, truly changing away from the former sole pursuit of output and output value in agriculture and the rural economy to the improvement of benefits across the board, and increasing peasant income. The main reasons for posing the issue in these terms are as follows: First, increasing peasant income is essential to maintaining the unflagging interest of peasants in production. Following implementation of the family output related contract responsibility system in rural villages, both simple reproduction and the expansion of reproduction fell to peasant households. A substantial portion of peasant income for the previous year had to be applied to reproduction in the following year. If income does not increase or increased only slowly, the peasants' capacity for reproduction is bound to be weak. When agricultural inputs are inadequate, not only is current agricultural production impaired, but changes in agricultural production methods and progress in the modernization of agriculture will suffer too. If the peasants toil all year and the granaries are full but their pockets are empty, and there is no improvement in their clothing, food, and housing, maintenance of their interest in production will be difficult. Once agricultural production no longer enjoys the enthusiastic support of the peasants and begins to slide, the entire national economy loses its most fundamental sustenance. Second, increase in the effective supply of agricultural products, including increase in the total amount, improvement in the selection offered, and raising quality is a basic goal in the development of agriculture. Furthermore, attainment of this goal depends on how well the peasants are or are not rewarded. Nowadays peasants decide what they will grow on the basis of their expectation of the income to be made. If we resurrect the old methods of jacking up targets and issuing compulsory orders, matters may turn out differently that we expect. Unless the situation of increasing output only to recieve no or little increase in income is changed, stable agriculture also becomes an empty phrase. Third, the main mark of modern agriculture is improvement of the organic make-up and technical make-up of capital, reducing the amount of manpower and its contribution. This means that the peasants and the rural collective economy organization must possess substantial accumulated funds. Fourth, past thinking about the development of agriculture emphasized the role of peasants as a source of products, but neglected their role as a market. This is one of the reasons that the national economy has found it difficult to shake off the market slump. Rural villages are a vast market, and peasants are the largest customers for industrial goods. Changes in rural purchasing power have a direct bearing on the prosperity of industrial markets, which affects, in turn, the economic returns of industrial enterprises. Facts show that the market capacity of the urban population is not enough to support the sustained rapid growth of industry, but development of the rural market depends on increasing peasant income. Fifth, attainment of a comfortably well-off standard of living for the people of the whole country by the end of the present century is an important strategic goal in the development of China's economy. The key to realization of the comfortably well-off goal lies in rural villages, and the difficulty in attaining it also lies in the rural villages. Calculations show that peasant attainment of a comfortably well-off standard of living will require a per capita net income of 1,200 yuan (at constant 1990 prices). At this rate, per capita peasant net income in Ningxia will have to reach 1,000 yuan by 2000, i.e., an annual 6 percent rate of increase. This includes a per capita annual income of 1,300 in river valley areas, or an annual 8 percent increase, and a per capita annual income of 650 yuan in mountain regions, or an annual more than 6 percent increase. These are 1 percentage point higher than the speed of increase for the nation as a whole. Clearly, the use of every possible means to increase peasant income is an extremely daunting task that will brook no delay. Unless peasant net income in the Ningxia Autonomous Region can be increased substantially, the region will be unable to enter a comfortably well-off standard of living period along with the rest of the country. Sixth, peasant income is not just an economic issue but a political issue as well. It affects not only the overall development of the national economy, but also affects relations between industry and agriculture, between city and countryside, and between the Party and the peasantry, as well as the stability of society and the consolidation of socialist political authority in rural villages. The Party's and the government's repeated emphasis on various vigorous measures to solve the peasants' burdens problem has as it goal increasing peasant income. Agriculture is the region's greatest strength, and it is also the main source of peasant income. Talk about increasing peasant income other than through agriculture is unrealistic. Non-agricultural industries are also an effective way to increase peasant income, and talk about increasing peasant income without non-agricultural industries is likewise impossible. Although non-agricultural industries have developed slowly in Ningxia, they show tremendous development potential. Therefore, a policy of emphasis on both agriculture and non-agricultural industries must be part of the guiding thought for increasing peasant income. Agriculture cannot be emphasized at the expense of non-agricultural industries, nor can non-agricultural industries be emphasized at the expense of agriculture. Coordinated development of both agriculture and non-agricultural industries should form the foundation for steady increase in peasant income. 1. Close Attention to the Peasant Income Problem, Making Increase in Peasant Income a Long-term Strategic Task. Increasing peasant income is a concerted expression of the Party's wealthy people policy, and it is the urgent desire of the broad masses of peasants. Once the food and clothing problems of the broad masses of people are solved, the income problem becomes the problem that concerns them most. The key to doing something about this rural economic task of increasing peasant income lies in doing something about the main contradiction between rural reform and development. The peasants wholeheartedly support the Party and the state's policy of reform and opening to the outside world because these policies enable them to obtain very many tangible benefits. CPC committees and government at all levels should do all possible to increase the peasants' income, truly making it the basic point of departure and point of return in rural work, make in a key task in future rural work, and correctly handle the relationship between development of the economy and increasing peasant's income, and between the peasant's immediate attainment of wealth and long-term economic development. They must proceed from local realities to draw up realistic plans and genuine measures, and carry them out one by one. Cadres at all levels must further change their thinking, get away from erroneous conceptions, eradicate the tendency to think that rural work means working on agriculture, and that agriculture means grain. In evaluating a place's work from now on, more must be looked at than just how much grain is harvested or how much output value increases. More attention must be paid to how much peasant income increases. Those in charge must fulfill the functions of their office, and administration means staying the course. In appraising achievements in an official career, it is important to look at whether the person has genuinely and sincerely guided the peasants in developing the economy, in increasing their income, and in being highly effective so that the peasants can gain a genuine sense of the advantages of the Party's wealthy peasant policy through the work of cadres at all levels. Only when they have such a work objective and guiding thought can cadres at all levels more wholeheartedly guide the peasants in becoming wealthy, and find more ways to riches. 2. Intensify Rural Reform; Persist in Using Reform To Spur Development; and Use Development To Spur Increased Income. The goal of China's economic system reform is establishment of a socialist market economy system. This means enabling the market to play a basic role in the allocation of resources under state macroeconomic regulation and control, economic activity thereby abiding by the laws of value, and adjusting to changes in supply and demand, so that the allocation of resources produces greater benefits. The setting of this goal places new requirements on, and poses new tasks for rural reform. After rural villages instituted the family output related contact responsibility system, although the peasants had relatively independent decision making authority, under the planned economic system, agricultural production continued to follow the former leadership methods in which growing areas were rigidly assigned, and even production methods were stringently set. The peasants lacked true decision making authority, and the increase in peasant income was severely limited. With the development of a rural socialist market economy system, the production orientation will change, production being conduction according to market demand. Whatever the market needs will be produced, and whatever is profitable will be produced. Unprofitable crops will not be grown. The market supply and demand situation and price fluctuations will be a reflection of this demand. Development of production on the basis of the market orientation will mean that both government and the people must make some fundamental changes. Government has to change its functions and leadership methods, become aware of, study, a nd thoroughly understand market signals in a timely fashion, and pay attention to regulating the market well. Using this as the orientation for economic activities, government must produce companion policies, and organize the peasants to produce to meet market demand. The peasants must orient toward the market instead of toward the government, and change from reliance on the government to reliance on market demand in reaching their own decisions. In this way, the peasants can effectively increase their income according to the laws of market economy activity. In addition, a market economy is an economic form that encompasses both cities and the countryside, and the entire national economy. It cannot be built solely on the rural villages. It must knit together and dovetail every aspect of cities and the entire national economy. This means that the dual system of city and countryside separation must be demolished and barriers between cities and the countryside eliminated, the existing household registration control system that separates cities and the countryside reformed, the peasants encouraged to play a part in commodity circulation in the cities, and take part in the building of cities, thereby changing and building a new relationship between the cities and the countries. This will provide the peasants more space to exercise their talents and increase their income. It will actively guide a greater flow of the elements of production from cities to rural villages, thereby increasing rural vitality and strength for the development of productivity. The area thus affected is very broad. One important such area is the complete opening up of the urban labor market to allow surplus rural labor to flow into the industries and positions in cities that need manpower. At the same time, it will actively organize an exchange of manpower with economically developed areas, and gradually open up the international labor market. 3. Active Readjustment of the Make-up of Rural Industry To Develop High Yield, Premium Quality, High Returns Agriculture. As orientation toward the market increases, farm product prices are further decontrolled, and the clash between a steadily growing population and a gradually diminishing amount of cultivated land becomes worse and worse, accumulating the large amounts of money required for investment in agriculture by increasing income from limited cultivated land will be impossible. Prospects of increasing peasant income by increasing grain procurement are also becoming dimmer and dimmer. Likewise, controlling prices of the agricultural means of production cannot solve the problem fundamentally, and the national treasury will be unable to bar the burden of continued fiscal subsidies. Low return agriculture is already far from being able to meet peasant income growth needs. Therefore, no time should be lost in setting about the vigorous readjustment of the rural industrial structure. Development of high yield, premium quality, high return agriculture is bound to become the inevitable choice to improve overall returns from agriculture and increase peasant income. The development of high yield, premium quality, high returns agriculture is the basic future trend of development of China's agriculture, and it is also an important way for the peasants to become wealthy and begin a comfortably well-off standard of living during the 1990's. It marks the entry of China's agriculture into a new historical stage. This stage is characterized by, first, a change in China's agriculture from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture. Modern agriculture requires not only high yields, but premium quality and high returns as well. This is what distinguishes it fundamentally from traditional agriculture. Second is the transformation of China's rural economy from a semi-self sufficient to a commodity economy, and a commodity economy is market oriented. It takes not only quantity but quality to achieve dominance in markets. Only quality products can compete, gain a market share, and produce returns. Finally, the standard of living of China's people is changing from subsistence to comfortably well-off. One extremely important mark of this change from subsistence to comfortably well off is substantial improvement and rise in the people's food, clothing, housing, and travel. All these are related to agriculture; every one of them is related to the rise in the quality of agricultural products. These features of the era mean that high yield, premium quality, high return agriculture must abide by both natural laws and market laws. Advanced technology and scientific methods must be employed, labor-intensive and technology-intensive production are needed, and natural and social resources must be developed and used in multiple ways, all production elements combined in an optimum way to the maximum extent possible for greater per unit yields, premium product quality, and high overall returns that yield economic, social, and ecological benefits. Developing a high-yield, premium quality, and high benefit agriculture requires expansion of the growing area for cash crops, livestock feed crops, melons, fruits, and vegetables in the internal make-up of agriculture while ensuring steady increase in grain production at the same time. Development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline products, fishing industry, and agricultural and sideline processing industries must be accelerated as part of the readjustment of the rural economic structure to lengthen the agricultural production chain and widen the agricultural production realm. Only a rational and effective restructuring can make the rural economy expand from the farming industry to processing industries, from the production realm into the commodity circulation realm, from undertakings that yield small returns to those that yield large returns, and from labor-intensive to technology-intensive industries, thereby gradually following a course of high yield, premium quality, and high return development. 4. All-out Development of Town and Township Enterprises To Open Many Avenues for Rural Employment. The trend of future rural economic development suggests a gradual decline in the primary industry portion of the rural industrial structure, and a gradual in the tertiary and secondary industries portion; a gradual decline in amount of manpower employed in agriculture, and a gradual rise in the amount of manpower employed in non-agricultural pursuits, particularly in town and township industries; and a gradual decline in the rate of increase in peasant income coming from agriculture, and a gradual rise in the rate of increase in peasant income coming from other than agriculture. As the most active growth point in rural economic development today, town and township enterprises have become a major source of peasant income. Over the long term, town and township enterprises offer potential for increasing peasant income in the Ningxia Autonomous Region, town and township enterprises also offer hope. Take a firm grip on the key that town and township enterprises are means having a firm grip on the key to increasing peasant income. The main difference between rural economic development in Ningxia and coastal area lies in the difference between town and township enterprises. The gap between peasant prosperity is manifested mostly in the level of development of town and township enterprises. Therefore, we must make all-out development of town and township enterprises a strategic emphasis for development of the rural economy and the entire national economy as well. We must regard it as the key to increasing peasant income. Adherence to a guiding policy of multiple wheel drives, multiple track operations, highlighting strengths, rational dispersal, step-by-step advance, and all-out development, no matter the form of ownership and no matter the form of operation, so long as it increases peasant income, and some long as it increases local economic strength, everything should be done to encourage development and to provide active support. Development of town and township enterprises requires suiting general methods to specific circumstances, and providing tailored guidance. In the relatively economically backward southern mountain region, a beginning should be made with the processing of agricultural and sideline products, and rational use of resources, needed support provided to quicken the pace of development in a planned way. In the irrigated areas in which water is diverted from the Huang He where economic conditions are relatively good, particularly in places where the town and township enterprise base is relatively good, the starting point should be somewhat high. Efforts should be made to bring about a gradual change from labor-intensive to capital-intensive and technology-intensive industries, steadily improving product quality and returns. Rural market towns and small cities are the main places from which agricultural, sideline, and local specialty products enter cities, and from which industrial wares enter the countryside. They support rural secondary and tertiary industries. We must hasten the building of rural market towns and small cities and towns, encourage the peasants to go into cities and towns to operate secondary and tertiary industries, and we must draw up corresponding favorable policies to increase the intensity of efforts in this regard. In this way, we can enable small cities and towns to play a turnkey role in the development of rural secondary and tertiary industries for the opening of peasant employment avenues that increase peasant income. In addition, we must channel surplus rural manpower to shift into cities and towns and to flow across jurisdictional lines. We must both encourage peasants to enter market towns and small cities, and also permit the peasants to enter large and medium-size cities under certain conditions so that they can engage in secondary and tertiary industries more securely, and have more secure employment channels. 5. Vigorous Fostering of Rural Markets To Guide the Smooth Entry of the Peasants Into the Commodity Circulation Realm. With the founding of the socialist market economy system, the extent of peasant reliance on markets is bound to become greater and greater, and peasants must enter the circulation realm if they are to increase their income. However, in Ningxia, the backwardness and incompleteness of rural markets is extremely glaring. A powerful integrated system for supplying the means of production and for promoting the sale of farm products is lacking, and financial, technology, labor, and information markets have yet to appear. This greatly limits increase in peasant income. Therefore, the fostering of rural markets has become an urgent need in development of the rural economy to increase the peasants' income. The fostering of rural markets must rely on the small cities and towns, the advantages they offer in terms of geography, communications, energy, technology, and location being used for further development of country fair markets and specialized markets centering around agricultural and sideline products. We must energetically develop all sorts of wholesale markets, and actively explore futures markets for the gradual formation of an agricultural products system in which country fair markets are the foundation, wholesale markets are the hub, and futures markets are the vanguard. In addition, we must actively foster and develop land, manpower, finance, technology, and information markets. Only when a fairly complete rural market system exists can the peasants be linked to the market economy and the peasants be guided toward a smooth entry into the commodity circulation realm, thereby being able to increase their income consistently. 6. Truly Reduce Peasant Burdens To Protect Peasant Interest in Production. Reducing the peasants' burdens is a major economic and political issue for protecting the peasants' interest in farming, safeguarding social order, consolidating rural socialist political authority, and cementing relations between the Party and the masses, and between the cadres and the masses. We must resolutely abide by the State Council's and our own regions applicable policy regulations for reducing the peasants burdens, strictly control township collection of fees and collective withholdings, not increase peasant assessments on any pretext, and do all possible to reduce peasant losses of benefits in every regard, making sure to return to the peasant the benefits that belong to them in the first place.
