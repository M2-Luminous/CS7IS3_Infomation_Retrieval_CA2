FR940324-0-00020 FR940324-0-00006 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;35] Establishment of Class D Airspace; Hailey, ID AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action proposes to establish Class D airspace at Friedman Memorial Airport, Hailey, Idaho. Midwest ATC Service, Inc., operates a control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport with an associated airport traffic area. Airspace Reclassification, which became effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and eliminated those ATA's not already designated to become Class D Airspace. As a result, the requirement for two-way radio communication with the control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport lapsed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class D airspace to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations and continue the two-way radio communication requirement at Friedman Memorial Airport. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bob Brown, ANM&hyph;535, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;35, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056, Telephone: (206) 227&hyph;2535. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On January 12, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by establishing the Hailey, Idaho, Class D airspace (59 FR 1680). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``airspace traffic area,'' replacing it with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' Class D airspace areas are published in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes the Class D airspace at Friedman Memorial Airport, Hailey, Idaho. Midwest ATC Service, Inc., operates a control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport with an associated airport traffic area (ATA). Airspace Reclassification, which became effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and, for control zones with operating control towers, replaced it with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' Only ATA's already designated to become Class D airspace continued to exist; Friedman Memorial Airport was not so designated. As a result, the requirement for two-way radio communication with the control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport lapsed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class D airspace to contain IFR operations and continue the two-way communication requirement at Friedman Memorial Airport. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air). Adoption of the Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 71 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1348(a), 1354(a), 1510; E.O. 10854, 24 FR 9565, 3 CFR, 1959&hyph;1963 Comp., p. 389; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); 14 CFR 11.69.
