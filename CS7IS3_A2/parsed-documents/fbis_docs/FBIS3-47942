The upper chamber's Special Committee on Political Reform approved the package of four bills by a voice vote. Eighteen committee members were in favor and 16 were against. Hosokawa has staked his job on the passage of the political reform bills which call for members of the House of Representatives to be elected through a combination of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, in place of the current multiseat constituencies. Originally designed to clean up Japan's scandal-tainted political system, the package also calls for a limited tightening of curbs on political funds. It remains unclear, however, whether the coalition can secure their passage by a full session of the upper chamber in view of dissent among some legislators of the Social Democratic Party, the biggest party in the ruling coalition. The coalition, which hopes to have the vote by the full house on Friday, has a slim majority with a combined force of 131, compared with the opposition's 115. It needs 126 votes to be sure of winning. The committee vote came after eleventh-hour talks Wednesday between the coalition and LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] failed to achieve a compromise over LDP demands to modify the bills. The powerful lower chamber passed the package on November 18.
