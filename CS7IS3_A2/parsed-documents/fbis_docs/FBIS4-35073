FBIS4-35073 "drlat125_a_94011" FBIS-LAT-94-125 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Planting Unlikely To Reach 60 Percent Planting Unlikely To Reach 60 Percent FL2906004494 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 2300 GMT 28 Jun 94 FL2906004494 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Spanish BFN [Report by Diosdado Maso from the "Exclusive" program] [Text] I am going to speak about the spring sugarcane planting program. There are 48 hours left in the month of June. The spring sugarcane planting program is unlikely to reach even 60 percent completion. For some Cubans, this is a recurring ailment. Seen in cold blood, this statement is nearly true. In 1994, however, the situation has been extremely difficult because the over 7,000 caballerias still to be planted were subject to constant rain since the beginning of April; the fuel shortage that is also responsible for the power outages we experience at home; and of course, this or that shortages, although to be truthful, shortages have not influenced results as much this year. Nonetheless, the sugarcane that should have been planted by 30 June can and should be planted in July, August, and September because, in the end, that is the sugarcane that will be ground in the 1995-96 harvest, and it can be planted, I repeat, perfectly well. To date, only Pinar del Rio Province has met its spring sugarcane planting goal. Havana Province has attained 94 percent of its planting goal. Havana has demonstrated aggressiveness in this endeavor. It was the only province to meet its limited sugar production program and as you can see, is also about to complete its spring sugarcane planting program. The worst spring planting situation is in Sancti Spiritus Province, with 39-percent fulfillment; and Villa Clara Province, which has not even planted 50 percent of the 2,600 caballerias projected. Planting the projected sugarcane is a life-or-death situation for Cuba. Sugar continues to be the source of our cash currency for any major commercial transaction. Other transactions will be covered by tourism, perhaps nickel, and tobacco revenues. Only sugar currency, however, fills the bill. This is why, only by producing more sugarcane can we acquire more currency. This is why the goal now is not to feint, but to plant up to the last caballeria, even if it takes up to midnight on New Year's Eve.
