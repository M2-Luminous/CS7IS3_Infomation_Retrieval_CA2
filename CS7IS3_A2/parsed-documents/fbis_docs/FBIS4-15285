Although the decision passed today by the constitutional conference of Kalmykia on the adoption of the regulations is not binding, it will pave the way for the forthcoming relevant decision by the Kalmyk parliament. Sergey Samoylov emphasized that valid until now has been the constitution of the Kalmyk SSR with some amendments. However, the experience of independent development of the republic has prompted new changes, i.e. the problems concerning the implementation of the concept of economic independence called for enacting an updated fundamental law. This circumstance is envisaged by the constitution of the Russian federation. Under the provisions of the newly- adopted regulations, Kalmykia remains a full-fledged national- territorial subject of the Russian Federation. The document also lays down the democratic norms of establishing state power and human rights, the representative of the president's administration pointed out.
