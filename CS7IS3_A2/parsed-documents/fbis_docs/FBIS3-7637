Security Council message on the North Korean nuclear wrangle at Thursday's [31 March] foreign ministers' meeting. Visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu meets U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and sources say they are likely to agree on issuing a statement by the council president rather than adopting a resolution -- but carrying the same strength in tone. Han told Korean reporters that if the council opts for a presidential statement, all permanent members including China will speak in favor with North Korea the only country opposing it. "This will make public the fact that China is on our side," Han said. But he suggested that the tone of the statement should be stronger than what China has proposed, putting in print the deadline by when North Korea should allow international inspection of its nuclear facilities and a warning on sanctions if Pyongyang fails to comply. On whether Seoul and Washington would resume their joint military maneuvers, Team Spirit, Han said the United States has always respected Seoul's position and decisions. "This time, we would be asking what Washington thinks instead of consulting them on our own position," Han said.
