FBIS4-54715 "dreeu086__a94008" FBIS-EEU-94-086-A Daily Report 4 May 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Efforts Against Computer Viruses Reported Efforts Against Computer Viruses Reported AU0405091394 Sofia BTA in English 0849 GMT 4 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0405091394 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, May 4 (BTA) -- A total of 500 computer viruses were identified in Bulgaria only within about an year, which makes an average of two viruses per day. All state institutions -- parliament, cabinet and the president's office -- last year were subject to information terrorism three to five times, BTA learned from Mr. Evgeni Nikolov, head of the computer security lab with the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAN). An international conference on information protection is currently being held in Varna (on the Black Sea). An unidentified writer penetrated the Finance Ministry computers precisely when the 1994 national budget was being drafted, it became known at the conference. The National Bank of Bulgaria (BNB), too, just like all major commercial banks, was troubled by viruses. Jack the Ripper was the most dangerous of the viruses traced and broken by the BAN computer security experts, Mr. Nikolov said. It appeared last September in Bulgaria and caused serious damages after penetrating about 70 percent of the computers. "While we were ready to beat it within about a fortnight, it took the other affected countries three months longer to solve this problem," Mr. Nikolov also said. Statistical figures set the number of operating computers in this country at over 1 million. The experts working at the anti-virus lab with the BAN are 11 and only within an year they have developed some 1,000 anti-virus packages. They, however, have to sell their products cheap to prove they are not writing computer viruses as a means to provide a market for the anti-virus products. Bulgaria has highly qualified computer experts. It is generally believed that some of the unbreakable viruses, including the Dark Avenger, are Bulgarian-made. According to Mr. Nikolov, however, it makes no sense blaming one nation or another and the anti-Bulgarian campaign in this sector is losing its vigour.
