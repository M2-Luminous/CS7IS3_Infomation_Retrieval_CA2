Now it is facing a more bitter experience by adopting an explicit position in favor of the Zionist enemy and extending strong support to it. Clinton has repeated the Zionist enemy's statement that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Zionist entity. The United States has also postponed the adoption of a resolution at the UN Security Council condemning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron, although more than three weeks have elapsed since the carnage. At the same time, the United States has prevented the UN Security Council from adopting a resolution lifting the sanctions against Iraq in order to sell its oil. Thus we see that the United States is adopting a double standard. This policy is unacceptable. The United States will only win the anger of all the Islamic peoples with this policy. Has Clinton forgotten that there is a UN Security Council Resolution No. 252 from 1968, which confirmed the legal status of Jerusalem and stated that any measures aimed at changing the status of Jerusalem are invalid? This resolution called on the Zionist enemy to immediately refrain from any action that could lead to a change in the status of Jerusalem. Do we understand from this that the United States has the authority to impose resolutions and cancel resolutions of the Security Council whenever it wishes? We would like to ask Clinton: Would he accept it if some Jews or people from any other nationality were to occupy any U.S. state and do to its American citizens what the Zionists are doing to the Palestinians and establish settlements against the will of its people? Or would the situation be different? Let Clinton know that people are brought into this world free and will not accept being treated like slaves. Every person is proud of his freedom. Freedom will triumph, and blood will be shed freely for the sake of freedom. The will of the peoples will conquer, and injustice will have a terrible end. The United States had paved the way for the cancellation of the United Nations resolution equating Zionism with racism. Is the al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident considered racism or democracy? Are these blood-smeared hands considered the source of terrorism, violence, and extremism? This U.S. policy is rejected by all the Islamic peoples. It implements the wishes of the Knesset which is seeking to establish a state from the Nile to the Euphrates. We said before that this enemy is full of hatred toward the Muslims. The Koran acknowledged this when it said: "Strongest among men in enmity to the believers wilt thou find the Jews and pagans." But there are people, may God forgive them, who have sought to establish reconciliation and peace with them. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident revealed some of the hatred and rancor the Jews have in their hearts. They even regarded the settler who killed this large number of Muslims as their patron, because the killing of Muslims is considered a cult. One of the rabbis even said with complete insolence that a finger of a Jew is worth one million Muslims. This is despicable and rejected. The Muslim's blood is precious. Glory is to God, his messenger, and the faithful. Perhaps those who have been deceived by peace and negotiations with this enemy have awakened from their heedlessness and have realized that it is impossible to achieve peace with it. The responsibility for the massacre was not limited to this settler. Others participated in it, and some soldiers also colluded with him. The responsibility is collective, involving even the head of the state. Otherwise, how can we explain the instructions to the soldiers to kill the Palestinian stone thrower and not to kill the Zionist settler who kills with bullets? They are the killers of the prophets. Who knows, perhaps they are planning to accomplish something momentous with the advent of the year 1997, the 100-year anniversary of the Basel conference in Switzerland in 1897. After the massacre, they also provoked the Palestinians, killing and wounding scores of them. Furthermore, a curfew was imposed on Hebron from the day of the incident. We then saw that all that Rabin and Clinton are concerned about is for the negotiations and the peace process not to be halted because of the massacre. These negotiations do not represent the Palestinian people. The Palestinian issue is not the issue of some Palestinians or some Arab rulers, but it is the issue of all the Muslims. We know that the United States resorts to the carrot and stick policy with some of these rulers and the few Palestinians represented by the PLO. Let the United States and the Zionist enemy know that rulers change, but the peoples stay, and that the peoples' will conquers. Let them review their position on the Palestinian issue and the issues of Jerusalem and the al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest shrine. The Muslim peoples will not forsake the issue of Palestine and the al-Aqsa Mosque, irrespective of time and sacrifices. To the Palestinians: We say to the Palestinians: Do not allow the Zionists to kill you from behind, but face them and defend yourselves and your land. This is a legitimate right. Know that your dead are in paradise and their dead are in hell. "So lose not heart, nor fall into despair, for ye must gain mastery if ye are true in faith. If a wound hath touched you, be sure a similar wound has touched the others. Such days (of varying fortunes) we give to men and men by turn that God may know those that believe, and that He may take to Himself from your ranks Martyr-witnesses (to truth). And God loveth not those that do wrong. God's object also is to purge those that are true in faith and to deprive of blessing those that resist faith." And slacken not if following up the enemy. If ye are suffering hardships, they are suffering similar hardships; but ye have hope from God, while they have none." [Koranic verses] To the Muslims in general: O Muslims, Islam is not a personal religion. It is the religion of one nation, one group, and even one body. If one member of this body complains, the entire body comes to help. O Muslims, appreciate the meaning of the one nation and one body. Do not slacken, weaken, or keep quiet. You must rise up from your sleep. The matter is very serious. The enemies of Islam have underestimated you and undervalued your lives as we have seen in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kashmir, and other places. They were disgraced as they left hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children to be killed and tens of thousands of women to be raped and killed. O Muslims, do not believe in the international institutions. They have become puppets in the hands of the arrogant forces. Call on your rulers to play a strong role in these institutions. Otherwise, establish an Islamic league that cares for and manages the affairs of the Muslims, protect and defend them. The enemies of Islam are after their own interests. The Muslims in the world can use the weapon of popular boycott of enemy goods. It is an effective weapon against them. We warn against the issues of the Middle Eastern market, normalization with the enemy, and ending the boycott of Israel. These are extremely important matters, because they work for the benefit of the enemy. The economic issue will be followed by political hegemony. It is not becoming of 1.2 billion Muslims to surrender to slaughter, displacement, and rape. We must act, contemplate, and think about what must be done to fortify ourselves before what happened in Palestine and Bosnia-Herzegovina is repeated against us. The first thing we must do is return to God and fear Him, and then equip ourselves with all the means of strength. The first of these is strength of faith, then the strength of unity, the strength of weapons and education, and so forth. We must then have confidence that Almighty God will support us and make us triumph. God's book tells us about victory, God willing: "Until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God." "Fain would they extinguish God's light with their mouths, but God will not allow but that His light should be perfected, even though the unbelievers may detest (it). It is he who hath sent His apostle with Guidance and the religion of truth to proclaim it over all religion, even though the pagans may detest (it)." [Koranic verses] God has granted victory to his messenger and the few believers with him against the pagans in the Arabian Peninsula and against the Jews, Persians, and Greeks. If we follow the same path of God's messenger, may God's prayers and peace be upon him, God will grant us victory. To the rulers of the Muslim countries: O rulers of the Muslim countries: Sense your responsibility for your Muslim peoples and cooperate with them. "Let not the strutting about of the unbelievers through the land deceive three: Little is it for enjoyment. Their ultimate abode is hell. What an evil bed (to lie on)." Purge your countries from what is objectionable and sinful that angers God. Educate your peoples about strength, fortitude, good character, and zeal for religion and your peoples will support you in the face of the enemy's treachery and even sacrifice their lives for you. O rulers, all sedition fanned by the enemies between the Muslim countries and among the Muslims in the same country or between them and their rulers must be stopped. Close your ranks according to God's book and his messenger's teachings and mend your differences. Respond to your Lord's order: "The believers are but a single brotherhood. So make peace and reconciliation between your two (contending) brothers; and fear God, that ye may receive mercy." "And hold fast, all together, by the rope which God stretches out for you, and be not divided among yourselves. And remember with gratitude God's favor on you, for ye were enemies and He joined your hearts in love, so that by His grace ye became brethren." [Koranic verses] This is the way, and there is no other one. Avoid violence and counter violence. Avoid anything that could weaken our Islamic countries. God be my witness, I have conveyed the message.
