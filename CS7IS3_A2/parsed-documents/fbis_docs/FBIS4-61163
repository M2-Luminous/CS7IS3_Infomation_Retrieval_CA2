In accordance with the transformation regulations of the new law, the reform of the state administration has to be completed by 31 December 1995. The transformation regulations of the law foresee that the Cabinet of Ministers, along with the municipal authorities and heads of civil institutions are to bear responsibility for implementing the reform in due course. The transformation regulations provide that the reform is implemented in a respective sequence of time. The first stage of the reform will be carried into effect in the ministries (except the Ministry of Interior Affairs and the State Forest Service in the Agriculture Ministry), and the state institutions which are submitted to them, by 31 December of the current year. The second stage of the reform of the state administration will take place in the Ministry of Interior Affairs, the State Forest Service, and the institutions of municipal authorities, and will have to be implemented by 31 December 1995. To ensure a proper course of transformation, the Cabinet of Ministers will affirm the list of the civil servant positions available in the state civil service. The employees will be attestated by attestation commissions. As is stated by the civil service law, the following are state civil institutions: the State Office, all state administration and municipal institutions, court and prosecutor's institutions, State Control institutions, as well as other institutions acting as state or municipal authorities, established in accordance with the Satversme [constitution], legislative acts, and decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers. As regards the civil servant, it is a person who has passed an examination qualifying him as a state civil servant, and has been nominated, for a definite or indefinite time, to some post defined on the list of civil service positions. According to the law, he performs the duties, which have been delegated by the state to the municipal authorities, or fulfills functions of the state civil service in a civil institution. The law states that the posts of the chairman of the High Court, his deputies, and judges of the High Court, the chairman of the district court, his deputies, and judges of the district court, as well as judges of other courts, the posts of the general prosecutor and other prosecutors, the posts of the state controller and members of the State Control Council are not to be regarded as civil servant posts. The law provides that the candidates for the posts of civil servants should meet obligatory requirements, such as, to possess Latvian citizenship, and to have a command of the Latvian language. The law denies the possibility to become a civil servant to a person who has been an employee of the former USSR or LAtvian SSR State Security Committee, the Russian Defense Ministry, as well as security service, intelligence service, and military espionage or counterespionage of Russia or other states. The transformation rules also provide that foreign citizens and stateless persons, who are performing duties of civil servants at the moment when the law comes into effect, are permitted --after passing the attestation examinations due to regulations adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers -- to function in the status of candidates for the post of civil servant, for a time not longer than two years.
