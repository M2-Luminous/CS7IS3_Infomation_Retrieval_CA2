A decisive guarantee for victory in the march this year is to defend our rock-solid single-hearted unity around the party and the leader [suryong] as the most precious thing and demonstrate the might of this unity more highly. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: We must defend the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks, which has been consolidated rock-solid under our party's leadership, as the most precious thing and further consolidate and develop it. Single-hearted unity is our revolution's immortal, honorable tradition and a great banner of victory. Our people have been able to victoriously overcome all difficulties and trials on the revolutionary road and march forward and build a powerful independent, self-sufficient socialist country capable of self- reliant defense in this land because they have waged struggles like heroes after strongly uniting around the party and the leader [suryong]. Last year, when stern trials faced the fatherland and reunification, our people honorably defended the socialist fatherland's dignity and safety and won a great victory in socialist economic construction. This was possible because there was the might of single-hearted unity. Only when we resolutely defend the honorable tradition of single-hearted unity and continuously and highly demonstrate its might, can we fully demonstrate the superiority of socialism of our own style and complete the chuche-oriented socialist cause to the end in any storm. More strongly consolidating single-hearted unity among our revolutionary ranks is all the more important a demand in connection with our revolution's environment and our massive tasks. The imperialists and reactionaries are strengthening their offensives on an unprecedented scale in the political, economic, military, and diplomatic fields and all other fields to isolate, stifle, and crush [korip chilsik apsal] our Republic, which is marching under the uplifted banner of socialism. The situation in our country is still tense and complicated because of the enemy's anti-Republic, antisocialist maneuvers, and numerous difficulties face us. We must fly the banner of single-hearted unity more highly if we are to score revolutionary upsurges by waging the struggle to thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary economic strategies under these circumstances. Single-hearted unity is a source of the vitality of socialism. When our people implement our party's revolutionary economic strategies after strongly uniting around the party and the leader [suryong], the imperialists' anti-Republic, antisocialist commotions will quiet down, and our people will be able defend and maintain socialism of our own style and glorify it to the end. The tasks of all fields of socialist construction this year are heavy and massive. As the great leader has elucidated in his New Year's address, we must thoroughly implement the revolutionary lines of self-dependence, self-support, and self-reliant defense to comply with the prevailing situation and the requirements for the development of our revolution. They must also vigorously carry out the three revolutions, ideological, technological, and cultural, to further strengthen the country's political, economic, and military might. Our party's revolutionary economic strategies presented at the 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth party Central Committee are the most just and revolutionary lines for consolidating a basis for a self-reliant rock-solid national economy and further improving the standard of living to meet socialist demands. When we thoroughly implement these strategies, we will be able to more vigorously demonstrate the superiority of socialism of our own style and take new attack bases for conquering higher peaks in socialism. We must continuously and strongly adhere to the agriculture-first policy, the light industry-first policy, and the foreign trade-first policy this year. We must also give top priority to the coal industry, the power industry, and railway transportation, which are the leading sectors of the people's economy, and continuously develop the metallurgical industry. They must also achieve new development in all fields of socialist cultural construction and exert due efforts to strengthen the country's defensive capability in response to the enemy's war provocation maneuvers. If we are to implement these massive tasks successfully, we must defend our single-hearted unity as the most precious thing and more highly demonstrate its might. Our single-hearted unity is single- hearted unity in ideology and in action in which the entire party and all the people absolutely worship [sungbae] and follow the great leader [suryong], and the great leader [yongdoja]. When we highly display the might of such great single-hearted unity unprecedented in history, there will be no difficulty that we cannot overcome or stronghold that we cannot occupy. The road to destroying in every step vicious anti-Republic and antisocialist maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries and the road to highly demonstrating the spirit of chuche Korea are to highly display the might of single-hearted unity. The road to consolidating the foundation of the nation's self-supporting economy by vigorously accelerating the socialist general march is for all people to struggle with single-hearted unity with the party. The idea on further strengthening the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks, expounded by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in the New Year's address, is a precious guideline that provided a decisive guarantee for victory of this year's combat. This idea reflects the great leader's lofty intent to make this year the year of historic turn in the revolution and construction in our country by more highly displaying the might of our single-hearted unity, which the entire party, all the people and the whole Army have attained by firmly rallying themselves behind the great leader [yongdoja]. All party members and working people should further consolidate and develop our single-hearted unity in conformity with the demand of the prevailing situation and development of the revolution, and should brilliantly achieve the militant tasks elucidated by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in the New Year's address. Thus, we should register greater victory in the struggle to advance the socialist cause of our own style. It is important, above all, for all party members and working people to deeply realize the greatness of the leader [yongdoja] and to have thoroughgoing faith to absolutely trust and follow only their leader [suryong] and their leader [yongdoja] under any circumstance. The might of the unity of the revolutionary ranks is the might of solid faith of all people toward the leader. Comrade Kim Chong-il, our dear leader, is the matchlessly great man who has both literary and military achievements and who has loyalty and filial piety. He is destiny and future of our fatherland, our people and our-style socialism. Through proud realities of our revolution, which advances without wavering even a slight degree in the midst of worldwide upheaval, all party members and working people should be keenly aware of how the great leader [yongdoja] we are upholding is at the van of the party, the revolutionary ranks and revolutionary armed forces. We should uphold the dear comrade leader with loyalty and filial piety by cherishing the iron-clad belief that because there is the leader [yongdoja], there is the nation, and their own happiness and everlasting prosperity of the future generations are insured. The great chuche idea is an ideological basis of our single-hearted unity. All the people should firmly insure consistency of their ideologies and actions in accordance with the demand of the chuche idea. Herein lies the invincible might of our single-hearted unity. Deeply realizing that the chuche idea is the life of our-style socialism, party members and working people should more firmly arm themselves with the chuche idea. Our single-hearted unity is a powerful driving force in socialist construction, and its might should be fully demonstrated in the practical struggle to accelerate the socialist economic construction. In today's rewarding struggle to further consolidate the foundation of the nation's self-supporting economy, to upgrade the people's standard of living, and to hold a new offensive position to occupy a higher height of socialism, we should fully display the might of our people's firm unity with the party and the leader [suryong]. By highly displaying the sense of unbounded devotion to the party and to the revolution and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle, all party members and workers should timely fulfill and without fail national economic plans assigned to them. For us to glorify our-style socialism with the might of single-hearted unity, we should more brilliantly bloom the communist fine custom overflowing in the whole society. The revolutionary traits of our people, who are firmly united as one with the party and the leader, should be vigorously demonstrated in highly displaying the communist fine custom, in which all members of society help and lead each other according to the collectivist principle, "One for all, all for one." The single-hearted unity is our most powerful weapon and strength in defending, protecting and accomplishing our-style socialism to the end. As long as there are the wise leadership of the party and the leader, and the single-hearted unity of the people, who are rallied behind the great leader [suryong] and great leader [yongdoja], there is nothing that we should be afraid of in this world. All party members and working people should advance by more highly upholding the banner of single-hearted unity with sense of confidence and courage. Thus, we should again demonstrate the unswerving spirit of heroic Korea in this year's socialist general march.
