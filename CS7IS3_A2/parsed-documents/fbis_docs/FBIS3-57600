Did he accept your resignation or did he accept your conditions? How did your conversation actually finish? [Fedorov] I repeat once again -- I have never resigned and I am not going to do so. I have not accepted the invitation to take a certain post in the cabinet which is being reorganized -- I mean the post of finance minister. The president confirmed this invitation and I, of course, did not accept it. I tried to explain my position to the president. He regretted that I did not accept this proposal. He advised me not to go away too far. [Svanidze] Are you actually fulfilling the duties of the finance minister at the present moment? [Fedorov] No, I am not. I have already signed an order. The order has not been yet formally issued, so I am still a minister. But I signed the order yesterday that my first deputy is to fulfill my duties. [Svanidze] Dubinin? [Fedorov] Yes. [Svanidze] Boris Grigoryevich, you said in your statement that the country is rolling away and there is an economic coup in the country. What do you mean? [Fedorov] I mean that if the government's program had some certain guiding lines, some certain methods of economic policy and instruments during the past two years and suddenly this direction has been changed -- instead of 3-5 percent inflation there will be 8-9 percent, although I could guarantee that in the present atmosphere, even 20 percent would appear to be a good result -- if we are told that economic romanticism has now gone and some non- monetary methods will be used and there will be some other policy, this means a change of policy [sentence as heard]. But I was invited by the president to carry out a quite definite, specific policy directed at fighting inflation and creating a normal market economy in our country. I worked on this for a year. [Svanidze] You say that at the moment there are fundamental and open opponents of the policy of reforms in the government. Whom do you have in mind? [Fedorov] The government is roughly the same as it was before, only the addresses, so to speak, of the people have changed. Clearly, that was the task in mind. You realize that even before the reorganization there was no majority of reformers in the government. They were in the minority, but there was an opportunity, at least, to carry out a certain policy. There was confidence in the premier. As soon as the premier changes course -- which he has spoken about -- naturally the status, say, of the minister of finance is reduced and the general correlation of forces in the government changes. In other words, naturally, to pursue the same course as before is extremely difficult. Therefore, if what the western press calls the worst central banker in the world -- Gerashchenko -- remains in the post of chairman of the Central Bank, then naturally, it becomes impossible to pursue a civilized normal financial monetary-credit policy. It is natural that those positions which Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Aleksandr Nikolayevich Zveryukha put forward were also fundamentally at variance from my own views and with those tasks which were set out in the program, and his presence in an office which was higher than the minister of finance, this also naturally makes this work very, very difficult, or rather, impossible. [Svanidze] One must suppose that you did not hide these views from the president, and what was his reaction to them? [Fedorov] I did not hide my views -- I never conceal my point of view. The president said that there was no need to hurry, that there might be changes, and that Gerashchenko, too, in principle, of course, was not going to be there for ever. He reaffirmed that he was opposed to changing the course. [Svanidze] What is your prediction for inflation by the end of the year? [Fedorov] As always, I gave my predictions in good time, way back in December -- a Christmas prediction, so to speak -- where I spoke about it increasing 20-fold, 2,000 percent, a rate of 10,000, then I defined it a litle more precisely at something like a 12,000- fold drop in real per-capita incomes. There would still be a fall in production and capital investments and a devaluation of the savings of the population. In other words, I do not foresee any area where the indices will be any better than they were in 1993. On the contrary, we are getting close to going the same way as Ukraine. [Svanidze] What do you intend to do now? [Fedorov] Well, I'm a member of the Duma, and I intend to work there. [Svanidze] In other words, you will move from a financier and an economist to becoming a professional politician? [Fedorov] Well, you know, a minister, if he is a real minister, is also a professional politician. If he is just a cashier who dishes out cash then yes, of course, he is purely a technocrat. A technocrat has nothing to do with politics. I have pursued a policy and I have certain convictions that I will continue to uphold.
