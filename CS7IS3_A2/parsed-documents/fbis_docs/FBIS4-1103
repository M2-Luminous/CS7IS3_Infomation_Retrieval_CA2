They are being severely hindered from carrying out this assignment by their lack of necessary communications equipment and transportation. Meanwhile, 30 Belgian jeeps and radio equipment, which are intended for the OAU peace mission, are waiting, unused, in a hangar for a definitive "yes" from Brussels. [passage omitted] At the cabinet of the Belgian Foreign Ministry, a spokesman for Willy Claes said that "the talks with the OAU concerning the specific use of the Belgian equipment had not yet been concluded, and that consequently Belgium could not yet release the vehicles in question." A final agreement would be reached "within a few days, or one week at the latest," he said. "However, we still have high hopes for the OAU mission," Burundian Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo said, speaking yesterday with DE STANDAARD over telephone. "Both the Army and the militant elements in the Hutu quarters are accusing each other of provocation. There is an urgent need for us to gain an objective picture of the situation." In addition, Ngendahayo said that it was a "shame that some reports had exaggerated the previously sporadic disturbances in some parts of the capital at the very same time that such intensive, serious efforts are being made to put them behind us." During the weekend, the Burundian Government again took measures to strengthen the administration in the tribal areas and is seeking possible ways of gradually disarming the population. The foreign minister was optimistic about the possibilities envisioned Monday by the Constitutional Court regarding the succession of country's defunct President Cyprien Ntaryamira. He said that "relations with the former part of unity, UPRONA [Unity for National Progress], are so good that a solution to the menacing constitutional impasse is very close to being reached."
