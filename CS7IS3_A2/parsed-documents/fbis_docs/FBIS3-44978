Vice-Minister of Justice Wang Julu said at a news conference today that the move is aimed to promote the cooperation and exchange between the mainland lawyers and lawyers from those areas. "This will provide legal service for the economic exchange and cooperation between the mainland and areas of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao," Wang said. It is also a reform measure for China's lawyer system, he added. This measure is responding to requests by lawyers and legal experts from those places to know the mainland legal system and legal background, he said. The requests come as China is to resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, and the pace of unification across the straits is being stepped up, Wang said. They asked for permits to take part in the national lawyer qualification test and obtain mainland certificates, so that they can defend "certain cases under certain regulations," according to Wang. Residents from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao must meet the same requirements as residents on the mainland to participate in the test, the vice-minister said. They include that the candidates must endorse the Constitution of the People's Republic, have no criminal record, no serious mental illness or other serious illness, and are above the age of 23. One exception was made on credential qualifications due to the different legal and educational systems in these areas. The Justice Ministry decided that those with college credentials issued by China's State Educational Commission are allowed to take part in the test. Wang said that his ministry will run training seminars for residents from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao to enable them to have a systematic knowledge of China's legal system. He said a "Chinese lawyer training class" will be held in Hong Kong on January 17 this year jointly by the National Examination Center on Lawyer Qualification, the Law School of the People's University of China from Beijing and Shu Yan College of Hong Kong. He said that people from those areas who passed the test will be licensed to practise after the required practical experience and passing proficiency assessments.
