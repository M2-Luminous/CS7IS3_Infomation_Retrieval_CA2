On 9 June, police arrested a 51-year-old Chilean at the airport who had arrived in Vienna from South America via Zurich. Two kg of cocaine were discovered in the man's suitcases. The suspect also carried 20 faked $100 notes and 20 faked $100 travelers checks. Finally, the officers also managed to catch the Chilean's contact: A Spaniard, resident in Uruguay, who wanted to run away but was rounded up and arrested after one warning shot was fired. He should have taken the cocaine to Italy.
