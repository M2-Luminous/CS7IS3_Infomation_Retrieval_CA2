Gen. Diya was speaking with State House correspondent Mohamed Labe shortly on arrival in Abuja from his three-day consultation with traditional rulers and leaders of thought across the country: [Begin recording] [Diya] We continue to appeal to Chief M.K. Abiola not to confront the government. I have said this, that Chief Abiola believes in God. He is a very good Muslim. He knows that it is God that gives one a position, and I know that Chief M.K. Abiola would not want to see this country -- this country that has reduced from what it used to be -- he wouldn't want to see this country in chaos. I think he will not do it. [Labe] On his confutations with traditional rulers and leaders of thought, he said the talks had been successful. [Diya] I think they have been very very successful. I am more reassured now than ever before that our traditional rulers, our elders are all committed to a united and very strong Nigeria. [Labe] For three days, the chief of general staff criss- crossed the country, talking with northern traditional rulers and elders and their counterparts in the east, Edo, Delta, and leaders of thought of the southwest. The traditional rulers assured the Federal Government of their loyalty. [passage omitted] [end recording]
