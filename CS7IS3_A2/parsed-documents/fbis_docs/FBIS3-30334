The existing situation needs to be strengthened, and the Yugoslav peoples themselves need to decide about their future. Territories populated by Serbs or Croats must stay under the control of Serbs or Croats, while the Muslim issue is an artificial one. You do not have any Muslims, said Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, in an exclusive interview to Srdjan Djuric, editor of the Eye of the World program of Independent Television Studio B. The blockade must be lifted, continued Zhirinovskiy, and then everything will take a normal course. There will be Slovenia, Croatia, and Greater Serbia. And that is it. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, it is all Serbia. Nothing else will be necessary. Let there be three states -- Slovenia as one entity, then division with Croats -- if they are such great Catholics -- and the rest will all be Greater Serbia. Borders with Bulgarians, Romania, and Hungary. You have access to the Adriatic; it is all normal. [Djuric] Your idea of a confederacy of Orthodox countries has been given a lot of publicity in Serbia. How do you envisage this? Which countries would comprise it? What would be its purpose? [Zhirinovskiy] We need to think about the fact that in this world, which has fallen apart, there are no longer two blocs, there is no bilateral balance, and no fanatical ideology lasts forever. All this has gone down the drain. Essentially, this was violence. However, if we were to try uniting into some kind of alliance of states, as Orthodox Slavs, this would make us stronger, firmer. We would then have a single society, a common language with you. We are one tribe. You remained in the Balkans, the Poles proceeded to the northwest, the Russians to the northeast; our civilization started there [as published]. The Russians went on their way, the Poles on theirs, and you stayed here. Then they hacked you to pieces, gave some to the Italians, Austrians, Germans, and Turks. They are all barbarians. They came from here [as published] 500 years ago, they conquered the Byzantine Empire, and kept you in blood and torture for 500 years. Until Alexander II liberated all of you. That is why we could now form a Slav alliance of Slav states. The Balkans, Czech, Slovakia, Poland, Russia -- these would make a very good foundation, because we share a common language and culture. The Serbs, the Ukrainians, and the Russians are all Orthodox. It would be easier for all of us, it would be better. It would all be one expanse of territory, because this is a single territory, one territory, a huge territory. If you were in New Zealand, and someone else were in Argentina, how could you unite? Whereas in this case, everyone is here. You. The Bulgarians. Only the Hungarians and the Romanians are in the way. A clear border with the Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. We could save a lot on transportation. For example, from your ports on the Adriatic across all of Russia from Vud to Japan. There you are. Poland and Germany as well. Hamburg, Warsaw, Moscow, Vladivostok. A Eurasian transit trade route and everything will be fine. The language -- Russian. You will be pleased to speak Russian more often than English. You even use the same alphabet as we do. We favor doing something, we are trying to accomplish something. However, the Slavs have always been weak. The Germans constrained you from the west, the northeast, and the northwest. If a new Russia emerges, we will not allow them to go on constraining you. If you desire closer relations with Russia, so be it. If you do not, you are welcome -- everything depends on you, on your wishes. If the Russians rule over the territory of the former Soviet Union, the situation in Serbia and Yugoslavia will be stable. If the Serbs are at war, the Croats, and Bosnia, it will be an endless war. The same applies to our case. If you remove the Russian front, we too will have an endless war, just like Afghanistan. [Djuric] What is your opinion of the presidents of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia? [Zhirinovskiy] I do not know them very well personally. Principally speaking, they are all former communists. I am not a communist. And that is why it is obvious that there is no agreement on ideology. I am ready to support them if they take up a patriotic position, that is, where there are Serbs, that is Serbia. [If they support] let us say normal relations with neighboring states, so that noone would attack the Serbs, and that they try to minimize any danger threatening Serbia, we can reach an agreement. However, if they betray the Serbian people and start betraying Serbian interests to the advantage of the Muslims and Croats, then I cannot support them, because I believe that an agreement is not possible. Where the Serbs live, that is Serbia. All of it. Concessions should not be made to anyone. The Muslims need to be removed, all the armies withdrawn, and the war ended. You can live on tourism alone. Tourism can make you the richest country in the world, you need nothing else. Such sea, such beaches, so many beautiful resorts. And now there is a war there, and everything is being destroyed. [Djuric] Finally, a short question. Do you know the president of Yugoslavia and do you have a candidate for that post? [Zhirinovskiy] Who is the current president of Yugoslavia? I know that Milosevic is the president of Serbia, and I did not think that Yugoslavia had a president. [Djuric] It does, his name is Lilic. [Zhirinovskiy] Who? Lilic? Who is he? We know of Milosevic from Serbia, and the Muslims have Izetbegovic. Who is this Izetbegovic? What makes him a Muslim? And I know Tudjman -- the Croat. There, we have heard of them; Tudjman, Milosevic, Izetbegovic. While the president of the united Serbia and Montenegro is not widely known, this is very unclear. However, the alliance [as published]. We knew only of Tito, Josip Broz Tito! That was all we knew -- Tito -- and nothing else. Nowadays, you elect them and change them every year. For example, that American -- where did he run off to? [Djuric] You mean Panic? [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, Panic. That was his fate. He came for a while, he was here, and then he went back to where the greasy sandwiches are. Why should he be in a place where everything is bleeding? That is not a fatherland. That is a market. He tried to be president of Yugoslavia and then he went back. I know of Milosevic, but he is a communist. And that is his flaw. Which is his party? [Djuric] The Socialist [Party of Serbia]. [Zhirinovskiy] The Socialist -- of course, I raise my hat to him. I told the communists here that they should change their name, I told Zyuganov that he should rename the party the Workers' Party. Everyone is tired of the word communist. And in the same way that there is an Agricultural Party, he could change the name of the party to the Workers' Party. It is a good name. The Russian Workers' Party of Russia, the president -- Zyuganov. Otherwise, they have no perspective. [Box, p 5] Democracy [Djuric] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, are you a monarchist or a republican? [Zhirinovskiy] I am a republican. I respect the monarchists. However, I am a republican. I also respect religious parties, but I favor a secular republic. That is that. Here we have the Liberal Democratic Party -- law and freedom. Freedom within the framework of the law; that is the whole ideology. For me democracy is when the majority finds the solutions, but takes into account the minorities -- as in Yugoslavia. The Serbs make decisions, taking into account that there are also the Slovenes and Croats and other categories. However, it is the Serbs' duty to make the decisions. Looking back into history, there used to be a great Serbia, and there was order and silence. Yet now we will have 12 states, and there will be war, bloodshed, and violence. Nothing good will happen. We choose the lesser of two evils. The lesser evil is Serbia's rule in the Balkans, the greater evil is 15 small states swallowing and killing each other every day. [Box, p 5] The Hobby [Djuric] According to the election results, a great number of soldiers and officers voted for you. Is that because the army believes that you are the man who can restore its position and reputation in Russian society? [Zhirinovskiy] The significance of the army! Yes? The army always displayed its sympathy, both at the previous and these elections. I always say: I love the army, the KGB, and the secret political police. That is my flaw. I love them. Other people, they go fishing or have other hobbies, while my hobby within the framework of politics are my sympathies towards the structure of power. I used to be in the army. I love a strong Russian Army, a strong KGB, and the political police, that is, the entire structure of power, and that is why they voted for me. Eighty percent of the officers, the army, the KGB, and the police voted for me. However, since the voting was secret, this cannot be proven. It can only be proven in the military constituencies, which were closed to everyone else. There it was obvious.
