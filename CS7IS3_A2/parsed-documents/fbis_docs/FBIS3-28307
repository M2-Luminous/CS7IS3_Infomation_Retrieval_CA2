What lay behind this, apparently, was also Takemura's discontent with the prime minister's growing tendency to lean on Ichiro Ozawa, general secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. It is possible that the "triangular" relationship of Hosokawa, Ozawa, and Takemura which has been the main frame of the government since its inception will now change drastically and that a new element of instability will face the government. In a news conference on the morning of 3 February, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura criticized the prime minister's concept of the public welfare tax, saying, "To look back, it cannot be said that everything was appropriate." This is the first time that Takemura, who is functioning as Prime Minister Hosokawa's housekeeper, has criticized the prime minister openly. As far as the matter of reducing the income tax and raising the consumption tax is concerned, Takemura has believed since late last year that it would be difficult to accept the Finance Ministry's idea of "taking care of the two matters in one package" in view of the internal circumstances of not only the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] but also Komeito [Clean Government Party] and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. He is said to have talked with the prime minister about it many times and to have been assured that the two matters will be "severed" from each other. He thought that this common understanding was the given premise when he entrusted the prime minister with making a final decision. But the prime minister's final "decision" was "to handle the two in a package," and this came as a shock to Takemura. Takemura appears to suspect that "the prime minister accepted the proposal of Ozawa and Komeito General Secretary Ichikawa, who are sympathetic to the Finance Ministry and its idea of raising the consumption tax." Explaining the "decision," the prime minister said that cabinet members of the SDPJ in a meeting at the prime minister's residence on 3 February agreed to honor a decision of the ruling party representatives meeting. But Takeyama, in a top leaders meeting of the government and ruling parties held at the prime minister's residence late in the evening of 2 February, in fact spoke against the concept, saying, "I will speak as president of Shinto Sakigake [New Party Harbinger], and I would like you to be cautious (about handling the two in one package)." Moreover, he refused to attend the prime minister's news conference before the dawn of 3 February, and he said at his own news conference held later that morning that "the mistake should be redressed." All of these acts are thought to be his expression of his repulsion toward the stand of the prime minister. Recently, Hosokawa has been said to be thinking negatively even about a possible merger of the Japan New Party and Shinto Sakigake. As a result, Takemura is trying to strengthen his relations with SDPJ leaders and people such as DSP Chairman Ouchi. Differences in views between Hosokawa and Takemura were revealed even on the question of who should be charged with examining a revision of the concept of the public welfare tax. The prime minister wanted the party representatives [general secretaries] conference to be put in charge, but Takemura insisted that the party heads council should take care of it. On the evening of 3 February, Takemura announced that he would support the prime minister as best as possible, and he expressed his willingness to restore good relations with Hosokawa, but there is no question that a cold wind has started to blow on the relationship between Hosokawa and Takemura, thus putting an end to their honeymoon period.
