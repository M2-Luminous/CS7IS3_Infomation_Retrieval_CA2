In the 18,000-character-strong "report," Gyaincain Norbu first recalled the work of the past year. He said: We steadily developed the rural and pastoral economy, industrial production, and transport. The construction of energy, transport, telecommunications, and other infrastructural projects proceeded smoothly. A good trend of development was maintained in foreign trade and tourism, and in the work of introducing investments from abroad and establishing lateral ties at home. New progress was made in establishing the market system, new achievements were made in the building of spiritual civilization, and the people's living standards were further improved. The "report" expounded in detail the salient features of 1993, including efforts to emancipate the mind, deepen reforms, improve and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, adhere to the principle of fostering both material progress and cultural and ideological progress and attaching equal importance to both, achieve social stability, and wage a thorough anti-corruption struggle. Making a comprehensive analysis and summing up achievements, Gyaincain Norbu pointed out: There are still many shortcomings in our work, as well as many difficulties and problems ahead. We must pay great attention to solving them seriously. On the guiding principle and tasks for this year, Gyaincain Norbu particularly pointed out: Nineteen-ninety-four is a crucial year for this region to carry out comprehensive reforms, promote overall progress, make breakthroughs in selected fields, and accelerate the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. For this reason, the guiding principle for the government work is: to work under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line; implement in an all-around way the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Fifth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Autonomous Regional CPC Committee; seize opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development and maintain statability; continue to improve macroeconomic regulation and control, step up infrastructural construction, vigorously readjust the economic structure, and constantly enhance economic efficiency; and bring about a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. The goal of economic development is to achieve a gross domestic product of 4.01 billion yuan, an 8 percent increase over 1993. Gyaincain Norbu emphasized: All our work this year should be subordinate to and serve the main objective -- reform, development, and stability -- and reform should be put at the center of all our undertakings. In economic restructuring, we should take productive forces as the criterion and seize the opportunity to promote overall progress and strive to make breakthroughs in selected fields. Our economic restructuring should converge with the national framework and structure. In economic restructuring, we should consider Tibet's reality, take firm action and prudent steps, and adopt flexible policies. Gyaincain Norbu called on the governments at various levels to implement meticulously all promulgated reform measures and do solid work in all fields. In order to adhere to the guiding principle and accomplish all tasks of this region this year, Gyaincain Norbu pointed out: Efforts should be made to increase the income of peasants and herdsmen, further deepen reforms in rural and pastoral areas, increase investment in agriculture and animal husbandry, readjust structure according to market demand, develop village and town enterprises and a diversified economy, and accelerate economic development in rural and pastoral areas. It is necessary to step up infrastructural construction and enhance the capacity for future economic growth. It is necessary to concentrate on improving the economic efficiency of industry and transport service. A further step should be taken to open up wider to the outside world and to develop foreign trade and tourism. We should continue to improve the fiscal, taxation, and banking work and ensure funds for economic and social development. We should accelerate the construction of markets and cultivate a unified, open market system. Great efforts should be made to develop education, science and technology, and improve the quality of the work force. It is necessary to improve the social security system and accelerate the reform of the urban housing system. Gyaincain Norbu said: Development is the foundation for social stability, and reform creates a strong motive force for development. Only when social stability is maintained can we smoothly promote reform, opening up, and economic development. He emphasized: We should correctly handle the relationship among reform, development, and stability and create favorable conditions and a good social environment for the deepening of reforms and for the acceleration of development. Gyaincain Norbu expounded in detail such questions as how to wage a thorough anti-splittist struggle, strengthen the political power at the grass-roots level, do good work concerning nationalities and religions in the new period, strengthen the legal system, step up the building of spiritual civilization, and deepen the anti-corruption struggle. In conclusion, Gyaincain Norbu called on everyone in Tibet to rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, hold aloft the banner of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics, unite as one, work hard, create a new situation of reform, development, and stability in Tibet, and rapidly bring about new development in all undertakings in Tibet.
