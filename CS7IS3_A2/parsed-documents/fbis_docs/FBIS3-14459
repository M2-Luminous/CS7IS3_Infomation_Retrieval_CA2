In a report from the marshes, our sources note that the regime has massed many troops, including armored and artillery units, in preparation for the attack. The same sources add that the regime has beefed up its forces by sending units from the Republican Guards, the emergency forces [quwat al-tawari'], large elements from the security and intelligence services, and units from the so- called Popular Army, which has been reestablished to confront popular protests against the regime.
