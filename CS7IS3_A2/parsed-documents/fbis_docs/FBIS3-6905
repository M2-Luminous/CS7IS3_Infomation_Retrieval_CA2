Renuka] [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 23 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- A senior Malaysian minister is hopeful the Malaysia-initiated East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC), initiated by Malaysia and which is currently on a membership drive, will take off before the end of next year. Rafidah Aziz, who is trade and industry minister, said the grouping would comprise the ASEAN members in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the new market economies in Indochina. She hoped that the grouping would be launched before the 18th PECC [Pacific Economic Cooperation Council] general meeting which will be held in 18 months' time. The decision to form this loose informal grouping was born out of the necessity to maximise the potential in the East Asian region and opposing perceptions to the EAEC are coloured by non-economic factors, she said here. The ASEAN Secretriat is in the midst of talks with the potential launch members towards determining the objectives of the grouping. The reasons behind the formation of the EAEC are basic and sane, she reiterated while assuaging fears that the grouping would evolve into a trade bloc. Speaking from the perspective of East Asia and open regionalism, she pointed out the trade and investment inter-dependence in East Asia was equally significant when compared with the region's trade with the rest of the world. We are all export-led economies, she said to underscore the fact that the proposed grouping would remain a loose consultative forum and consistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). On APEC, she said that group had strayed from its original objective into a new format, heightened by the informal leaders summit in Seattle.
