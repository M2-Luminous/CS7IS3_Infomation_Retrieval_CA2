Megawati, joining in the debate about who should succeed President Suharto if he steps down in 1998, stressed that the succession should proceed constitutionally. "I know President Suharto is a wise man who knows very well that everything should be in line with the 1945 Constitution," she said as she wound up her tour of the province on Sunday. The succession debate resurfaced last week with a statement from Donald Wilson, an American author who has written about President Suharto's leadership, that the incumbent leader "knows when to step down" and that he would not be president for life. Suharto, now 72 years old, was reelected for his sixth five-year term in office last year. There is now growing speculation that he will step down in 1998, if not before because of his age. The president however has not publicly disclosed his intentions. Megawati, who was elected by popular vote in an unprecedented party congress in December declined to go into detail when pressed if she would consider running for the presidency. "I'd rather keep the answer to myself," she said, but stressed that the political elite should heed what the people have to say about the next leader. She warned that the more the Indonesian people are educated, the more they will understand their political rights and that only leaders with broad horizons will be elected. PDI, the smallest of the three organizations sanctioned by the government to contest the general election, also urged the abolishment of the controversial "floating mass" system, which bars the rural masses from politics except during elections. Under this policy, political organizations are barred from setting up branch offices below regency or mayoralty levels. PDI and the United Development Party (PPP) say the system benefits their rival, the government-backed Golkar [Functional Group] because all village heads who can mobilize the masses, are effectively Golkar cadres. Both PDI and PPP have been demanding that they be allowed equal access to reach the grassroots supporters in villages so that they can compete on equal footing. [passage omitted]
