He said that it is no secret that the constitutional reforms will not solve the country's urgent problems but will instead serve to set the guidelines for the new nation that Venezuelans can build. The president made these statements during the presentation of a new book by COPRE [Presidential Committee for State Reform] President Ricardo Conveias entitled "A Constitution for the Future [Una Constitucion Para el Futuro],'' a collection of reflections on the constitutional reform draft bill that the bicameral commission, over which Rafael Caldera himself previously presided, will present. [Begin recording] [Caldera] At this time, with the country's need for change and a need to face up to its problems, the topic of constitutional reform is fundamental and cannot be postponed. I am convinced of the country's urgent need to carry out constitutional reforms. Parliamentary experience shows that a draft bill in the lawmaking process that is begun during a legislative period, even though it may be badly needed, generally speaking does not get approved until the following legislative period. There would be no reason to waste all that effort during the preceding period and not take advantage of the fact that with only one more debate to go in the Senate a big commission that represents all sectors and fulfills all hopes could review the bill in depth for a second debate in the Senate, for reconsideration in the Chamber of Deputies, and then submit it this year to a popular referendum. [Conveias] It is a delicate task but one of great significance, especially taking into account the country's current situation. Congress, in assuming this huge and delicate job, will somehow reconcile itself and give the country the possibility of having a new constitution through a popular referendum. We believe a deadline should be set for this and we must all assume the sacred mission of naming a constituent assembly, which will be complemented with the favorable vote cast by the majority of voters the day of the referendum. This task is important, it is a priority, and it should not restrain congressmen from carrying out other important legislative and control tasks. [end recording] Dr. Conveias insisted that their intention is not to impose deadlines on Congress but that congressmen should impose it on themselves so they can be in tune with the Venezuelan people's demands.
