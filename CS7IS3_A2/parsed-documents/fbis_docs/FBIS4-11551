The spaciousness of this new avenue that skirts the bay, along with the care with which the preparations are being made, portend a special splendor to this massive gesture, despite the fact that the inevitable austerity of the current moment prevents our using certain equipment and other material resources. Yadira Garcia, a member of the Politburo and first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Matanzas, said that the people of Matanzas have the special responsibility this year of expressing the joy, militancy, and steadfastness not only of the people of the province, but of all the people throughout the nation. Making the closing speech today [date not specified] at a meeting to review preparations for the 1 May activity, Garcia recalled that this year there will be parades only in Matanzas and Pinar del Rio. She expressed her confidence that the parade to be held in the City of Matanzas will be a success, and announced that over 100 foreign guests will attend. This meeting, held at the Atenas movie theater, was attended by administrative and union representatives from all sectors, the UJC [Union of Young Communists], and the mass organizations, and was characterized by great enthusiasm, expressed in exchanges of emulative challenges between unions.
