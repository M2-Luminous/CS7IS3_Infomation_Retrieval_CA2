FBIS4-32772 "drlat104__a94004" FBIS-WEU-94-104-A Daily Report 27 May 1994 ANNEX Brazil Official Proposes Reviving Intelligence Services Official Proposes Reviving Intelligence Services PY2805002694 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 27 May 94 p 5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY2805002694 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Portuguese BFN [Text] Brasilia -- Strategic Affairs Secretary (SAE) Mario Cesar Flores on 26 May proposed the resurrection of old security and intelligence services -- such as the DSI (Security and Intelligence Division) and ASI (Security and Intelligence Advisory Office) -- within nonmilitary ministries for the purpose of fighting corruption. Flores believes the resurrection of these services must be studied carefully so as to prevent a recurrence of what happened during the military government, that is, the establishment of virtual parallel governments within the respective ministries. "It is a good preventive measure to have internal intelligence services within ministries. Care must be taken, however, to prevent them from becoming virtual parallel governments as they did in the past," Flores said during a lecture he gave at a seminar entitled: Intelligence Activities Within a Democratic State, which is being sponsored by the Chamber of Deputies National Defense Committee. Flores also proposed the creation of intelligence agencies that would temporarily operate abroad -- whenever the need arises for obtaining confidential information in other countries. Flores said: "Brazil used to have agencies abroad. At present, it has none." Upon noting that Brazilian diplomats may obtain public information such as that published by the press, Flores noted that diplomats should not act as secret agents. He said: "Diplomats may supply routine information. But there are cases in which diplomats should not get involved because if they are caught carrying out secret, illegal activities they end up being expelled from the host country." In his lecture, Flores stated that it will be incumbent upon the new president to organize the Brazilian intelligence service. He said: "In its administrative reform, the future government will probably promote a central intelligence organization that will be conceived as part of the package of organizations answering to the president." In his opinion, the new government will have to create a national defense council, which will consist of representatives from the Justice Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, the Armed Forces General Staff (EMFA), the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the SAE. Flores believes the council will be primarily charged with reestablishing intelligence activities consistent with a democratic system.
