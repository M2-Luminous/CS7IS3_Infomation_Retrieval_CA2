The 144th motorized rifle division turned over the remainder of the Aegviidu polygon, roughly 300 hectares. Since the rest had been received before, Aegviidu is now fully turned over. The Piirsalu storage facilities were taken over from the navy, making L�a�anemaa the 13th district that is `clean.' One third of the fuel terminal at Tallinn's North Harbor has been taken over. Documents to be signed are with the commander of the Northwest sector, as are those for the Hydrographic Service of the Baltic fleet. During the last week of the year just ended, roughly 40 armored vehicles were taken out by rail from the Klooga and Tallinn units of the 144th motorized rifle division. The Mines of Naissaare Out of the previously determined number of 330 newer type sea mines at Naissaare, 282 had been removed by December 25. Only 48 mines are left that can be put on one ship of the `Girocompass' type. There were also 1,454 mines of the older type. Out of those 828 have been destroyed by burning, leaving a balance of 626. However, the pace of work has slacked off a bit lately, because out of the 37 navy personnel, only 18 are left. According to authorities at the Tallinn naval base, mine clearing at Naissaare should be completed by April 1, even though experts think the job could be completed within a month. Packing Noted at the Radio Reconnaissance Station Packing is also going on at the radio reconnaissance center at Vana-Aaviku, near J�uri, in the Harjumaa district. At one time, this object belonged to KGB, but was later turned over to the navy. Its operating reach covered the coastal areas of the United States and Canada, and the Mediterranean region, not to mention the continent of Europe. The center itself did not pose any particular danger to Estonia but, since it was aimed from our territory against other states, it was that much more troublesome politically. Now, the dismantling of receivers has begun. The senders are still in place, but the station as a whole is no longer operational. Local commanders think that dismantling will be completed in February. After that, the buildings and antennas will be turned over to Estonia. (The equipment is obsolete and Estonia does not need it). In contrast to many others, this object is in good order, nothing has been broken. In summary, one could say that foreign troops are leaving, indeed, but at a very slow pace. In tomorrow's paper, we shall try to analyze why this is so.
