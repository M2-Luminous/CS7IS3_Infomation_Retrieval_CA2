FR940128-2-00138 FR940128-2-00088 Finally, Schaefer argues that, even if the District Court should have entered judgment in connection with its April 4, 1989 order remanding the case to the Secretary, the fact remains that it did not. And since no judgment was entered, he contends, the 30-day time period for filing an application for EAJA fees cannot have run. We agree. An EAJA application may be filed until 30 days after a judgment becomes ``not appealable''_ i.e., 30 days after the time for appeal has ended. See section 2412(d)(1)(B), (d)(2)(G); see also Melkonyan, 501 U.S., at XXX , 111 S.Ct., at 2165. Rule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure establishes that, in a civil case to which a federal officer is a party, the time for appeal does not end until 60 days after ``entry of judgment,'' and that a judgment is considered entered for purposes of the rule only if it has been ``entered in compliance with Rul[e] 58 *␣*␣* of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.'' Fed. R. App. Proc. 4(a)(1), (7). Rule 58, in turn, requires a district court to set forth every judgment ``on a separate document'' and provides that ``[a] judgment is effective only when so set forth.'' See United States v. Indrelunas, 411 U.S. 216, 220, 93 S.Ct. 1562, 1564, 36 L.Ed.2d 202 (1973) (per curiam). Since the District Court's April 4 remand order was a final judgment, see ante , at 2630, a ``separate document'' of judgment should have been entered. It is clear from the record that this was not done. The Secretary does not dispute that, but argues that a formal ``separate document'' of judgment is not needed for an order of a district court to become appealable. That is quite true, see 28 U.S.C. 1291; Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, 435 U.S. 381, 98 S.Ct. 1117, 55 L.Ed.2d 357 (1978) (per curiam); Finkelstein, supra, 496 U.S. at 628, n. 7, 110 S.Ct., at 2665, n. 7, but also quite irrelevant. EAJA's 30-day time limit runs from the end of the period for appeal, not the beginning. Absent a formal judgment, the District Court's April 4 order remained ``appealable'' at the time that Schaefer filed his application for EAJA fees, and thus the application was timely under section 2412(d)(1). 6 6 We disagree with Justice STEVENS' assertion that ``the respondent has prevailed precisely because the District Court in this case did enter a remand order without entering a judgment.'' Post , at 2633, n. 2 (emphasis in original). By entering a sentence-four remand order, the District Court did enter a judgment ; it just failed to comply with the formalities of Rule 58 in doing so. That was error but, as detailed in the text, the relevant rules and statutes impose the burden of that error on the party seeking to assert an untimeliness defense, here the Secretary. Thus, contrary to Justice STEVENS' suggestion, see post , at 2633, n. 2, our ruling in favor of respondent is not at all inconsistent with the proposition that sentence four and sentence six provide the exclusive methods by which district courts may remand a section 405 case to the Secretary. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed. Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justices White, O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, and Thomas joined. Justice Stevens filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Blackmun joined. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1922 Filed 1&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4190&hyph;29&hyph;P
