In addition, the financial order was chaotic and exacerbation of the uneven development among regions and systems of ownership and between industry and agriculture was more obvious than in previous years. The year 1994 will be a year of policy adjustments and intensified reform. We hope that textile enterprises, while comprehending the macroeconomic situation, will better grasp the helm of enterprise reform. In 1993 China's national economy remained on the fast track. In the first half of the year, the economy achieved exceedingly high 14.1 percent growth. In June the state adopted a series of macroeconomic control measures. In the second half of the year, financial order turned around somewhat, the scale of investment came under control to a certain extent, and the domestic economic environment clearly improved. Compared with the last few years, 1993 still could be considered a rapid-growth year. Annual gross national product (GNP) is expected to break 3 trillion yuan, calculated according to comparative prices, the growth rate will be about 13 percent. The total value of output of industry at the township level and above is estimated to have grown by 30.2 percent in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, the growth rate tended to slow, and the annual increase over the previous year is expected to be about 21 percent. Fixed asset investment still maintained an exceedingly high growth rate. This is directly related to the chaotic financial situation. A great many units by short-term loans in violation of the rules carried out different forms of arbitrary raising of funds without the permission of the authorized departments. The resulting financial confusion caused a decrease in banks' sources of funds, making it difficult for them to support the requirements of production and circulation and forcing the state to issue a large amount of currency. Cash issuance rapidly increased. In the first half of 1992, 2.1 billion yuan in currency was withdrawn from circulation, but in the same period in 1993, an additional 52.8 billion yuan was issued. The difference between the decrease and the increase was 50.7 billion yuan. Financial chaos also led to enterprises' circumventing state macroeconomic controls and raising a large amount of funds to guarantee projects, expanding the scale of investment. In the first half of 1993, fixed asset investment grew by 60 percent. Within that, investment in fixed assets under the ownership of the whole people grew by 70.7 percent. After the state adopted macroeconomic control measures in the last half of June, financial order improved somewhat and the chaotic situation of arbitrary short-term loans, arbitrary raising of funds, and arbitrary establishment of financial organizations was essentially curbed. The rate of development was slowed somewhat, restraining new starts to a certain extent. In the second half of the year, the investment growth rate will decline somewhat, but still maintain an exceedingly high rate of growth. It is estimated that annual fixed asset investment for the whole society could reach 1.15 trillion yuan, an increase of about 46 percent over the previous year, becoming the year with the greatest increase since the 1980s. Its major characteristics were that the share of investment in the state budget further declined and the share of investment outside the budget (domestic loans, self-raised funds, and the use of foreign funds) rose further. But enterprise shortage of funds still is rather pronounced, causing serious difficulties for normal enterprise production and operations. A great many enterprises, because they lack funds, have no way to purchase raw materials, affecting the production of products that the market urgently needs and making them stop production or partially stop production. In September the production growth rate of state industrial enterprises was only 6.8 percent. Some enterprises were in arrears on staff wages. "Triangular debt" staged a comeback and mutual loan arrearage among enterprises still exists. The main cause of the shortage of enterprise funds is that money was tightened, which created a new batch of triangular debts. From June through August, the banks recalled a large amount of short-term loan funds, but precisely during the same period in 1992, they put out a large amount of short-term funds. The increase and the decrease actually reduced the utilization of funds. Moreover, a large portion of the short-term loan funds recalled were enterprise circulating funds. With the decline in the growth rate of the economy and the lowering of the intermediate demand, some enterprises lacking in competitiveness naturally could encounter sales difficulties on the cooling market, and reserves could rise with corresponding stagnation and waste of some funds. With the "three fevers" (real estate fever, stock fever, and development zone fever), banks loaned funds to subordinate companies to speculate on real estate and the central bank demanded repayment in a limited time. Actually, it could not be repaid. So, some banks could only block enterprise liquid capital as a stopgap. In some places, enterprises with savings in the bank could not take money out. The income and the consumption of residents both rose and the market was stable in the midst of overall prosperity. In the first half of the year, residents maintained worth by competing to buy, but in the second half of the year this essentially disappeared. Prices of imported home appliances and gold jewelry went back down somewhat. As regards the overall supply and demand for consumer items on the market, the supply remained greater than the demand. It is estimated that the annual social commodity retail sales figure will reach 1.35 trillion yuan, an increase of about 23 percent over the previous year. Deducting the price factor, the actual increase is about 9 percent. The disparity between the rural market and the urban market is rather great. Increases in the income and the consumption level of rural residents still are clearly lower than the national average. Income of rural and urban residents continues to increase and the standard of living has improved somewhat, but the disparity between the incomes of urban and rural residents is gradually widening. According to preliminary calculations, the ratio of the actual annual income of urban and rural residents will expand to about 6:1 from 2.8:1 in 1992. It is estimated that the annual per capita living expenses of urban residents will reach 2,350 yuan. With the price factor deducted, this is an actual increase of about 12 percent over the previous year. The per capita net income of rural residents is about 860 yuan. With the price factor deducted, it is an actual increase of about 2 percent over the previous year. The fact that increases in farmers' income are not much, is the crux of the difficulty for overall agricultural production and favorable development of the national economy. The inflation rate remains rather high. Since 1993, with the "overheating" economy beginning to cool, prices exhibited an overall rise, climbing from month to month. In the first three quarters, retail prices rose 12 percent on average and the prices of residents' living expenses rose 14 percent, with those in 35 large and medium-sized cities rising about 20 percent. The economy continuously cooled, but prices remained high. The main reason was that prices are a delayed indicator. Although the economy had cooled, the delayed effect of the economic overheating in the previous stage continued to act on the prices of consumer items. This round of price rises came mainly from the state's making rather large adjustments or freeing up the prices of some items and services necessary for living such as grains; non-staple foods; fuel; rent, water, and electricity fees; transportation fees; and tuition while macroeconomic controls lacked the necessary complete measures, driving overall price levels up. With residents' income gradually rising and classes of consumption gradually opening up, some high consumers gave impetus to the rise in the prices of consumer items. The exchange rate of the renminbi for the U.S. dollar changed, causing the prices of import and export commodities to soar. In addition, such factors as increased wages also encouraged price rises. It is estimated that annual new increases in issuance of renminbi still will reach 145 billion yuan, and retail prices will rise about 13 percent over 1992 and prices of residents' living expenses will rise about 15 percent with prices in 35 large and medium-sized cities rising about 19 percent. Foreign trade formed a deficit and the international balance of payments was unbalanced. According to preliminary calculations, 1993 exports totalled about US$92 billion, an increase of about 7 percent over the previous year; and import totals will break US$100 billion, an increase of more than 24 percent. Foreign trade imports greater than exports led to greater foreign exchange expenditure than income and state foreign exchange reserves declined for a foreign trade deficit of approximately US$7.5 billion, the first in the 1990s. The imbalance in the international balance of payments exacerbated. The main reasons were that, beginning in 1993, prices on the domestic market rose rather high and foreign sales did not equal domestic sales. Some traditional large quantity export products declined greatly and export transactions also declined rather greatly, causing export reserves to be inadequate. Rapid economic growth, flourishing domestic demand, and the clearly rising reliance on imports, along with reduced import tariffs caused rapidly increased imports of raw materials in tight domestic demand such as rolled steel, copper, and aluminum. The continuous delivery of large batches of equipment ordered by large purchasing delegations that China sent to Europe and the United States in 1992 also were a cause of high import growth. In 1994 China is in transition to the market economy and a policy adjustment period. The economy has already entered sustained, rapid, healthy development. It is expected that the rate of economic growth will recede somewhat and the rate of growth of the national economy will be lower than in 1993, maintaining the rather high level of approximately 10 percent, which to a certain extent could relieve restraint on development of the national economy from the transportation "bottleneck" in recent years and curb large price rises, creating a good economic environment for adjustments in the economic structure and avoiding the occurrence of large rises and large falls in economic development and giving 1994 a "soft landing." Improved structural adjustment and maintenance of appropriate investment. Because of the influence of several factors, it is estimated that the rate of increase for fixed asset investment in the entire society will decline somewhat in 1994. Total investment will exceed 1.35 trillion yuan, but the actual growth rate for investment will be 1-2 percentage points higher than the actual growth rate of the GNP. Because in 1993 the state adopted macroeconomic control measures, generally eliciting the attention and the praise of people in foreign economic circles, in 1994 the maintenance of constant growth in the scale of foreign investment in Chinese fixed assets and the steady growth of the national economy will play an ever more important part. So, the maintenance of appropriate investment will help to guard against economic slippage and the intensification of the disparity between overall supply and overall demand will help to rationally adjust the economic structure. Given impetus by costs from the previous stage and affected by the delayed effect of excessive issuance of currency, it will be very difficult to curb inflation. It will be extremely difficult to think about maintaining price rises at 6 percent or under. Retail prices for the whole society in 1994 are expected to approach 10 percent. Urban resident cost of living price indices could exceed 10 percent. So, in 1994 we should adopt effective measures to keep prices down and avoid social problems caused by loss of macroeconomic controls and promote improvement in the economic environment. The economic environment has improved somewhat, helping to develop foreign trade exports. In 1994 China will be restored as a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Based on the consideration of being restored to GATT, at the beginning of the year, China announced a merging of the exchange rates. Because the world economy will tend to recover in 1994, the international market demand will increase somewhat, and the Chinese government will encourage increased exports, the 1994 domestic economic environment can be expected to be somewhat better than 1993. In addition, there is the devaluation of the yuan and the impetus to foreign trade that can come from that, especially the development of the export trade. But it still will be rather great difficult to increase the export trade to realize a balance of trade in 1994. It is estimated that in 1994 foreign trade will grow at the rate of about 16 percent and total growth will still be held down by the high rate of increase of foreign imports. Within that, imports will increase by about 21 percent over the previous year and exports will increase by about 10 percent over the previous year, and the annual trade deficit will be about US$10 billion.
