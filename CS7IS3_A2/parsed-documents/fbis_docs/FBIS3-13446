[passage omitted] In the first sermon I will briefly discuss the effects of prayers during the month of Ramadan and the self-development in those days. I will also devote the second sermon totally to the issue of Palestine and Jerusalem and the global effects of such an important issue. [passage omitted] Our nation which pays attention to prayers and evaluates the effects of its self-discipline should also recognize the value of such practices and not permit the incorrect and immature analysis of some so-called intellectuals, which is in fact narrow mindedness, to enter their mind with the idea that spending energy and time on prayers and fasting can be the cause of underdevelopment in economic and other issues. Even if such prayers did not exist and let us say that we could enjoy a strong economy, then we would have become like one of those advanced Western countries and that has never been our goal. It is impossible to have a strong society without such basic foundations for the development of human beings in today's world. You can see how world arrogance and imperialism repeatedly deal violent blows to the Third World countries stopping them from getting up and standing on their own feet. We see the source of our resistance in prayers even if that might seem trivial and common to some, but prayers are deeply wise and constructive. My point in this sermon is that we use this harvest that we have reaped from the holy month of Ramadan this year -- like other years, it is not an exceptional year -- to preserve the spirit of our piety throughout the year, especially since we are on the eve of a new year. With that same asset we are today rapidly taking the country forward in the face of so much conspiracy and mischief. As the country's chief executive I say that without the presence of those earnest people on the scene the country could not advance, with all its enemies, with the method with which it is being rebuilt, and at this speed -- that we were able to shrug off the new conspiracy of the arrogant powers about the fall of the price of oil and go on our way, I see the secret in those strong pillars of society and in the alertness of our people. One cannot help but admire a nation 30 percent of whose income is taken away from it, but it continues its programs as normal and does not declare a state of emergency. Despite all the propaganda and wicked plans to dishearten the people -- which one can sometimes hear from certain uninformed, or perhaps sincere, people inside the country -- the society continues on its course. We are now in the construction period. Our main slogan is construction. The blow they intended to deal us was to close that road to us. During the war they blockaded us to prevent us from obtaining arms. Or they created havoc inside the country to disrupt our security. In the construction period they intend to take away the tools of our construction, which is the budget. But they see today that they have come unstuck. [passage omitted] The great big shock wave with which they had planned to bring us to our knees has passed over this society like a breeze, and if there is any delay in some of the work the society is so aware that it can understand well. [passage omitted] I hope that the world of Islam fathoms clearly this correct direction of Iran's movement and that it finds its way, as our nation has, in Islam, the Koran, worship, contact with God, self-sacrifice and hard work.
