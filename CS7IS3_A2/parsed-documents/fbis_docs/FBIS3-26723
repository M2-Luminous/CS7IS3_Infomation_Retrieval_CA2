He also called on officers and soldiers stationed there. During the Spring Festival holidays, Liu Huaqing, braving drizzling rain, extended regards to workers at the Dongdu Dock worksite and its second-phase project and at the Customs joint inspection house in Xiamen, conveying to them and the people of Xiamen the cordial solicitude of the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. On 11 Feburary, after hearing a work report by Jia Qinglin, secretary of the Fujian provincial party committee and governor of Fujian, Liu Huaqing said: By implementing in-depth Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, implementing the guidelines of 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, as well as the Central Committee's series of major decisions, persisting in making economic construction the central task, and adopting effective measures, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government have brought about a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of Fujian's economy, quadrupling the province's gross product seven years ahead of schedule. Liu Huaqing said: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has issued the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establish of a Socialist Market Economic Structure." Therefore, leaders at all levels should become acquainted with new situations, study new issues, learn new knowledge, persist in simultaneously building material and spititual civilizations, handle well the relationship between overall interest and partial interest, and concentrate their efforts to accelerate economic development. He said: Since Fujian and Taiwan are separated by only a strip of water, the two sides should enhance their nongovernmental exchanges and strengthen their economic and technological cooperation. People on both sides of the strait will be happy if our economies become strong and powerful. During his stay in Fujian, Liu Huaqing, accompanied by Nanjing Military Region Commander Gu Hui, called on the officers and soldiers stationed in Xiamen, encouraging them to preserve and carry forward the traditions of the Red Army in the new situation and to strengthen army building in accordance with the general requirments -- all army units must be qualified politically and competent militarily. They must have a fine style of work, maintain strict discipline, and be assured of adequate logistical support -- as put forward by Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin. Liu Huaqing called on basic-level officers and soldiers of a group army on 13 February. He said: The People's Liberation Army bears the historic mission of protecting and building the country. At no time and under no circumstances should it forget this sacred duty and function. In the new situation of reform, opening up, and establishing a socialist market economy, officers and soldiers of the whole army must work hard, be selflessly dedicated, and subjugate personal interests to collective interests. Partial interests must be subjugated to overall interests and army building must be subjugated to the overall interests of national economic construction. He said: China's cause of liberation was achieved with the blood of tens of thousands of revolutionary martyrs. The establishment of New China has not been easy. It is because of the hard work of a few generations of people that it has developed to this day. Every generation should cherish our present-day achievements. Every soldier must contribute to the country's political stability and economic development. Liu Huaqing stressed: The key to improving army building lies in cadres. Party committees and leaders at all levels must keep constant tabs on their work of training cadres, enforce management and requirements strictly, and strengthen education and studies; they should bring into full play the subjective initiative of cadres at all levels as well as the role of veteran comrades in passing on experiences, giving help, and setting an example in training new cadres, and follow the method of letting higher-level units guide and educate lower-level units. Leaders at all levels must show sincere concern for the weal and woe of soldiers, solve practical problems of basic-level officers and soldiers, and guarantee that the working, living, and recreational conditions for basic-level cadres and soldiers are good in order to ensure that the masses of officers and soldiers will be content with their jobs at basic units in the army and continue to make contributions to the country.
