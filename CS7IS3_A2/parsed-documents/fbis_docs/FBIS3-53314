Speaking to IRNA Wednesday, 'Ali Shirzadian strongly denied the `U.S. Today' [as recieved] report on Iran's nuclear activities and said Iran is one of the active members of the Internaional Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and is faithful to its commitments as a signatory to the treaty. He noted that Iran's Atomic Energy Organization was committed to the principle of nuclear inspection adding that it had a clear policy and its activities had been for peaceful purposes. The spokesman further said that due to the Islamic Republic's commitment to the rules, the U.S. hostile propaganda against Iran's atomic activities had not least affected the IAEA decisions so far. He said that the organization's report to the council of governors on Iran's clear atomic policies last fall was a firm response to U.S. allegations against the Islamic republic. The IAEA secretary-genaral had said in his report that all the sites, buildings and laboratories inspected in Iran were devoid of any non-peaceful nuclear activities.
