Mohammad Yunus Kanuni, the political counselor at the Afghan Defense Ministry, told MENA that these youths' identities have not been ascertained yet but interrogation of other prisoners showed that they were Egyptian, Sudanese, and Algerian nationals. He regretted the fact that the names of those killed are not known so as to inform their families. He said that Hekmatyar's forces took away their passports as soon as they joined and gave them aliases that do not indicate their real identities. In reply to a question on how these youths had come to the areas of fighting in Afghanistan, Yunus said that a number of service offices that operate under false Islamic names succeeded in enticing these youths to come to Afghanistan under the false pretext of "Islamic jihad." The Afghan official expressed hope that Muslim youths will understand what the real situation in Afghanistan is before they think of traveling to it under false slogans that take jihad as their symbol. He added that the service offices treat these groups as mercenaries.
