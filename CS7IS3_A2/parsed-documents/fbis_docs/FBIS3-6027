FBIS3-6027 "dreas049_a_94023" FBIS-EAS-94-049 Document Type:Daily Report 14 March 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Party Heads on Realignment, Cabinet Reshuffle OW1203080694 OW1203080694 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo TV Asahi Network in Japanese at 0108 GMT on 6 March, during its weekly "Sunday Project" panel discussion program, carries a 47-minute live political debate including Tsutomu Hata, president of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), and Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), in Asahi's Tokyo studio, and by Komeito Chairman Koshiro Ishida in Osaka linked by remote hookup. Political commentator Soichiro Tawara acts as moderator, and two guest commentators -- Kyoto University Professor Masaaki Kosaka and journalist Hajime Takeno -- are also asked to give their views. The first 17 minutes of the debate are devoted to the recent political turmoil over a failed cabinet reshuffle plan by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. In the discussions, Hata and Ishida admit they had supported Hosokawa's plan to fire Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura from his post. But Murayama and Ouchi insist the plan was ill-conceived, and add it was good for the unity of the coalition that the plan was discarded. At 0125 GMT, the topic turns to the question of political realignment. Tawara says he believes that, from the time of the disagreement over the cabinet reshuffle incident, the coalition has been divided into two power centers -- Shinseito, Komeito and Hosokawa's Japan New Party on the one hand, and the DSP, the SDPJ, and Takemura's Sakigake (Harbinger Party) on the other. He then asks Murayama of the SDPJ if the coalition will continue to exist in in a two-group format. Murayama replies, "It so happened that the views (of the SDPJ, the DSP, and Sakigake) matched on the question of the national welfare tax and on the issue of the cabinet reshuffle, and there were agreements on ways to ensure coalition stability and solidifying cooperation." He insists, "This condition has not been intentionally created to counter the Shinseito-Komeito bloc, as alleged by some people." Tawara asks Ishida of Komeito if the coalition parties, in the face of the next general election, will eventually merge into one party or cooperate with each other while retaining their identities as separate parties. Ishida says the parties are "not yet in a condition of being able to accommodate other parties' positions" and to bring themselves together under one umbrella. Ishida, however, suggests all coalition member parties should move toward gathering together under one umbrella, insisting, "The election system requires that we move toward a two-party system." He notes that the "Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is a big opposition party with more than 220 seats in the lower house." Asked a similar question, Murayama of the SDPJ says, "The parties should cooperate (in the next general election) to ensure that the LDP does not return to power," but he says the cooperation does not mean that all the parties should merge into one force. Murayama says such a merger would be "impossible." At 0134 GMT, Ouchi of the DSP is asked to express his view on the issue of future political alignment. Ouchi says, "Political alignment really means forming new parties. All parties should make all possible efforts toward that end." However, noting that a failure to win in the next election could be a "catastrophe" for the coalition, he says the parties should not try to seek to form a single force at once from the beginning. He insists, "people who hold cautious stands and people aiming for higher targets should form parties of their own at first." He also says that in the next general election the coalition parties should do all they can to maintain the coalition government by cooperating with each other. He adds that one preferable way would be for the eight existing political groups in the coalition to merge into two or three parties, and for them to cooperate in the next election. Asked to give his views, Hata of Shinseito says, "It is important for all the parties to make endeavors to become one group," noting "we -- the parties of different backgrounds and political ideals -- have been able to surmount all the difficulties arising from these differences, and to maintain the coalition over the past seven months." Hata says the parties should either merge into one big party or form a single joint floor group in the Diet. Asked about reports that Komeito and Shinseito are heading for a merger, Ishida of Komeito asserts the reports are not correct. He says his party wants to create a new party which includes all other parties in the coalition. At 0148 GMT, guest commentators -- Professor Kosaka and journalist Takeno -- are asked to give their comments on the views of the four political party leaders. With the debate coming to close, Tawara brings up the question of the cabinet reshuffle once again. Recalling that one of the reasons people did not support Prime Minister Hosokawa's idea on a cabinet reshuffle was the "bad timing" of the announcement of the plan, with the 1994 budget yet to be cleared by the Diet. Tawara asks Ouchi of the DSP if a reshuffle would be possible once the Diet completes deliberations on the 1994 budget. Ouchi says, "Common sense tells me that if he wants to reshuffle the cabinet, he should do it after the regular session of the Diet closes and major bills have been taken care of." Murayama, Hata, and Ishihara also express similar views.
