Through 31 May, the National Action Party, PAN, spent 12.5 million new pesos. The PAN urged the other parties to publicly disclose their finances and stated that it has well-founded doubts regarding financial reports presented by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI. In Chiapas, 60,000 people left the Party of the Democratic Revolution, PRD, to protest the way party leaders nominated candidates. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 7 Jun 94) On the occasion of Freedom of the Press Day on 7 June, PRD presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solarzano signed a document advocating the creation of a pluralistic social communication council that would guarantee freedom of expression. Cardenas said freedom of the press in Mexico is still very limited. Labor Party, PT, presidential candidate Cecilia Soto Gonzalez said she received death threats last week. She rejected that such threats could affect the coming elections, however. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 7 Jun 94) PT's Soto underscored during a meeting with teachers that only a coalition government will be able to meet the needs and demands posed by Mexico's current situation. As for the skirmish between PAN and PT militants over destruction of PT political propaganda by PAN followers in Durango, Soto noted that the PAN attitude is censurable. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 9 Jun 94) Also on Freedom of the Press Day, the presidential candidates made an unprecedented joint appearance before the media. PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo indicated that there are two candidates who seek to tarnish Mexico's image. He added that Mexico has problems, but it also has victories and great potential. Intolerance should not prevail and there is intolerance when constitutional reforms that have received the support of most Mexicans are being criticized, he added. Zedillo criticized Cardenas' intolerance and uncivilized attitude while urging his opponents to hold "personal dialogues" to ensure clean elections. Alvaro Perez Trevino, candidate for the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, stated: "I will not invest a penny for glory. We will strive so Mexicans have a guaranteed access to jobs, health care, welfare, and education." Popular Socialist Party candidate Marcela Lombardo said it is unfair to try to establish a bipartite system in Mexico, and Mexico wants a genuine democratic regime to strengthen its sovereignty. The PRD's Cardenas denounced the existence of shady relations between the government and some media, and accused private television of becoming one of the pillars of the PRI. Cardenas also accused the PAN of condoning the alleged "electoral fraud" that gave the victory to President Salinas in 1988. National Opposition Union candidate Pablo Madero stressed: "Democracy feeds on tolerance and respect for the will of people. The tripartite system seeks to trade with the popular vote." Rafael Aguilar, candidate for the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, claimed that following the last debate, there was a feeling that an arrangement outside the popular will had been concocted. In this arrangement, the PRI secured the presidency before 21 August while the PAN and the PRD candidates obtained the first and second vice presidencies beforehand. Mexican Green Ecologist Party candidate Jorge Gonzalez argued: "Mexico demands justice, honesty, democracy, and congruity in politics and public administration. Colosio's case has become a mockery of Mexicans. The corruption that pervades the police force and the judicial system is becoming unbearable." PT's Cecilia Soto said: "I want to urge you to build a bridge so that Mexicans can overcome apathy, intolerance, and the inability to conceive a new way of life for Mexicans." (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 8 Jun 94) The private sector has voiced mixed views regarding the 10-point proposal presented by Ernesto Zedillo. The Mexican Council of Businessmen stated the proposal was clear and precise and that it will lead Mexico to steady growth in 1995. Meanwhile, Raimundo Artiz, president of the National Processing Industry Association, said Zedillo's presentation was just a campaign speech and will not help solve the economic problems. Artiz added that if the PRI candidate wins, Mexico's economic prospects will be even worse than those of the last six years. Salvador Lopez, president of the National Chamber of Commerce, noted that it was too soon to voice an opinion on Zedillo's proposal while urging the remaining candidates to present their proposals for the benefit of the public. Eduardo Bours, president of the National Agricultural-Livestock Council, said Zedillo's proposal is part of a great national concern to give the countryside the significance it deserves because it suggested viable solutions that will help this sector grow. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 8 Jun 94 p 12) Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, presidential candidate for the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, has visited Veracruz and said Mexicans are prepared for change and demand respect for the people's vote. Aguilar said there are favorable conditions for peace and social calm for the elections.

He also visited neighborhoods in southern Hermosillo. As to the Colosio case, Fernandez said the final word has not been given, adding it is a very difficult crime to solve. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 4 June 94) Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate for the Green Ecologist Party, has visited (Tlamanalco Municipality), Mexico State, and said one or two debates are not enough to discuss the great problems the country faces.

Regarding the Colosio assassination, he has said: "It all seemed to indicate it was a plot, but to say it was an assassin who acted alone is a simplistic view." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 4 June 94) Cecilia Soto, presidential candidate for the Labor Party, has visited Guadalajara and protested because her party has been excluded by the Government Secretariat from holding negotiations on political reform. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 4 June 94) PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo has announced in Tlanepantla Municipality, Mexico State, one of the most industrialized in the country, he will implement a policy for the creation of jobs. "My intention is to draft an economic policy to promote investments because investments generate stable, productive, well-paying jobs," Zedillo has said. He added his biggest challenge will be to create 10 million jobs before the year 2000, when all fiscal and tax obstacles faced by businessmen should be eliminated. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 3 June 94) Zedillo had a breakfast meeting with members of the Permanent Agrarian Congress in Mexico City. During the meeting, Zedillo said the crisis in the countryside has produced sad faces, discouragement, and even violence, as in the case of Chiapas. Zedillo said peasants do not understand the Program of Direct Support to the Countryside. He said the government should stop subsidizing poverty and the state should end paternalistic policies. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 4 June 94) Speaking to university students from public and private high schools, Zedillo said differences can be overcome through dialogue and debate, adding that pressure by inflexible minority groups do not scare him. Zedillo also talked about the environment and said he who contaminates it should pay for the damage, and he who protects the environment must be rewarded.
