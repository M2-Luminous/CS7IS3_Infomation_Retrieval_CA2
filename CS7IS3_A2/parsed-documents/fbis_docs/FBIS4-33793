The party and government take initiatives there that involve the masses when solving problems. The words consistency and determination are no longer theory but reality in Caibarien Municipality, north Villa Clara Province. Raul saw this during his tour of the area. Major Jimenez Vazquez, head of the municipal general staff, briefed Raul on the area's level of defense preparedness, the territory's political and moral state, and the development of the food program with the people's help in solving problems. Caibarien Municipality is recognized as being prepared defensively at the second stage for several reasons, including: the completion of fortified projects, the detailed preparation of the cadres in the six defense zones, the authorization of the warning system, and the ability to transport in case of enemy attack. Defense Day was completed successfully with specialists giving practical and theoretical classes. Furthermore, Caibarien is contributing more to the territorial militia in preparation for combat. The municipality has perfected the Unified Vigilance and Protection System and the equipment and armaments are ready to be put into action. [passage omitted] Raul and his delegation met workers at the municipal organic gardens -- the most outstanding in the province -- where he was able to see developments in the production of vegetables and tubers for the population. Raul expressed his satisfaction when he saw the good political and moral state of those workers, who labor every day with great responsibility. [passage omitted] The tour through Caibarien included a visit to the Campanas de las Villas contingent, which is working on the Caibarien-Cayo Santa Maria embankment. A total of 42 kilometers have already been completed. Orlando Rodriguez, head of the contingent, explained the progress made on the project, the collective's experiences, and the fuel-saving initiatives and innovations. Construction on the embankment is top quality and is being carried out with environmental protection in mind. Access to the beaches of Villa Clara's northern keys will help develop the Cuban tourist industry. Raul was interested in touring the completed portion of the embankment, particularly the embankment's new bridge. Raul conversed with the workers en route to the project and encouraged them to continue. Raul was amazed by the magnificent project and posed for a photograph with the workers and his delegation at the end of the embankment as a souvenir of his visit. This project, devised by our commander in chief, demonstrates how man can overcome any obstacle regardless of difficulty.
