A certain amount of tension exists in relations between Russia and Latvia, and it is connected first and foremost with the situation of the Russian-speaking population in this Baltic Republic, and also with the presence of Russian servicemen there. It seems that these issues were at the focus of attention of those taking part in the news conference. However, let us listen to Ulmanis himself. Trusting the assembled journalists' promises not to criticize him for his incorrect use of Russian, the president summed up the results of his visit: [Begin Ulmanis recording] We came here with the firm intention of expressing our attitude to those issues that are presently hampering the existence of normal, good-neighborly and, I would say, friendly relations between our two neighboring countries. The issues in question are the withdrawal of troops, the elimination of the Skrunda radar station, and matters relating to economic relations. I must straightaway acknowledge that I met with full mutual understanding on President Yeltsin's part. As a result, one treaty, three agreements, and one protocol have been signed. The documents boil down essentially to the total and unconditional withdrawal of Russia's troops before 31 August 1994. In the course of talks with the defense minister it was stated that the troops might be withdrawn considerably earlier. A treaty was signed on the status of the Skrunda radar station. It will have the status of a military establishment under civilian control, and cannot have the status of a military base. An agreement was also signed on social guarantees for all the people affected by this process. In the main, this concerns the military pensioners and their future destiny. We view this package of documents as a unified whole and as a regrettable necessity, with which history has presented us. It is viewed as a unified package of documents, which pursues the single goal of normalizing relations between the two states. Two things recently have been very important for us: We have received from the Russian side information on the numbers of military pensioners. As president, I need always to know this figure by heart. There are 22,320 of these people, and the social guarantees apply to them. Secondly, we are together with the Russian side creating a repatriation fund, which will help in a civilized way those people so wishing to leave Latvia. I am left deeply impressed by all that has happened today, since history has never before known a day when the national anthem of a free Latvia has been played in a free Russia. I should very much like this day to have broken the ice of distrust and the hostility -- we shall not hide it -- which has existed both in Russia and in Latvia, because our task and our results will only be positively achieved when the population of Latvia and the population of Russia begin thinking in the way that we now desire.
