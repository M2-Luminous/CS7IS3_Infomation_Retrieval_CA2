Xiao Rong, an NPC deputy of the PLA, who had just hurried back home from Japan after participating in a ceremony for the first publication of the Japanese edition of the book My Father, Deng Xiaoping, made the above remarks in an interview with these staff reporters at the plenary session of the NPC delegation of the PLA today. The reporters asked: "What is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's current health?" Xiao Rong said: "He is very health now. Of course, at his old age, he is not like he used to be. But for a 90-year-old man, his health is not bad. He reads a dozen or so papers daily and he watches news bulletins on television. Like other NPC deputies, he also reads some documents about the current NPC session. The reporters asked Xiao Rong whether Comrade Xiaoping also reads JIEFANGJUN BAO daily, and she said without hesitation: "Of course, JIEFANGJUN BAO is an important paper. My father has to read it every day because he is a veteran serviceman. From the Red Army to the Eighth Route Army to the PLA, and finally acting as the chairman of the Central Military Commission, he has always been very concerned about army building. Although he is retired now, he likes to read JIEFANGJUN BAO as he used to." Xiao Rong also answered this question: "Why has Comrade Xiaoping spent the Spring Festival in Shanghai over the past seven years?" Xiao Rong said: "My father likes Shanghai. He attaches special importance to Shanghai's important position in China's reform and opening up and economic development. He thinks Shanghai's role cannot be replaced by any other place. During my father's stay in Shanghai over the last Spring Festival, he witnessed its huge changes and happily commented: `It's really good!' He had never said this before." Then Xiao Rong smilingly recalled and said: When my father saw the newly built Yanggao road in Pudong he was very cheerful and composed an "impromptu poem:" "Seeing the road today is better than reading for one hundred years." At that time, I said: You've never composed a poem before, why have you come up with one today? My father said seriously: "These words are from my heart." As he said this, everyone on the spot laughed including Shanghai Municipal Party Secretary Wu Bangguo and Mayor Huang Ju. Finally, the reporters asked: "When will the second volume of My Father, Deng Xiaoping, (whose author is Mao Mao, that is, Xiao Rong) which has long been expected by readers, be published?" Xiao Rong disclosed: "I am now making preparations to write the book."
