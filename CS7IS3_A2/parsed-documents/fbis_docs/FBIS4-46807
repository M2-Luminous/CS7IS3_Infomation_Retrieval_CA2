Sarkisyan: "Is Forum `Going Into Battle?'"] [Text] The Fourth Armenian Businessmen's Forum has completed its work. The organization, created with the purpose of combining the efforts of business people and helping Armenia, which is going through transition period difficulties, finally has made it to the big league. This happened at the price of debunking a myth nurtured for decades: That all the diaspora as a whole and its business circles in particular think about is the good of their historic homeland. It turned out that most of them if they have not lost interest in the Motherland entirely, at the very least are quite indifferent to it. It also became clear for everyone that there is no place for charity in business. Emotions are nice, but business may flourish only if the necessary financial and legal base have been created for it. And last, the forum participants have realized that their attention should center on the interests of Armenian economy. The efforts of Armenian businessmen should be directed at its prosperity. Correspondingly, they will reap dividends due them only if this goal is achieved. Let us start from the beginning, though. The latest forum resembled only remotely the first one, which had been marked by pomp and universal euphoria. It differed in the composition of participants as well. Of the 120 foreign guests, 80 were our Iranian compatriots. I should note that four years ago there were guests from more than 50 countries. In this connection, France d'Arteng, the French ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the Republic of Armenia, very tactfully and, of course, quite correctly pointed out that this was to be expected. And in fact, unlike in the United States and France, Armenians in the Near East, in particular in Iran, live in communities, are better organized, and have retained their ethnic values and hence the attachment to their historic homeland. Besides, Iran is our neighbor; transportation questions between us do get resolved one way or the other; banking ties are being established; the population's standard of living, the degree of technological development do not differ substantially. So why not trade? It was the fortuitous combination of these two circumstances that has led to a rather resolved Iranian delegation landing in Yerevan. This was matched by the atmosphere in the government's conference hall, where the forum participants held their meetings. For two days they discussed ways to overcome the stagnation that has settled into their work. Many quite openly--bordering on unfairly--expressed doubt in the abilities of this organization's leadership. It came to a point where the board chairman, V. Dzhazmadaryan, remarked that he might as well step down. Of course, the personality factor plays an important role in any undertaking. Seriously speaking, however, the main topic of the forum was the need to provide forward momentum. Among objective reasons the only one that actually stands in the way is the lack of a proper legislative base. Jumping ahead, I will say that Armenian Supreme Council Deputy Ye. Shamshyan informed the businessmen that a draft law on protection of foreign investment is being readied to be submitted for discussion. Moreover, he asked for proposals as to what normative acts are needed in order to get things moving. Very little has been accomplished over the past few years. Not just in absolute terms, which would be understandable and explainable, but even taking into account the opportunities available both in the republic and outside it. Especially impressive were remarks by O. Seferyan from India; A. Ter-Torosyan, a businessman from the United States; A. Asriyan, the Armenian Entrepreneurs Union's Chairman; and L. Agaronyan, the chairman of the Armenian-Iranian Chamber of Commerce. In particular, among priorities they named the need to get compatriots from CIS countries involved, to develop more flexible and effective forms of participation in resolving the tasks facing Armenia, but of most importance, to begin concrete work. The primary means to serve this goal will be the Corporation of Armenian Businessmen joint-stock society, set up by the forum, which will assist in the development of small- and medium-size business. Judging by the participants' enthusiasm, its charter capital will exceed by far the originally planned $200,000. As to expected dividends, nobody can guarantee them. As in any business, there is risk. Napoleon used to say that the most important part is to get into a battle, and then see. The Armenian Businessmen's Forum has moved from words to action. Among things on the drawing board is to create with the participation of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development a financial corporation with a charter capital of $12 million, which will meet the highest standards of a commercial bank. As to the forum organization, the audience was not ready for normal work, and there was a shortage of information materials. During Mme. d'Arteng's speech, the forum's Board Secretary Ruben Grigoryan had to give up his seat in the Presidium to the interpreter. And when Mr. A. Sobkhani, Iran's acting charge d'affairs in Armenia, took the floor, there was no interpreter in the conference hall at all. In desperation, he addressed the audience half-jokingly in Armenian: "There are so many Armenians from Iran here; how can it be that there is no interpreter?" And then he and an interpreter took turns at the microphone... Trifles perhaps? Depends how you look at it. In any case, if these are trifles, they are certainly unpleasant ones. Another conference of Armenian businessmen is behind us. Also behind us is another year of work, the only result of which is the emergence of the Corporation of Armenian Businessmen. There is another year ahead of us--until another forum, or rather, a whole year which, I am sure, will finally show who is who among businessmen and what their word is worth.
