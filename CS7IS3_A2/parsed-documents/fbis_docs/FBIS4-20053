Three main subjects were discussed: the problem of the increase in long-term interest rates in the wake of the gradual increase in interest rates in the United States; the question of how to follow up support to Russia following the IMF's financing worth 10 billion francs; and the functioning of the international capital markets. On his journey to Washington, French Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery once again expressed satisfaction at the French economic picture, which he was preparing to explain in detail to his interlocutors. All the economic indicators in France "are moving in the right direction," Edmond Alphandery stressed, and the recovery is all the stronger because it is being led by all components of demand: better export performance, investment spending, the construction of houses, and household consumption. The economy minister thinks that the official growth forecasts of 1.4 percent "now look rather cautious" to several economic bodies. "Some think that we should exceed that figure," he pointed out. To achieve that, three factors would have to be present: an increase in the rate of exports thanks to an improvement in the international environment; a stronger resumption of investment; and a rebuilding of stocks.
