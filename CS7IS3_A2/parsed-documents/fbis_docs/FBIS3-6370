Ambassador for Nuclear Affairs Kim Sam-hun told a press conference Thursday afternoon, "Now is a time when we should mobilize all possible means." He said his government has been led to doubt if the government should or can carry on efforts to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. "We cannot fulfill what have been agreed on at this time when North Korea has not kept agreed matters," Ambassador Kim said. He thus hinted that the third-round U.S.-North Korea high-level talks could be put off indefinitely and the `94 Team Spirit exercise carried out. Kim said North Korea has expressly violated the agreement it reached with the IAEA on last Feb. 15 and another it made with the United States on Feb. 25. Saying that a final decision would depend on the outcomes of the next inter-Korean working-level contact slated for March 19 and a special IAEA Board of Governors meeting on March 21, the ambassador said, however, "The patience of the international community let alone our government's has almost exhausted." Regarding the issue of Patriot missiles, he said that no final decision has been made yet on the matter. "But, if it becomes impossible to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue, we don't see any reason why we should delay their deployment in Korea especially because the Patriots are basically defensive weapons," Kim said. He said that if and when the special IAEA Board of Governors meeting refers the North Korean nuclear issue to the United Nations Security Council, the Seoul government would respect and follow the decision. "At this moment, our government is really tired and feels the strong skepticism if we should continue to regard North Korea as the other side in dialogue," Kim said.
