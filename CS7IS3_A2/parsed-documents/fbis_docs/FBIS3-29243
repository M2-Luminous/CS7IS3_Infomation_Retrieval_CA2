The coalition government has compiled the fiscal 1994 budget for the first time since it was inaugurated. What sort of priorities have been made within the compilation of the budget? [Fujii] Ever since his cabinet was formed, the prime minister has continued to stress that the coalition government should build Japan into a fruitful and high-quality nation, and the coalition government should have the people understand that policy. I have worked to compile the budget, taking into account what the prime minister has stressed. At the same time, the coalition government is faced with the issue of spurring the stagnant economy. When the fiscal 1994 budget was compiled, I gave consideration to stimulating the economy. I also gave consideration to curbing special national bonds, and I intend to concentrate the allocation of funds on public works projects. These are what I bore in mind while the 1994 fiscal budget was being compiled. [Mizuki] The government's debts will grow again; this is the most important issue. The coalition government will issue 20 trillion yen in national bonds. How will the coalition government put the brakes on national bonds? This is an important matter. Minister, how are you going to deal with this issue? [Fujii] A substantial portion of the 200 trillion yen in national bonds are bonds to finance construction projects. The bonds will leave our nation with assets worth that much. In that respect, it is beneficial to ask the people to assume the burden of some of the bonds. Faced with stimulating the economy, the coalition government intends to issue national bonds to spur the economy. The coalition government also intends to bring about a recovery of the economy. I think the coalition government should make every effort to curb the so-called special national bonds. [Mizuki] Representatives of the ruling coalition parties have agreed to settle the issue of securing financial resources in order to make up for a fiscal shortfall incurred from tax cuts. Raising the consumption tax is the only way to secure the financial resources; the ruling coalition parties will thus focus their debate on whether or not to raise the consumption tax. When and how will the representatives of the ruling coalition parties settle the issue? [Fujii] The representative of the ruling coalition parties have agreed to settle the issue within this year; this is their best choice. As you said a while ago, it is a natural for them to discuss ways to address unfair taxes and to streamline the administration. They will also discuss ways to reform the current tax system -- taking into account the balance of income, assets, and consumption -- and to create new taxes. They have agreed to do all these things this year. I value the agreement and think the representatives will resolve the issue as they have agreed upon. [Mizuki] As I mentioned a while ago, I would like to ask about the public works projects. It is said the coalition government will concentrate the allocation of funds for the projects on improving the standard of living. The people are placing high hopes on them. [Fujii] The budget for public works projects will grow substantially. While public works projects for natural parks will grow by 20 percent, those for agriculture will increase by 14 percent. Public works projects for sewage and housing will also be greatly increased. I believe this allocation of public works projects reflects Prime Minister Hosokawa's policy. The growth is quite bold. Public works projects grew by 0.5 percent in 1993. Given the growth in public works projects for 1994, I believe the coalition government has made its utmost efforts. [Mizuki] Looking at the compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget, this time the so-called zokugiin [Diet members who champion special interests] were not as active as they were during the era of the Liberal Democratic Party. However, my impression is that moves by government ministries and agencies to protect their vested rights and interests are still deep-rooted. Minister, how do you plan to deal with those moves? [Fujii] The ruling coalition parties have provided all those concerned with the opportunity to put forth their views on the budget. The ruling coalition parties have presented the government, especially the Ministry of Finance, with their views. From our standpoint I feel the process has drastically changed. [Mizuki] This question concerns the future management of the economy. The compilation of the budget has been delayed for more than a month. Minister, how do you plan to manage the economy as you fill the vacuum? [Fujii] The budget should have been compiled in 1993; psychologically this would have been correct. However, we have compiled the third supplementary budget, and the budget will certainly give a boost to the economy. The coalition government will stimulate the economy through the third supplementary and fiscal 1994 budgets. The coalition government will also implement a package of stimulus measures totalling 15.25 trillion yen. The package is the largest ever. It will serve to reinvigorate land transactions, agriculture, and small businesses. It is very important for the coalition government to implement the package without delay. [Mizuki] The coalition government has decided on a package of stimulus measures totalling 15 trillion yen, as well as a budget bill, both of which are expected to spur Japan's economy. However, at this moment the yen is substantially appreciating against the U.S. dollar following the breakdown in the Japan-U.S. summit talks. Minister, what do you think about this? [Fujii] I cannot help saying that the current exchange markets are affected by speculative moves. The currency's exchange rate must reflect the country's economic fundamentals. It is undesirable for the exchange rate to move dramatically for short periods. This is an agreement reached among the G-7 industrialized nations. I feel these are speculative moves which will probably last a day or so. [Mizuki] Various remarks by high-ranking U.S. Government officials have affected the speculative moves. The G-7 industrialized nations have agreed to cooperate with each other in dealing with severe fluctuations of the exchange rate. How do Japanese and U.S. financial authorities see the current sharp increase in the yen's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar? [Fujii] A responsible U.S. Government official has said there is no change in the U.S. Government's policy on the exchange rate. I agree with that. [Mizuki] Over the past few days, there has been no change in economic fundamentals. The breakdown of the Japan-U.S. summit talks over the opening of the Japanese market is responsible for the drastic appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar. It is important for the coalition government to settle the issue at the earliest date. [Fujii] I have said the drastic appreciation of the yen has been caused by speculative moves. There are various reasons for these speculative moves. It cannot be denied that the breakdown of the summit talks is responsible for it. Although the leaders of Japan and the United States failed to reach an agreement on various bilateral issues, they agreed there will be no change in friendly relations between the two countries. It is necessary for the leaders to have opportunities to understand each other. [Mizuki] If the appreciated yen sets back Japan's economy, this would adversely affect the world economy. The G-7 industrialized nations will meet later this month. Minister, how are you going to deal with the appreciated yen? [Fujii] Financial authorities in the G-7 industrialized nations have agreed that the exchange rate must mirror the economic fundamentals. Drastic fluctuations in the exchange rate have an adverse impact not only on the country concerned but on the world economy. Japan should try to reaffairm the agreement at the meeting to be held by the G-7 industrialized nations. [Mizuki] Then, Minister, do you think the current sharp increase in the yen's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar is temporary, and thus does not reflect Japan's economic fundamentals? [Fujii] Yes. I believe the drastic appreciation of the yen has been caused by speculative moves. [Mizuki] This is my last question. It is unclear why the yen has appreciated so drastically. Minister, when will Japan's economy recover? [Fujii] The government has agreed to put the economy back on the path of recovery at the earliest possible time during fiscal year 1994, and to make certain it will continue its stable growth in the fiscal year 1995. I am and will manage the economy based on the government agreement. [Mizuki] Banks are overloaded with bad loans, and there are other issues. It is not easy to resolve those issues. Minister, when do you think these issues will be resolved? [Fujii] I intend to resolve them at the earliest possible date in 1994. [Mizuki] Minister, thank you for being interviewed.
