This prominent pan-Arab occasion represents a historic scene full of good deeds carried out by generations that raised the banner of the Ba'th and followed the path of the founder president, may God have mercy on his soul, who illuminated our road toward realizing the objectives of the great Ba'th Party through his enlightened thought and generous sacrifices. The 47th anniversary embodies the same spirit that prevailed at the party's beginning, represented by the steadfastness of great Iraq, under the leadership of mujahid comrade Saddam Husayn, the symbol of our nation's struggle and the sign of its glory and firm stands in defense of pan-Arabism and Islam. The faithful people's conviction that the nation deserves its affiliation to its deep- rooted history and to gain victory over its enemies is becoming stronger. It is an immortal anniversary that takes us back to the starting point to become aware of the relation between the founding of the party and the nation, and inspire us to carry out historic action and embark on a message-bearing role in accordance with the party's principles and in continuation of its tradition, and shouldering the trust of Arab socialist, democratic, and unionist struggle. The founding of the party ushered in the beginning of ripe pan- Arab and militant action and transformed it into a popular movement capable of contributing to the civilized character of the nation through long popular struggle against the factors of its [word indistinct] and abandonment of its message-bearing role. The Ba'th movement has set the course of resurgence and introduced organized and unified Arab action as a way to achieve salvation. Since the beginning, the movement found itself facing a difficult test and unique experience that require seriousness, harmony with its objectives, and ability to work for the nation through viewing life as a message and jihad. After 47 years, the answers to the questions posed by Arab struggle and its challenges to the party's vanguards and organizations will continue to be linked to the readiness of the Ba'thists to discuss facts frankly with the people and resort to the party's militant principles and moral pillars represented in truth, love for the people, unselfishness, and commitment to the nation's interest and Party programs. All these principles and pillars continue to be standards for evaluating the party's march to determine how well this march is in line with the principles and to remedy any contradiction with these principles. The Ba'th Party has set its path based on faith in the people and the justice of the Arab cause, and through a special approach and comprehensive vision of the contradictions in the Arab situation. the party has worked, in an honest and principled manner, to decisively confront this situation in the interest of the masses. The close ties with reality and the people provided the party with a firm opinion and position, and the ability to predict the future and develop the experience in order to know the facts of the historic stage and its trends, based on the revolutionary Arab ideology. The Ba'th Party has translated its deep-rooted ideology and struggle, objective approach, and openness to the Arab and human heritages. This gave the party its distinguished nature that reflects the movement's characteristics and historic birth. The Ba'th Party was founded during a stage full of totalitarian ideologies and beliefs and integrated thoughts in the fields of arts and social and human sciences, which had the ability to influence. They enjoyed frameworks, establishments, and political, economic, and cultural influence to the point that they almost prevented the emergence of anything new and blocked any living expression about the identities of the developing peoples as a result of this influence and productivity. The Ba'th has proven its presence by its comprehensive ideology. It saved the Arab fate and Arab thought from perdition, from imitation, and from being at the wrong end of the stick. It emphasized its role as a positive and creative movement whose establishment was dictated by the nation's circumstances and its ambitious aspirations. This movement resulted from the deeply felt spiritual tribulations of the nation and from its values of freedom, justice, self-respect, as well as its humanitarian approach. The Ba'th did not confine its struggle to ready-made ideologies or to rigid concepts that outline the desired Arab society. It did not adopt a comprehensive universal outlook, but remained committed to its role as a revolutionary and faithful pan-Arab movement that will be working for hundreds of years. It will not acquiesce to abridged missions, becoming just an ideological school, or agree to a diminished size, becoming only a movement held captive by improvised positions and transient reactions. The Ba'th knows its civilized role and the basic components of its effort to pinpoint the historical moment through which the modern Arab resurgence is passing. The Arab struggle for this resurgence coincides with an imbalance in this age's materialistic civilization. This gives their struggle a missionary and humanitarian dimension that contributes to redressing this civilization and participating in the establishment of a new world based on faith and spiritual munificence. That is why the anniversary of the party's establishment remains a constant call to return to the sources of faith. The more time passes, the more the need to widen the course of these sources, removing the residues and obstacles of the experiment, so they can regain their purity. The Ba'th assumed its role in shaping Arab unionist awareness. It led the battle for values and objectives against the forces of the fait accompli and the advocates of isolationism and regionalism [word indistinct] its nation in front of a conspiracy that seeks to return it to the era of decline and stagnation. Thus, it assumed the responsibility of moving the Arab state of affairs in an upward historical direction. It maintained the incandescent flame of the pan-Arab movement for half a century as a unionist and humanitarian movement. Many unionist movements disappeared in many parts of the world, gave up their role and their objectives and submitted to international maneuvers and the interests of influential countries at the expense of their aspirations and legitimate objectives. The secret of the Ba'th's pursuit of its vanguard pan-Arab role is its confidence in the nation's capabilities. Struggle can unleash the best potentials. This has made it, throughout its history, the selfless friend of the Arab masses, waging the Arab nation's fierce battles. It produced tangible results and transformations for this nation, starting with its participation in confronting the usurpation of Palestine, the constant confrontation of Zionism and the reactionary alliances and regimes, the attainment of the first unity in the modern Arab history, the toppling of secessionist anti-Arab regimes deeply involved in the conspiracies against unity, and the struggle to attain the people's objectives, foremost being oil nationalization, tackling issues of minorities, and setting up a broad popular movement throughout the Arab homeland devoted to championing the pan-Arab cause. Topping the list of the Arab struggle's gains is the Ba'th convergence with Iraqi spirit and aspirations, in a historical meeting that expressed the depth of Iraq's militant and civilized personality, unleashed its heroic potential, and placed this militant country, after the success of the glorious 17-30 July Revolution, at the center of the Arab nation's battle against the schemes to liquidate the Arab cause and the conspiracies against the future. The Ba'th placed in Iraqi hands, conscience, and minds the requisites for the major unleashing of forces and the great achievements of a lofty people. With its civilized heritage and its unique past and present pan- Arab role, not to mention its achievements in the field of liberation, its sharp Arab perception, the audacity of its Ba'thist vanguards, and the genius of its struggler leader Comrade Saddam Husayn, Iraq has renewed its position under the Ba'th banner as the focal point and shield protecting the nation by freeing its political decision making and its economic, scientific, and military achievements, burying the aggression at the eastern gate of the Arab homeland in the glorious Saddam's al-Qadisiyah. It embodies the brilliant face of resurgence and is the proof of the nation's salubrity and the platform from which it proceeds to liberate Palestine. From this premise, Iraq's becoming the target for the abortion of the plan for Arab resurgence reconfirms the importance of the strategic imperialist constants in the Arab homeland. Thus, the Mother of Battles summed up the importance of Arab security vis- a-vis the perils it faces. In essence, it was of a defensive nature, although it contained a spirit of rejection and confrontation of the despot. It mobilized the nation's comprehensive outlook toward the requisites of life, and expressed the commitment of the will and the Arab moral and ethical configuration that does not accept the prevalence of materialistic concepts and the violation of Arab sovereignty and honor. This clairvoyant perception of the values of truth and justice has made the Arab nation fully aware of its posture and of the inevitability of its victory in the battle of values. This perception has made it possible to specify the points of weakness among the ranks of the aggressors and to foresee the imminent downfall of the powers of hegemony, despite their unrestrained whims and the clamor of media disinformation that aims at glorifying the sole superpower and embellishing its arrogance. Confidence about the future does not reflect unjustified optimism. Rather, it is based on a profound understanding of the Mother of Battles' repercussions and an ability to inspire the masses of the Arab people. This confidence emerged after the course of events was monitored, the international situation was digested, the balances of power were assessed, and history deeply studied. All this tells us that the enemies' course and interests are in constant contradiction with human will. More importantly, this confidence has provided a clear picture of the Arab nation's abilities to be involved in great actions of jihad and construction when requirements and factors of progress are accompanied by genuine policies. From the outset, it has been clear that the subsidence of the wave of unilateral control of the fate of the world is a matter of time, which will not be long. This is clear despite the heavy price paid by humanity, especially the Iraqi people, who confronted a military aggression and continue to be subjected to an oppressive siege, because of the continued unilateral hegemony. O sons of the glorious Arab nation, O Ba'thist strugglers: The Ba'th Party has pointed out the modern pan-Arab movement's maturity and ability to express its essence and objectives. At the same time, the Ba'th Party continued to view pan-Arab issues as a militant incentive and an instigator for yearning for an Arab awakening. Arab unity was and will be a cultural framework capable of maintaining the Arab nation's existence and ability to remain at the level of its message. Unity will continue to be the Arab nation's chance to achieve progress, improve its status, and emphasize its united identity. Unity is not a momentary need or a fallacy brought about by transient circumstances or by dreamy ideological adventures. Therefore, Arab unity is not a slogan raised today, to be forgotten tomorrow. In the past, whenever they sensed weakness or retrogression among the ranks of the Arab nation, hostile foreign powers, reactionary regimes, and advocates of parochialism attempted to undermine the idea of unity and waged systematic wars against it. All this has one purpose, namely, to ensure the role of the usurping Zionist entity as a force obstructing Arab advancement. The regional plans aiming at obliterating pan-Arab identity, resisting Arab unity, and granting the Zionist entity geographic legitimacy and a stronger hegemonic role have proved lame and unachievable. Those plans take advantage of the climate of retrogression and disintegration and the role of colluding Arab regimes to weaken the trend of liberation, democracy, and unity, and to distract the masses' attention from their battles and real concerns. They offer false, useless solutions that only increase the masses' poverty and dependence on foreigners. At their best, such solutions can be described as being an expression of the state of affairs of the impotent ones, not of the Arab nation and its conscience. The failure of regional policies and their role in weakening joint Arab action can be responded to only by action in accordance with a realistic, militant unionist plan, starting with an objective understanding of the phases of the struggle for unity and by providing the practical requirements for advancement. This plan should replace impotent and deceptive plans built on regional and international deals at the expense of our people's interests, principles, and future. O masses of our militant people: The Palestinian Arab issue has remained a sensitive parameter that signals ebbs and tides in our Arab situation. It has been a measure of the situation of the masses and the level of their preparedness to wage major battles. Since its establishment, our party has viewed this issue as the essence of the Arab nation's ordeal and the core of the Arab cause. This stand proceeds from the party's realization of the extent of the danger posed by the Zionist scheme and the Jewish state's role of obstructing the Arabs' natural unity. the party's stand also stems from the prominent position of the Palestine question in the conscience of the masses and in the formulation of the modern pan- Arab consciousness and the Arab masses' collective approach to the Palestine question as a crucial issue. Since its early beginnings, Palestine has been a basic part of the Ba'th Party's struggle. the party has been present on the Palestinian scene throughout all the stages of struggle, offering known sacrifices that culminated in the Mother of Battles and Iraq's glorious stand when the al-Husayn and al-'Abbas missiles pounded the usurping entity. The armed Palestinian resistance, the valiant intifadah, Iraq's victory in the al-Qadisiyah battle, and the momentum provided by the Mother of Battles have embodied the course of liberation, the need to provide the requirements of balance with the enemy, and revived hopes for the historic solution and set it as a strategic target. In contrast, the abortion of the will of liberation, emptying the Palestine question of its content, and the agent Arab regimes' adoption of a course aiming at liquidating the Palestine question have provided an atmosphere for maneuvers and the adoption of political effort as an alternative that disregards the resources of struggle, future chances, and the positive factors that can lead to weakening the enemy front and rectifying the regional and internal balances of power in our nation's interest. And thus involvement in political and informational work in approaching the settlement strategy began to assume a more clear-cut character. At the same time there was an increasing loss of direction and a dilution of principles and enthusiasm for liberation, caused by temptations to accommodate the status quo under external and Arab pressures. The hardships to which the Palestinian Arab people are being subjected are being used as a pretext to recognize the Zionist enemy and to go along with the scheme to transform the bulk of the land of Palestine into disputed territory. Developments unfolding in the Palestinian arena highlight two contradictory positions -- the position of the intifadah masses adhering to the goal of liberation and the fight to get recognition for the Palestinian people, and the position of the so-called settlement and dealing with [words indistinct] or reserve to achieve one strategy. The bloody and outrageous massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque redrew part of the picture after a long spell of haziness, reminding Arabs and the world of the tragedies and ugliness of occupation and the hidden intentions of aggression. It exposed the lie of international legitimacy that is being driven into the background by the savagery of Zionist terror. An incident of this enormity provides fresh evidence of an aggressive nature that warrants a determined stand against present challenges and a better grasp of the truth about the enemy and the dichotomies of the human and moral and cultural aspects of the Arab-Zionist conflict. The belittlement of our nation's rights and the Hebron massacre's implications furnish proof that coexistence with an enemy that denies the most basic conditions of life and aggresses against the most cherished sanctities is an impossibility. Thus, the wretched attempts at brain-washing and cutting us off from our history in order to transform Palestine into a bridge for the Zionists to cross into the region are part of the culture of what was termed peace and settlement that seeks to promote the slogan of absorbing the Zionist entity. Such a slogan was bandied about in the past as a test balloon by suspect circles and reactionary regimes to sound out the reaction of the masses. This slogan was meant to serve sinister ends. It has been repeated [words indistinct] supported by a variety of factors to trumpet the humanitarian dimension of containing the Zionist entity, given our nation's potential possession of the edge promoting the notion that the Arab nation can afford to accept peace and conciliation with Israel and recognize its theft of Palestine today with an eye to winning the conflict in the future. This is an oversimplification caused by shortsightedness. The Zionist entity's existence is an imperialist creation brought about by division, subservience, and backwardness. This fact does not fall under the heading of a normal exchange of normal relations in the region. Palestine is the focal point of a vibrant pan-Arab struggle, and will remain so until it retrieves its Arabism. The Palestinian cause has assumed its status as a central issue for Arabs by virtue of the fact that Palestine was stolen, and due to the very nature of the conflict. The political dimension of the issue has assumed a special dimension. We should, therefore, refuse to marginalize it and thwart the Arab regimes' attempts to ignore it. This is despite the importance of other central Arab issues that determine the directions of Arab struggle and engage the attention of the masses. Our Arab nation views the Palestinian issue as a central cause. The conspiracies to liquidate it only underscore the importance of working to help it, pursuing the patient struggle for liberating Palestine. For this reason, the masses of the occupied territories are providing the finest examples of courage and heroism and adherence to rights. They are turning the chapters of the tragedy of occupation and coercion into fine chapters of jihad, just as the uprising of the Arab masses in Egypt was an eloquent response to the advocates of normalization and a damnation of the regime that imperialism had devoted to advance its agenda. These features that throb with the preparations of the Arab masses to pursue the struggle are the most conclusive proof that the Arab nation has wagered on its own resources and the awareness of its children as they counter attempts to sell the settlement to our nation. Militant Arab masses; militant Ba'thists: Since the Ba'th took its first steps in the struggle, it has undertaken the responsibility of instilling the spirit of faith and freedom and confidence in the Arab nation. Its militants have pledged themselves to a disciplinary line that reinforces in them and the Arab masses the feeling of pride in our history and the Arab character and a cultural role enemical to shaky allegiances and a fascination with the glitter of false modernity. For decades, it has continued to champion a meeting of hearts and minds between progressive Arabism and Islam, between the Arab character and Islam, to promote communication with nations and peoples to advance the causes of mankind. In this context, the intellectual, spiritual, cultural, military, and political victory scored in the glorious battle of Saddam's al-Qadisiyah has provoked the aggression, because the colonialist West succumbed to its aggressive instincts and reestablished the complexes dwelling within its centuries-old memories to nip in the bud the potential for true renaissance demonstrated by Muslims and Arabs, to neutralize them by crippling the forceful role of Iraq, which embodies the Arabs' quest for progress as well as the heroic defense of Arabism and Islam. Hence, the jihad waged in the Mother of Battles was the epitome of adherence to principles, a manifestation of the determination to uphold basic values pertaining to the freedom of peoples, and an attempt to promote international relations to free them from the spirit of custodianship, and of the domination of world colonialism. Our nation's discourse in its jihad mission, manifested in addresses by the leader of the faithful grouping, mujahid comrade Saddam Husayn, strengthened the people's hope that the new wave of domination would subside, that the forces of faith and jihad would triumph against brutal powers and tyrannical invaders everywhere. In this climate, which was highly significant and in which intentions became crystal clear, steadfastness turned into a living example, and began to bear fruit. The rejection of and opposition to the U.S.-Zionist hegemonic course and its tyranny have begun to be felt, particularly after the halo surrounding this course began to fade because it does not uphold the values of justice and equality, because it opposes the peoples' interests and aspirations, because contradictions exist among those who enjoy spheres of influence and want to share the booty, and because of the emergence of the dynamism of scientific and technological advancement, which is bound to impact on the international economic situation, thanks to the newly-created regional blocs that are increasingly affecting international relations by various means. The militant and patient Somali people have set another splendid example by vindicating the peoples' rights, as well as their ability to resist foreign intervention and the violation of national sovereignty. The Somali people have been able to make the aggressive Western alliance leave their territory, defeated and at a loss, not to mention the grave moral and political losses it sustained. Day after day, the attempts and pressure to impose U.S. domination subside. These attempts and pressures are no longer useful, given the fact that there is less need for U.S. military protection in various parts of the world due to the end of the Cold War, and because the U.S. role in international investments is declining. Consequently, the United States has lost the seminal momentum in the world economy that it used to expand its influence. Hence, threats to use force and pressure are becoming burdensome at a time when such threats cannot serve as a means to promote what officials called the new world order, which has proven to be a cover for evasion and deception. This has prompted some quarters that promoted this order to act against it, and to utterly abandon it. The evidence for this is that the international policy pursued in the context of the unipolar order is experiencing a bottleneck. This is because the game of involving basic values and human destiny in international politics has backfired. The covers and slogans of democracy, human rights, anti-war sentiment, and environmental protection have called into serious question the double standards employed, as manifested in the successive crises and the marathon race to reclaim colonialist influence. This has demonstrated the lack of balance, as well as the propaganda content of all the political covers used by hegemonic forces. Consequently, the upcoming phase is that of the erosion of hegemony after it was used to oppress and punish peoples, and to threaten their security and sovereignty with economic boycott, aggression, and economic embargoes. At the same time, it is the phase in which the rejection of domination and subjugation will mature and turn into international rebellion and disobedience. What is currently taking place in Russia is a referendum on its independent national choices. It is a manifestation of the importance of rehabilitating its international role and its national pride, which was trampled by the United States and its allies. This trampling of pride has become so objectionable that the Russian people are being pressured into abandoning all components of their sovereignty in return for deceptive and sweet promises that have caused Russia to lose its unique standing among the international community of nations. Russia has almost become subservient. O sons of our glorious Arab nation; O you militant Ba'thists: On this glorious anniversary, one cannot escape the analogy between the phase in which the party was launched and the current phase in terms of the need to reestablish an Arab consciousness of the rules of the game at this point in time, the need to end the state of stagnation, and the need to work to reactivate intellectual and militant thought to highlight the jihad implications of the Mother of Battles and the spirit of heroism epitomized by the unique leadership of leader President Saddam Husayn, given the qualitative challenge the Mother of Battles posed to the nation, the challenge that is targeting the axioms of the pan-Arab struggle. Therefore, Arab strugglers are required to make persistent moves to promote their struggle, because this is required by the need to rid the potential for renaissance of the burdensome negative phenomena which have pushed Arabs backwards. This is a must if we are to have a good understanding of the dialectics of renaissance and decline, an understanding that enables us to cope with the current circumstances and employ proper intellectual and aggressive criteria to reach an objective assessment of the phenomena of this dialectic. Spontaneous popular vigilance during the Mother of Battles was the result of an awareness of Iraq's pan-Arab stand and national awakening. Responsibility for maintaining clarity and developing the struggle require the consolidation of the masses with jihad principles and the enlightenment of the people about the objectives of the nation's battle, its historical depth, and cultural content. Our nation's fate is to repulse the colonialist foreign onslaught, prevent infiltration into national ranks, and stop the exacerbation of its contradictions. We must hold fast to the principled course in order to remain steadfast in the face of old and new plots. The forces of the Arab nation can abort the plots of fragmentation and the internationalization of internal problems. They can mobilize their potential to lift the blockade of Iraq and coordinate their plans and stands to reject hegemony and plots of submission. They can maintain their gains with the unity of the Arab masses and reinforce democratic and united achievements. In light of the Arab masses' struggle, history, and objectives, militant action should be revived in national and pan-Arab life to restore the shining face and honorable role of popular Arab struggle. Our political parties and unions, our Arab intellectual and artistic bodies, and all vital organizations in the nation are required to wage the decisive battle -- each according to their position and capabilities -- to maintain the spirit of resistance of the Mother of Battles. They are called on to wage an uprising to decide the fate of our conflict against occupation and aggression, on the path of awakening and cultural rejuvenation. The living nations, which face difficult circumstances and wage struggle, look forward to turning events, no matter how great they are, into factors of strength for the future. Let all honest good people pool their efforts to prepare the factors of steadfastness and confrontation on the basis of principled and historical grounds so the achievements of the Arab revolution and struggle will be established deep in the heart of Arabs and human history. By providing a creative framework to move the masses, and by establishing a large-scale militant Arab front in light of a faithful future pan-Arab plan, our nation will restore its strength and proceed with its jihad to resume its cultural role. It will seize the historic initiative through the strength of principles and the will of people. On the party's anniversary, Ba'thists call on our nation to sharpen their determination, to move toward the integration and unity of the Arab struggle strategy, and to develop formulas and levels of action to hallmarks of steadfastness and victory and to build the new Arab homeland and new Arab individuals who know their role and who have faith in their mission. Long live the Arab nation and its steadfast sons in Iraq and Palestine in defense of Arab future and rights. Long live the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, the symbol of the nation's unity and the inspirer of its generations. Faithful greetings to the Ba'th founder and the inspirer of its generations. Greetings of love to the mujahid leader Comrade Saddam Husayn, the knight of the nation and the leader of its awakening. Glory and immortality to the righteous martyrs of our nation; the martyrs of Palestine, the Ba'th, the al-Qadisiyah, and the Mother of Battles; all the martyrs of its crucial causes. [Signed] The National Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, April 1994
