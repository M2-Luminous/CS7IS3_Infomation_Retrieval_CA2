"This is an important accord," said Salvatore Biondo of the FIM [Italian Federation of Metal workers and Mechanics] steelworkers union who reported, "It was reached with difficulty because in play at the same time is restructurization, break-up and privatization." Another union spokesman, Maurizio Micolia of the UILM [Italian Metal Workers Union], said the agreement reached with the mediation of Labor Minister Gino Giugni, "confirms an important philosophy for negotiations, that is, this accord will be inherited by the private- sector buyers as a special clause in the sales contracts." Luigi Portioli of the FIOM [Federation of Employees and Workers in the Metallurgical Industry] said the agreement was "undoubtedly costly but certainly effective. We hope that Ilva will be sold to a big national steel business capable of assuring international cooperation." Most of the workers whose jobs are targeted in the new plan, 10,450, will receive early retirement with benefits to be written into an updated Labor Ministry law degree. According to the labor side, early retirement costs will come to 1.8 billion lire (1.07 billion dollars), to be added to expenditures for other social safety nets for the additional jobs losses.
