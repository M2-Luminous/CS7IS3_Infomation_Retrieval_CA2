Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock told the UN Human Rights Commission here before the ministers' meeting that "such terrible crimes cannot be accepted by civilized societies at the end of the 20th century." "The international comunity must take the necessary action to stop them," he said. Wednesday's talks here coincided with a meeting in Brussels of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ambassadors debating whether to give the Bosnian Serbs a deadline to lift the siege of Sarajevo or face air strikes by the alliance's warplanes. But Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, who had been invited here by international mediators David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, decided to stay in Ankara to "remain close to his government" pending any NATO decision, an official said. Pro-Moslem Turkey is a NATO member and on Wednesday said it was prepared to take part in any NATO air strikes in Bosnia. Pro-Serb Greece meanwhile said it would go along with any NATO decision. Ministers in attendance at the talks here were Mock, Albania's Alfred Serreqi, Bulgaria's Stanislav Daskalov, Greece's Karolos Papoulias, Italy's Beniamino Andreatta, Romania's Teodor Melescanu and Hungary's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Janos Hermann. None made a statement as they went into the meeting, which was also to focus on a 60-page document detailing the economic effects on the Balkans of the 1992 trade embargo against Belgrade. Owen and Stoltenberg want "to have the ministers' input on the issues of reconstruction and recovery in advance of a settlement," an official said. No statement was due to be issued after the session. The meeting had been scheduled before Saturday's massacre of 68 Bosnians at the Sarajevo market which triggered the latest debate on whether to use air power against Bosnian Serbs. Meanwhile, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic held talks with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic ahead of a fresh round of multilateral Geneva talks from Thursday aimed at reaching a political settlement. They said at the half-way stage that their discussions had been "constructive." Granic said they had covered ways to end hostilities between Bosnian Croat forces and the mainly Moslem Bosnian Government Army in central Bosnia. The Zagreb government has denied UN allegations that its own troops are engaged in the fighting. Croatia itself will not be represented at Thursday's talks here, which are intended to work out "confidence-building measures" by the three sides to the Bosnian conflict, represented by Silajdzic, Radovan Karadzic for the Bosnian Serbs and Mile Akmadzic for the Bosnian Croats.
