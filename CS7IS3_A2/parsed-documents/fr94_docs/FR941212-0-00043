FR941212-0-00043 FR941212-0-00015 21. While we thus liberalize our non-ownership relationship rules in certain respects, we also narrow these rules in other respects. First, we generally prohibit LECs from exceeding the carrier-user relationship in their telephone service area with any franchised cable operator, except (as described above) to provide enhanced or other nonregulated services related to the provision of video programming in an area substantially served by a video dialtone platform, or to lease cable drop wires. One of the primary goals of this proceeding is to lay the groundwork for the development of competition in wire-based video delivery services. We believe that allowing a broad range of affiliations between LECs and cable operators in a LEC's telephone service area could undermine this goal. For example, permitting LECs and cable operators to construct or operate jointly a video dialtone platform could encourage cable operators to abandon their facilities in favor of the video dialtone platform. Indeed, we consider it highly unlikely that a cable operator would participate in the construction or operation of a video dialtone system unless it planned to use or was using that platform. In that event, the public would lose the benefit of competition provided by the cable system. Conversely, LECs might be inclined to underwrite a cable operator instead of building competing video distribution systems. Moreover, even in markets in which LECs build video, dialtone systems, incentives to compete vigorously could be tempered by debt financing, joint ventures, and other non-ownership relationships with the cable operator. We are particularly concerned about that possibility given that, in the near-term, the LEC and cable operator are likely to be the only two wire-based video systems in most markets. Under the circumstances, the risks of anticompetitive consequences outweigh any public gain that could be offered by permitting such relationships. 22. Second, we generally prohibit cable operators or any other video programmers from participating in the operation of a basic video dialtone platform. Unlike LECs, which are subject to Title II of the Communications Act, and, in the case of the largest LECs, nonstructural safeguards designed to prevent or reveal discrimination, video programmers are subject to no Title II nondiscrimination obligations or requirements. We therefore conclude that, without special safeguards, permitting video programmers wide latitude in participating in the operation of the basic video dialtone platform raises too great a risk of discrimination. Nevertheless, we may permit discrete roles for video programmers in operating the video dialtone platform if we conclude that the benefits of permitting such roles outweigh any risk of discrimination that they raise. 23. These modifications, aside, we otherwise affirm our rules governing non-ownership affiliations. We also affirm that we are not statutorily precluded from allowing LECs to exceed the carrier-user relationship in providing video dialtone service. 24. To summarize, LECs may provide enhanced or other nonregulated services related to the provision of video programming to any video programmer, including a cable operator, in areas substantially served by a video dialtone platform. LECs may also enter into other types of non-ownership relationships with video programmers that are not franchised cable operators, except that they generally may not jointly operate the video dialtone platform. LECs may not, however, otherwise exceed the carrier-user relationship in their telephone service area with franchised cable operators, except to lease cable drop wires. We believe that these modifications of the non-ownership affiliation rules make them more consistent with our overall video dialtone policies. 25. We note that LECs remain unrestricted in the provision of enhanced or other nonregulated services unrelated to the provision of video programming, whether within or outside the LEC service area. LECs also remain unrestricted in the provision of video programming directly to subscribers outside their service area. Finally, for purposes of our non-ownership affiliation rules, we will treat debt that is convertible to stock as non-cognizable unless the interest is converted, or, based on an analysis of the specific facts involved, we conclude that the interest confers control over a video programmer. This is consistent with our treatment of convertible debt in other areas. Moreover, to the extent the equity interest would be impermissible, LECs would be unable lawfully to convert the debt. Therefore, it is proper to view it as debt, rather than equity, unless and until any such conversion occurs. E. Definition of Video Programming 26. We affirm our interpretation of the statutory definition of video programming set forth in the Second Report and Order. We believe that the Commission's interpretation most closely comports with congressional intent in enacting the 1984 Cable Act. We also affirm the Commission's conclusion that video-on-demand images can be severed from the interactive functionalities and thereby constitute video programming.
