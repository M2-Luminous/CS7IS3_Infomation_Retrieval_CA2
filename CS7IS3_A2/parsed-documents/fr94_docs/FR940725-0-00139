FR940725-0-00139 FR940725-0-00019 ``Hot work'' means any activity involving fire- or heat-producing operations, such as riveting, welding, and burning. The definition of this term also indicates that grinding, drilling, abrasive blasting, and similar spark-producing operations are also considered to be hot work unless they are isolated from atmospheres containing a concentration of any flammable or combustible substance greater than 10 percent of the lower explosive limit of that substance. While the definition in the final rule is substantially the same as that contained in the proposed standard, it has been editorially revised for clarity. It should be noted that the definition of ``hot work'' in revised Subpart B will be applied to Subpart B whereas the definition of the same term in ยง1915.4 applies to the rest of part 1915. ``Immediately dangerous to life or health'' 3 (IDLH) means an atmosphere that poses an immediate threat to life or that is likely to result in acute or immediate severe health effects. This definition has been adopted without substantive change from the proposal. 3 The definition of ``immediately dangerous to life or health'' in ยง1910.146 reads as follows: Immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH) means any condition that poses an immediate or delayed threat to life or that would cause irreversible adverse health effects or that would interfere with an individual's ability to escape unaided from a permit space. ``Inert or inerted atmosphere'' means an atmospheric condition in which: (1) The oxygen content of the atmosphere is maintained at a level less than or equal to 8 percent by volume or at a level of 50 percent of the amount required to support combustion, whichever is lower, or (2) The space is flooded with water and the vapor concentration of flammable or combustible materials in the free space above the water line is less than 10 percent of the lower explosive limit for the material. This definition has been adopted without substantive change from the proposal. In the NPRM, OSHA raised the issue of whether or not the proposed definition of ``inert or inerted atmosphere'' was appropriate, especially with respect to the maximum permissible level of oxygen. The Agency asked for guidance on whether or not specific oxygen levels for various substances should be published along with the rule. The persons who commented on this issue felt that OSHA should not publish specific levels in the final rule (Ex. 6&hyph;10, 6&hyph;18, 6&hyph;23, 6&hyph;24, 6&hyph;27, 6&hyph;28, 6&hyph;33, 6&hyph;34). They argued that since a Marine Chemist would be the person authorizing and monitoring the inerting of atmospheres and since Marine Chemists are thoroughly familiar with the selection of appropriate procedures involved, specifying oxygen levels in the OSHA standard was unnecessary. Endorsing this view, NFPA (Ex. 6&hyph;10) stated: Inerting in the marine industry is overseen by Marine Chemists in accordance with the requirements of the ``Control of Gas Hazards on Vessels_NFPA 306 (1988).'' The provisions for inerting as contained in NFPA 306, 2&hyph;3.7(a), are based upon the industry accepted practice for inerting. It takes into account the theoretical lower limit for the amount of oxygen to support combustion, which is approximately 11% by volume for most petroleum products. The procedure specifies either reducing the oxygen content to 8% by volume or 50% of the amount to support combustion, whichever is less. In practice, because the value of 50% of the amount to support combustion is usually less than 8% by volume, an even greater margin of safety is achieved. The minimum oxygen for combustion values are contained in Appendix B, ``Explosion Prevention Systems_NFPA 69 (1986)''. NFPA 306 requires in 2&hyph;3.7(a), (c) that the selection and disposal of the inert gas medium be acceptable to the Marine Chemist who provides specific instructions on his/her Marine Chemist Certificate. NFPA supports the addition of the definition for inerting and the levels as specified in the definition since these levels are industry accepted and provide for an adequate level of safety when administered by a Marine Chemist in accordance with NFPA 306. The Marine Chemist Association, Inc. (Ex. 6&hyph;34), agreed stating: The Marine Chemist Association feels that inerting is not a procedure free of potential hazards and that inerting for hot work should only be attempted with the proper skill to determine each of the above mentioned factors. If OSHA provides only partial details of these factors, it may lead to unauthorized personnel attempting the procedure outside current regulatory requirement, and could possibly result in the generation of hazardous situations. For the reasons stated by NFPA and the Marine Chemist Association, OSHA is not specifying the precise levels of oxygen acceptable under the definition of ``inert or inerted atmosphere'', either directly in the definition or in an appendix. Under ยง1915.14(a), an atmosphere to be inerted must be tested and certified by a Marine Chemist or a U.S. Coast Guard authorized person, who would be thoroughly familiar with the proper techniques involved. The Agency fully concurs with the Marine Chemist Association that setting out these levels within the standard itself might encourage unqualified persons to undertake the inerting of a hazardous atmosphere, possibly leading to a severe accident. ``Labeled'' means identified with a sign, placard, or other form of written communication that informs all employees of the status or condition of the work space to which it is attached. This term was not included in the proposed revision of Subpart B, but OSHA believes that its inclusion is necessary for clarity. ``Lower explosive limit'' (LEL) means the minimum concentration of vapor below which propagation of a flame does not occur in the presence of an ignition source. This definition is unchanged from the proposal.
