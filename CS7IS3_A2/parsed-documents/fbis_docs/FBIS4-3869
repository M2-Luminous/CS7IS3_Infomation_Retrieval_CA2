He said he was convinced Canada and China could become very good cooperative partners. MacLaren also reaffirmed support for the restoration of China's status as a signatory state of GATT and for China's becoming a founding member of the World Trade Organization. Zou Jiahua said he had personally experienced the strong desire of the Canadian Government and personalities of Canada's various circles to strengthen cooperation with China in the past few days of his Canada visit. He said he thought the two countries already had the conditions for accelerating the development of their bilateral relations and that the opportunity is also very favorable. MacLaren and Zou Jiahua jointly explored the prospects for Sino- Canadian trade and cooperation in science and technology. Both sides believed that, though Sino-Canadian trade and economic relations have enjoyed comparatively great development in recent years, much remains to be desired when compared with the actual needs and existing potentials of the two countries. The potentials for the two countries to expand cooperation in energy, transportation, hydroelectric power, communications, and other infrastructure fields are still very tremendous. Both sides discussed relevant specific issues and reached a consensus on a wide range of topics. After their talks ended, MacLaren hosted a banquet in honor of Zou Jiahua and his party in the evening.
