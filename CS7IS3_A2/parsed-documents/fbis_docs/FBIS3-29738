It plans to draw up within 30 days a list of Japanese products which will be subject to punitive tariffs. Should Japan fail to respond with opening its market, the United States is prepared to initiate sanctions, including imposing punitive tariffs. However, this matter is difficult for us to understand, no matter how we look at it. A bilateral agreement on cellular phone systems guarantees U.S. access to Japan's market by allocating certain frequencies to U.S. firms which adopt a transmission system that is technologically different from that which Japan has already adopted. In other words, the accord gives equal opportunities to U.S. firms, but it does not guarantee them equal results after they have been given a chance to compete with Japanese firms. Currently, the issue has been pulled away from the hands of the government and is now subject to business strategies of private firms. According to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, however, the United States has demanded during trade talks which have been held so far that Japanese phone service companies purchase 225,000 portable phones within the next 18 months because U.S. firms have not made a good showing. Apparently, the "results-oriented" trade policy of the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton is also reflected among private firms. No wonder Japan complains that it is impossible to bring this about, to say the least. At their meeting last week, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Clinton must have surely confirmed the two nations would resume talks on their trade issues after a cooling-off period. The latest U.S. moves rub this agreement in the wrong way and add more fuel to the bilateral trade friction, rather than help it cool off. Since the Japan-U.S. summit meeting has ended in a failure, we urge that both nations maintain their composure. Should the two nations, whose combined GNP accounts for 40 percent of the world's total GNP, find themselves bogged down in a trade war, it would be harmful not only to themselves, but also to the whole world. It cannot be denied that the latest U.S. decision implies a "retaliatory" measure against Japan for the latter's rejection of U.S. demands for numerical targets at the framework trade talks. It has also been reported that the United States intends to withdraw a promise it has made at GATT's new round of multilateral trade talks (Uruguay Round) to reduce tariffs on electronic products. It is believed the United States has in mind major Japanese items in connection with this move. After the summit meeting, the U.S. Government, together with Congress, has hinted that it is considering various options toward imposing retaliatory measures against Japan. This is extremely regrettable. The United States is resorting to a strategy which includes sanctions because it believes that, from past experience, Japan will not change unless there is outside pressure and that, if pressured, Japan will eventually give in. Unfortunately, the agreement between the two nations in 1989 regarding opening of Japan's market for car and portable telephones is a classic example. At the time, the Japanese Government insisted there were "no more frequencies left for allotment" to U.S. firms. However, the government gave in to demands of the U.S. Government, which threatened sanctions by invoking its 1988 Trade Act. Thus, the government agreed to a last-minute political settlement which allowed U.S. firms to gain access to the Japanese market. Such involuntary market opening maneuvers should now be discontinued. Should the U.S. Government initiate sanctions against Japan, it would be logical for Japan to take its case before multilateral review under GATT. That, however, would further escalate the tension between the two nations. The telecommunications industry can be expected to still continue making solid growth. We feel Japan and the United States can further cooperate in fields they are strong in, such as technological and product development and building information networks.
