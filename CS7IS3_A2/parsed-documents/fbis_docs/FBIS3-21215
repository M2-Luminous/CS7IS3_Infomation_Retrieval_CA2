The Mission visited 14 materials research organizations, including the Angarsk Electrolysis-Chemical Complex, a research institute in Siberia. This mission recently compiled its survey report based on the observation of ``materials research activities in various shapes and forms, many of which may be considered competitive with counterparts in Japan and the U.S.'' According to that report, Russia's Atomic Energy Department, in cooperation with Phillips Corp., is pursuing a TV-tube production project with a production goal of 3 million pieces per year. An NPO (Ratti) (in a Moscow suburb) is studying high-temperature gas furnaces, carbon-coated fuels, and the nuclear reactor Topaz for space uses; is developing photomagnetic disks with a technology level equivalent to that of Sony Corp.; and is carrying out research with a single crystal growth device via the Czochralski method, one of the pull-up methods. At the 40-year-old Chemical Technology Research Institute, the report says, rare metals that have been made three to four times more efficient by the coprecipitation method are being applied to piezo-ceramics, and 300- to 500-kg lots of samarium are being produced in a large crucible by using large-current electromagnetic induction.
