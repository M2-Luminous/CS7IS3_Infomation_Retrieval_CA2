Korea was initially scheduled to submit its country schedule to GATT on February 15 but has since been delaying its submission as the United States and Japan locked horns over the issue of abolishing tariffs on some products. While delaying the submission of its country schedule, Korea has come under strong pressure from opposition political parties and the general public to reopen negotiations on the concluded Uruguay Round trade accord. On the surface, the government rules out the possibility of reopening GATT talks, saying the U.S. and Japan will submit their country schedules shortly after resolving the tariff problem. Government officials say the latest trade friction between Washington and Tokyo won't escalate into such a point where last December's GATT accord will be nullified. The trade friction between the two countries emerged as Japan backed down from its earlier promises in the Uruguay Round of trade talks by proposing withdrawing tariff concessions in its country schedule. After Japan committed itself to withdrawing its earlier tariff concessions on imported wood products, the U.S. made a similar action by revoking its promise to abolish tariffs on some imported electronic products including semiconductors. As the two countries are locked in a battle over the tariff problem, Korea is now withholding submitting its country schedule, keeping a close watch on how the U.S. and Japan act. But the government's "cautious action" has aroused public opinion urging the government to consider reopening talks on last December's GATT accord. A call for reopening GATT talks is gaining strong momentum as last December's accord is accepted as unsatisfactory, especially in the field of farm trade in which Korea was obligated to open its rice market to imported goods for the first time in its history. Reopening GATT talks has emerged as a political issue after Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang hinted at the possibility of reopening GATT talks at the ongoing extraordinary session of the National Assembly only on the condition that the world's economic powers withdraw their already-promised concessions. But officials at the Economic Planning Board [EPB] are skeptical about the possibility that the entire textbook of last December's GATT accord will be nullified. "The latest trade battle between Washington and Tokyo is nothing but a tempest in a teacup and won't put the whole GATT accord at jeopardy," an EPB official said. The official said Korea will take similar action to what the other economic powers do. "If the U.S. and Japan withdraw their tariff concessions, Korea will also revoke its earlier promise to abolish tariffs on imported semiconductors and copper," he said. But most government officials say it will be all but impossible to rewrite the textbook on world farm trade, an issue in which Koreans have keen interest. "Only when other countries try to revise the farm trade accord, will we consider taking similar action, but at the moment no one is trying to do so," the EPB said.
