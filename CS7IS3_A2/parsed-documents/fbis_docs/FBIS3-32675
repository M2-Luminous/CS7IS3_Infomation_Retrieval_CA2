It seems that poor coordination between (Micken) and the Salvadoran Foreign Ministry prevented his visit to the country. However, Molina Fonseca has said that disregard for human rights in the country is a matter of concern for everyone. [Begin Molina recording] I believe the human rights situation concerns all of us. We are going through very delicate times. It is a time for much thought. Many deaths are being reported. Bodies are constantly being found, and, unfortunately, these crimes are not being properly investigated. [end recording] With regard to the murder of Crescencio Diaz by U.S. soldier Michael Lopez, the ombudsman said investigations are underway to find out what happened. [Begin Molina recording] What should worry us is finding out how Major Lopez got out of the country. That is what the Salvadoran people should find out. We have opened a file on this case and we have requested information from the Foreign Ministry, immigration, the judge hearing the case, and the National Police director. We want to find out who is responsible for this. [end recording] Molina Fonseca also addressed the Goteras Jail massacre and said that he is very worried because the Justice Ministry has yet to issue a report on the case and establish responsibilities.
