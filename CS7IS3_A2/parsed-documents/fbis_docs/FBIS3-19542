Following a fresh outbreak of criticism against him, he secretly summoned the group of ministers, the party leadership, and the leaders of the party's parliamentary group to a meeting a few days ago at which he says agreement was reached both on the party's goals during the remainder of this election period and on ending the "clever tactical maneuvering" on personal issues. At an impromptu news conference Friday [18 February] at the parliamentary building he stated frankly that he had now "pounded his fist on the table," as he had promised to do earlier. That this quite literally happened was attested to by parliamentary group vice chairman Kimmo Sasi, among others. [passage omitted] He also related that party vice chairman Maija Perho-Santala apologized for statements she had made, including those in an interview with the principal Social Democratic newspaper, DEMARI. In it she described Salolainen as "extremely hypersensitive" and implied that an extra party congress might be called for. Caustic Opinions Salolainen did not mince words in his opinion of Perho-Santala, among others. He declared that he was "very displeased" by the disloyalty she had exhibited and pointed to the loyalty he himself had shown presidential candidate Raimo Ilaskivi as a model for others. [passage omitted] Clearly annoyed, Salolainen further noted that it is very difficult to lead a party in the current economic situation. Here he compared his own situation with Prime Minister Esko Aho's position as chairman of the Center Party. It is well known that he too has come under pressure from Paavo Vayrynen, among others. "We are both better than our reputations, but envy and shrewd calculation makes people behave strangely," Salolainen said. He went on to say that Aho is by far the best conceivable person for the Center Party chairmanship. He also said he sympathized with former Social Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Pertti Paasio. He referred warningly to the consequences that ensued when the SDP decided to remove capable Paasio. The Social Democrats are already coping with their third party chairman in a short period of time. Finally, he also accused "old journalist colleagues" of conducting a campaign against him out of envy. Some Understanding Despite the broadside against his critics, Salolainen also indicated some understanding of the dissatisfaction that exists. He conceded that he has recently been forced to devote quite a lot of energy to the European Union (EU) negotiations, but promised to begin devoting himself to preparations for the parliamentary election as soon as the EU negotiations have ended. Then the emphasis will be in the party sphere. In view of the time that remains in the election period, the party leadership has already defined its goals. Salolainen declined to talk more about that yet. Proposals and demands will be presented in good order later. It remains to be seen if order has now really been restored in the National Coalition Party. The party's parliamentary representatives seem to expect that there will continue to be internal dissatisfaction with the party chairman. [passage omitted]
