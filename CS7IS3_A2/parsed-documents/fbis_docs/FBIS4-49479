The report, which runs into tens of thousands of words, devotes a large portion to the defense of Chris Patten's erroneous policy, praising him for "correctly choosing a path which seeks to satisfy the demands of Hong Kong people" and indicating its full support for him. The authors of the report can be said to be Chris Patten's defense counsels. The report describes the "assumption of the post of governor of Hong Kong by Chris Patten, a former government minister with cabinet duties" as a "most significant change in Hong Kong." What have been the "changes" since Chris Patten arrived in Hong Kong? The following, briefly stated, are some of the notable changes: From the outset, he refused to discuss and cooperate with China and took a course of confrontation--this was the first change. He initiated great changes to the political system, produced a political reform package in contravention of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of corresponding to the Basic Law, and agreements and understandings between China and Britain--this was the second change. Throughout the negotiations, he kept on disrupting and undermining the talks between China and Britain on Hong Kong's 1994/95 electoral arrangements with a double-faced approach--this was the third change. He spoke of Hong Kong as an "international asset" and visited the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Western Europe to beg the international community for intervention in Hong Kong's affairs--this was the fourth change. He supported legal revisions and formulated new policies in order to sow dissension between civil servants and Hong Kong citizens, divide the Hong Kong people, and create disturbances--this was the fifth change. He distorted some criminal cases which China has handled according to law in an attempt to arouse discontent with the Chinese Government and foster "anxiety" about the future in the people--this was the sixth change. That such changes could be lauded by the report as "most significant changes" indicates well how much Britain's policy has changed toward China. As is well known, over the last few years, the British Government has changed its China policy on the basis of a completely erroneous assessment of the situation in China. It is against this background that Chris Patten came to Hong Kong to carry out Britain's mistaken policy. His point of departure, therefore, was "change," turning cooperation into confrontation and stability into turmoil. The core of his actions were "unilateral moves" to make key changes to the current political system in order to prolong Britain's control over Hong Kong after 1997. All of the changes made by Chris Patten in Hong Kong have violated agreements between China and Britain, worked against Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and impeded Hong Kong's steady transition. But the report tried its best to look for "grounds" for Chris Patten's "changes." "Ground" one: "The Joint Declaration does not require that all things remain unchanged between 1984 and 1997." Here, let us pose a question to the authors of the report: Does the Joint Declaration demand that Britain change the current political system during the transition? Nowhere in the Joint Declaration and its annexes is Britain given the power to greatly change the political system. The theme running through the document is one of "keeping unchanged." There are more than 20 instances of "retain," "maintain," "continue," and so on, which are all aimed at safeguarding Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and a smooth transition. It is also a responsibility placed by the Joint Declaration on China and Britain. This defense by the report is obviously awkward. "Ground" two: "The provisions of the Basic Law are at present not legally binding on the Hong Kong Government." This statement is clear in its connotation, namely, that there is no need to take the Basic Law into account in actions taken by Chris Patten before 1997 to change the political system. But since the British Hong Kong government is not bound by the Basic Law, why does Chris Patten keep explaining that his "political reform package" corresponds with and does not violate the Basic Law? Why did the report, following Chris Patten, say that "our legally sworn witnesses, our governor, and the British Government hold that absolutely nothing in the proposals made by the Hong Kong governor is inconsistent with the provisions of the Basic Law?" It is cheating to say that Chris Patten's package "corresponds with the Basic Law" and "is absolutely not inconsistent with the provisions of the Basic Law." The truth is that the package violated the principle of corresponding with the Basic Law. Because Chris Patten never wanted to be "bound" by the Basic Law and was willing to work only under the "Letters Patent" and the "Royal Instructions." Unexpectedly, the report revealed the truth. "Ground" three: "The British government and the Hong Kong authorities are not legally obliged to stop Chris Patten's proposals from being implemented before 1997." This gives them away again. Chris Patten is above the British Hong Kong Government and is in a supreme position, which is a power given by the British Queen. Therefore, the Hong Kong authorities have no means (or it should be said "have no intention") of stopping him from carrying out his package. It is easy to understand. And it shows that there is only dictatorship and no genuine democracy in Hong Kong at the present time. What we do not understand is who is commanding who -- the British Government or Chris Patten? Can it be Chris Patten who is commanding the British Government? The "Letters Patent" expressly stipulate that the "governor obeys the rules, ordinances, and rulings in the Letters Patent in making laws." Since Chris Patten's package received the "full support" of the British Government, why did the report say that the British Government is not legally obliged to stop Chris Patten from carrying out his package? Are they not shooting themselves in the foot? This was a slick move that backfired! The authors of the report, in intending to prove the correctness of Chris Patten with these "grounds," end up showing that his policy is wrong. This is something they probably did not expect!
