Sci.: "There Is But One Citizen In A Civilized Country"] [Text] The geographical location of the Azerbaijan Republic, which is located in what Academician Marr called the "Caucasian Isthmus," lies at the crossroads of Christianity and Islam, Christian-Gregorianism and Judaism. This occurred without discrimination among the peoples. In the course of historical processes the republic's population mixed and intermingled with other peoples and ethnic groups in addition to those who were Turkic-speaking. The fact that the majority of the people living in the republic are Muslim has led to broad relationships. This assures the close unity of the population. But processes following the fall of the Soviet empire caused a far-reaching national awakening in Azerbaijan, as well as in other places. The situation which was created led to the development of thoughts about entire nations, as well as minority peoples in determining their own fate. As a result of poorly thought out propaganda about ethnic relations, a number of minorities have begun to establish their own self "defense." Thus, they have created their own "societies."In the past, this commanded great sympathy. However, this also awakened the self-preservation instinct of peoples, and created Talysh, Lezgian, Avar, Udin and Kurdish factors. Undoubtedly, had attention in government circles not been drawn to this, the mature social stratum of national minorities could have slowed this process down and preserved it. It strikes many that the process of national awakening is accidental and could be quickly eliminated. Such ideas are mistaken, the disturbance created from national awakening will survive a long time. Among the population of those who have not yet become adults this process will continue even longer. This process also creates social tension. Earlier, 35-40 thousand youth having very strong self-preservation instincts left the republic every year. This significantly weakened the social tension. On one hand, the war, the lack of growth of jobs and the horrendous refugee situation, on the other, the non-objective propaganda by provocateurs, makes the situation more complicated. There is, however, no national basis for this. The present social and economic difficulties have created the war. We have to emerge from this situation by working together and striking back at the enemy. In the time of the last regime a number of mistakes were also made in ethnic policy. By saying "Turks have no friends other than Turks," the potential for ethnic discrimination was created. The population living in the republic, regardless of their size or number, took part jointly in the formation and development of national culture in Azerbaijan. These peoples were stabilized by one citizenship in our republic. Thus, there was never national discrimination in Azerbaijan. But, within the ongoing processes, the spirit of self-awareness began to grow. Provocateurs, making use of this, are beginning to increase dissatisfaction among the non-Turkic population. The emergence of the wish to "live freely" in man's nature creates the conditions for fragmentation. Narrow-minded men understand the concept of "living freely" only in a limited sense, and interpret it as the living freely of individual men. Nevertheless, the wish to live "freely" must be understood to mean the development of an ethnic group or people, its reaching world culture, and its national flowering. In recent years, the inflaming of ethnic feelings in the republic has done serious damage to mutual understanding. But social development led to the attainment of a civilized level within the population and the dominance of individuals with harmonious natures within the ethnos. Without them, no ethnos could survive, and each of these persons is a reason for the development of the ethnos. Because such people are at a mature stage, they equate their passionate impulse with their instinct for self-preservation. When the individual's self-preservation reaches a harmful level, it leads to the growth of people to a mentality of prodigality and an anti-social character. Mature individuals know that peoples possessing a small population and little territory can always gain an entree to world culture through the language and cultural treasury of any large nation because their intellectual development and local possibilities do not correspond to a modern level of development. Thus, socially mature persons from minority peoples have always worked to create close ties with the larger people. When the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic [ADP] was established the Avars living in Balaken and Zagatala Rayons wanted the opening of schools in their own language. Knowing this, Colonel Ahmedbey Dibirov (commander of the ADP army in the Sheki-Zagatala zone) advised them that if we want to reach out to world culture, we have to study in Turkish or Russian. Since our people are similar to the Turks as Muslims, it would be more appropriate for the children to study in Turkish. In every country the permanent residents of that country are citizens of it. Often those who talk about civilization have to be aware that in the United States of America, the world's most progressive, civilized and democratic country, there are only citizens, not nationalities. Second, the thrusting forward of national discrimination is ignorance. Such imprudence has done not less damage to the republic than the war. Ethnic relations in the Azerbaijan Republic are seen broadly in the context of living together, unity of religion and family relationships. The national question is an exceptionally broad and sophisticated problem. Without knowing its scope, certain peoples conducting a nationality policy who lack an instinct for self-preservation have not drawn necessary conclusions. Dividing a people according to the concept of large or small is in itself defective. In every measure conducted in this sector, the entire population must be evaluated as a whole because the destiny of the republic is in their hands. In other words, the demands on the one citizen and this same citizen's concerns must be identical.
