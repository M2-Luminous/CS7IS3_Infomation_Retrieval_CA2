FR940916-1-00173 FR940916-1-00020 48 CFR Part 31 [FAR Case 93&hyph;22] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Travel Costs AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to specify the documentation required to support the allowability of contractors' claimed travel costs. This regulatory action was subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before November 15, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW, Room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 93&hyph;22 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jeremy Olson at (202) 501&hyph;3221 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 93&hyph;22. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The FAR currently does not specify what documentation is required by contractors in order to support travel costs incurred under Government contracts. As with other contract costs, the requirement to document travel costs, in order to determine the allowability of costs incurred, has been implicit and would not normally be specifically stated in a cost principle. However, the Councils are proposing that specific criteria be incorporated in the cost principle at FAR 31.205&hyph;46 because the Office of Federal Procurement Policy SWAT Team on Civilian Agency Contracting in its report of December 3, 1992, entitled ``Improving Contracting Practices and Management Controls on Cost-Type Federal Contracts,'' found that agencies are having difficulty because the travel cost principle is silent on the documentation requirements. The report had recommended several changes to the FAR which were viewed to have Government-wide benefit and which would make the FAR less general with respect to the allowability of certain costs. The Councils also believe that revising the FAR to include specific documentation criteria will help in achieving consistent treatment of such costs by contracting officers. The documentation criteria being proposed for the FAR reflect similar requirements already imposed by Section 274 of the Internal Revenue Code for claiming travel costs for Federal tax purposes (26 U.S.C. 274(d)). There would, therefore, be no additional recordkeeping requirements placed on contractors. The proposed revisions also coincide with guidance currently contained in the Defense Contract Audit Agency's Contract Audit Manual (CAM) at CAM 7&hyph;1002.2. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule clarifies a condition of cost allowability for contractors who wish to be reimbursed under Government contracts subject to FAR 31.2. The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., applies, but the rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles do not apply. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 93&hyph;22), in correspondence.
