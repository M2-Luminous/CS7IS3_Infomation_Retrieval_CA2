We will exert exceptional efforts to complete the talks, but I do not wish to set dates because negotiations may take a day, a week, or even a month longer than a fixed date. This is not because of a lack of goodwill or pessimism, but experience has taught us that some issues that we imagine to be unimportant may emerge suddenly and cause a problem that will need long hours of negotiations to resolve. [Fahmi] Why does Israel insist on the need for the presence of Israeli security officers at the crossings to search travelers? [Peres] There are two basic reasons. Although I believe that 'Arafat has issued orders to PLO members to halt acts of violence and terrorism, there are other organizations that are still carrying out such acts. Israel has to engage in negotiations simultaneously as it faces violence and terrorism. We told 'Arafat that as long as this situation persists we will be strict on security issues because when a traveler crosses to Gaza and Jericho, he enters not only these two cities but also Israel and he has the freedom to travel in it. Therefore, we are strict in negotiations concerning security issues. We suggested to 'Arafat that the security arrangements be on a temporary basis and that if acts of violence stop, the arrangements we have agreed upon may be revised. [Fahmi] The Syrians still insist on your acceptance of a complete withdrawal before they define the meaning of a complete peace. Are we still in the same situation after the Geneva summit? [Peres] This does not make sense but the Syrians know our stance on the withdrawal. They must say what they mean by a complete peace. They must prove their willingness to accept security arrangements that fulfill the Israeli and Syrian security requirements. [Fahmi] Are there secret channels for negotiations between Syria and Israel and what are the means to achieve progress in these negotiations? [Peres] There are no channels for negotiations with Syria except the Washington negotiations. However, we need to conduct negotiations on a higher level of representation because new proposals can be put forth. The continuation of negotiations only at the official level means that the negotiators will keep repeating their familiar stances.
