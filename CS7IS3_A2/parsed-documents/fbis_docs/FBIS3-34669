Is that true? [Al-Muqaryif] All organizations and parties, especially the big ones, sometimes have differences of opinion and even differences of positions. This is one of the facts which apply to any political action. No organization has been able to avoid it or brag about it. An organization such as the NFSL, entering its 13th year in the face of a regime which has many resources and capabilities at its disposal, and carrying out its task against a background of serious and continuously changing regional and international circumstances, cannot be expected not to encounter situations and changes over which there would be some differences of opinion ... That is what has occurred within the NFLS over the past months. I would like to draw the attention of those interested in Libyan affairs and Libyan opposition affairs to the fact that what is important is not the occurrence of differences but the extent of the organization's ability to face and discuss them in a democratic and civilized way. The developments you have mentioned proved that the NFSL is capable of finding appropriate solutions through its democratic institutions represented by the field offices, the leadership body, the Permanent Bureau, and the National Council, which will be meeting soon to complete its resolution of pending issues. [Al-Ruzz] Is there a split? [Al-Muqaryif] There is no split. There are differences, sometimes sharp differences, over organizational and struggle issues. Some of them were discussed during the meeting of the Permanent Bureau, and discussion of the remaining issues will be completed at the meeting of the National Council. [Al-Ruzz] Could the differences lead to a split? [Al-Muqaryif] We believe that is unlikely and we hope it would not happen. Even if it did happen, it would be a familiar phenomenon in the world of the organizations with circumstances similar to our own. [Al-Ruzz] In the event of a split, how -- candidly speaking -- would that reflect on the NFSL's performance? [Al-Muqaryif] I will not make the mistake of saying that it would not affect the NFSL. It would be painful and regrettable for any front or organization to lose any of its sons, but what I do know and am certain of is that the NFSL has enough manpower and struggle mettle to healthily overcome any negative phenomenon, God forbid. Do not forget that the NFSL has, throughout its march, undergone some fierce crises which could have blown away its entire existence, such as the times of its exit from Morocco in 1983, from Sudan in 1985, and from Chad in 1990. [Al-Ruzz] Have the attempts to mend the rift been fully exhausted? [Al-Muqaryif] I have already said that the Permanent Bureau tackled many issues during its meeting of last December and left it to the National Council, which is the highest authority, to deal with the other issues. The council members have been summoned to an extraordinary meeting to complete that task. [Al-Ruzz] There are those who criticize you for having hastily announced that the NFSL claimed responsibility for the Bani-Walid military incidents last October, as a result of which dozens of the NFSL's supporters inside Libya were arrested. [Al-Muqaryif] What I would like to emphasize -- and hope would put an end to the controversy over that matter -- is that the October events were in fact a real and strong uprising in which a large number of men from the Libyan Armed Forces in Bani-Walid, Misratah, and Tarhunah participated. The regime was violently shaken by these events and it faced them with violence. This fact cannot be changed by the regime's attempts to trick some sectors of the media, which have put forward certain claims of the regime's own making, nor can it be changed by the differences of opinion that have emerged regarding the NFSL's responsibility. The other point I want to stress here is that a number of officers who participated in the operation or were linked to it have managed to leave Libya and will shortly meet with the media and present all the facts they know about what happened, and will reveal the extent of the NFSL's connection with that serious operation. [Al-Ruzz] May we know the names of these officers? [Al-Muqaryif] Of course not, for the time being. [Al-Ruzz] When will they meet with the media? [Al-Muqaryif] In the near future. We are sure that official circles in a number of states are aware of and know what really happened, its magnitude, and the degree of the NFSL's responsibility for that. [Al-Ruzz] What about those who were detained as a result of the NFSL claiming responsibility? [Al-Muqaryif] Do you think that the regime waits for the NFSL's announcement before taking savage and severe action against the members of the military and the civilians it suspects of having moved against it? The regime does not need any announcement from anyone. Its record over the past years confirms that fact. Actually, the NFSL acted out of a sense of responsibility about that internal act of heroism which the regime tried to play down and demean, and for which it tried to give other reasons -- such as claiming that a number of officers rebelled because of a delay in the payment of their salaries, or that they moved militarily for tribal reasons. Our knowledge of the truth of that action and the men who were behind it made us move to tell the world that it was part of the Libyan people's opposition movement seeking to overthrow the regime in favor of a democratic alternative. [Al-Ruzz] Why do you give so much importance to the October military movement, which was over in two days? [Al-Muqaryif] I believe that the October movement was one of the largest and most serious movements against the regime, be it in reference to the nature of the movement, preparation for and participation in it, or its timing. Prior to that movement the regime had believed that the tribes were loyal to it, and it relied considerably on their men. But the occurrence of that movement and the participation of tribal people in it faced the regime with a new situation. For one thing, it could no longer depend on the loyalty of these tribes and, second, it could not fill the great vacuum created after the expulsion and arrest of members of these tribes in the various army units, security organs, and other civilian sectors. [Al-Ruzz] Those opposed to the NFSL criticize its close links with the United States and maintain that these links confuse matters and rob it of its independence? [Al-Muqaryif] The NFSL has, since its foundation, been anxious to understand the regional and international realities related to the Libyan issue, and it has addressed these realities most evenly, wisely, and responsibly. That in no way means that the NFSL has at any time forfeited its independence, will, or national aspirations. The Bab-al-'Aziziyah operation was the best evidence of that. Furthermore, the fact that the NFSL had initiated and maintained its military program in Chad as represented by the Libyan National Army and its struggle in the most difficult circumstances was another example of that fact. There can be no doubt that the October events were another manifestation of that at a time when many thought that the NFSL had forfeited its will to struggle against the regime in the face of international developments and changes. [Al-Ruzz] It has been claimed that Dr. Muhammad al-Muqaryif is the obstacle standing in the way of unification of the opposition factions, and that his way of addressing that issue has frequently impeded the unification process.... [Al-Muqaryif] It would be better not to address this question to me. I wish you had addressed it to the NFSL's institutions. I wish you had asked them: Did Muhammad al-Muqaryif really try to impose his views on this matter? I believe that accepting such a claim would mean that all the NFSL's institutions, including men and fighters, are just a front manipulated by the secretary general. Nobody would believe or accept such a claim. I am proud to belong to a democratic organization based on men who have chosen its objectives, methods, and policies. All I and my brothers in the leadership do is implement and carry out the resolutions passed by the National Council in its past sessions. Furthermore, I have no personal opinion on that issue that is any different from the views of my brothers; and even if I did, I believe that the brothers would have prevented me from imposing that opinion on them. [Al-Ruzz] As we are talking about unity of the opposition, what did happen at the Algeria meeting? [Al-Muqaryif] First of all, I am not saying that the meeting of the opposition took place in Algeria. I will not say where it was held. A meeting did take place between the NFSL, the National Alliance, and the Coordination Committee. It did in fact crown the efforts of many elements of the Libyan opposition, not necessarily from the highest ranks of the leadership. The meeting took place in the middle of last October and it was attended by We agreed that, after the signing of the statement, a committee would be formed to prepare for a general conference of the Libyan opposition, and we had hoped that the conference, which was supposed to take place 21 November, would lead to the signing of a dcoument stating the constant principles of the struggle. We in the NFSL were prepared to go all the way in the field of coordination among the factions even if that meant the formation of a unified command and joint bodies, and so on. But, regrettably, the circumstances of one of the organizations prevented the signing of the draft statement. Its leadership asked for more time to think about the matter. There can be no doubt that the sudden disappearance of Mansur al-Kikhya was a great loss for these efforts, as well as for the national struggle in general, because of his tolerant nature and willingess for dialogue and the bridging of views. He played a major part in promoting the right circumstances for the present plan. His absence has greatly affected many aspects including this particular issue. [Al-Ruzz] What do you have to say about al-Kikhya's continued disappearance? [Al-Muqaryif] On the human level, it was a real tragedy for him, his family, his friends, and his fellow strugglers. We will undoubtedly miss him, particularly in these circumstances. What did happen? Nobody can know for sure, but I do not hesitate to point an accusing finger at the regime as being the party behind the disappearance. There are many examples in the regime's old and recent record. The resolutions of the so-called Revolutionary Committees and al-Qadhdhafi's recent speeches confirm the new trend in the regime's way of dealing with the opposition. The Libyan regime has a major vested interest in al-Kikhya's disappearance at this stage. We have information that the regime will not restrict its operations to just kidnapping al-Kikhya. It intends to carry out more operations. Al-Qadhdhafi's invitation to Ahmad Jibril and Abu-Nidal to Libya was for that purpose. We also have information that the regime did not halt its efforts after Jibril and Abu-Nidal refused to settle in Libya and that he sent Colonel 'Abdallah Hijazi to them and Hijazi met with them and offered coordination of operations against the opposition. [Al-Ruzz] How do you assess the recent government changes in Libya? [Al-Muqaryif] Before talking about the changes, it suffices, in order to discern the tragic conditions of the Libyan people under that regime, to examine what went on at the General People's Congress and what was said by Abu-Zayd 'Umar Durdah, secretary of the General People's Committee, and the ministers. Salaries are not being paid and there is no education and no medical or other services. The new government bears no particular hallmarks, except that 'Umar al-Muntasir was retained at the Foreign Ministry as someone who could help contacts with the West. It also includes a number of Revolutionary Committees members with vast experience in terrorism such as 'Izz-al-Din al-Hanshiri, Muhammad Hijazi, and Ahmad Ibrahim.
