It occurred to me that we could perhaps make an exception today so that you yourself could pick an event or topic of the past days that you would like to talk about. [Klaus] You have taken me by surprise. I am really not prepared for this. I think that the topic that somewhat stirred up public opinion as well as the political sphere was, of course, the recalling of Tomas Jezek as the head of the National Property Fund [NPF] and the appointment of the new candidate to that post. [passage omitted] It seems to me that it is a serious matter. As far as I can see I think the way it was done did not satisfy many -- the public in particular. I think that this is a pity. Most of all, it would be a pity to send out to the world any confusing signals which, in my opinion, are not appropriate. [Stahlavsky] Mr. Prime Minister, in connection with Tomas Jezek's departure from the NPF, Jaroslav Ortman, a representative of the left bloc, said that this is the beginning of a search for the one who is guilty of errors made during privatization. [Klaus] No, that is certainly not the case. I believe that with Ortman it is a case of wishful thinking. It really is not the case. The problem is on one side a standard problem, that is a political struggle of one against another. [passage omitted] [Stahlavsky] [passage omitted] What is your opinion on the strengthening of presidential office powers? [Klaus] None of us has discussed the strengthening or non- strengthening of the presidential office. Similarly, none of us has dealt with eliminating the Senate from the Constitution. We are permanently being attributed ideas like that and I repeat that we are not dealing with such issues. [passage omitted]
