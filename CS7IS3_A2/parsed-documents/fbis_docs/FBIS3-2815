The Implementation of the State Budget for 1993; 2. The Draft State Budget for 1994; and 3. Deepen the Fiscal and Taxation Reform, Relentlessly Increase Revenues and Cut Back Expenditures, and Strive to Fulfill the 1994 State Budget. 1. The Implementation of the State Budget for 1993 Total state revenues in 1993 came to 511.482 billion yuan -- including 69.384 billion yuan income received from domestic and foreign debts -- covering 113.1 percent of the budget, a 23.2 percent increase over the previous year. Total state expenditures amounted to 531.982 billion yuan -- including 33.735 billion yuan spent to pay for the principle and interest of domestic and foreign debts -- equaled 112.5 percent of the budget, a 21.2 percent increase over the 1992 figure. This resulted in a deficit of 20.5 billion yuan, which was not in excess of the budgeted figure. Based on the double-entry system, revenues in the regular budget totalled 407.391 billion yuan, or 119.3 percent of the budgeted figure; and construction budget revenues -- not including income from domestic and foreign debts -- totaled 107.264 billion yuan, or 122.5 percent of the budgeted figure. The implementation of the 1993 state budget. Both revenues and expenditures exceeded the budgeted figures by a fairly large margin. According to our preliminary analysis, the overfulfillment of revenues by a large margin was mainly due to three factors: First, the national economy's sustained, rapid growth caused an increase in revenues accordingly. The rapid growth of the national economy and the commodity's circulation expansion brought about the overfulfillment of revenues of main tax categories closely related to economic growth. Revenues from the product tax, value-added tax, and business tax alone were 49.5 billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. Second, measures to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control yielded positive results and led to a marked drop in revenue losses. According to State General Administration of Taxation statistics, efforts to screen tax reductions and exemptions and to collect tax payments in arrears for the previous years brought about a 30 billion yuan increase. Third, in 1994, the central authorities decided to implement the fiscal tax assignment system, under which the central government will reimburse local governments a certain amount of tax revenues based on their 1993 figures. This new system aroused the local governments' enthusiasm for revenue collection, and they took a number of measures to strictly collect taxes, manage revenues, and prevent tax evasion. As a result, revenues increased by a large margin in the fourth quarter. However, some local governments, to inflate the base figure for the central government's reimbursement, resorted to illegitimate means and fraud by collecting taxes before the due date. We have urged local governments to examine and correct themselves, and we will organize forces to verify and handle cases in accordance with the State Council's requirements. As far as increased expenditures were concerned, expenditures related to economic growth increased by a bigger margin. Expenditures needed for the development of various undertakings also increased by a larger margin. Of these increases, expenses on cultural, educational, science, and health undertakings were 10.816 billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. Expenses on education alone were 6.463 billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. Expenses on urban maintenance and construction was 3.86 billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. Spending for wage adjustment of workers and staff of administrative institutions and units was budgeted at 4 billion yuan. In the course of implementation, however, because the margin of wage adjustment was higher than the originally estimated figure, in addition to an increase of personnel and changes in jobs and grades throughout the year, the actual spending was almost double the budgeted figure. Generally speaking, the implementation of the 1993 budget was good. Special mention should be made of the fact that although treasury bond sales were sluggish for some time last year, party committees and governments at all levels, as well as relevant departments, attached great importance and lent enthusiastic support to such sales. Financial departments at all levels also devoted massive manpower to providing services aimed at promoting sales, thereby ensuring completion of the task of issuing treasury bonds. This was of vital importance to the fulfillment of last year's budgetary tasks. II. The Draft State Budget for 1994 The guiding principles for planning the state budget for 1994 are: Fully implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; ensuring smooth progress in financial, taxation, and other major economic reforms; continuing to tighten and improve macroeconomic regulation and control; actively building up financial sources; paying attention to improving enterprises' efficiency; ensuring that increases in financial revenue would match economic development; upholding the principle of acting within one's means; readjusting the revenue structure; appropriately increasing input in such key sectors as agriculture, education, science and technology, and infrastructure; maintaining needed increases in funds for national defense, public security, and judicial departments; strictly controlling ordinary fixed assets investments and nonproductive expenditures; and promoting sustained, rapid, and healthy development in the national economy, as well as overall social progress. We have made initial plans for the 1994 budget in accordance with the guiding principles for budgetary planning and the changes in budget requirements. Excluding revenues from the repayment of domestic and foreign debts, total state revenues are set at 475.99 billion yuan, a 7.7 percent increase over the previous year and calculated on similar terms. Excluding expenses used to repay domestic and foreign debts, total state expenditures are set at 542.914 billion yuan, a 15 percent increase over the previous year and calculated on similar terms. The difference between revenues and expenditures is 66.919 billion yuan [as heard]. An 7.7 percent increase over the previous year is planned for financial revenues in 1994; the percentage increase is not high. Calculated on comparable terms, this year's financial revenues will only increase 14.4 percent over the previous year. The current revenue plan, therefore, is positive because it is based on a full consideration of factors leading to increased revenues, such as rapid economic development and improved management. The draft state budget compiled according to the dual budget system follows: Revenues in the regular budget total 448.911 billion yuan, a 9.9 percent increase over the previous year. Revenues in the construction budget total 83.149 billion yuan, a decrease of 22.5 percent from the figure fulfilled in the previous year. In the draft state budget for 1994, revenues in the central budget are set at 332.91 billion yuan, a 3.8 percent increase over the previous year. The central budget compiled according to the dual budget system follows: Revenues in the regular budget total 325.923 billion yuan, a 6 percent increase over the previous year. Revenues in the central construction budget total 22.243 billion yuan, a 44.3 percent decrease from the previous year. To facilitate examination by fellow deputies, I would like to expound policy-related issues in compiling the draft state budget: The question of debts in 1994. Domestic and foreign debts for 1994 are set at 129.245 billion yuan, a 39.361 billion yuan increase. The total debt volume accounts for 3.8 percent of the year's gross domestic product, a slight increase over the previous year. The question of promoting rural economic development in an all-around way. Expenditures for aiding agricultural production and for paying various agriculture-related operational charges in this year's state budget total 37.8 billion yuan, a 17.4 percent increase over the actual expenses in the previous year. Including other budgetary items used as agricultural expenses, the state's planned financial input in agriculture totals 52.3 billion yuan, a 7 billion yuan increase over the previous year. On the issue of further successfully running large and medium-sized state enterprises. This year's reform of the fiscal and taxation systems will focus on transforming mechanisms to seek unity of the taxation system for all enterprises. It will play a positive role in invigorating state enterprises' stamina for development and competitiveness. Meanwhile, our reform of the taxation system will scrap the regulatory tax for state enterprises and exempt them from payment of funds for construction of key energy and transport projects and for state budget regulating funds, thereby increasing their financial strength by over 14 billion yuan. The issue of increasing investment in the focal points of science, technology, and education. This year's budget for culture, education, science, and public health expenses is more than last year by 17 billion plus, or 18 percent. III. Deepen the Fiscal and Taxation Reform, Relentlessly Increase Revenues and Cut Back Expenditures, and Strive to Fulfill the 1994 State Budget Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability constitute the overall situation for the work of the whole party and the whole nation. Ensuring the smooth progress of reform of the fiscal and taxation systems and fulfilling the state budget for 1994 are of crucial importance for the fiscal and taxation work to subordinate themselves to and serve the overall situation. We must successfully carry out the work in a down-to-earth manner to ensure that the anticipated results are achieved from reform of the fiscal and taxation systems. The main substance of this year's fiscal and taxation reform include reforming the current local fiscal contractual responsibility system to implement a tax assignment system on the basis of a rational division of power between central and local authorities, reforming the taxation system to establish an indirect tax system based mainly on the value-added tax, unifying enterprises' income tax and personal income tax while reforming state enterprises' profits distribution system, and improving and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. The central government must bring the issuance of bonds under control in accordance with the amount of debts approved by the state; local governments must adhere to the principle -- keep expenditures within the limits of income and maintain a balance between revenue and expenditure -- in making its budget, and are not allowed to make budgets that incur deficits. We must take advantage of the favorable opportunity offered by fiscal and taxation reform to improve revenues. We must improve the methods for the issuance of state treasury bonds to ensure fulfillment of the issuance tasks. As the amount of state treasury bonds to be issued this year is very large, it will have a direct bearing on the results of fiscal and taxation reform and on balance between revenue and expenditure. Financial departments at all levels must closely coordinate with the bank to ensure that priority is given to the issuance of state treasury bonds under the centralized leadership of local party committees and governments. Financial and banking departments at all levels must accumulate experiences, actively explore methods for the issuance of state treasury bonds under the conditions of a market economy, bring the total amount of expenditures under control, and guarantee the expenditures for key projects during the issuance of state treasury bonds. When making arrangements for financial expenditures, they must adhere to the principle of doing what one is capable of, ensure adequate funds for key projects, and curb expenditures for ordinary ones. This year, in addition to continuing to increase input into agriculture, education, and science and technology sectors and into infrastructure projects, in addition to guaranteeing the necessary increase in outlays for national defense, judicial, procuratorial, and public security departments, we must give priority to the expenditures for payment of wages and for state grain reserves. It is strictly forbidden to transfer wages for staff and workers to carry out new projects. Construction of projects arranged with financial funds by areas that delay payment of wages to staff and workers shall be resolutely postponed or stopped. Institutions that delay payment of wages to staff and workers are not permitted to purchase small cars or other expensive, luxurious consumer goods. Financial departments at all levels must attach a high degree of importance to the issue.
