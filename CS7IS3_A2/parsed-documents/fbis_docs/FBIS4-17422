As was explained by Inese Birzniece, chairman of the Parliamentary Commission for Human Rights, the amendments which have been adopted in accordance with Article 81 of the Constitution, refer to people who have entered Latvia illegally, and they have been adopted with the purpose of establishing procedures for removing these people from the state. The changes in the law, which are said to fully correspond with the CSCE mission in Latvia, are not yet accepted in their full form, therefore it was impossible to learn today the precise procedure for deportations and possible appeals. However, as we were told by I. Birzniece, "it is out of the question that some mass deportations could take place." It is stated in the amendments that they do not apply to people whose legal status in Latvia is not clear, and regarding whom the legislative process has not yet been completed. I. Birzniece emphasized that the draft law on the status of noncitizens should be accepted as soon as possible. According to the changes, the border guards and state police will have the sole right to deport the above mentioned people, whereas these individuals shall have the right to appeal the decision to the director of the Immigration Department or in a court of law, I. Birzniece explained to DIENA. According to a report by Edvins Inkens, the minister for special assignments, at a press conference, 400 people were deported from Latvia last year. There was not a single appeal submitted in any of the cases, which proves that the deportations were correct and well based.
