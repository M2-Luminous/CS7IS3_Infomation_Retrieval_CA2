Representing the Israeli Bedouin population, al-Sani' made it clear that the Hebron massacre was indeed a terrible thing; yet, it was the way the Israel Police and other security forces treated the Palestinian citizens of Israel, who expressed their reaction to the massacre, which made many of the Arab leaders think that they do not have equal rights as citizens. They will not accept the fact that there is different treatment of Jewish and Arab demonstrators. If the sights in the field express a reality, if indeed they expressed the way the Jewish majority really feels toward the Palestinian minority, then there seems to be no chance of holding a dialogue that would lead to coexistence in the foreseeable future. The killing by police gunfire of a resident of the Bedouin village of Rahat during demonstration there last week started a fire that does not seem extinguishable in the near future. The reactions by the Palestinian citizens of Israel and the counter reactions by the security forces created a situation which casts doubt on the possibility of attaining an arrangement in the future that would satisfy the demands of one side. Since the Hebron massacre, the leaders of the Arab public have been articulating the PLO negotiating demands, calling on Israel to accept them. For example, they call for dismantling settlements, disarming settlers, stating that the settlements and peace cannot coexist. The fact that the Negev Bedouin -- who until recently have not regarded themselves part of the Palestinian nation -- hoisted PLO flags, is an indication of a sweeping phenomena which points to a changing reality, currently forming before our eyes. We have seen such flags hoisted in the Galilee and the Triangle, but the sights from the Negev, including the reports that stones were hurled at cars on the Beersheba-'Arad highway, make the Jewish population feel that the security situation has deteriorated -- and not only in the territories, but inside the Greed Line. At a seminar of police commanders, convened last week to discuss aspects of the peace negotiations, the Hebron massacre was placed on the agenda. To the amazement of many of those present, some 25 percent of the officers expressed some degree of support for or understanding of the Hebron murder. Expressions that do not become police commanders were heard there, and the silent majority did not react with anger. If the police commanders' anger in view of the situation in the territories is understandable at all, the way they reacted to the events in the Israeli Palestinian sector can probably explain their conduct as everyday law and order observers. Hence it is easy to sympathize with Knesset Member al-Sani's remarks regarding the double standard which prevails in Israel with regard to its Jewish and Arab citizens. The continuation of the acts of protest by the Arab public here, in fact, reveals three levels of reaction: One expresses pain over the Hebron massacre, in which worshipers were murdered during the fast of Ramadan while in a holy mosque, along with real sympathy for their brothers in the territories. On a second level, Israeli Arabs express growing anxiety about acts carried out in the territories which, they believe, might be repeated against them, mentioning the events of Land Day and the Kafr Qasim massacre in the same context. They mainly fear that the Israeli reaction was not an isolated event, rather that it is the result of a policy which might make them change their place of residence. Some Israeli Arab leaders believe that, in parallel with the transfer of settlers from the territories inside the Green Line, some of them might find themselves outside Israel's boundaries -- because of territorial changes or other reasons. On a third level, the Israeli Arabs point at their distress over poverty and neglect in their sector, which causes frustration which, in turn, drags them to support a fundamentalist religious element which contains nationalistic elements in it. The combination of religion and nationalism breeds extremism, and not only in Islam. The Jewish group residing in Hebron is an example of this, even if this group does not suffer from poverty and neglect. Israeli Palestinians and Jews now face a difficult dilemma. Having been repressed for years, the feelings of hostility and rage came bursting out, creating a new reality. The Oslo agreement, in which Israel recognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people, does not stipulate whether or not the PLO also represents the Israeli and Jordanian Palestinians. Israeli Arabs today regard themselves part of the Palestinian nation. Feeling rejected by the Jewish majority in Israel -- as was seen last week -- they might turn to the PLO for political asylum. For its part, the PLO will not hesitate to accept them. The leaders of Israel will then face a problem. It is possible that the Israeli Arabs will be party to comprehensive Middle East peace negotiations in which the Green Line will no longer be sacred. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who is preoccupied with the political process, must take some time to formulate a comprehensive policy on the Israeli-Arab conflict. It could be assumed that it will be difficult to continue with the system of making interim arrangements to bring about short spells of quiet. Because the Israeli Arabs are on the political agenda today, he will have to listen to more voices than he has so far.
