The report says that an appeal was made by Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister, to armed persons who illegally occupied land in the O Bek K'am area. One day after the appeal was made, these persons still refuse to leave the expropriated land. "To resolve the issue peacefully, the government used airplanes to drop leaflets containing the appeal of the prince on the disputed area, which is reported to be about 200 hectares. "Faced with the stubborness of these armed violators, on the afternoon of 17 February at around 1430, combined forces comprising troops from the special military region, the military police, and the Interior Ministry security police, accompanied by six tanks and armored vehicles, entered the area. The troops fired the first salvo against targets believed to be the positions of the ringleaders of the illegally armed persons." "It is to be recalled that 80 percent of these land violators are armed and the other 20 percent rely on them." "According to reliable reports, the ringleaders are a former FUNCINPEC (National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia) general, a field grade officer; a former lieutenant general and a major general of the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party. Ten percent of this group is demobilized soldiers; some are former Cambodian People's Party troops." "According to preliminary reports, the combined forces are in complete control of the area. They have arrested more than 20 trespassers and are burning houses built by them. According to reports from some people living near the area, by 1800 on 17 February four persons were killed in the assault." In its 20 February issue, REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA continues its report on the operations against the trespassers, saying that "about 1430, [on 18 February] the armed group, which according to reliable sources comprises about 100 armed persons, was still in the area and had fired two B-40 rockets at the special military region forces stationed nearby." According to the same sources, the special military region command and the Phnom Penh police received authorization following this incident to act to stop the violence. "His Excellency [H.E.] General Tea Chamrat, co-defense minister, and co-Minister H.E. Yu Hokkri, accompanied by H.E. co-State Secretary Khan Savoeun, went to the scene. They issued orders to the forces in cooperation with the armored vehicles and tanks to launch an operation against the anarchic armed group." "After a clash lasting about an hour and a half between the anarchic armed group -- which one source says consists of former Sereika movement troops led by Seng Phirom and Yim Vanna -- and the royal government security forces, the situation was calmed because many group members surrendered and others were arrested by the royal government forces. Realizing this unfavorable situation, the `ringleaders' of the anarchic group managed to escape and take along some weapons." "According to preliminary reports on the operation to eliminate armed anarchy lasting a full afternoon on 18 February, many anarchic structures in the 200-hectare area were dismantled and burned by the combined forces. Furthermore, some forces have disclosed that as a result of this clash, the royal government's combined forces finally arrested 48 members of the anarchic group and the people staying in the area, including two women, and confiscated many weapons. "According to a reliable source, this brief armed clash resulted in a number of unspecified deaths and injuries." The paper concludes the report saying that "on 18 February at about 0915, many members of the military police and the police force surrounded a building on Sivutha Road north of the Phsa Depo market in Tuol Kouk ward. The goal was to search and arrest some members" and that "a military policeman has disclosed that the combined forces arrested four suspects and took them to military police headquarters for questioning." According to this official, "what is regrettable is that a suspect, believed to be one of the ringleaders with the rank of major general, escaped before the search."
