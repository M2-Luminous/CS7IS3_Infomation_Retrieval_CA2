This is a short summary of the main reactions to the U.S. "diplomatic renaissance," without which no progress could be expected, regardless of the outcome of the Western military ultimatum. Discussions and negotiations should be held both before and after the bombs, and these possible bombs have also been taken out of the last diplomatic safe: The Serbs are expected to make the most concessions, and, after sanctions, they had to be threatened with the largest stick. "Everybody agreed that the final end to this war must be agreed upon at the negotiating table," stated Peter Tarnoff, Warren Cristopher's assistant for political issues, who, along with envoy Charles Redman, is, on the U.S. side, in charge of a new gathering of the Western allies and the restoration of the Bosnian negotiations. Madelaine Albright talked of this as the main message of the NATO ultimatum at the Security Council, in the evident attempt to appease the Russians and encourage the Serbs who support a peaceful solution. What is it that is real and new, since everything sounds so familiar? Washington and Europe have finally agreed upon a joint approach, and once the White House gets into something with someone else, it has to lead. In this list of immediate tasks, Europe and Moscow had to give up the idea that a larger carrot (suspension of the sanctions) could curb the Serb appetites, and Washington agreed -- at least ostensibly -- to press its Muslim proteges. They must finally be satisfied with "reasonable demands," instead of constantly making the list of their wishes longer. Charles Redman therefore quickly went to Sarajevo, so that it could be firmly determined once and for all what kind of Bosnia and how much Bosnia for themselves the Muslims support. Immediately following these talks, the Serbs and Croats will be offered a kind of final menu that will not be based on the blackmailing principle of "take it or leave it," but would nevertheless be something that it is almost impossible to refuse, since "they would have to realize" -- says Tarnoff -- "that behind everything this time lies the unity and the common purpose of Europe and the United States." What about Croatia? Even Peter Tarnoff admits that Washington and Brussels have yet to agree upon a common approach to this issue. Germany has reappeared on the stage as the illegitimate foster parent of its naughty foundling, which it long ago sent into punishment, but still opposes someone else slapping it. In all this, Bonn can also expect new headaches at the constant diplomatic carousel that, in the Croatian public, turns Klaus Kinkel into a torturer at one moment and a savior at another. In a somewhat more extensive answer to the question of what this unachieved joint Western policy toward Croatia could look like, Tarnoff answered cautiously, but still threateningly: "We are aware of the need to resolve the issue of the Krajinas, and we know that Croatia is playing a very important role in the final (Bosnian) agreement. Croatia can profit a lot from the agreement, taking into account its economic situation resulting from a great number of war refugees. However, if it is not capable of playing a useful role, it could be put under pressure." Everything Mario Nobilo said at the Security Council was based on the attempt to make the world see that Croatia is more yielding, peacemaking, and prepared for all negotiations. Certain "elements" of the Croatian Army will be withdrawn. Zagreb and Sarajevo jointly signed the request for the international control of their borders, and soon a real Croat-Muslim ceasefire can be expected. The Sarajevo Ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey did not attack Zagreb at the Security Council (he and Nobilo are even friends), which should show that it is easier to breathe after Mate Boban. However, at the same time all the media talk of great military successes of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council], and some foreign sources claim that the Croat forces -- aided by "elements" of the Croatian Army -- had started an unprecedented attack at Gornji Vakuf. Each negotiation is thus first announced at the frontlines by suicidal attempts to secure as strong territorial maps as possible for the negotiating table, and in that case even Mario Nobilo is not able to conceal the terrible reality by well-formulated papers. Many will say that Peter Tarnoff spoke in an unusually mild way about Croatia, but the best informed still know that because of these attempts to retrieve at least part of what was so irresponsibly lost in central Bosnia, Zagreb could be forced to sacrifice part of the so crucial sea as early as the following day. Because, with the Americans, everything is both easier and more difficult at the same time.
