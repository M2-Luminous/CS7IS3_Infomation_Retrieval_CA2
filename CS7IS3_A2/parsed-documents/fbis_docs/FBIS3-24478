It has been observed that organic compounds irradiated with UHF-energy in the presence of a sensitizer results in reactions giving products analogous to those of high temperature cracking (pyrolysis), and thus this process may be termed UHF-cracking. In the present work some results are presented on the UHF-cracking of liquid n-hexane, its mixtures with ethanol, and also UHF-cracking of n-hexane in the presence of other additives. The products were chiefly mixtures of light saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. It was demonstrated that with UHF-cracking of n-hexane at atmospheric pressure, the ethylene content in the products exceeded 44 mole percent. The presence of hydroxyl-containing additives suppresses processes leading to the formation of coke, so that the yield of useful products is practically unaltered.
