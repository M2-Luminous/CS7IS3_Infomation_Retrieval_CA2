In the early morning of May 2 last year, Xiangyanghong 16, a Chinese scientific exploration ship heading for the Pacific Ocean for a 187-day research mission, was involved in a collision with a foreign ship. The exploration ship and millions of dollars worth of instruments and documents sank to the bottom of the ocean. Soon after the accident, China decided to resume the mission. Over the past year, necessary equipment was purchased, produced and installed. Xiangyanghong 09, the sister ship of Xiangyanghong 16, was transformed and test-navigated for the mission.
