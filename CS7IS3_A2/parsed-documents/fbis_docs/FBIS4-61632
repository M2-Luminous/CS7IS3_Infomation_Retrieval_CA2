As is known, Russia's budget for 1994 has not yet been given final approval by the State Duma. The total sum of arrears for the first quarter is R [rubles] 5.2 trillion, including R3.4 trillion owed to the federal budget, or 15 percent of anticipated revenue. The trend has increased for priority to be given to payments to territorial budgets, to the detriment of the federal budget. Thus, according to the Economics Ministry's figures, on 1 January federal budget nonpayments constituted 58.1 percent of the total sum of nonpayments, but by 1 April this figure had risen to 64.7 percent. Budgetary revenue in the first quarter of 1994 amounted to R17.4 trillion (not taking account of external economic activity), R6.9 trillion of which went into the federal budget. Out of the total sum, the most significant revenue was from profits tax -- R7 trillion, or 40.2 percent; from VAT -- R4.8 trillion, or 27.6 percent; and from income tax from private individuals -- R2.4 trillion, or 13.8 percent.
