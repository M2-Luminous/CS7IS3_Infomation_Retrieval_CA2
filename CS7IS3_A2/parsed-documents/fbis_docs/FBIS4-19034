This was stressed by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky on Monday [11 April] at a conference of the Social Democratic Group of the Trade Union for Metal Workers, Miners, and Workers in the Energy Sector in Bad Hofgastein. According to one of the objectives that the chancellor defined in an eight-point program before the Social Democratic metal workers, "Austria must not stop focusing on industry. For our export-oriented industry, membership in the European Union [EU] will make free access to the European Union, the largest market of the world, possible. In addition, however, new opportunities, particularly in the markets of dynamic growth -- that is, Central and South America, Southeast Asia, and China -- have to be pursued." There are already tendencies of success that have to be strengthened now, "so that real economic growth will again be greater than the increase in productivity." Only then will the unemployment figures strongly decrease again, he said. Economic growth could above all be considerably increased by a more ambitious infrastructure policy, the chancellor stated, who mentioned as examples, among others, the development of the railroad and the improvement of telecommunications. In concrete terms, Vranitzky outlined an eight-point program. It contains the following proposals: First, the improvment of industrial location; second, the promotion of regional industrial bases; third, improved training; fourth, intensified export promotion; fifth, improved research and development; sixth, entry into the European Union in order to ensure access to the EU market and to be better able to protect our interests against other economic blocs; seventh, acceleration of the process for offering investors increased protection; eighth, making population more "industry-focused."
