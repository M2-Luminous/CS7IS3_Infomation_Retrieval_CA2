Chien is the first Republic of China [ROC] foreign minister to visit the Vatican in more than 10 years. The Vatican is the only European country that maintains diplomatic relations with the ROC. During his stay in the city-state, Chien will chair an annual meeting of ROC officials stationed in Europe to review their work over the past year and to chart new courses for future work. Chien will then visit several European countries with which the ROC does not have formal ties, the official said. He, however, declined to reveal Chien's itinerary and with which European officials Chien plans to meet. "Chien will brief the press on his European tour after he returns on July 4," said the official, who requested anonymity. Chien left for the U.S. on June 15 to attend a seminar in Beaver Creek, Colorado on major international concerns at the invitation of former U.S. President Gerald Ford. After the meeting, Chien visited his married daughter, who lives in the United States. He left for the Vatican Monday (American time).
