In Russia today there are 14,500 enterprises where there are over 700 sources of radiation. In the opinion of the State Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, the most dangerous enterprises are those attached to the Ministry of Defense and the (Ministry of Atomic Energy). At our request, Nikolay Yegorov, first deputy minister of atomic energy, comments on this. [Begin Yegorov recording] Those storehouses where, at present, radioactive waste is being dumped or stored do not satisfy contemporary requirements, in other words those requirements that were made following the Chernobyl disaster and which are in accordance with international requirements. But radiation safety at these storehouses is being monitored and I think -- from my point of view -- it is normal. Present-day requirements stipulate that storehouses should be protected from air attacks, from natural disasters -- earthquakes and a number of other extreme factors. These storehouses do not comply with these requirements because when they were designed such norms did not exist. [end recording]
