FR941117-2-00080 FR941117-2-00054 There are many reasons that might cause the Department not to initiate a lawsuit, or to challenge some practices and not others, including reasons related to the factual support available for potential claims and the enforcement resources that would be required to establish them. These decisions are ``peculiarly within [the] expertise'' of the Department of Justice, which is ``far better equipped then the courts to deal with the many variables involved in the proper ordering of its priorities.'' Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831&hyph;32 (1985); see also Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001, 1006 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting from summary affirmance) (``How is a court to decide whether a better settlement in a case involving one industry is more important to the public than the benefits that might be gained by immediately working on an antitrust problem in another industry?''). Finally, Congress did not intend the Tunney Act to lead to protracted hearings on the merits, and thereby undermine the incentives for defendants and the government to enter into consent judgments. S. Rep. No. 298, 93d Cong. 1st Sess. 3 (1973); see United States v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 552 F. Supp. 131, 151 (D.D.C. 1982), aff'd, Maryland v. United States, 460 U.S. 1001 (1983). Because it is not the function of the court ``to make de novo determination of facts and issues'' but rather to determine whether explanations of the Department of Justice were ``reasonable under the circumstances,'' United States v. Mid-America Dairymen, 1977&hyph;1 Trade Cas. (CCH) ¶61,508, at 71,980 (W.D. Mo. 1977), courts have consistently refused to consider ``contentions going to the merits of the underlying claims and defenses.'' Bechtel Corp. 648 F.2d at 666. IV. Conclusion The Tunney Act requires that public comments and the government's response to those comments be published in the Federal Register . When that publication has been accomplished, the government will notify the Court that all of the procedures required by the Tunney Act have been completed, and will ask the Court to enter the proposed Final Judgment based on its determination that the Final Judgment is in the public interest. The United States is firmly convinced that the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest, and we urge the Court to act promptly to ratify that judgment. If the proposed Final Judgment is to fulfill its promise of opening the personal computer operating system software market, it must be approved without delay. Microsoft has agreed to abide by the requirements of the proposed Final Judgment pending the Court's Tunney Act review. However, the effectiveness of the proposed remedy depends not only on Microsoft's conduct, but on the perception of industry participants that the remedy will be approved and enforced. OEMs considering alternatives to Microsoft's forthcoming Windows '95 product need to know that they may shop the competition without paying a royalty to Microsoft for each computer they sell. Other operating system suppliers also need to make development and marketing decisions with the assurance that Microsoft's per-processor and per-system licenses will no longer artificially limit the market for their wares. Accordingly, we urge the Court to act promptly to approve the proposed Final Judgment following the completion of the remaining Tunney Act requirements. Dated: October 31, 1994.
