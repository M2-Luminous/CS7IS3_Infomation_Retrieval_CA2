NODONG SINMUN today says this is only too natural a condemnation of the traitor Kim Yong-sam's "civilian" fascist rule. Though the traitor has advertised "reforms" as if he would bring some "changes" to South Korea, and made brag of his administrative "achievements" after his assumption of office, the reality shows that the "civilian" regime is violating human rights more harshly than the preceding military dictatorial regimes, the analyst says, and goes on: The traitor has refused to abolish the notorious "National Security Law," a legacy of the military dictatorship, and expanded and strengthened such repressive tools as the "security planning board" and the "secret affairs command." After rising to power, the Kim Yong-sam group began brutally suppressing the righteous desire of the students and people for independence, democracy and reunification and mercilessly cracking down on the struggle of the workers and peasants for their vital rights, branding it as "collective egoism" and "illegal riot." It has also put down the struggle of workers for a wage hike by setting in-motion even the "emergency arbitration power," which the preceding military dictators had not dared to employ. Noting that the South Korean people have keenly felt that with the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique as sly as fox left in power, they cannot feel ease even a moment but will undergo greater misfortunes and sufferings, the analyst says they will bring him to justice without fail.
