There, they seized rifles, 2,000 useful cartridges, caps, exploders, a cartridge reloading machine, and explosive and detonating substances, among other items. According to reports submitted to the Office of the Assistant Attorney for Local Offices and Inspection, headed by Alfonso Cabrera Morales, the authorities confiscated the following equipment on a ranch in the municipality of San Pedro Garza Garcia, also in Nuevo Leon: 200 useful cartridges of 9, 223, 76, and 380 mm caliber; eight loaders for an Uzi submachinegun, squad pistols, a 38 caliber special revolver, and a 380 mm caliber squad revolver; as well as nearly half a kg of marijuana. The Attorney General's Office noted that, in the first case, four rifles, a squad pistol, two professional bows, and precision accessories for arming steel-tipped arrows, all apparently owned by persons associated with the drug traffic, were also placed at the disposal of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office. It reported that the arms and explosives factory was located on the ranch known as San Roque, in the municipality of Villa de Juarez, where the public poisoners presumably were hiding. Since arrest warrants had been issued for them, the ranch was searched on the basis of a court order from the aforementioned district court. No arrests were made. As for the confiscation in San Pedro Garza Garcia, the investigative agents specified that the weapons were discovered at No. 122 Versalles Street, in the Colonia Del Valle. It is presumed that members of a group engaged in drug purchases and sales gather there. The traces of marijuana found inside the domicile prompted the assumption that its occupants intended to meet soon with other public poisoners to close a deal involving that drug. It was learned that officials from the local branch of the Attorney General's Office in Nuevo Leon have requested information from U.S. authorities regarding the origin of the seized weapons and other items, as well as the cartridges. It is thought that their owners are connected with arms trafficking groups operating on the southern United States border, and are very likely trading that equipment for drugs. It was stressed that the investigation is being continued, and that information is now available on the property owners. Arrest warrants have already been issued for two of them, who are expected to be placed at the court's disposal within the next few days. Wanted for crimes against health, they are now charged with other crimes specified and penalized in the Federal Law on Firearms and Explosives, as well as the Criminal Code.
