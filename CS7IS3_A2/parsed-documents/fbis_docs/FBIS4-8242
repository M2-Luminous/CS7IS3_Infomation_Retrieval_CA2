President Berisha said that as it has been asserted "the reforms in Albania have been advancing quicker than in other countries in the past two years," adding that Albania fulfills all the conditions for becoming a member of the Council of Europe: free elections, observation of the human rights and the rights of national minorities.

Lord Finsberg appreciated the profound changes made in the course of reforms and said he would like to see Albania be as soon as possible a full member of the Council of Europe.
