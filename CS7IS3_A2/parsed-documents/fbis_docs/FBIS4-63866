This was the first time that scientists from the East and the West, among them representatives of NATO's scientific committee, had worked together at such a forum. "If someone had told me five years ago that I would be in Moscow discussing problems of the peaceful use of secret rocket fuels with Russians, that would have seemed pure fantasy," Dr. H. Krause, a member of that committee, told me. Professor H. Schubert, one of the organizers of the symposium, stressed that the exchange of experience and ideas in this sphere is extremely useful -- mountains of weapons have been stockpiled and represent a great danger. From time to time these weapons remind you of their presence with colossal explosions endangering the population and the natural environment. However, the reports delivered by academicians B. Zhukov, G. Sakovich, and V. Tartakovskiy, Professor Yu. Frolov, and many others showed that an explosive that has become surplus to requirements can be of use to people. TNT, for example, can be used to produce polymer film and artificial diamonds can be made from substandard powder. Powder charges can be used in magnetohydrodynamic generators, which in turn can be used to detect mineral deposits and increase the accuracy of long-term earthquake forecasting. Converted missiles can be used in reverse to drill bore holes. It is surprising but true that even fires can be put out using powder charges, which release flame-extinguishing aerosols from the warhead casings. These casings can be fired straight from a grenade launcher through the window of a blazing apartment to put out a fire. These are many examples of this kind but they require prior scientific research work which is, unfortunately costly. Here, too, cooperation with the West could prove highly useful.
