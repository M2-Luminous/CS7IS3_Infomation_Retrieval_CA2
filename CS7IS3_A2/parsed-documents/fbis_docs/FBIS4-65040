A visit to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday further clarified the U.S. stance on the matter. Ambassador Richard Barkley held talks with Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk and made various proposals, which are regarded as a "formula." Ambassador Barkley's written proposals indicate that the U.S. Administration, let alone trying to facilitate the "operation to save the pipeline," wishes to further complicate the matter by transferring it to the UN Security Council. The contacts Ambassador Barkley made shed light on the U.S. stance on the matter some time ago. While the U.S. officials explained the anxiety in Washington caused by the initiatives that may result in the violation of the embargo against Iraq, the White House approach was outlined as follows: "Former President Bush won the war. President Clinton does not wish to lose what has been achieved." That viewpoint was an indication that the assessments that led to the Gulf War have not changed and that the embargo will remain in effect as long as Saddam Husayn leads Iraq. It is a fact that the recent UN Security Council resolutions contained moderate provisions in favor of Iraq. However, they lacked any tendency that may have led to a change in the present situation. Consequently, the messages from the U.S. State Department are aimed at forcing Turkey to move within the framework of that approach. Turkey wishes to operate the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline to withdraw the oil in it. Furthermore, it is inclined to agree to resume the pumping operations after it withdraws the oil in the pipeline. However, the United States has drawn Turkey's attention to the UN resolutions. More importantly, it has asked Turkey to hold talks with Britain, France, and Russia and "persuade" them to agree to the resumption of the flow of oil in that pipeline. Apparently, the United States has defended the view that Turkey has to seek the consent of the countries that have established a coalition against Iraq. In addition to limiting Turkey's "maneuvering" capability in its effort to have the embargo against Iraq relaxed, various aspects of Ambassador Barkley's letter to Ozdem Sanberk can be described as rather harsh. For example, a reference was made to Article 50 of the UN Charter on the existing economic problems in Turkey, which also justified the effort made to help Turkey redeem the loss it has incurred from the embargo on Iraq. Regarding the concept of "support," Article 50 says in part: "If any country, regardless of whether it is a UN member, is confronted with special economic problems as a result of the implementation of the preventive or compelling measures the UN Security Council may take against any country, then that country has the right to appeal to the UN Security Council for the solution of its problems." Yes, that is the recommendation that has been made to Turkey by a friendly country, the United States! The message that has been conveyed to Turkey is quite clear: "We understand you. You have incurred an economic loss as a result of the Gulf War. You are in financial difficulty at the present time. If you expect any help, then you better appeal to the United Nations." Is that not disrespectful? It is as if Turkey is regarded as a country like Somalia. As far as aid is concerned, the United States is forcing the Ciller administration in Ankara to beg Butrus Butrus-Ghali's organization, in addition to the IMF and the World Bank. That is shameful. The United States reached an agreement with President Mubarak and quickly erased Egypt's debts to unite the Arab world against Saddam Husayn when the Gulf War broke out. However, that country has advised Turkey to appeal to the UN Security Council only three years after that state of affairs. The quota of $1.6 billion is the only key to the resumption of pumping operations in the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline. The UN condition is that 30 percent of that amount be transferred to the reparations fund. However, Iraq has regarded that condition as a violation of its sovereignty. Consequently, it has endured the embargo. Therefore, it is impossible for Turkey to persuade Iraq to agree to sell its oil and channel the profit it makes to the UN reparations fund. Actually, Turkey is not concerned with the sale of oil at this stage. It is only trying to save the oil pipeline. However, it seems that its initiatives have been judged to be too much. The views Ambassador Barkley conveyed to Ozdem Sanberk yesterday indicated that Turkey "has missed the train" on the question of having pumping operations in the oil pipeline resumed. The valves could have been turned on immediately after Sanberk returned from Baghdad to Ankara some time ago. However, the question of the needs of Turkey, which has expected a formula from the United States, have been transferred to the commission [not further specified] once again. The U.S. officials have invited the Foreign Ministry officials to hold talks in Washington at the end of May. Meanwhile, they want Turkey to reach an agreement with Britain, France, and Russia. The question as to how Ankara will manage to persuade Moscow, London, and Paris to agree is unknown. Also unknown is how long southeastern Turkey, whose economy is on the verge of collapse, can continue to endure the embargo. It is a pity for the people of this country. It is as if the embargo has been imposed on Turkey and not on Iraq. Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin's visit to the Habur border gate was the only "timid" step that has been taken to revive the border trade between Turkey and Iraq thus far. If Barkley's letter will not be enough to force the Turkish Grand National Assembly members to remember our national interests and Turkey's sovereign rights, then what are the "warnings" they need that they may do so? Meanwhile, why is the parliament undecided on rejecting the extension of the Hammer Force's mandate? Is it because the parliamentarians believe that the United States may act with a sense of fairness and provide the aid Turkey needs? We believe that this is something that will not happen.
