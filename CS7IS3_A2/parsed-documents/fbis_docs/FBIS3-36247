The minister said he had learned of the premier's visit from the mass media and that he had never given his consent to signing the agreement. Shokhin recalled the fact that it was the prime minister who asked him to take up preparing the negotiations on the unification of the two countries' monetary systems. Shokhin said the package of documents defining the procedure for the unification had not yet been prepared. He added that he had a meeting with one of Belarus' deputy prime ministers in Moscow last Friday. "We did not advertise this, but we detected a number of approaches to solving disputable issues. Now the task is to introduce the approaches into the text of an agreement," Shokhin was quoted as saying. With this aim in view, several Russian representatives left for Minsk for two to three days. "If the documents are to be, we must approve them at a government meeting," the minister pointed out. Only after this can the documents be signed, he added.
