Abete, who leads the powerful industrial association which recently signed two ground-breaking labor accords with government and trade unions, said he had four simple suggestions, "four little measures" to be taken by a new government that will presumably be formed after parliament elects its speakers. Confindustria, Abete said, would like reinvested company profits to be made tax deductible. He said he did not want this to be a "discount" but a "just differentiation between profit and revenues." Second, Abete asked that company taxes be reviewed because of "the country's difficult moment," referring to recession. Abete then suggested that "something be done for the job market," adding: "We want more part-time and term contracts." Lastly, Abete asked the government to review laws on government contracts, which have been virtually frozen since corruption scandals erupted; "We want clear relations with politics," he said. For his part, Agnelli said Italy's market and industry are evolving, becoming more efficient, "fair and just for consumers," but they are doing so very slowly. The new government, according to Agnelli, "has the chance to work well to lead and accelerate this change." Before leaving for Rome, where the life senator is taking part in the election of the new Senate speaker, Agnelli, too, called for "greater mobility and flexibility" in the labor market and for a reduction in fiscal pressure, especially of direct taxes and of taxes that prevent small- and medium-sized companies from accumulating risk capital. He also asked for legislation favoring investments for research, training and exports, and called for raising the mandatory school age limit from 14 to 16. Agnelli also suggested creating tax incentives for industrial restructuring, speeding up privatizations, and warned that current debate on granting increased autonomy to regional authorities must proceed very carefully, "through calm and constructive discussions without controversial exasperations."
