This is evidenced, among other things, by its frenzied maneuver for arms buildup. As has been reported, the puppets, under the pretext of further solidifying the security posture, have decided to introduce additional late-model weapons, such as Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters. It is no secret that the puppets, during the warmonger U.S. Defense Secretary Perry's junket to South Korea last month, decided to bring in anti-artillery radar, a global positioning system [chisang mokpyomul wisong chujok changchi], and ultra- modern gun-barrel equipment, as well as Apache helicopters, from the United States. On 12 May, the puppets deployed for active service new type medium-size transport planes purchased from Spain. The South Korean puppet clique raves that these transport planes, whose deployment for the puppet air force will be completed by the end of this year, will enhance their so-called operational capability. The bellicose puppet elements' arms buildup maneuvers--by which they deployed the new type CN-235 medium-size transport planes, in addition to Apache offensive helicopters and Patriot missiles, which are weapons of mass destruction, in South Korea under the instigation of the U.S. imperialists--well expose the true colors of the U.S. imperialists and the puppets leading the situation to a brink of war. The fact that the South Korean puppets are following the road of war adventure is also evidenced by their continuous war exercise commotions of various types aimed at northward invasion. As has been reported, the South Korean puppets conducted fire games aimed at attacking us from 9 to 14 May, such as the combat readiness exercise; a chemical, biological, radiological exercise; a troop and equipment movement exercise; and a combat plane emergency take-off and landing exercise. On 9 May alone, the puppets brought a large- scale naval exercise group into the West Sea of Korea and conducted provocative war exercises, such as a marine mobile exercise, anti- air and anti-shore exercises, and a ship dispersion exercise, raving about the so-called completion of the posture for coping with the initial stage of war. At the same time, the South Korean warmongers conducted a joint airborne dropping exercise and a joint open-air exercise with the U.S. forces on the East Sea of Korea. Facts show that the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique had an eye on attacking us by three-dimensional operations from air, land, and sea through these war exercises. As has been made public, the Kim Yong-sam ring is raving that it will conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise this November and enforce other war exercises as scheduled without reducing their scale. The Kim Yong-sam ring's reckless maneuvers for arms buildup and preparations for war of northward invasion are an intolerable act of treachery aimed at driving the fellow countrymen into the calamity of nuclear war as a perpetrator of a war of foreign forces. It is the invariable policy of the United States to build up armed forces of aggression on the Korean peninsula and threaten and crush [apsal] us by force. The United States, raving about our nuclear development and countermeasures for our surprise attack, are frenziedly engaged in war commotions, massively bringing new type Patriot missiles and other military equipment, including latest- model Apache offensive helicopters, into South Korea. This is prompted by its desire to obliterate our country's socialism by force. The South Korean puppets, with the United States, have already worked out the so-called New Operational Plan 5027, a plan to provoke a war of northward invasion. The U.S. warmongers--who have assembled vast aggression armed forces in and near South Korea aimed at imposing nuclear calamity on our nation and deployed Patriot missiles and offensive helicopters to South Korea--are making powder-reeking such an outburst that they will not hesitate to wage a war or preclude the possibility of a preemptive strike. According to the U.S. paper THE WASHINGTON POST of 12 May, Perry and other U.S. military leaders, babbling about sanctions against us recently, said that a war could turn out a reality. This is a very serious remark. Needless to say, the South Korean puppets' arms buildup and fire-game commotions are perpetrated by this policy of aggression and war of the United States. The South Korean puppet clique, which is sustaining its filthy life depending on foreign forces, is attempting, foolishly, to obliterate our Republic by force and realize its ambition for reunifying the country by northward invasion taking advantage of the U.S. imperialists' reckless military action. The Kim Yong-sam ring is attempting to intensify the arms buildup and war fire game under the pretext of building up a security posture and lead the situation on the Korean peninsula to a dangerous phase of war so as to leave South Korea under the U.S. domination permanently and to sustain its power as a cat's paw for its master's war. Our fellow countrymen, who treasure national dignity and love peace, can never forgive the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique which attaches greater importance to its personal comfort and foreign forces' interests than to national interest and destiny and which does not hesitate to impose the calamity of a nuclear war on the nation. If the South Korean puppets think they can realize their ambition for reunification by northward invasion through the reckless arms buildup and war fire-game, they are having an illusion. The Kim Yong-sam ring should stamp on its mind that the treacherous act of confronting the fellow countrymen leads to its shameful destruction.
