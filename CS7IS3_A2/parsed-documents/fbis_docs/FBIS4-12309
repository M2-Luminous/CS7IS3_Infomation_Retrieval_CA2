Both sides emphasized the traditional affinity between India and France. The French foreign minister stressed the need for increased economic cooperation in the light of economic reforms in India and said that it was their intention to attend the joint commission meeting at the ministerial level later this year. A visit by a French business delegation is also envisaged this year. Our prime minister briefed Mr. Juppe on our relations with neighboring countries and underlined the challenge to our territorial integrity on account of Pakistan's interference and support to terrorism on Indian soil. The prime minister indicated that India was open to bilateral discussions with Pakistan. Mr. Juppe said that France opposed internationalization of the Kashmir dispute. He said that they understood India's position and hoped that bilateral discussions between India and France [as received] would soon be resumed. On NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty], our prime minister mentioned that the NPT review conference of 1995 provided suitable opportunity for a genuine review of the treaty to make it universal and nondiscriminatory. In this context, the prime minister pointed out that India's action plan presented an approach which was exemplary. While briefing newsmen, the official spokesman stated that the French foreign minister, Mr Alain Juppe, met our home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, today. The discussions focussed on terrorism and fundamentalism aided and instigated by Pakistan. He briefed Mr. Juppe extensively on the J and K [Jammu and Kashmir] situation and the problems posed by Pakistani support in the context of our efforts to revive the political process in Jammu and Kashmir. The home minister said that the phenomenon of terrorism was not something faced by India alone and a global approach was necessary to counter this menace. Mr. Juppe said that France also had been a victim of terrorism at different periods of its history and would welcome an exchange of views and information through bilateral channels. The home minister mentioned that India was awaiting the visit of the French interior minister, Mr. Charles Pasqua, who has been invited by our home minister and the invitation has been accepted.
