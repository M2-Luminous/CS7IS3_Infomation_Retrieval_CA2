According to an article published today in LA PRENSA GRAFICA, Salaverria said the United States is presenting this possibility not only to Central America, but to the Caribbean and some South American countries. The government official explained that the United States has made this suggestion in light of the fact that hundreds of Haitians are fleeing their country because of the difficult political situation. The Haitians are leaving their country in boats, many of which are being intercepted at sea. Foreign Minister Salaverria said that the United States is looking for a third country that will temporarily accept these people while the causes that motivated them to leave their country are investigated. If it is found that they fled their country for economic reasons, they will be returned to Haiti. However, if they fled for political reasons they will be allowed to enter the United States. Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani has said that the Salvadoran Government has not received an official request from the United States, but if it does, "this will have to be studied." Salaverria said that El Salvador, a country that is still recovering from a 12-year war, saw many of its citizens flee to other countries, mainly the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Australia. "Our duty is to improve our domestic situation to offer favorable conditions for the return of our fellow countrymen," the minister said. Salaverria added that the Salvadoran attitude does not "reflect a lack of sensitivity on our part, but rather it reflects our situation." Meanwhile, Health Minister Gustavo Argueta said that El Salvador faces serious problems because it is the smallest country in the area and it is overpopulated; therefore, offering space to the Haitian refugees "would be illogical."
