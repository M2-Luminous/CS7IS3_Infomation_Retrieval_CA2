The World Bank is providing $45 million of that amount on a nonreturnable basis. This credit issue is the result of more than two years of negotiations with the Bank in which the Russian Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources played the main role. In connection with the bank's decision, Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, the head of the ministry concerned, believes that the loan will help to attract Western investors to environmental projects which are being carried out on Russia's territory. The minister said that it is planned to implement these projects in the most environmentally disadvantaged areas of the country and in particular the Lake Baykal region and Tula and Kemerovo oblasts. There is also a plan to create the necessary infrastructure of Russian nature conservancy organs. The Ministry of the Environment has also announced that the Danish Environmental Protection Fund has made Russia a gift of $3 million for filter equipment for the Northern Thermal Electric Power Station in Moscow. The introduction of these devices will help to reduce discharges of nitric oxide from 5.5 tonnes to 1.8 tonnes a year and to subsequently close down several dozen boilers operating on obsolete technology.
