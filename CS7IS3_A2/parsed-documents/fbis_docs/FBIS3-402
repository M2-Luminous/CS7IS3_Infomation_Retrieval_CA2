Despite General Constand Viljoen's last-minute registration of the Freedom Front, the Volksfront today rejected participation in the election. Johan Claasen was at today's Volks Representative Council meeting. [Begin recording] [Claasen] Today's decision comes as a blow to followers of Gen. Viljoen who tried to keep the door open for participation in the election. The council's president, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, retained enough support against such a move. [Hartzenberg, in Afrikaans] Since they are insisting that the only way we can show our support for a volkstaat [homeland] is through this election, and because that is not an acceptable test to us, the council decided that it will stand by the decision it adopted two week's ago -- that it will not participate in the 27 April election. [Claasen] Gen. Viljoen said he abided by the decision. The registration of the Afrikaner Vryheids Front [Freedom Front] would now be allowed to lapse. [Viljoen] You cannot deregister, it will simply elapse when you don't hand in your list of candidates. [Claasen] The decision not to take part in the election was taken behind closed doors in Pretoria's Synod Center. But talk among volkstaters noted that the general was rapped on the knuckles for his apparent single-handed decision to register. Some right wingers were more outspoken. [Unidentified right winger in Afrikaans] We say that this country is our country, and that is why we are not prepared to enter this election. [Claasen] Many supporters waited patiently for hours outside before they were allowed into the meeting. They also wanted to know where the final borders of their volkstaat would be. Dr. Hartzenberg told them that a final map had been drawn up, but members of the council would have to study it before it could be accepted. [end recording] Today's decision by the Volksfront not to participate in the election means that last night's registration by Gen. Viljoen of the Freedom Front becomes null and void. A total of 29 parties registered for the election -- eight of them just beat the midnight deadline.
