The party's leader, Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, said that despite the leaders' meeting the road forward did not look promising. [Buthelezi, in English] In my whole lifetime, in all the years I have lived on planet earth, I've never seen the anger of the people reaching the levels which it has reached.
