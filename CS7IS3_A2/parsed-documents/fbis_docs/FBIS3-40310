[Passage omitted] The social product (in material terms) declined in 1991 and 1992 by 11 and 15 percent, respectively. The recessionary trends also continued in 1993. After an almost 16-percent decline in industrial production in 1992, during the first seven months of 1993 industrial production was 15.3 percent lower than during the same period in 1992 (most heavily affected were the paper industry, with a 34 percent decline, the footwear and leather industries, with 35.2 percent, and metallurgy, with 24 percent). It is estimated that both the social product and industrial production fell another 15 percent in 1993. In 1992 the social product amounted to only $818 per capita, and last year it probably declined to $657. Other economic areas are also falling behind. Agriculture has been seriously affected (also because of the drought); it is estimated that agricultural production was between 15 and 20 percent lower than during the previous year. Construction (in terms of the number of hours worked) will reach a negative growth rate during the first seven months of 10 percent (compared to the same period the previous year), and in terms of value, during all of last year it was even 30 percent lower than one year earlier. Overnight stays in tourism grew somewhat, but only at the expense of domestic guests (28.1 percent), whereas the number of foreign overnight stays remained at the level of the previous year, which was already more or less at an extremely low level, since the war events in the former Yugoslavia had already almost completely cut Macedonia off from tourist foreign exchange income the year before. Investments in capital assets are also continuing to decline. In 1993 their share in the social product was 15 percent, whereas in 1990 it was still 17.7 percent. Unemployment is at the extremely high level of 27.4 percent, and is still growing. More than 174,000 people are unemployed. It is interesting that in recent years this figure almost did not increase, in spite of large declines in production. Thus, in the middle of 1992 there were 172,000 people unemployed, and at the end of 1991, 166,900. In the first half of 1993 it grew by 1.5 percent. This indicates high latent unemployment, and also the fact that people in Macedonia are trying in every possible way to prevent a growth of unemployment and the resulting social tension, even at the price of artificially maintaining employment. This, of course, will only be possible for a while longer. Sooner or later it will be necessary to restructure the economy and also start to solve the problems in the real economic sphere. Then we can expect a major growth in unemployment. Just like the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], until recently Macedonia was also solving more and more of its problems by printing money. This, on top of the significantly reduced supply of the Macedonian market, and the significantly increased transportation costs (because of the above-mentioned transportation difficulties, etc.), was reflected last year in 1,691 percent inflation. The year 1993 began with a rapid growth of prices (15.6 percent in January, as much as 32.5 percent in February, and 8.5 percent in March). Later Macedonia started to carry out a stabilization program that is already showing initial results (although perhaps only temporary ones). The National Bank is conducting a restrictive monetary policy; selective loans have been eliminated; in May there was a transition to a sliding exchange rate for the new Macedonian currency, the denar. Inflation fell to 3.4 percent in April, and in June there was even deflation (a 0.9 percent decline in retail prices). The renewed jumps in July and August (7.7 percent and 9.5 percent), however, indicate that the stabilization was rather short-lived. In fact, the external shocks, along with the small size of the Macedonian economy and the high correlation between changes in the exchange rate and price growth, are rapidly stimulating a new inflationary spiral. This is particularly true since Macedonia has a large budget deficit (at the level of 6.5 percent of the social product in 1992 and even 10 percent this year), which can be rapidly monetized, while there is a real danger of a new explosion of wages, which already thwarted the stabilization program once last year. The situation in Macedonia, to be sure, is not as critical as in the FRY, but recently there has also been a severe decline in the standard of living here (real wages in 1991 fell by 13 percent, and a year later by 33 percent). In spite of this, real average wages are still between 250 and 300 German marks. The situation, however, is also being alleviated by the very strong and rapidly developing gray economy, which according to some estimates is already reaching 25 percent of officially recorded production. Macedonian finances are in a rather weak position. Most of the financial resources have been blocked at the National Bank of Yugoslavia in Belgrade. Foreign exchange reserves are approximately at the level of $130 million and are increasing negligibly (by $1 million a week). With its slow recognition on the international scene, the country has been virtually cut off from international loans and aid. It was only during last year, with loans from the Soros Foundation and the receipt of some foreign aid (Macedonia was granted aid in the amount of $120 million by the United States and 30 million ECU by the EC as a sort of compensation for the damages it suffered as a result of the UN sanctions against Serbia) somewhat alleviated matters. This was also helped somewhat by mobilization of the foreign exchange funds received from the sale of socialized apartments. On the other hand, it is estimated that the country has more than $1 billion in foreign debt (as of 30 June 1993 Macedonia owed $848 million for the principal and $349 million in interest). The lack of sources of foreign exchange has put Macedonia in a position in which it cannot meet its debt obligations. In addition to the unpaid $128 million from last year there is also another $165 million, which Macedonia will likewise not be able to service without additional foreign financial aid. Macedonia has an already traditional foreign trade deficit, which was previously mostly covered by the Yugoslav federation. Ever since independence, foreign trade has been seriously affected. Of the countries on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, trade is taking place more or less normally only with Slovenia, which is becoming an increasingly more important trading partner for the Macedonians. Croatia has introduced tariffs on imports of Macedonian goods; the FRY is under an embargo anyway. There are also difficulties, primarily in regard to transportation, in trade with the EC and East European countries. According to the Macedonian government's data, the trade deficit was otherwise significantly reduced in 1992 (to $7 million from $225 million in 1991 and $418 million in 1990), and in 1993, after a surplus in the first quarter, the deficit is expected to rise again to the level of $80 million. Furthermore, there has also been an almost complete disappearance of foreign exchange earnings from tourism, which previously brought $50 million a year; foreign exchange remittances from abroad are also down to a third of those before the collapse of Yugoslavia. The government has already taken some steps toward strengthening market forces. Central subsidies have been reduced, the independence of management has been strengthened, likewise price controls have been mostly eliminated, and only a small number of basic food and energy products are still under state control. Recently a privatization law was also passed, which introduces somewhat different models of privatization from those we are familiar with from other East European countries and Slovenia, and for which Macedonia has received very positive evaluations by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Its basic goal is to lead to a change in the management of enterprises as soon as possible. Enterprises will be sold in terms of a majority share (51 percent). The aim of this is to find a new majority owner and manager immediately. Small investors will only be able to buy the remaining shares (49 percent), in smaller amounts. In contrast to other East European models and also the Slovene one, an enterprise, instead of having a multitude of dispersed owners, will already have a majority owner and manager at the very beginning. At the same time, this will also prevent someone with a smaller share (for example 10 percent) from acquiring the exclusive right to manage the enterprise. Privatization does not include distribution for free, and instead workers have the right to a 30 percent purchase at a discount of up to 70 percent. The volume of Slovene-Macedonian trade has significantly declined from 1990 to the present. In 1990 Macedonia, although it was within Yugoslavia, was an extremely important trading partner for Croatia, the present FRY, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Calculated on the basis of the average exchange rate, Slovene exports to that country amounted to $586 million (on the basis of statistics from the SDK [Public Auditing Service], which monitored internal flows in Yugoslavia and are not completely comparable with the foreign trade statistics, so these figures should be taken with a grain of salt), which is more than we exported to Austria in 1992, and approximately at the level of exports to France. In 1990 and 1992 our sales to Macedonia declined abruptly, but still reached about $382 million in 1991 and $133 million in 1992. It is interesting that trade with Macedonia increased substantially in 1993. While trade with other parts of the former Yugoslavia is still declining, the volume of trade with Macedonia in the first nine months of last year almost doubled in comparison with the same period in 1992. Macedonia has thus broken through to seventh place among Slovenia's most important trading partners. By September exports to Macedonia ($145 million) had already exceeded the total for 1992, while during the same period in the previous year they only amounted to $77 million. We traditionally have a surplus in trade with Macedonia. In 1992 it was about $55 million, and last year it was already $77 million. Several factors contributed to the extraordinary increase in trade. On one hand, it probably involves a gradual normalization, after the drastic decline during the crisis years of 1991 and 1992, to which the reestablished transportation routes like the ferry link between Koper and Durres (and further on to Skopje), but also the regular air link between Ljubljana and Skopje, also contributed in their own way. On the other hand, part of that trade probably also conceals some goods that after arriving in Macedonia seek a further path into Serbia, which is otherwise, in theory, isolated. In terms of structure, most of our exports are pharmaceutical and cosmetic products, which last year represented a fifth of all Slovene exports, and exports of paper, textile, and wood products are also important. Significant items in imports are copper, electrical cables, textile products and clothing, and of course also Macedonian wine (this year import duties were eliminated) and fruits and vegetables, etc. Both economies are showing strong interest in increased cooperation. A large number of Slovene enterprises are present in the Macedonian market in the form of joint firms or representations (for example, Gorenje, Peko, Kompas, Planika, Stol Kamnik, Libela, and so forth). Among other things, the Macedonians are also interested in establishing a bank in Slovenia.
