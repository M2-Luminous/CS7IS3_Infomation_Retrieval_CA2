Xiao was speaking at the opening session of an international symposium on intellectual property protection attended by 130 experts, lawyers and business people from China, Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Thailand and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Also attending are representatives of the European and German patent offices. According to the minister, legal regulations are being prepared that aim at punishing proven copyright violations. Meanwhile, the Chinese Government is to publish a decree on border control of goods involving rights violations. "Customs will be allowed a still bigger role in intellectual property protection and in preventing the entrance and exit of such goods," he said. Xiao expected the decree to facilitate the implementation of the "Paris Convention on Protection of Industrial Intellectual Property" and the "Berne Convention on Protection of Literary and Artistic Works" to which China has acceded. Law enforcement organs are being strengthened as part of an effort to improve copyright protection. Such organs and the departments of science, technology, and police as well as the industry and commerce administration are to jointly investigate major cases, he added. The supervision and review of law enforcement by local governments and State Council departments is also being improved. This will be carried out at irregular intervals and will be concentrated on cases which are "important and affecting many sides." Professional societies and other non-governmental organizations concerned with rights protection will be encouraged and assisted by the state in offering consultancy and other services. "China attaches great importance to intellectual property protection work, and is improving the legislation in this regard," Xiao noted, citing the laws passed in recent years on trademarks, patents, technical contracts and unfair competition. China has acceded to a number of international conventions on intellectual property protection. "It is in the process of making its own protection work meet international standards," he said. "Law enforcement, on the whole, is good." Meanwhile, the minister acknowledged the occurrence of rights violations and attributed this to a lack of understanding of the importance of rights protection on the part of some government departments and people. "Intellectual property protection is an important part of China's policy of reform and opening to the world," he said. "It is vital for China to formulate laws to protect people's creative work and ensure normal operation of the socialist market economy."
