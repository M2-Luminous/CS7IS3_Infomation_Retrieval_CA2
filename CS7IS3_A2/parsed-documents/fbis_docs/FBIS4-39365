Nevertheless, people in your country celebrate 10 June -- the date that the Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation With Russia was signed in 1992 -- as an event of national importance. What is the reason for that? [Nanayev] Let us recall the events of the time. Kyrgyzstan had just proclaimed its independence. The wholesale process of its diplomatic recognition may be said to have begun. These were worrying times. But our country was only really conscious of its independence after Askar Akayev and Boris Yeltsin signed the Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation Between the Kyrgyz Republic and Russia. This event was the point of departure from which the current history of our state began. The treaty with Russia is the foundation of cooperation between our countries based on equality, respect, and support for our peoples. [Shinkarenko] The foundation of cooperation.... Construction schedule overruns and unfinished construction are associated with this word. What a lot of that we can remember! But what has it really proved possible to accomplish on this "foundation?" [Nanayev] I can say with confidence that the first stories have already been built. Needless to say, the greatest progress has been made in the political sphere. Our presidents have really displayed political will here. Thanks to this the Treaty on Friendship has been supplemented by dozens of other agreements and protocols, strengthening the international-legal base of our bilateral ties. We fully understand the ways of further developing Kyrgyz-Russian relations, strengthening cooperation within the CIS framework, and coordinating actions on the international arena. Cooperation between our foreign ministries, in the military-political sphere, and in peacemaking operations has been comprehensively developed.... [Shinkarenko] The special relations of trust between Boris Yeltsin and Askar Akayev are well known. However, there are plenty of problems on which they do not have time to work. [Nanayev] You're right. It would be unjustified to depict all aspects of our relations solely in a rosy light. In the political sphere a great deal is determined by the leaders of the states. Cooperation in other spheres is strongly influenced by many factors. This applies particularly to trade and economic relations. Production is continuing to decline in both countries. The fall in the standard of living of the bulk of the population has not yet been halted. Many major enterprises that were created to meet all-Union needs, particularly in the military-industrial complex, have been left without orders. And this means tens of thousands of workers and specialists have lost their livelihood. We cannot resolve this problem without Russia's aid. In Moscow and Bishkek there is shared understanding of the difficulties that have arisen. For instance, an accord has been secured on Russia providing credit and on the creation of an investment fund and joint production units, including some based on defense enterprises capable of producing output that Russia also needs. However, the accords are slow to be implemented. But there have been improvements here, too. Both in Kyrgyzstan and in Russia it has proved possible to bring down inflation considerably. The national currency is being strengthened.... Thus light can already be seen at the end of the tunnel. [Shinkarenko] Many people in Russia are talking about the difficulties that have beset Russian-speaking residents of the former Soviet republics and about a Russian exodus. How are things in Kyrgyzstan? [Nanayev] Following the breakup of the USSR the fate of their compatriots became a pressing matter for virtually all the former Soviet republics. Like homing pigeons many people reached out for their historic roots and origins -- and that is quite natural. The instinct of self-preservation is always the first to come into play in critical situations, but there is also a countermovement. Raisa Fedorovna Kazanina, who now lives in Volgograd, wrote recently to a Bishkek newspaper that she is homesick for Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], which she considers her second home. She wrote that only illness prevents her from returning home. Our president is fully determined to support this endeavor on the part of the country's Russian-speaking citizens and create favorable living and working conditions for them, and thus halt migration. The Republic has formulated a concrete action program. It has been discussed with the Russian president and is bolstered by corresponding measures on both sides. But people have spiritual as well as material needs. In particular, a great deal has been done to ensure that the Russian language continues to operate in the Republic as before and the interests of the Russian-speaking population are not infringed upon. In 1993 a Slav University where teaching is conducted in Russian opened in Bishkek. Funding of the university's activity is shared by Kyrgyzstan and Russia. There are, of course, many farfetched fears and prejudices in the sphere of interethnic relations, and the Republic's leadership is doing everything it can to dispel them. For instance, a reasonable approach has been found with Russia to the so-called dual citizenship problem. I think that this solution will prove quite acceptable to all the Republic's inhabitants. [Shinkarenko] Are there any other events or things that you would like to point out on the eve of the treaty's second anniversary? [Nanayev] First, President Askar Akayev's official visit to Moscow in February, his meeting with President Boris Yeltsin. During this summit they discussed the most topical problems in our contacts, including the sphere of credit and financial relations, the prospects for the creation of joint ventures, the position of Russian-speaking residents, ways of strengthening the CIS, and promoting a settlement in Tajikistan. I cannot help but underline the following. During the difficult days this spring a number of regions of the Republic were beset by gigantic landslides (mountain torrents). Dozens of people died and the country sustained tremendous material damage. The Russians, the relevant services of the Russian Federation Ministry for Affairs of Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Elimination of Natural Disasters were the first to respond to the disaster. Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of Russia's Federation Council, visited the scene of the disaster. Lastly, here is another interesting point. We are currently preparing for a major event -- the Chuy Valley Days in Moscow Oblast. This festival is in return for a visit that we were paid by a delegation from Moscow Oblast. This event, as it may appear, is of by no means local significance and does not date from the time of stagnation. Familiarization with our friends' affairs shows that in the new conditions, our people still have a tremendous need for contacts with one another and have similar interests and aspirations. The Chuy Valley Workers' Cultural Days coincide with the second anniversary of the Treaty of Friendship and in this respect are particularly symbolic. [Shinkarenko] Good news and positive emotions are always beneficial. But what particularly alarms you today, Mr. Ambassador? [Nanayev] By the strictest criteria, apart from the difficulties that I have already mentioned, I do not foresee any difficulties in either the short or the long term. On the contrary, there is reason to think that our relations will continue growing and bear increasingly rich fruit. But one must not forget that these are relations between real partners linked by thousands of strands. And, as you know, there have always been, are, and regrettably will remain problems in our affairs that we must work on, especially now, when our countries are in the throes of a profound economic crisis. But unraveling these "knots" is a matter for the political leadership and for us diplomats.
