"Nobody but a fool wants air strikes but on the other hand nobody but a fool can go on tolerating the situation in which as many people can lose their lives as it happened Saturday in Sarajevo," Owen said following a meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The mortar attack Saturday occurred in a crowded Sarajevo market killing 68 people and injuring about 200. Owen said his meeting with Milosevic centered on what could be done to avoid a similar tragedy in the future. He added that the meeting to be held Thursday in Geneva between Bosnia's three warring parties -- Moslems, Serbs and Croats -- "is not a meeting to discuss global peace settlement but to discuss confidence building measures." He said these measures would include setting up a "hot line" between the Serbs and Moslems that would lead to a demilitarization of the Sarajevo region.
