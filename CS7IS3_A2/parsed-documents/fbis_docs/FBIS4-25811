Officials believe this would free up the bottle-necked Chinese rail lines, particularly in the east. Meanwhile, companies from Japan, Germany and France are competing fiercely to take part in the 70 billion yuan ($8 billion) construction of the huge Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway. In the coastal areas, China will build high-speed passenger railways with speeds reaching 250 kilometres per hour, said Shen Zhijie, chief engineer for the Ministry of Railways, yesterday. On existing jammed rail lines, speeds will be raised to 140 kilometres per hour by introducing new rolling stock technology, Shen said at a Sino-Japan seminar on high-speed railways. Passenger train speed on other lines will be pushed near 100 kilometres per hour by improving the arrangement of operation. Currently, the fastest speed of passenger trains is about 110 kilometres per hour. The Guangzhou-Shenzhen railway, with designed speed of 160 kilometres per hour, is expected to open for traffic before the end of the year. By the end of the century the average load of a freight train will be raised from 2,519 tons in 1992 to 2,900 tons, Shen said. China is also plotting the high-speed railway linking Beijing and Shanghai. The 1,300-kilometre line will connect five cities each with a population of more than 2 million. If completed before 2000, it will handle 120 million passengers each year, three times more than the existing line, Travel time from Beijing to Shanghai would be cut from 17 hours to 7 hours, experts said. The three-day Sino-Japan seminar on high-speed railways, which opened yesterday in Beijing, aims to introduce Japan's technology and experience on its trains, said Hiroshi Okada, president of the Japan Railway Technical Service, which sponsored the seminar. Japan's bullet train, running since 1964, was the first high-speed train in the world. Japan hopes its technology will be used in China's high-speed railway projects, Okada said. The Chinese Government is trying to borrow money from Japan to complete the Beijing-Shanghai line, in the fourth batch of loans from Tokyo. Japan is still undecided on the loans, but is showing a positive attitude to the project, Okada said. In the past 14 years, China used $2.1 billion in Japanese loans for its railway construction. Japanese banks also showed strong interest in this project, he added. Matsuo Michihiko, Japan's Vice Minister for Transport, said Japan is willing to transfer its technology to China. The seminar is Japan's latest effort to boost its ties to China's high-speed railway project. Last November, German companies held a similar seminar to introduce its ICE train to China.
