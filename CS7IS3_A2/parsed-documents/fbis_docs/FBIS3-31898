These are the final assessments, I would say. I think, however, that you, given your position, have been trying to find some rational explanation of this unusual political move, as it were, because this move ignored a minister's subordination to government policy. Have you found this explanation? [Havel] This appears to be a popular topic these days, and one is reluctant to comment further on it because many comments have already been made. Nevertheless, it seems to me that it is my duty to add a little more. I am unable to find a proper explanation. Minister Baudys's intention was undoubtedly noble. But the whole matter was so dilettantish that it broke all of the elementary rules of diplomacy, politics, and so on. This was almost shocking. I firmly believe that the sensation it caused and the degree of shame it generated for our Republic is perhaps a sufficient lesson to all of us to exercise caution. At issue here is not merely the fact that Minister Baudys failed to consult our constitutional officials on his original idea, whose content was very contentious, by the way. The point here is that this is not the way in which international initiatives should be pursued. [passage omitted] It was so absolutely dilettantish from start to finish, and I firmly hope that nothing of this kind will ever be repeated. But, should that be the case, the consequences of it would have to be more serious. [Tamchyna] Conditions of the NATO ultimatum to Bosnia have, on the whole, been met. The world can take a deep breath in the few days to come. Mr. President, despite all of this, don't you feel that Minister Baudys's personal position, presented to the world, or the discrepancies between your statement and the statement by the Czech prime minister could send a signal to the world that our foreign policy is not completely united on this currently very important issue? [Havel] The fact that representatives of the same state hold contradictory views does not, of course, create a very good impression. [passage omitted] The fact is, however, that the state must have its own foreign policy and direction, which it has. I think that, in principle, all of us are acting within the foreign policy constraints. In some cases, it might appear that some have gone beyond these constraints. It appears that all of them should give careful thought to what they are saying, and they should be aware that thinking aloud, which is often well intended, can give an altogether different impression once journalists get hold of it. [passage omitted] [Tamchyna] In the light of some political evergreens repeatedly discussed by the government, it seems that the fine and sensitive fabric of relations within the ruling coalition is not always as firm as it should be. Mr. President, in this context, what do you think about the two election bills [on local and Senate elections] approved by the government this week? [Havel] First, I am pleased to see that these bills have actually been passed by the government and that they will soon go through the parliament. Given that local elections and elections to the Senate are scheduled for this fall, it is high time to get these bills ready. I think that retaining the principle of a combined electoral system in the bill on elections to local and city councils is a good thing. [passage omitted] As for the elections to the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, it is absolutely proper, and I think that it is a good thing that elections to the Chamber of Deputies should be based on the proportional representation system and that, as prescribed by the Constitution, elections to the Senate should be based on the majority system. I do not wish to declare this categorically, but I myself favor the principle of small-sized constituencies with one seat. This was agreed by the government. This is, indeed, a clear majority system as prescribed by the Constitution. From the voters' point of view, the system is easier to understand; I think it is correct. [passage omitted]
