He said that vanguard fighters of Hanminjon and people of different strata in the Southern part of the country were renewing their unshakable will to achieve the cause of national reunification with the motive force of the nation in hearty response to the reunification programme reclarified by the great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year address. The Kim Yong-sam regime, he said, declared from the beginning that it would improve South-North relations, placing the nation above anything else, but has actually committed such anti-national acts as further aggravating the North-South confrontation, turning away the North's broadminded proposals such as exchange of presidential envoys and the nation's desire for reunification and persistently resorting to the policy of dependence on outside forces. Hanminjon held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of its Central Committee in Seoul on January 2 and solemnly vowed to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam regime, declaring its resolute break with the regime, together with the people in the South aspiring after independence, democracy and reunification, Cho Il-min noted, and stated: The time has gone to watch the "civilian" regime or to expect something from it. It is the general review and will of our people in the South that the Kim Yong-sam "regime" should no longer be left intact. Hanminjon and patriotic people of different strata in the South will defend the banner of national independence till they have achieved independence, democracy and reunification.
