"If parliament thinks that my action is wrong, let us have a vote of confidence," he said. He also said that he would probably attend the CIS summit in Moscow next week. The Georgian parliament did not approve Tamaz Kvachantiradze as education minister. Tedo Ninidze was approved as justice minister when Shevardnadze nominated him for a second time.
