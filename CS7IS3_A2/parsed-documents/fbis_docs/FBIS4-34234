FBIS4-34234 "drlat117_a_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-117 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Castro on Embassy Occupations, U.S. Relations Castro on Embassy Occupations, U.S. Relations PA1706000394 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2039 GMT 16 Jun 94 PA1706000394 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 16 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro said here today that people who enter embassies in Cuba violently lose their right to obtain a visa to leave the country. "Anyone who wants to leave Cuba can obtain a departure visa but anyone who enters an embassy violently loses that right," Castro said in a statement for the Colombian station Radio Cadena Nacional (RCN). Castro said Cubans who are of age can request visas to leave the country, but they cannot always obtain visas from the corresponding embassies and therefore decide to occupy the installations. On Wednesday, nine persons forcefully entered the Chilean Consulate in Havana while 20 others are currently at the German Embassy and 118 at the Belgian ambassador's residence demanding authorization to leave the island. Castro said the Cuban government has the obligation of protecting the embassies. He added, however, that force should not be used. Yesterday, Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly of the People's Government, noted the need to "prevent in a civilized manner" the violation and vulnerability of diplomatic missions. He stressed that Cuban authorities will refrain from dislodging the several civilians who occupied the embassies by force, adding that no reprisals will be taken against them if they change their attitude. "It is necessary to prevent in a civilized manner" the forceful occupation of embassies "if we do not want the law of the jungle to prevail or even prevent the disappearance of diplomatic service," Alarcon stressed. He said that so far the countries affected by those incidents have cooperated with Cuban authorities in trying to persuade the occupants to voluntarily and peacefully leave the installations. Alarcon, a former foreign minister, said the occupation of embassies is the result of U.S. immigration policy, which denies visas to Cubans who want to emigrate to that country. In his statement to RCN -- one of the most important radio networks in Colombia -- Castro also referred to Cuba's relations with the United States, denying the possibility for "direct contact" at this time. He stressed that U.S. President William Clinton is very interested in obtaining his reelection and therefore power groups, which he did not identify, are pressuring him to maintain the sanctions against Cuba. Castro said he is pleased with the election of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as OAS secretary general, but ruled out the possibility that he can promote Cuba's return to the regional organization in the very near future. For Cuba, its return to the OAS is not a priority; what we view as a priority is the end of the economic blockade the United States has maintained against the island for more than 30 years, Castro stressed. Castro described the blockade as "inhuman and criminal." He added that it is not justified because the Cold War is over and said it has hurt Cuba more due to changes in its trade activities, 80 percent of which were carried out with the socialist bloc. Consulted about the situation in Colombia -- a country facing guerrilla groups comprised of several million armed men -- Castro denied his country interferes in the internal affairs of other countries. He recognized that for some time, Cuba actively supported revolutionary movements in Latin America because they supported the [Cuban] policy toward the United States, but he explained that that situation has changed. He said his country's relations with Latin America are based on mutual respect and nonintervention in the internal affairs of each nation. Castro refused to comment on the possible results of Sunday's presidential elections in Colombia. He only said he hopes the elected president will continue working to further improve the electoral process. Castro recognized that he does not have the same energy as when he was 20 or 30 years old. He added that he will retire when the right time comes, after overcoming the current difficult moments because he does not want to look like a deserter. He said he would like to have "a small piece" of land in Cuba to rest and dedicate his time to reading. He noted, however, that he still works 15, 16, or 17 hours daily.
