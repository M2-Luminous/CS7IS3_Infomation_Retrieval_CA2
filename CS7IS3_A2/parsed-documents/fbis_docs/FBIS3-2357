Liu Huaqing said: The People's Liberation Army [PLA] has made great achievements in military legislation. The tasks of governing the state and managing the Army according to law remain very heavy in the days to come, and we should continue to make efforts. The all-army legislative work meeting was held in Beijing on 3 March with the approval of the Central Military Commission. It was the first all-army legislative work meeting in the PLA's history. The meeting seriously adhered to the party central committee's guidelines on strengthening legislative work, as well as the Central Military Commission's principle of managing the Army according to law. It concentrated on studying how to accelerate military legislation, create a new situation of military legislation, and use military laws in guiding, promoting and protecting defense construction and army building under the conditions of building a socialist market economic structure and stepping up army building in the new period. Present at the meeting were persons in charge of relevant departments under the PLA's three general departments and major units and the Armed Police Force headquarters. The comrades in charge of the legislative affairs departments of the party central committee, the National People's Congress, and the State Council attended and addressed the meeting. China has paid great attention to military legislation in recent years. The Central Military Commission set up its legislative bureau in 1988 to strengthen its leadership over military legislation. So far, the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee have successively promulgated nine military laws and legal decisions, including the "Military Service Law" and the "Law on Protection of Military Installations." More than 100 military regulations and military administrative regulations have been enacted either by the Central Military Commission alone or by the Central Military Commission and the State Council jointly. More than 1,000 sets of military rules have been formulated and published by the three general departments and major PLA units. So, a more feasible military legal system has been preliminarily established, and the planning of military legislation has improved. Moreover, the PLA has made great efforts to supervise and inspect law enforcement and to register all military rules and regulations, and the efforts have promoted the implementation of military laws and upheld the unity and dignity of the legal system. The PLA has also made remarkable achievements in publicizing the law, carrying out legal education, training legal affairs cadres, and providing legal counsel, as well as in jurisprudential studies.
