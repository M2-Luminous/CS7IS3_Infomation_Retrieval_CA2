FBIS4-468 "drafr070_c_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 10 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Spokesman: IFP To Take Part in `Genuine' Election Spokesman: IFP To Take Part in `Genuine' Election MB1004204694 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in Afrikaans 1800 GMT 10 Apr 94 MB1004204694 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network Afrikaans BFN [Text] Although the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] insists that it will not participate in the election, the party is apparently spending considerable amounts of money on election posters. Several IFP election posters were seen in the streets of Durban and surrounding areas, some with the message "vote when the time comes." [Begin IFP spokesman Arthur Koningkramer recording, in English] There's nothing contradictory in it. We still believe in elections. We are absolutely convinced that it is not possible to go ahead with democratic elections without a major player like the IFP. In addition, as you're well aware, the concerns of His Majesty the king, in terms of self-determination of the Zulu people, have not been addressed. We are confident that they will be addressed. And in conclusion I would just like to say that we're absolutely committed to elections. There will be genuine all-inclusive elections, and the IFP will fight them. [end recording]
