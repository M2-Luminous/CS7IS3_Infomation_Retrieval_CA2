We could even claim that we contribute to world military science. Chiefs of departments, staffs, and regiments compete with each other to visit foreign countries, and at the same time our Turkish neighbors prefer to train their soldiers in our country. Naturally, at our expense. First, it is cheaper, and second, if anything happens, they will be one step ahead. The so-called lower-ranking commanders of the Bulgarian Army cannot refuse to train people who will later join the reserve troops of the Turkish rather than the Bulgarian Army. Here and there it has been suggested that the recruits from across the border have a suspiciously great interest in our arms and army structures, but all this remains within the realm of specualtion. The National Assembly members, ostensibly concerned with the well-being of our motherland, are in no hurry to adopt the armed forces bill. For the time being, the bill has a loophole that allows even our officers to have dual citizenship. True, people who are torn between two countries cannot become officers, but no one can prevent active officers from acquiring another passport if they so wish. Under these circumstances why should the army officers be angry because the army does not have enough money? There is no reason to be, if our army can train the cadres of our traditional rivals free of charge.
