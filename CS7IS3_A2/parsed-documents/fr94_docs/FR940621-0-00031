FR940621-0-00031 FR940621-0-00016 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 649 [Docket No. 940366&hyph;4165; I.D. 021494E] RIN 0648&hyph;AF39 American Lobster Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this final rule to implement measures in Amendment 5 to the Fishery Management Plan for the American Lobster Fishery (FMP). Amendment 5 is intended to eliminate overfishing of American lobsters in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), with anticipated complementary management action in state waters. A final rule published on May 20, 1994 (59 FR 26454), implemented one of the measures approved under Amendment 5_maintenance of the current 31/4-inch (8.26&hyph;cm) minimum carapace length. This rule implements the remaining measures approved under Amendment 5: Limits on the issuance of new Federal vessel permits for a 5-year period, change in escape vent width, dealer permits, operator permits, a framework process to develop a stock rebuilding program, and a revised definition of overfishing. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of Amendment 5, its regulatory impact review (RIR), initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA), and the final supplemental environmental impact statement (FSEIS) are available from Douglas Marshall, Executive Director, New England Fishery Management Council, 5 Broadway, Saugus, MA 01906&hyph;1097.

Comments regarding the burden-hour estimates, or any other aspect of the collection-of-information requirements contained in this final rule, should be sent to the Regional Director, Northeast Region, NMFS, One Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, MA 01930, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) (Attention NOAA Desk Officer), Washington, D.C. 20503. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul H. Jones, NMFS, Fishery Policy Analyst, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9273. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Amendment 5, with some exceptions, was approved by NMFS on May 11, 1994. Background to the amendment was discussed in the proposed rule (59 FR 11029, March 9, 1994), and is not repeated here. Approved Management Measures NMFS is implementing the approved measures of Amendment 5 through two separate final rules. The first was published on May 20, 1994 (59 FR 26454). That final rule maintained the minimum carapace length for lobsters at 31/4 inches (8.26 cm), thereby rescinding the scheduled increases in the minimum size. This rule implements the remaining approved provisions of Amendment 5: (1) A 5-year moratorium on the issuance of new Federal vessel permits, (2) dealer and vessel operator permit requirements, (3) a decrease in the minimum width of the lobster trap escape vent from 6 inches (152.4 mm) to 5&hyph;3/4 inches (146.1 mm), and (4) a framework process that requires the development of a stock rebuilding program in four management areas in the EEZ (Gulf of Maine Near-shore, Southern New England Near-shore, Middle Atlantic Near-shore, and Offshore) by the end of the first year of implementation of Amendment 5. The framework process calls for the establishment of Effort Management Teams (EMTs) for each management area to develop area-specific management measures. Amendment 5 also revises the overfishing definition for American lobster to read: The resource is recruitment overfished when, throughout its range, the fishing mortality rate (F), given the regulations in place at that time under the suite of regional management measures, results in a reduction in estimated egg production per recruit to 10 percent or less of a non-fished population (F 814 10% ) With respect to the definition, the Amendment also specifies that the development of the status of the stock report and the evaluation of fishery-induced effects will consider information based upon one or more indices, including but not limited to: (1) Larval abundance index in surface waters, (2) larval settlement index, (3) pre-recruit indices by year class, (4) landings, (5) size composition of the landings, (6) spawning stock biomass, (7) numbers of egg-bearing females, (8) effort levels and catch per unit of effort, and (9) possible relationships of biological parameters to water temperatures or other environmental parameters. Although much of this information is currently unavailable, it is NMFS' intent to incorporate this information, as appropriate, into the determination of whether the fishery is being overfished when such information can be developed into valid, quantifiable indices of overfishing. Based on the definition, the lobster resource is overfished. To achieve reductions in fishing mortality, Amendment 5 includes a framework process requiring the New England Fishery Management Council (Council) to develop a stock rebuilding program during the first year of implementation. The management measures may include any of the framework measures specified under ยง649.44(d). These measures may be applied to all segments of the harvesting sector within each management area. To determine which of these measures will be implemented in each of the management areas, Amendment 5 establishes an EMT for each management area. Each EMT is charged with recommending to the Council a stock rebuilding program for its area no later than January 20, 1995. Based on the EMT recommendations, the Council is required to submit framework management measures to the Director, Northeast Region NMFS (Regional Director). This development timeframe is designed to provide industry members within each area with the opportunity to reach a consensus by July 20, 1995 as to which options listed in ยง649.44(d) should apply in their respective management area. NMFS has informed the Council, in a letter from the Regional Director dated May 11, 1994, that if the EMTs are unable to make their deadline, then NMFS will begin the process of withdrawing the FMP. The Council recommended to NMFS that the initial specification of a seaward boundary line of the Southern New England Near-shore area, which is contiguous with part of the Offshore area, be as set forth in ยง649.42 (see Figure 3 of part 649). The Council will determine the final location of a boundary line after the EMTs for these areas jointly consider the issue and make a recommendation to the Council. Long Island Sound, under the jurisdiction of the coastal states and not part of the EEZ, is not specifically part of the Southern New England Near-shore area. Amendment 5 includes new permitting requirements for vessel operators and dealers, and limits the requirements for limited access vessel permits for a period of 5 years. During the third year of the new permit requirements, the Council will conduct a formal review to determine whether the limitation on permits is necessary to the stock rebuilding program. The Council may choose to extend the limitation on new permits for a specified period or terminate it if it determines that such action is consistent with the stock rebuilding program. Amendment 5 specifies the lobster fishery control date as March 25, 1991, rather than January 9, 1991, as published in the Federal Register on March 25, 1991 (56 FR 12366). Shortly after publication of the control date of January 9, 1991, the Council agreed to adjust that date to the date of publication of the control date notice_March 25, 1991. The EMTs will consider the following control date guidelines during development of the stock rebuilding program: (1) In the event that a system of assigning fishing rights is developed as part of the FMP, such assignments shall be based on historical levels of participation in the fishery prior to March 25, 1991, with consideration for recent investments that have not yet been reflected in measures of participation; (2) new or re-rigged vessels will be given consideration in the assignment of fishing rights if (a) the vessel was under construction or re-rigging for directed lobster fishing as of March 25, 1991, as evidenced by written construction contracts, work orders, equipment purchases, or other evidence of substantial investment and intent to participate in the lobster fishery; and (b) the vessel possessed an American lobster permit and landed lobster prior to March 25, 1992; (3) historical participation will transfer with a vessel for a transfer made after March 25, 1991, unless such transfer is accompanied by a written document indicating the agreement of both the buyer and the seller that any future fishing rights applicable to that vessel are not being transferred with the vessel; and (4) any system of assigning fishing rights will take into consideration the following concerns relative to individuals or corporations that have sold a vessel within the time that may be chosen to determine historical fishing rights: (a) The degree of economic dependence upon the lobster fishery, including, but not limited to the percentage of income derived from the lobster fishery; (b) the extent of past participation in the lobster fishery; and (c) the demonstration of intent prior to March 25, 1991, to re-enter the lobster fishery with another vessel. Delayed and Disapproved Measures and the Reasons for Disapproval The limited access permit requirements and the vessel operator permit requirements will be implemented in 1995, so that they can be included as part of the 1995 permitting process. The annual permit renewal begins in August-September of each year, and limited access lobster vessel permits and vessel operator permits will be required on January 1, 1995. This implementation schedule will ensure that NMFS can administer the requirement with the minimum burden upon applicants. Three measures proposed in Amendment 5 were disapproved. Two measures were disapproved because they were inconsistent with national standard 4 of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act), which requires that any allocation of fishing privileges be fair and equitable. These measures would have established three vessel permit categories and would have set a quota for vessels issued a permit and using gear other than lobster pots. The proposed permit categories and quota would have unfairly impacted, without adequate justification, one segment of the fishery while allowing unrestrained increases in other sectors of the fishery. Also disapproved were the Council's proposed mandatory reporting requirements for dealers and vessels. The Council has not demonstrated that the benefits of the mandatory reporting requirements justify the costs, as required by E.O. 12866, particularly in light of the fact that the majority of lobsters are harvested from state waters. NMFS will pursue a cooperative approach with the states to share the costs of such a data collection. Comments and Responses NMFS received comments on the proposed rule from one U.S. Senator, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Council, four Maine state representatives, five fishing industry associations, and nine individuals. All of the comments were carefully considered during the formulation of this final rule. Specific comments are discussed and responded to below. The Council submitted comments requesting several clarifications and changes to the regulatory text. Most of these changes are noted in the Changes from the Proposed Rule section of this preamble. In addition to these changes, the Council requested that a provision restricting party, charter, and dive boats to six or fewer lobsters per person on board be expanded to include any fishing vessel. NMFS is not implementing this provision because it was not included as part of Amendment 5 and, as such, has not received adequate public notice and comment. The Council also requested that vessel owners not be in violation of the prohibition against selling or transferring fish to unpermitted dealers unless the sale or transfer were done knowingly. NMFS has not adopted this change because it would make enforcement of this prohibition almost impossible and because it would be inconsistent with similar prohibitions in other fishery management plans. In any event, NMFS will exercise discretion in enforcing this prohibition in cases where vessel owners could not reasonably be expected to know whether a dealer was validly permitted. Comment : A U.S. Senator, the Coast Guard, four industry associations, and six individuals stated that the amendment should be approved. Response : The comments have been noted and the amendment was partially approved, as explained above. Comment : One individual objected to the specific eligibility criteria for a limited access vessel permit that require a vessel or vessel owner to have been issued a Federal American lobster permit, or a federally endorsed state American lobster permit, and to have landed American lobsters prior to March 25, 1991. Response : This provision complies with the Magnuson Act requirements for establishing a system for limited access to a fishery. If a system for limiting access to a fishery is included in a fishery management plan, the Magnuson Act requires the Council and NMFS to take into account such factors as present participation in the fishery, historical fishing practices and dependence on the fishery, and capability of vessels to be used in other fisheries. The Council and NMFS considered all of these factors in establishing criteria required to qualify for full participation in the American lobster fishery. A control date was announced on March 25, 1991 (56 FR 12366), which gave notice to participants and potential participants that future participation in the fishery may be limited for vessels that entered the fishery after the control date. The purpose of the control date was to discourage increases in fishing effort and speculative entry into the fishery while development of Amendment 5 progressed. Amendment 5 also establishes an exemption to the limited access fishery for party, charter and dive boats in possession of six or fewer lobsters per person, or for recreational vessels and vessels that fish exclusively in state waters for lobsters. Therefore, Amendment 5 provides the opportunity for recreational operators and other types of operators who fish exclusively in state waters to participate in the fishery while discouraging further increases in fishing mortality by limiting the number of participants in the fishery. Comment : Two individuals requested that the boundary line between Management Areas 2 and 3 be omitted. Another requested that Management Area 4 be split into two zones. Response : The Council decided, and NMFS agrees, that a boundary line between the Southern New England Near-shore area and the Offshore area is needed to define the areas in the final rule so that appropriate area specific management measures can be developed. The Council has stated that future boundary lines for the areas will be considered jointly by the EMTs for these areas and that the EMTs will make recommendation on changes to the Council. Comment : Two individuals requested that the boundary line for the Management Areas be specified by Loran C coordinates, rather than by latitude and longitude. Response : All boundary lines listed in Federal fishery regulations are specified by latitude and longitude, because such coordinates are more precise and accurate for enforcement purposes. Comment : Three individuals stated that the amendment should be disapproved because it violates national standards. One industry association stated specifically that Amendment 5 violates: (1) National standard 1, because it does nothing to prevent overfishing; (2) national standard 2, because it does not use the best scientific information available; (3) national standard 3, because the Amendment establishes management zones that do not manage the lobster stock throughout the range of the stock; (4) national standard 4, because the Amendment discriminates against the mobile gear sector; (5) national standard 5, because there are severe restrictions placed on the mobile gear sector and absolutely none on the trap sector; (6) national standard 6, because the Amendment ignores the fact that mobile gear is a variation within the lobster fishery; (7) national standard 7, because, by establishing EMTs, the Amendment does not minimize costs. Response : With the exception of the disapproved portions of Amendment 5 noted above, NMFS has determined that the measures included in Amendment 5 are consistent with all of the national standards. Specific responses to the comments follows. Amendment 5 is consistent with national standard 1 because it mandates a timetable to implement measures to address overfishing based on a specific definition of overfishing, and creates a framework system to change management measures proposed by the Council. The process is designed to develop an industry consensus, through the EMTs and the Council, concerning the most effective management measures to achieve the objectives of the FMP to reduce fishing mortality in each of the four management areas. Thus, Amendment 5, as implemented, specifies the process, the timetable, and the specific biological objectives that will achieve the objectives of the FMP in addressing overfishing. If the Council fails to submit management measures sufficient to meet the FMP objectives, the regulations require the Secretary to determine whether preparation of an amendment to the FMP is necessary. In addition, NMFS stated in a letter notifying the Council of partial disapproval Amendment 5 that it will begin the process to withdraw the American lobster FMP if the EMTs have not submitted recommendations to the Council concerning management measures within 6 months after the effective date of the regulations implementing Amendment 5. Amendment 5 is consistent with national standard 2 because the Council determined, and NMFS agrees, that the NMFS weighout database is the best scientific information available in determining the conservation and management measures. Further, any new available data will be considered in reviewing specific management measures submitted to NMFS under the first-year framework process. National standard 3 states that ``to the extent practicable,'' an individual stock of fish shall be managed as a unit throughout the range. The overall objective of the FMP is to support and promote the development and implementation, on a continuing basis, of a unified, regional management program for lobster. The American lobster FMP and Amendment 5, as implemented by this rule, establishes a system to manage the lobster stock as a unit throughout the range. The provision for management areas recognizes that individual measures to achieve the overall FMP objectives may need to vary because of regional and state differences in how the lobster fishery is conducted. This is consistent with national standard 3, which provides that FMPs need not be identical for each geographic area within the management unit, if the FMP justifies the differences. Since more than 80 percent of the lobster fishery occurs in state waters, this approach is needed to insure consistent, comparable management measures among the various states engaged in the fishery. The measures that create different categories based on gear were disapproved because national standard 4 requires that any allocation of fishing privileges be fair and equitable. The permit categories and quota, although intended only to cap effort and prevent re-direction of effort from other fisheries, impact, without adequate justification, only one segment of the fishery and continue to allow unrestrained increases in other sectors (with the exception of the permit moratorium which affects all sectors equally). Pertaining to national standard 5, the measures that place restrictions on the mobile gear sector have been disapproved for the reasons stated above. Pertaining to national standard 6, for the reasons stated above, gear categories were disapproved. National standard 7 states that, ``where practicable,'' management measures shall minimize costs. This amendment creates EMTs for each of the four management areas to address concerns of geographic differences in the lobster fishery as permitted under national standard 3, as discussed above. Since more than 80 percent of the lobster fishery occurs in state waters, NMFS has determined that this approach is a practicable, cost-efficient way to insure consistent, comparable management measures among the various states bordering the four management areas established by Amendment 5. In particular, this approach is necessary to be consistent with the agency's guidelines on national standard 7, which state that a factor in deciding whether a fishery needs management through regulations implementing an FMP is the need to resolve competing interests and conflicts among user groups and whether a measure can further that resolution. Comment : One individual opposed the requirement for mandatory vessel logbooks. Response : This requirement was disapproved. Comment : Two individuals requested that representation on the EMTs include draggers and divers. Response : Members of each EMT will be appointed by the Council, in consultation with appropriate states and NMFS. This final rule does not restrict or require participation on the EMTs by any specific group or groups. Comment : One individual requested that the definition of recreational fishing vessel be changed to include dive vessels. Response : The definition for recreational fishing vessels includes dive vessels, provided that lobster harvested by dive vessels are not intended to be, nor are they, bartered, traded, or sold. Comment : A U.S. Senator and two industry associations expressed concern with the 100 lobster possession restrictions and the target quota for non-lobster pot vessels. Response : These provisions have been disapproved. Comment : One industry association asked if the wording of the overfishing definition as defined in Amendment 5 will mandate a change in the way future overfishing will be determined. Response : The overfishing definition in the Amendment will be the objective measurement of the status of the lobster stock and complies with the 50 CFR part 602 guidelines. Comment : Four Maine state legislators expressed concern over conflicting state and Federal American lobster regulations. Response : The overall objective of the FMP is to support and promote the development and implementation, on a continuing basis, of a unified, regional management program for lobster. The final rule published on May 20, 1994 (59 FR 26454) is consistent with this objective by maintaining the minimum size at 31/4 inches (8.26 cm). Comment : Four Maine state representatives expressed concern that the Maine Legislature's Joint Standing Committee on Maine Resources was not contacted to discuss any perceived or actual concerns about the lobster resource. Response : The Coastal Zone Management Act requires that the coastal zone agency of each state affected by Amendment 5 be contacted and asked whether they agree that the amendment is consistent, to the maximum extent practicable, with their federally approved coastal zone management program. On February 7, 1994, the Council sent a letter to the Coastal Program Manager for the State of Maine, and on February 11, 1994, the Council received a reply from the State of Maine that determined the amendment was consistent with the enforceable policies of the Maine Coastal Program. In addition, the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources serves on the Council. Comment : One industry association expressed concern that the wording under ยง649.9(d)(1) does not exempt recreational vessels. Response : NMFS has modified ยง649.4(a) and ยง649.9(d)(1) to clarify that recreational vessels are exempt from the permit requirements. Comment : One industry association pointed out that recreational fishing vessels, as defined in the proposed rule, were not limited to six or fewer American lobsters per person aboard the vessel at any time. Response : It was not the intent of Amendment 5 to restrict the recreational fishery for American lobsters. However, by definition, recreational vessels are prohibited from bartering, trading, or selling lobster. Comment : One individual objected to the requirement for an operator permit and stated that it should be the responsibility of the vessel owner to make sure that the vessel operator is fully aware of, and follows, all regulations. Response : The intent of this measure is to improve regulatory compliance by those who are most directly able to control the actions of the vessel and crew. The number of operators having their permit suspended or revoked is expected to be relatively small. Penalties would be assessed against a vessel operator only if the vessel operator is determined to have been involved in a major violation or is a significant repeat offender of Federal fishing regulations. The language gives notice to the vessel operator that his/her right and privilege to operate and serve on a federally permitted fishing vessel is subject to the condition that right may be suspended or revoked in certain circumstances. Without the possibility of suspending or revoking an operator's right to serve in any capacity on a federally permitted vessel, the purpose of requiring operator's permits would be meaningless. The language also puts the operator on notice that he/she will be responsible for his/her actions and will not be able to move to another vessel should a suspension occur. It is consistent with a vessel permit suspension, which takes the vessel out of the fishery during the time of suspension. Changes from the Proposed Rule Changes were made to several sections of the proposed rule to clarify the measures and to ensure consistency with other fishery regulations. In addition, substantive changes are made to the following sections: In ยง649.1, the narrative within the first paragraph is modified to add the phrase ``This part implements the Fishery Management Plan for the American Lobster Fishery (FMP), as amended by the New England Fishery Management Council in consultation with the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC), and approved by the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries'' to clarify further the purpose and scope of the FMP. In ยง649.2, the definition of an ``Effort Monitoring Team'' is modified to add the phrase ``a group of American lobster industry representatives (appointed by the Council)'' to clarify who the appointing authority is for the EMT. In ยง649.2, the definition of a ``ghost panel'' is modified to add the phrase ``after a period of time if the'' to clarify the meaning of a ghost panel. In ยง649.2, the definition of ``Lobster Plan Development Team'' is not used in these regulations and is deleted from this final rule. In ยง649.2, the definition of a ``lobster pot trawl'' is added. In ยง649.2, the definitions of ``reporting month and reporting week'' are deleted from this final rule. The vessel and dealer reporting requirement measures were disapproved by NMFS; therefore, these definitions are no longer necessary. In ยง649.2, the definition of ``sixth tail segment'' is not used in these regulations and is deleted from this final rule. In ยง649.2, the definition of a ``whole American lobster'' is modified to add the phrase ``A cull whole American lobster is an American lobster with one or both claws missing,'' to clarify the meaning of a whole American lobster. In ยง649.4 paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) are added to clarify NMFS' intent to allow 1994 permits to remain effective until December 31, 1994, and the remaining paragraphs of the section are redesignated accordingly. In ยง649.4(b), the narrative in the introductory text is modified to add the phrase ``From January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1999,'' to clarify NMFS' intent to start issuing limited access American lobster permits in 1995 and that this permit requirement will expire at the end of 1999. In the same paragraph, the phrase ``not intended for or resulting in trade, barter or sale'' is added to clarify which vessels do not require a limited access American lobster permit. In ยง649.4(b)(1)(B), the phrase ``or federally endorsed state American lobster permit,'' is added to clarify that a vessel issued a federally endorsed state American lobster permit can also qualify for a limited access permit. In ยง649.4(b)(2), the phrase ``for the years after 1996 - 1999'' is added to clarify the intent of Amendment 5 to limit the issuance of limited access vessel permits for a period of 5 years. In ยง649.4, paragraph (b)(2)(ii) is added to clarify the intent of Amendment 5 to limit the issuance of limited access vessel permits for a period of 5 years. In ยง649.4(e), the word ``overall'' is added to clarify what vessel length information is needed. In ยง649.4(h), the phrase ``A Federal American lobster permit will expire upon the renewal date specified in the permit'' is added to correct a statement in the proposed rule. In ยง649.5(a), the phrase ``Beginning on January 1, 1995,'' is added to clarify NMFS' intent to require operator permits beginning in 1995, the phrase ``not intended for or resulting in trade, barter or sale'' is added to clarify further who does not require a vessel operator permit, and text is added to clarify further the requirement for an operator permit. In ยง649.5, paragraph (g) was revised to correct an error in the proposed rule. In ยง649.6(b), the sentence, ``For 1994, a copy of an applicant's completed application will serve as a temporary permit until the applicant has received a permanent permit.'' is added. Since dealers are required to have Federal permits upon the effective date of this final rule, there is not sufficient time for applicants to comply with the requirement to have their permit application submitted 30 days prior to the date they desire the permit to be effective. This will alleviate that problem. In ยง649.6(e), the phrase ``and the applicant has submitted all applicable reports specified in ยง649.7(a)'' is deleted. The vessel and dealer reporting requirement measures were disapproved by NMFS; therefore, this phrase is no longer necessary. In ยง649.6, paragraph (f) is revised to correct a statement in the proposed rule. In ยง649.8(a)(6), the phrase ``unless such gear has been rendered unfishable'' is added to allow for the retrieval of lost gear or the unintentional catching of lost lobster pots by trawl vessels and subsequent repairing or destroying of the gear on shore. In ยง649.8(b), the phrase ``or unless the vessel is a recreational vessels or vessel fishing for American lobsters exclusively in state waters'' is added to clarify exemptions to this prohibition. In ยง649.8(c)(5), the phrase ``Beginning on January 1, 1995,'' is added to clarify that the operator permit requirement is not effective until 1995. In ยง649.8, paragraph (c)(10) is added to codify the statutory requirements under section 307(1)(J) of the Magnuson Act. In ยง649.8(c)(1)(iii) is modified to add the phrase ``per person on board the vessel and the'' was added to clarify further the intent of the prohibition. In ยง649.20, the section heading is revised to clarify the meaning of the section, and paragraphs (b)(3), (d)(3), and (e)(3) were added to codify the statutory requirements under section 307(1)(J) of the Magnuson Act. In ยง649.23, the prohibition on transferring fish from one vessel to another while at sea is deleted because the landing and quota requirements proposed by the Council have been disapproved and this measure is no longer necessary. In ยง649.42, point I is added to the table in paragraph (b)(2) because it was inadvertently omitted in the proposed rule, and the heading of paragraph (b)(4) is modified to add the word ``EEZ'' to clarify that the near-shore waters referred to in the table are in Federal waters. In ยง649.43, paragraph (b)(11) is redesignated paragraph (b)(12), a new paragraph (b)(11) is added to clarify the Council's intent that the control date guidelines be retained for consideration by the EMTs, and paragraph (b)(12) is revised to clarify the Council's intent on recommending adjustments or additions to management measures. In ยง649.43, paragraph (e) is redesignated paragraph (f), and a new paragraph (e) is added to clarify that the Council is not precluded from taking necessary management actions in year 1 by the other requirements of ยง649.43. In ยง649.44(c), the references to Plan Development Teams (PDTs) are deleted to clarify that frameworks, as described in Amendment 5 are tied to EMTs, specifically. PDTs may, at the discretion of the Council, develop independent findings and recommendations. Also, the phrase ``shall provide the appropriate rationale and economic and biological analysis for its recommendation, utilizing the most current catch, effort, and other relevant data from the fishery'' is removed from paragraph (c) of this section, and placed in ยง649.44(d) to clarify further the Council's intent on who should prepare the required analysis. In ยง649.44, paragraph (d)(11) is redesignated to (d)(12), and a new paragraph (b)(11) is added to clarify the Council's intent that the control date guidelines be retained. Redesignated paragraph (d)(12) is revised to clarify the Council's intent on recommending adjustments or additions to management measures. Since all recordkeeping and reporting requirements contained in ยง649.7 were disapproved, sections 649.8 (Vessel identification), 649.9 (prohibitions), 649.10 (Facilitation and enforcement), and 649.11 (penalties) in the proposed rule are redesignated as ยงยง649.7, 649.8, 649.9, and 649.10, respectively, in this final rule. Since the contents of ยง649.22 (possession restrictions and target quota), 649.23 (transfer at sea), and 649.24 (restrictions on trawl gear while in the trap fishery) in the proposed rule were disapproved, ยง649.25 (experimental fishing exemption) of the proposed rule is redesignated as ยง649.22 in this final rule. Republication of Part of 50 CFR Part 649 A revised version of ยง649.20(b)(1) and (2) was published in the first final rule (59 FR 26454, May 20, 1994) for Amendment 5, effective May 17, 1994. Those paragraphs are republished here for the convenience of the reader so as to have the entire 50 CFR part 649 published together. Classification The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration when this rule was proposed that if adopted, it would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, an initial regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. This rule contains two new collection-of-information requirements and two revisions to existing requirements previously approved by OMB. These collection-of-information requirements have been approved by OMB. Nevertheless, public comments are invited on the burden-hour estimates for the collection of information requirements as listed below. The new reporting requirements are: 1. Dealer permits, OMB Control No. 0648&hyph;0202, (5 min./response); 2. Operator permits, OMB Control No. 0648&hyph;0202, (1 hour/response). Revisions to the existing requirements are: 1. Vessel permits, OMB Control No. 0648&hyph;0202, (1 hour/response); 2.

(1) Through December 31, 1994, any vessel of the United States fishing for American lobster in the EEZ must have been issued and carry on board a valid permit required by or issued under this part. The Regional Director may, by agreement with State agencies, recognize permits or licenses issued by those agencies endorsed for fishing for lobster in the EEZ, providing that such permitting programs accurately identify persons who fish in the EEZ, and that the Regional Director can either individually, or in concert with the state agency, act to suspend the permit or license for EEZ fishing for any violation under this part. (2) Alternate State EEZ permitting programs will be established through a letter of agreement between the Regional Director and the director of the State marine fisheries agency concerned. The letter of agreement will specify the information to be collected by the alternate EEZ permitting program and the mode and frequency of provision of that information to the Regional Director. The Regional Director will, in cooperation with the State director, arrange for notification of the existence and terms of any such agreements to the affected persons. Persons intending to fish in the EEZ should determine whether an alternate EEZ permitting program is in force for their state before applying for a Federal permit under paragraph (d) of this section. (3) Vessel owners or operators who apply for a fishing vessel permit under this section, or for a State permit endorsed for EEZ fishing under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, must agree, as a condition of the permit, that all the vessel's lobster fishing, catch, and gear (without regard to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of the EEZ, and without regard to where such lobster, lobster meats, or parts, or gear are possessed, taken or landed) will be subject to all the requirements of this part. All such fishing, catch, and gear will remain subject to any applicable state or local requirements. If a requirement of this part and a conservation measure required by state or local law differ, any vessel owner or operator permitted to fish in the EEZ must comply with the more restrictive requirement. (b) Limited access American lobster permits . From January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1999, any vessel of the United States that fishes for, possesses, or lands American lobster, in or harvested from the EEZ, must have been issued and carry on board a valid Federal limited access American lobster permit. This requirement does not apply to party, charter and dive boats that possess six or fewer American lobsters, not intended for or resulting in trade, barter or sale, per person aboard the vessel at any time, or to recreational vessels, and vessels that fish exclusively in state waters for American lobsters. (1) Eligibility in 1995 . (i) To be eligible to obtain a limited access American lobster permit for 1995, a vessel must meet one of the following criteria: (A) The vessel or vessel owner had been issued a Federal American lobster permit, or a federally endorsed state American lobster permit, and landed American lobsters prior to March 25, 1991; or (B) The vessel was under written agreement for construction or for re-rigging for directed American lobster fishing as of March 25, 1991, and the vessel was issued a Federal American lobster permit, or federally endorsed state American lobster permit, and landed American lobster prior to March 25, 1992; or (C) The vessel is replacing a vessel that meets any of the criteria set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section. (ii) No more than one vessel may qualify, at any one time, for a limited access American lobster permit based on that or another vessel's fishing and permit history. If more than one vessel owner claims eligibility for a limited access American lobster permit, based on one vessel's fishing and permit history, the Regional Director shall determine who is entitled to qualify for the limited access American lobster permit. (iii) A limited access American lobster permit for 1995 will not be issued unless an application for such permit is received by the Regional Director on or before December 31, 1995. (2) Eligibility in 1996 and thereafter . (i) To be eligible to renew or apply for a limited access American lobster permit for the years 1996&hyph;1999, a vessel must have been issued a limited access American lobster permit for the preceding year, or the vessel must be replacing a vessel that had been issued a limited access American lobster permit for the preceding year. If more than one vessel owner claims eligibility to apply for a limited access American lobster permit based on one vessel's fishing and permit history, the Regional Director shall determine who is entitled to qualify for the limited access American lobster permit. (ii) Beginning January 1, 2000, any vessel of the United States that fishes for, possesses, or lands American lobster, in or harvested from the EEZ, must have been issued and carry on board a valid Federal American lobster permit. This requirement does not apply to party, charter and dive boats that possess six or fewer American lobsters, not intended for or resulting in trade, barter, or sale, per person aboard the vessel at any time, or to recreational vessels and vessels that fish exclusively in state waters for American lobsters. The eligibility requirements for limited access permits for the years 1996 - 1999 are not applicable for obtaining an American lobster permit for the year 2000 and thereafter. (3) Change in ownership . The fishing and permit history of a vessel is presumed to transfer with the vessel whenever it is bought, sold, or otherwise transferred, unless there is a written agreement, signed by the transferor/seller and transferee/buyer, or other credible written evidence, verifying that the transferor/seller is retaining the vessel fishing and permit history for purposes of replacing the vessel. (4) Notification of eligibility for a limited access permit . (i) NMFS will attempt to notify all owners of vessels for which NMFS has credible evidence that they meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (ii) If a vessel owner has not been notified that the vessel is eligible to be issued a limited access American lobster permit, and the vessel owner believes that there is credible evidence that the vessel does qualify under the pertinent criteria, the vessel owner may apply for a limited access American lobster permit by submitting the information described in paragraphs (d) through (e) of this section. In the event the application is denied, the applicant may appeal as specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. If, through either of these procedures, the Regional Director determines that the vessel meets the eligibility criteria, a limited access American lobster permit will be issued to the vessel. (5) Appeal of denial of limited access American lobster permit or of permit category assignment . (i) Any applicant denied a limited access American lobster permit may appeal the denial to the Regional Director within 30 days of the notice of denial. Any such appeal must be based on one or more of the following grounds, must be in writing, and must state the grounds for the appeal: (A) The information used by the Regional Director was based on mistaken or incorrect data; (B) The applicant was prevented by circumstances beyond his/her control from meeting relevant criteria; or (C) The applicant has new or additional information. (ii) The Regional Director will appoint a designee who will make the initial decision on the appeal. (iii) The appellant may request a review of the initial decision by the Regional Director by so requesting, in writing, within 30 days of the notice of initial decision. If the appellant does not request a review of the initial decision within 30 days, the initial decision shall become the final administrative action of the Department of Commerce. (iv) Recommendations to the Regional Director by a hearing officer . A hearing officer shall be appointed by the Regional Director to review the initial decision. The hearing officer shall make findings and a recommendation to the Regional Director, which shall be advisory only. (v) Upon receiving the findings and a recommendation, the Regional Director will issue a final decision on the appeal. The Regional Director's decision is the final administrative action of the Department of Commerce. (c) Condition . Vessel owners who apply for a permit under this section must agree, as a condition of the permit, that the vessel and vessel's fishing, catch, and pertinent gear (without regard to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of the EEZ, and without regard to where such fish or gear are possessed, taken, or landed), are subject to all requirements of this part. The vessel and all such fishing, catch, and gear shall remain subject to all applicable state or local requirements. If a requirement of this part and a management measure required by state or local law differ, any vessel owner permitted to fish in the EEZ must comply with the more restrictive requirement. (d) Vessel permit application . Applicants for a permit under this section must submit a completed application on an appropriate form obtained from the Regional Director. The application must be signed by the owner of the vessel, or the owner's authorized representative, and be submitted to the Regional Director at least 30 days before the date on which the applicant desires to have the permit made effective. The Regional Director will notify the applicant of any deficiency in the application pursuant to this section. Applicants for 1995 limited access American lobster permits who have not been notified of eligibility by the Regional Director shall provide information with the application sufficient for the Regional Director to determine whether the vessel meets the eligibility requirements specified under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Acceptable forms of proof include, but are not limited to, state weigh-out records, packout forms, and settlement sheets. (e) Information requirements .

(f) Fees . The Regional Director may charge a fee to recover the administrative expense of issuing a permit required under this section. The amount of the fee shall be calculated in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook for determining administrative costs of each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and is specified with each application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application; if it does not, the application will be considered incomplete for purposes of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. (g) Issuance . (1) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904 and under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the Regional Director shall issue a Federal American lobster vessel permit within 30 days of receipt of the application unless: (i) The applicant has failed to submit a completed application.

(e) Presumption . American lobsters that are possessed, or landed at or prior to the time when the American lobsters are received by a dealer, or American lobsters that are possessed by a dealer, are presumed to be harvested from the EEZ or by a vessel with a Federal lobster permit. A preponderance of all submitted evidence that such American lobsters were harvested by a vessel without a Federal American lobster permit and fishing exclusively for American lobsters in state waters will be sufficient to rebut the presumption. (f) The possession of egg-bearing female American lobsters, V-notched female American lobsters, or American lobsters that are smaller than the minimum size set forth in ยง649.20(b), will be prima facie evidence that such American lobsters were taken or imported in violation of these regulations. Evidence that such American lobsters were harvested by a vessel not holding a permit under this part and fishing exclusively within state or foreign waters will be sufficient to rebut the presumption. ยง649.9 Facilitation of enforcement.

(1) The Council shall establish EMTs for each area specified in paragraph (b) of this section, for the purpose of making recommendations to the Council on management measures to achieve the objectives of the FMP. (2) Members of each EMT shall be appointed by the Council, in consultation with appropriate states and NMFS. Members of the EMT shall consist of a group of technical representatives that serve on each EMT and a group of representatives from the lobster industry, based on their geographical affiliation with an EMT. The Council may decide the number of representatives and operating procedures of the EMTs. (3) No later than January 20, 1995, each EMT shall report its recommendations for management measures for the stock rebuilding program for the area it represents to the Council. ยง649.43 First year framework specifications. (a) On or before January 20, 1995, each EMT shall submit its recommendations for management measures for the area it represents to the Council. In developing these recommendations, the EMTs may consider and recommend additional restrictions or limitations on vessels participating in the lobster fishery according to the categories and guidelines contained in paragraph (b) of this section. (b) After receiving the recommendations of the EMTs, the Council shall determine what management measures are necessary for each management area, in order to achieve the objectives of stock rebuilding specified in the FMP. For the management measures the Council determines are necessary to meet FMP objectives, the Council shall provide appropriate rationale and economic and biological analysis of the determinations. The Council shall make these determinations over the span of at least two Council meetings and provide the public with advance notice of, and opportunity to comment on, the determinations and the analyses before making final recommendations to be submitted to NMFS. The Council's recommendation on necessary management measures may come from one or more of the following categories: (1) Minimum-size changes; (2) A maximum-size limit; (3) Trap limits; (4) Seasonal closures of one or more management areas; (5) Closed areas or zones within a management area; (6) Restrictions on allowable fishing time; (7) Restrictions on allowable catches; (8) Permitting restrictions; (9) Additional restrictions on gear; (10) Overfishing definition; (11) Limitations on participation in the fishery in accordance with the control date guidelines listed below. These guidelines will apply until a stock rebuilding program is established. (i) It is the intent of the Council that in the event that a system of assigning fishing rights is developed as part of the FMP, such assignments shall be based upon historical levels of participation in the fishery prior to March 25, 1991, with consideration for recent investments that have not yet been reflected in measures of participation. (ii) New or re-rigged vessels will be given consideration in the assignment of fishing rights if: (A) They were under construction or re-rigging for directed lobster fishing as of March 25, 1991, as evidenced by written construction contracts, work orders, equipment purchases, or other evidence of substantial investment and intent to participate in the lobster fishery; and (B) They possessed an American lobster permit and landed lobster prior to March 25, 1992. (iii) The public is further notified that it is the intent of the Council that historical participation will transfer with a vessel, for transfers made after March 25, 1991, unless such transfer is accompanied by a written document indication the agreement of both buyer and seller that any future fishing rights applicable to that vessel are not being transferred with the vessel. (iv) The Council further intends that any system of assigning fishing rights will take into consideration the following concerns relative to individuals or corporations that have sold a vessel within the time that may be chosen to determine historical fishing rights: (A) The degree of economic dependence upon the lobster fishery including, but not limited to, the percentage of income derived from the lobster fishery; (B) Extent of past participation in the lobster fishery; and (C) Demonstration of intent prior to March 25, 1991, to re-enter the lobster fishery with a different vessel. (12) Any other restrictions that the Council may designate for the purpose of reducing or controlling fishing mortality rates, except that an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system would require a full FMP amendment. (c) After developing necessary management measures and receiving public testimony, the Council shall make a recommendation to the Regional Director on or before July 20, 1995. The Council's recommendation must include supporting rationale and, if management measures are recommended, an analysis of impacts, and a recommendation to the Regional Director on whether to publish the management measures as a final rule. If the Council recommends that the management measures should be published as a final rule, the Council must consider at least the following factors and provide support and analysis for each factor considered: (1) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire harvest/fishing season; (2) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the development of the Council's recommended management measures; (3) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource; and (4) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management measures adopted, following their promulgation as a final rule. (d) If the Council's recommendation includes adjustments or additions to management measures, after reviewing the Council's recommendation and supporting information: (1) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's recommended management measures and determines that the recommended management measures may be published as a final rule, based on the factors specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the action will be published in the Federal Register as a final rule; or (2) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's recommendation and determines that the recommended management measures should be published first as a proposed rule, the action will be published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register . After additional public comment, if the Regional Director concurs with the Council recommendation, the action will be published as a final rule in the Federal Register ; or (3) If the Regional Director does not concur, the Council will be notified, in writing, of the reasons for the non-concurrence. (e) At any time, the Council may make other adjustments to management measures implemented under this part pursuant to the provisions in ยง649.44. (f) Nothing in this section is meant to diminish the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act. ยง649.44 Framework specifications after the first year of implementation. (a) Annually, upon request from the Council, the Regional Director will provide the Council with information of the status of the American lobster resource, based on the most recent stock assessment report. (b) The Council and Atlantic States Fisheries Commission, through consultation with the ASMFC Lobster Scientific Committee within the stock assessment process and with the EMTs, shall continue to monitor the effectiveness of the Stock Rebuilding Program and to ensure, to the extent possible, that regional measures (within a Management Area) do not shift costs from one Management Area to another. (c) In addition, the EMTs, on at least an annual basis, shall determine the extent to which the objectives of the FMP are being achieved and shall make recommendations to the Council for further management actions, if required. (d) After receiving the EMT recommendations, the Council shall determine whether adjustments to, or additional management measures are necessary to meet the goals and objectives of the FMP. After considering the EMT's recommendations, or at any other time, if the Council determines that adjustments to, or additional management measures are necessary, it shall develop and analyze appropriate management actions over the span of at least two Council meetings. The Council shall provide the appropriate rationale and economic and biological analysis for its recommendation, utilizing the most current catch, effort, and other relevant data from the fishery. The Council shall provide the public with advance notice of the availability of both the proposals and the analyses, and opportunity to comment on them prior to, and at, the second Council meeting. The Council's recommendation on adjustments or additions to management measures may come from one or more of the following categories: (1) Minimum-size changes; (2) A maximum-size limit; (3) Trap limits; (4) Seasonal closures of one or more management areas; (5) Closed areas or zones within a management area; (6) Restrictions on allowable fishing time; (7) Restrictions on allowable catches; (8) Permitting restrictions; (9) Additional restrictions on gear; (10) Overfishing definition; (11) Limitations on participation in the fishery in accordance with the control date guidelines contained in ยง649.44(b)(11). These guidelines will apply until a stock rebuilding program is established. (12) Any other restrictions which the Council may designate for the purpose of reducing or controlling fishing mortality rates, except that an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system would require a full FMP amendment. (e) After developing management actions and receiving public testimony, the Council shall make a recommendation to the Regional Director. The Council's recommendation must include supporting rationale and, if management measures are recommended, an analysis of impacts, and a recommendation to the Regional Director on whether to publish the management measures as a final rule. If the Council recommends that the management measures should be published as a final rule, the Council must consider at least the following factors and provide support and analysis for each factor considered: (1) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire harvest/fishing season; (2) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the development of the Council's recommended management measures; (3) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource; and (4) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management measures adopted, following their promulgation as a final rule. (f) If the Council's recommendation includes adjustments or additions to management measures, after reviewing the Council's recommendation and supporting information: (1) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's recommended management measures and determines that the recommended management measures may be published as a final rule, based on the factors specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the action will be published in the Federal Register as a final rule; or (2) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's recommendation and determines that the recommended management measures should be published first as a proposed rule, the action will be published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register . After additional public comment, if the Regional Director concurs with the Council recommendation, the action will be published as a final rule in the Federal Register ; or (3) If the Regional Director does not concur, the Council will be notified, in writing, of the reasons for the non-concurrence. (g) Nothing in this section shall impair the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act.
