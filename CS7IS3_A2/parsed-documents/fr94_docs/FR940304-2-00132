Public Participation Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c), the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite the review process or for other good cause which may be consistent with applicable laws. The Assistant Secretary finds that good cause exists for not publishing the supplement to the Oregon State Plan as a proposed change and making the Regional Administrator's approval effective upon publication for the following reasons: 1. The standard amendment is as effective as the Federal standard which was promulgated in accordance with the Federal law including meeting requirements for public participation. 2. The standard amendment was adopted in accordance with the procedural requirements of State law and further public participation would be repetitious. This decision is effective March 4, 1994.
