South Korea, however, showed an unreasonable [ondangchi motan] attitude by saying in a reply telephone message on 12 April that it cannot accept the letter. As we are not able to hand over to South Korea the letter to South Korean authorities, political parties, organizations, and individual figures because of South Korea's unjust manner [pudanghan chosa], we unavoidably [pudugi] broadcast it [pangsonguro] today.
