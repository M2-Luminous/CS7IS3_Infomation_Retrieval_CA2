They told AFP that the withdrawal from the Makhmur region near the main Kurdish town of Irbil took place on Wednesday, with the army pulling back four kilometres (two miles). There was no immediate explanation for the pull-back in Makhmur, where the Iraqi army shelled farms during the harvest last summer. The region is close to the 36th parallel, north of which the Gulf war allies have imposed a no-fly zone for Iraqi aircraft. The declared aim of the zone is to protect the Kurds, who control northern Iraq in defiance of Baghdad. Kurdish military officials also said that Turkish gunners shelled the border regions of Narwah and Rikan, without causing damage or casualties. Turkish troops were concentrated on the other side of the border. In Ankara, the ANATOLIA news agency reported Wednesday that Turkish army commando units had crossed into northern Iraq in pursuit of Kurdish rebels who attacked a police post in southeast Turkey killing two officers. Thirteen rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) were also killed during the attack Tuesday evening in Cukurca, near the Turkish border with Iran and Iraq. It said the commando unit had crossed at least five kilometres (three miles) into Iraq on Wednesday.
