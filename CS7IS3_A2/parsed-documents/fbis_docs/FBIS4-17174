Velikoselskiy and Ye. Alekseyev, identified by caption] [Text] Not many visitors to this museum in St. Petersburg have been able to see the entire exhibition. Despite the fact that only specialists are admitted to the exhibition halls of the Russian Scientific Center of Applied Chemistry, it takes a special permit for some doors to be opened. Old women living nearby claim that the atom bomb itself was built here. In actual fact the State Institute of Applied Chemistry was and is working on other problems, also mainly of a defense nature. Engine fuel for space rockets from Gagarin's Vostok to the Buran has been developed here. However, in recent years the share of orders from the military-industrial complex has totaled less than half of the Institute's orders. Now there is not enough money to implement ideas, equipment is not being updated, and specialists are leaving. Unless the situation improves, this unique scientific center will become a subsidiary of its own museum, and no new generation of would-be Russian space travelers is likely to blast off to remote galaxies.
