How does the city view these dangers? [Vo Tran Chi] All four dangers raise issues of equal importance and are interrelated. Therefore, concentrated efforts must be made to overcome them. Given the characteristics of the city, however, top priority must be given to efforts to overcome the danger posed by the peaceful evolution scheme. Hostile forces are implementing their peaceful evolution scheme on a nationwide basis. Ho Chi Minh City, however, is regarded as a key target because it has all the conditions for the enemy to undermine our political, economic, cultural, ideological, and organizational structures. Furthermore, it is the objective of the peaceful evolution scheme to cause political instability. Meanwhile, political stability is the preliminary condition for socioeconomic development. Only when political stability is maintained can people throughout the country have a sense of security while engaging in business activities and accelerating socioeconomic development. Political stability is also the preliminary condition for encouraging foreign countries to make bold investments. [Van Dinh] Dear comrade: That is the preliminary condition. Are there any other conditions? [Vo Tran Chi] It is necessary to build a sound socioeconomic infrastructure. Socioeconomic infrastructure here means policies, laws, discipline, management mechanisms, and personnel who are competent and highly qualified for the overall development on the socioeconomic and political fronts. [Van Dinh] Dear comrade: What should the city do to overcome the danger of being left farther behind economically? [Vo Tran Chi] Intensive efforts must be made to effect economic restructuring based on the need for industrialization and modernization. Ours is an industrial city, but there still remains much room for improvement. In my opinion, as far as the 1994-95 period is concerned, drastic efforts must be made to improve technology, increase production output, and enhance economic efficiency. It is necessary to take practical measures to effect agricultural industrialization, thereby creating enough strength to promote socioeconomic development in the entire city and in surrounding areas. [Van Dinh] Dear comrade: To this end, what is the most decisive factor for success? [Vo Tran Chi] First of all, it is necessary to strengthen and enhance the leading role of the city party organization and the efficiency of state management agencies. Past experiences show that correct policies trigger quick responses from the masses and help rally the people around the party and make them act according to party policies and lines. Those policies guarantee both the common interests of the collective and the personal interests of each member of society. In addition to correct policies, it is necessary to conduct propaganda activities, organize implementation, draw experiences, and make amendments to keep those policies more consistent with real life situations. Furthermore, it is very important for the party organization, cadres, and party members to maintain firmly their political qualifications and socialist orientations. Therefore, it is necessary to consolidate grassroots party organizations and make them pure, firm, and strong so they can assume an overall leadership role in the new stage. [Van Dinh] Thank you, comrade.
