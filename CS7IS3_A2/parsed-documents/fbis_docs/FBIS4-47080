Uzbekistan devotes considerable attention to the problems of developing diverse ties with Japan, which is considered to be one of the most highly developed countries in the world. Japan in turn considers our republic to be a state with which mutually advantageous cooperation would be worthwhile. The history of cultural ties between our peoples extends far into the past, but diplomatic relations were not established between Japan and independent Uzbekistan until early 1993. An embassy of this country is now operating in Tashkent. On the eve of Islam Karimov's visit to Tokyo, this UzA correspondent asked a number of questions of Ukeru Magosaki, the Japanese ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the Republic of Uzbekistan. [Mirzo] Mr. Ambassador, 7 June will be exactly a year from the time that you presented your credentials to the president of our republic. What work has been done since then to develop cooperation between our countries? [Magosaki] What I find most gratifying is that talks are proceeding successfully in a diversity directions. I'm referring to visits by more than 20 delegations to Uzbekistan consisting of specialists from different sectors of the Japanese economy, and at long last, the official visit to be made to our country by President Islam Karimov. Japan is preparing to receive him at the highest level. Your methods of managing the economy are highly valued by the Japanese. In particular, one of your principles of establishing a market economy is that economic reforms are initiated and implemented by the state. We ourselves passed through this phase some time ago as well. We know from our own experience that it is impossible to achieve positive changes in the economy in the first stage without a plan and without unified leadership. [Mirzo] Please tell us briefly about the political changes in your country. [Magosaki] Until recently there were two major parties of a capitalist and a socialist orientation in Japan, which waged a struggle for power. The end of the cold war had a positive effect upon Japan's foreign and domestic policy. The struggle between the two parties faded into the past. Our country is now adhering to a new direction in domestic policy, one based on a multiparty system. From this day forward the government is to be headed by a unified coalition bringing together all parties in the country. Of course, change in the composition of this coalition is a fully natural phenomenon in the transitional period. You are aware that Tsutomu Hata was recently elected prime minister in place of Morihiro Hosakawa, who recently retired. New ministers have been appointed. My hope is that the newly formed government will work productively in behalf of progress in our country, and to raise the welfare of our people. [Mirzo] What is the new government's attitude toward states of Central Asia, and particular toward development of relations with Uzbekistan? [Magosaki] Japan is perpetually concerned with problems of mutual relations with Central Asian states. Our prime minister understands well the significance of Central Asian states because, among other things, he had worked previously in the office of foreign affairs minister. The fact that our new government made its first official invitation to the president of Uzbekistan, Mr. Islam Karimov, is clear evidence of this. [Mirzo] What can you say about the forthcoming visit by the head of Uzbekistan to Japan? [Magosaki] The visit to Japan by the leader of your republic will doubtlessly open up new possibilities for industrialists, bankers, and businessmen of our country. We anticipate signing of intergovernment documents in a number of areas of bilateral cooperation. During his visit President Islam Karimov will conduct talks with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, and he will be received by Emperor Akihito. In Japan, Mr. Islam Karimov is known not only as the president of the Uzbek Republic but also as one of the region's major political figures. We are very interested in the opinion of your country's president regarding the current situation in Central Asia, Uzbekistan's mutual relations with Russia, the situation in Tajikistan and Afghanistan, and Islamic fundamentalism. Consequently the Japanese are impatiently waiting to meet Islam Karimov as an authoritative and experience politician capable of objectively assessing the situation. [Mirzo] Mr. Ambassador, our compatriots have a rather full understanding of your country and its people. But what do Japanese know about Uzbekistan, about Uzbeks? [Magosaki] As you yourself said, our diplomatic relations were established around a year ago. However, the knots of cooperation between Japan and your country were tied back in the 7th and 8th centuries. Friendly ties between our peoples were established in that distant past through the Great Silk Route. It is no surprise that during his trip to Japan Islam Karimov will visit our emperor's personal museum, which contains unique articles associated with the Great Silk Route, and ancient relics left to us by your ancestors. Uzbeks are known in Japan as an ancient people whose roots extend deep into the past, as a people with a great future.
