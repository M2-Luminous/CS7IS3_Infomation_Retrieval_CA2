FR941003-0-00067 FR941003-0-00013 (3) If the applicant claims exclusivity under §314.108(b)(2), information to show that, to the best of its knowledge or belief, a drug has not previously been approved under section 505(b) of the act containing any active moiety in the drug for which the applicant is seeking approval. (4) If the applicant claims exclusivity under §314.108(b)(4) or (b)(5), the following information to show that the application contains ``new clinical investigations'' that are ``essential to approval of the application or supplement'' and were ``conducted or sponsored by the applicant:'' (i) ``New clinical investigations. '' A certification that to the best of the applicant's knowledge each of the clinical investigations included in the application meets the definition of ``new clinical investigation'' set forth in §314.108(a). (ii) ``Essential to approval.'' A list of all published studies or publicly available reports of clinical investigations known to the applicant through a literature search that are relevant to the conditions for which the applicant is seeking approval, a certification that the applicant has thoroughly searched the scientific literature and, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, the list is complete and accurate and, in the applicant's opinion, such published studies or publicly available reports do not provide a sufficient basis for the approval of the conditions for which the applicant is seeking approval without reference to the new clinical investigation(s) in the application, and an explanation as to why the studies or reports are insufficient. (iii) ``Conducted or sponsored by.'' If the applicant was the sponsor named in the Form FDA&hyph;1571 for an investigational new drug application (IND) under which the new clinical investigation(s) that is essential to the approval of its application was conducted, identification of the IND by number. If the applicant was not the sponsor of the IND under which the clinical investigation(s) was conducted, a certification that the applicant or its predecessor in interest provided substantial support for the clinical investigation(s) that is essential to the approval of its application, and information supporting the certification. To demonstrate ``substantial support,'' an applicant must either provide a certified statement from a certified public accountant that the applicant provided 50 percent or more of the cost of conducting the study or provide an explanation of why FDA should consider the applicant to have conducted or sponsored the study if the applicant's financial contribution to the study is less than 50 percent or the applicant did not sponsor the investigational new drug. A predecessor in interest is an entity, e.g., a corporation, that the applicant has taken over, merged with, or purchased, or from which the applicant has purchased all rights to the drug. Purchase of nonexclusive rights to a clinical investigation after it is completed is not sufficient to satisfy this definition. * * * * * 3.
