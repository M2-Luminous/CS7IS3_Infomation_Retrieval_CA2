Asked to comment on his critical attitude towards the opposition, expressed yesterday on television, Snegur replied: "Critical attitude? Have you understood that the critical attitude at yesterday's broadcast was addressed to the opposition? Very well." Asked "can there be any free elections while Dniester is occupied by the 14th Army," the president said "it is a real situation we have at this moment. However, we believe that in the Republic of Moldova elections take place for the first time on the basis of democracy and pluripartitism. In what regards Dniester, the executive took a series of measures to allow citizens in this part of the republic take part in the voting. Nevertheless, if we would be thinking only of this, I mean wait first for the final solution of the Dniester problem and only after that run the elections, we would halt other urgent measures. It is necessary first of all to have a parliament that would contribute to the most urgent solution of Dniester's problem." Snegur declared that yesterday's release of persons who organized the October rebellion in Moscow "is an internal problem of Russians and they will manage without us." Inquired if it is significant that he voted in a Russian school, President Snegur said "with us, electoral sectors, like the lodging place, are not established on ethnic principles. I live in the immediate vicinity of this voting section." Asked by the BASAPRESS reporter about how will things evolve in case there will be no prevailing majority in parliament, Snegur estimated that "it is hard to suppose, but I believe a new hard process will start, with attempts of conciliation and cooperation firstly between parliament factions, then between parliament and presidency. It would be good, however, if we had a majority faction in parliament." Asked why he voted so early and if, in his opinion, enough voters will follow his example, Snegur said "elections will run in an organized manner and with an active participation of electors, and the fact that I came to vote in the very morning is due to my responsibility and because my today's agenda includes many questions. On the other hand, the most pleasant moment for me is meeting my nephew whom I can see only on Sundays."
