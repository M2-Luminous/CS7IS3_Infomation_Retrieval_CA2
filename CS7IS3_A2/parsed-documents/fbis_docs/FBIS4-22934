E. Bauman. That is the unanimous conclusion reached by participants in a joint session of the boards of the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy and the State Committee for Higher Education of Russia. This was a field session which was held at the Bauman Institute because it examined the problem of use of the scientific potential of the oldest technical school of higher education in the country. The Bauman Institute--today a technical university--needs no special introduction: almost all the creators of aviation and rocket-space technology have graduated from its walls. But not many probably know that the Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute, Moscow Aviation Institute and Moscow Systems Research Institute (as well as many other institutions of higher education) are ``daughter'' enterprises of the Bauman Institute. Today the technical university is experiencing difficult times. A sharp reduction in budgeted financing and orders for scientific research development work (during the last 3-4 years orders have decreased by a factor of 4-6) urgently dictate that additional measures be taken for preserving the scientific potential of the university, its scientific schools and the material-technical base. Incidentally, the latter by many criteria is unique. This applies, in particular, to the academic-experimental center of the university in Dmitrovskiy Rayon of the capital region, which in essence has today become a scientific city. The understanding that a further lag in the development of science and education is fraught with irretrievable losses for society is today determining, as was noted by Igor Fedorov, academician ANS, rector of the Moscow State Technical University, in a conversation with a ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent, the principal directions in the development of scientific research in the university and its activity as a whole. The guests were shown an exhibit displaying the latest development work by the scientists and specialists of the Bauman Institute. Among the new materials and technologies, instruments and machines there are more than a few which are unique. For example, a robotized complex, better than its foreign analogues, has proven its worth in work on elimination of the consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
