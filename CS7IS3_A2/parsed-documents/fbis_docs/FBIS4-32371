"Over the past few years our relations have been normal, without any tensions or problems, although the contacts at various levels have not been very intense," the chief of the Polish diplomacy said. "Poland wishes that our countries could give a more substantial core to their bilateral cooperation, mainly in the economic sphere. One must openly admit that in this respect Polish-Romanian cooperation is dissatisfactory, and that we must act together towards improving this state of things. That is why Mr. Melescanu and I shall sign two important agreements that will ensure the legal background apt to dynamism the economic exchanges. We shall also sign a cultural agreement. The dialogue Poland and Romania are having can be very important in the context of the general search for means to ensure security and stability in our region. Our countries have both signed the documents of the Partnership for Peace. I am sure this is a good basis for a fruitful exchange of views and swap of experience in this field too."
