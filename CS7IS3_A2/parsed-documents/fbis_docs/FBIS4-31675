They are all dressed in the same uniforms, their shirts are usually "civilian," and they wear handknit sweaters--probably made by their mothers or wives. Those Muslim fighters want to return to their families as soon as possible. Although they rarely talk about revenge, they reject any negotiations that would take away their land and houses. The commander of the Blue Helmets in Sarajevo, Andre Soubirou, recently described the Muslim fighters as "an army of townspeople, partisans," who are fighting against "Serbian professional soldiers." "It is the armed populace, as Tito envisioned and wanted it," stated a certain military member of the UN Protection Forces. Thirty-two-year-old Kemal Hodzic was a driver before the outbreak of the war, and now he commands a company on Mount Kocar, which lies southeast of Tuzla, where the Muslim units carried out a lightning offensive. He is from Bratunac, a village approximately 30 kilometers away, which was "cleansed" by the Serbs in May 1992. His mother and father were murdered by the Serbs, and his wife and 10-year-old daughter fled to Tuzla. Soldier Rafa Dzufic is fighting on the first front line near Tuzla, in the vicinity of the strategic corridor near Brcko. The ruins of his house are only about 200 meters away; he returned from Austria "to defend his family and relatives." Twenty-nine-year-old Nadja Otici from Brcko can only observe the fields and roofs of his birthplace from a distance. He does not hide his feelings. The front line is at the end of a valley, and for more than a year he has not had any news about his family. Hakia Hodzik, likewise 29 years old, was an officer in the former Yugoslav Army. Now he commands the First Muslim Brigade on Mount Podrina, and he also conducted an offensive near Kladanj. Like all the others, he is also a volunteer, who fled from the valley along the Drina together with his fellow townsmen before the Serbian ethnic cleansing. One of his soldiers acknowledges: "We will fight to the last man. We want our land back. We will stop only when the bank of the Drina is ours again." The Drina marks the border between Bosnia and Serbia, and all the Muslims have been driven out of the villages that lie along the river. The area is now in Serbian hands, and the self-styled republic of Srpska is not prepared to give it back. "We will not accept any diplomatic solution that will dictate to us that we have to give up our land," Kemal says. He resolutely adds: "We will remain armed and we will fight." His fellow fighters also agree with him; they reject the politicians' attempts to persuade them to accept a "realistic" solution. The commanders of the units in this area complain that they do not have modern weaponry, with which they could have saved many of their fighters' lives. They can only attack the armored Serbian units with obsolete antitank shells. Farmers usually bring them food and ammunition with teams of horses. "Every four days we get a loaf of white bread, and otherwise we only eat black bread," said a gaunt soldier who is no more than 20 years old. He interrupted his studies during the Bosnian war, but he hopes that he will someday become a machinery engineer.
