In a press release today, Mr. Taylor said while the NPFL is fully aware that the LPC is not a party to the Cotonou Peace Accord, yet because of the love he has for the Liberian people and his desire for peace and national reconciliation, a delegation will leave Gbarnga shortly to hold discussions in Monrovia. The NPFL leader is, therefore, urging the special representative to Liberia and head of UNOMIL [UN Observer Mission to Liberia], Ambassador Gordon-Somers, to provide full security protection and sponsorship for the ensuing talks.
