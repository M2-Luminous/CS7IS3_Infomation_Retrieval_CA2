The head of the president's press service Azim Ibraimov told INTERFAX that the finance minister's resignation was the first instance of an uncompromising decision with regard to a cabinet member. In his view, this was an example of the government's resolution to tighten state discipline over fiscal matters in use against officials who, regardless of their rank, had raised their own level of responsibility beyond that permissible by law. Ibraimov pointed out that when the new premier Apas Dzhumagulov came to power, "the process of purging the state personnel system began in earnest." He also said that K. Shakirov used his authority among government members "as a sufficiently well-versed and competent professional financier, who knew his business." However, "weakness of character led him to violate procedure and abuse his authorities and, succumbing to family loyalties, the finance minister issued a loan to his own son-in-law," Ibraimov said.
