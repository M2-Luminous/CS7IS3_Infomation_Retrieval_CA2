[passage omitted] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid hailed those present, and expressed his congratulations on the occasion of the Islamic New Year. [passage omitted] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said that the declaration of the establishment of the Republic was made three weeks after the beginning of the war, and the northern insistence on effecting an occupation, so that citizens had to defend their Republic and its sovereignty. He said: It was they who imposed the war, but they cannot impose surrender on us, because they lack the capacity to do so. He stressed the need to hail the resistance, reject the occupation, have faith in victory, defend the Republic, reject silence in the face of injustice, and defend the solidarity of the front, because we have right on our side. He stressed that the Yemeni Socialist Party did not envisage ruling on its own, because it believed in pluralism, with the participation of the various parties, all personalities in society, all individuals of goodwill, patriotic shaykhs, and all who love this Republic and struggle for its sake. The brother chairman of the Presidential Council said: We are now experiencing another stage imposed on us after 25 [number as heard] years since independence and now, once again, we are struggling for our independence. We are struggling to stop the influence of this gang from penetrating these regions, because they are committing crimes, abominations, and pillage. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid lauded the heroic steadfastness of the citizens of Aden, the citizens in general, and the Armed Forces and security forces on the various battlefronts. He noted that the comprehensive recognition of the establishment of the Republic would accrue from this steadfastness and determination, because our forces spring from our people. [passage omitted] He stressed that we Yemenis will not agree to be fourth class citizens, because we are fighters who created a democratic Yemen by making sacrifices. [passage omitted] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid called on the sons of Hadhramaut Governorate to step up their mobilization and strengthen their ranks, in order to fight this invasion. He noted that historically, in the 17th century, such resistance prevailed in Hadhramaut when invaders reached Dhofar during the reign of Imam al-Mutawakkil ala'Allah Isma'il. Then they withdrew from Dhofar to the sea, and were never able to return. He said: Today you will also drive out these invaders from Hadhramaut. We shall not permit ourselves to be governed by the al-Ahmar family and the fundamentalists. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: We in our country know our history and our past, and we take pride in our history. We shall work together with all our brothers in the DRY to protect the Republic and its capital, Aden. We shall improve our situation and build ourselves up to be better than we were. We shall open our windows and our relations with all the people of the world, in the peninsula, and in the gulf. The meeting was attended by Brother Awad 'Abdallah Murshidi, secretary of Hadhramaut Governorate.
