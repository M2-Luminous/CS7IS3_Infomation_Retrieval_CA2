FR940511-0-00056 FR940511-0-00015 Section 307 of the MPRSA allows NOAA to assess civil penalties as high as $100,000 for each violation. In addition, monies collected under the MPRSA are available for use by the National Marine Sanctuary Program. Comment: The MBTA would not allow any taking of migratory birds in the sanctuary, thus providing even stronger prohibition than sanctuary status can provide. Response: See above response. Section 925.5(a)(6) of the Sanctuary regulations prohibits the taking of migratory birds within the Sanctuary. Including a prohibition on ``taking'' marine birds in the Sanctuary regulations allows such violations to be subject to the civil penalties authorized by the MPRSA which far exceed those authorized by the MBTA. Comment: Prohibit all takings of marine mammals and seabirds, regardless of military or fishing exemptions. Response: Section 925.5(a)(6) of the Sanctuary regulations prohibits the taking of marine mammals and seabirds in or above the Sanctuary except as authorized by the NMFS or the United States Fish and Wildlife Service under the authority of the MMPA, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq., the ESA, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq., and the MBTA, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 703 et seq., or pursuant to any treaty with an Indian tribe to which the United States is a party, provided that the treaty right is exercised in accordance with the MMPA, ESA, and MBTA, to the extent that they apply. Exemptions include a limited five-year incidental take of marine mammals provided by interim regulations promulgated pursuant to the MMPA, which are in effect until October, 1993. The ESA also has a limited incidental take exemption. See 16 U.S.C. section 1539(a)(2)B(i). NMFS, in conjunction with environmental groups and the fishing industry, is developing a permanent management regime to be implemented upon expiration of the MMPA interim regulations. If in the future NOAA determines that the existing regulations promulgated under MMPA, ESA, MBTA or any other state or Federal statute are not adequate to ensure the coordinated and comprehensive management of marine mammals and seabirds, changes to the Sanctuary regulations would be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the MPRSA, NEPA and APA. Comment: Exclude from [takings] prohibition birds considered game. Response: The only birds ยง925.5(a)(6) prohibits the taking of are seabirds_seabirds are not considered game species. Comment: Section 925.5(a)(6) of the proposed regulations would prohibit the taking of marine mammals or seabirds unless affirmatively permitted by regulations promulgated under authority of the ESA, MMPA, or MBTA. Because these regulations do not expressly permit any takings by treaty Indians, the proposed sanctuary regulations would effectively prohibit the Makah Tribe from exercising their treaty rights to take marine mammals. The proposed regulations would also hinder the tribe's ability to exercise its fishing rights by precluding fisheries which result in the incidental taking of marine mammals and seabirds. The DEIS/MP offers no conservation justification for imposing restrictions on the taking of marine mammals and seabirds which go beyond the restrictions imposed by the ESA and MMPA. The DEIS/MP concedes that the purpose of the proposed sanctuary regulations is not to protect particular species from extinction. According to the DEIS, the purpose of these additional prohibitions in the proposed regulations is to ``extend protection for sanctuary resources on an environmentally holistic basis.'' This goal does not permit infringement of treaty rights. Therefore, the regulations should be amended by adding ``or in accordance with any treaty to which the United States is a party.'' Response: The regulatory prohibitions do not abrogate or obstruct any rights under an existing treaty. The regulations have been changed by adding ``or pursuant to any treaty with an Indian tribe to which the United States is a party, provided that the treaty right is exercised in accordance with the MMPA, ESA and MBTA, to the extent that they apply.'' The treaty between the Makah Tribe and the United States explicitly assures the ``right of taking fish and of whaling or sealing at usual accustomed grounds and stations.'' (Article 4, Treaty of Neah Bay, 1855). Incidental takes of marine mammals can legally occur under permit and exemption provisions of the MMPA. Currently, Washington coastal tribes apply for and receive exemption certificates from NMFS for the incidental taking of marine mammals during fishing. Fees for this exemption are waived for tribes. Further, tribes cannot be denied entry into any fishery based on the likelihood or occurrence of seabird or marine mammal takings. Comment: Change the wording of the regulation to read ``as authorized or permitted by NMFS or [the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service] USFWS under the authority of the MMPA and ESA.'' NMFS suggests that the preamble and/or regulations clarify that Sanctuary permits will not be required for activities authorized or permitted by NMFS or USFWS under MMPA or ESA. Such clarification would relieve many concerns over the possibility of overlapping and potentially duplicative permitting requirements.
