The soldiers will begin independent patrols on the streets of the oblast center from the middle of February. Our correspondent is discussing the manpower acquisition problems with the unit commander, Yuriy Bondazhevskiy. [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Yuriy Alekseyevich, I know that the personnel situation is quite strained at the moment; what is the situation in your unit? How is the recruiting progressing? In recent times, there has been no one left to serve. [Bondazhevskiy] That is a fact; 1993 has been a difficult year in respect of personnel and in fact we have only been at 50 percent strength. Currently, the situation is significantly better and the units are 96 percent manned. The situation with contract manpower acquisition is a bit more complicated. However, there are a number of objective reasons for this, the first of which is housing conditions. Despite the internal troops manpower acquisition principle that they are to be from outside the territory and are to serve for three or four years, it has become fashionable to serve in the area where one lives, which is a gross breach of the statute on internal troops. If we take the 1992-93 figures, practically 90 percent of the unit was comprised of local servicemen. At present, 56 percent of the young recruits from the 1993 fall call up come from the Petropavlovsk city and Kamchatka Oblast Voyenkomats [Military Commissariat]. We see a solution to this situation in the following: carry out an exchange of personnel with other similar units located in the Far East. That is, the basic task, namely, guarding public order suffers because the majority of local servicemen are serving in local units. Use of local manpower leaves its mark, which is evident if we compare 1992 with 1991. Despite the number of personnel remaining the same there was a change in their quality, due to local content -- service effectiveness and quality of service declined substantially. [Correspondent] The presence of militiamen on duty on the streets is not noticeable at present, yet you say that units are 96 percent up to strength. [Bondazhevskiy] Yes, the fall-intake recruits are undergoing their basic training course. It is almost completed and in the course of the next two or three days they will be doing their examinations. Subsequently, they will be allocated to units where they will begin their independent duties. [end recording]
