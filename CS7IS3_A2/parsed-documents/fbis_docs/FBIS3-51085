Perez Yoma made this remark to a television station. He indicated that it is a question of principles because the coalition [Coalition of Parties for Democracy] believes the Armed Forces' leadership must be subordinate to civilian authorities. But he stated that this type of reform needs a broad consensus, and therefore he believes there will be no action on the topic in the short term. Perez Yoma said the topic "is neither first nor a priority," although he expressed his hope that "we can convince the rest of the Chilean people and the Armed Forces" that the power to remove the commander in chief must be returned to the president.
