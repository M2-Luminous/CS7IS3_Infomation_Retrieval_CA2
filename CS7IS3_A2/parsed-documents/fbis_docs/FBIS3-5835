The UNDCP highland integrated rural development project started the three week-long trial with support from a medical back-up team from the northern drug dependence treatment centre in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Twenty-one addicts voluntarily enrolled at the new unit in Nam Khian village, Pha Lavek, to take gradually reduced levels of twice- daily administered opium tincture. Medical check-ups, vocational training, and social activities are also part of the programme. The participants in the detoxification programme are accompanied by community health workers from their own village who will continue to assist with rehabilitation upon their return home. The team from Thailand, led by Dr. Charun Chittiwuthikan, is providing training for health workers in detoxification procedures, including the proper dosing of opium addicts to minimise withdrawal symptoms. Village elders and government officials joined project staff and the community for the detoxification programme's opening ceremony. A village "shaman" and a "witch doctor" performed traditional ritual at the new unit, including discarding used opium pipes into a nearby stream. Specially composed songs in the Hmong language warning of the perils of opium dependency were sung, and prizes for children's anti-opium art and a poetry competition were presented. Within the project area there are estimated to be 97 addicts of whom 70 have said they want to end their drug dependency. There are an estimated 40,000 addicts living in the Lao PDR. Many of the addicts said they had become opium dependent after taking the drug for a health problem and now wanted to give up the habit mainly for economic reasons. UNDCP's highland integrated rural development project, which started in July 1989, is implementing development activities to create economic and social conditions which eliminate the need to grow opium for commercial purposes. Establishing an efficient and effective community based health care system is an integral part of the project.
