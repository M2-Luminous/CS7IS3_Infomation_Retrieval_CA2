Speaking to reporters in Doha on Saturday [22 January], he said Iran as a powerful country which plays a major role in preservation of security and tranquility in the region, is ready to cooperate with regional countries. He stressed that withdrawal of foreign forces and fleet from the Persian Gulf waters not only would not harm security in the region but would rather reinforce it. Referring to Iran-UAE dispute, Besharati said the two neighbors could settle their dispute over one of the Persian Gulf islands through negotiations and remarked that Iran had repeatedly voiced readiness in this connection. He further noted that interference of foreign countries should not be interpreted as their concern for security, adding that Iran would never interfere in the affairs of regional countries. On fabrications made by some western media on human rights violation in Iran, the minister said those in fact were supporting terrorists who were involved in the massacre of many Iranian senior officials and civilians. He regretted fratricide in Afghanistan and noted that Iran, like other Muslim countries, had made diplomatic efforts to establish peace and tranquility in that country and assured that the dispute could be solved through negotiations.
