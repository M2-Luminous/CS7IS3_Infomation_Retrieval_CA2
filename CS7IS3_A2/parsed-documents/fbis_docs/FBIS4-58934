Al-Shaqaqi made this observation in an interview with Linda Sherzer in Damascus last week. He contends that he does not know where Ron Arad is being held today. Here is Linda Sherzer's report from Syria: [Begin recording] [Sherzer] Before Fathi al-Shaqaqi was expelled from the Gaza Strip, he was considered one of the most dangerous people there. In his office in Damascus, he proudly explains the reason: [Al-Shaqaqi] From October '86 to October '87, we killed from the Israeli soldiers more than all the other factions inside Palestine. [Sherzer] [passage omitted] You have travelled through the Arab world. Do you know anything about the fate of the missing Israeli servicemen? [Al-Shaqaqi] You know, I think all the Israeli soldiers, except Ron Arad, are dead. [Sherzer] Do you know that for a fact? [Al-Shaqaqi] Yes, for a fact. [Sherzer] Nowadays he and his wife and two children live in Damascus. He teaches his four-year-old daughter about the Palestinian cause. In his opinion, the Gaza-Jericho agreement is a disaster.
