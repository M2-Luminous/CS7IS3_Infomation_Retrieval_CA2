Vinicio Villar Anleu, legislature president, has estimated the damage at 100,000 quetzales, adding this will entail expenses at a time when it is necessary to make efforts to get the country ahead. Deputy Clodoveo Dominguez has said the person directly responsible for this situation is President de Leon Carpio, who has made statements that apparently seek a confrontation with the sole purpose of progressing with his referendum. Independent Deputies Jose Carlos Acevedo and Miguel Angel Montepeque have also blamed President de Leon Carpio for this act of violence, because he warned in his recent statements he was willing to take measures, which he did not specify, should the referendum fail. The center's Arturo Amiel has said the president is responsible, because he is delivering statements that incite destabilization and he is showing he is incapable of maintaining security in the country. Christian Democrat Enrique Guillen Funes has described President de Leon Carpio as a spoiled child who is making statements without thinking what the repercussions these may have, and--what is worse-- he is setting aside his role as the statesman he claims to be. Congressman Francisco Reyes Lopez, from the Guatemalan Republican Front, has expressed regret that at this time, when we are trying to have a referendum, someone is trying to mar the situation with threats that, as in this case, are used by any group or sector to create unrest. Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla Vega has said the bomb attack is a way of stopping and frightening Congress, and therefore the president should determine the origin of the attack. Representative Eduardo Matute feels this action seeks to incite the population to rise up against Congress, and therefore it is an outrage against Congress. Several deputies have agreed the government's lack of capability to guarantee the security of Guatemalans became evident once again with the terrorist attack executed early yesterday morning against the Legislative Palace. The center's Mario Mazariegos has said that unfortunately now-- when it is very close to the referendum--various sectors are interested in creating problems, and they are taking advantage of the situation, while the government is incapable of implementing a security operation to guarantee Guatemalans' lives and calmness. Mazariegos has warned the conditions prevailing in the country apparently seek to lead Guatemalans to chaos, with the only purpose of marring Congress' prestige. Independent representative Eduardo Matute has said the attack carried out against a group of people in an area of 18th Street, central zone, reflects that the security forces are incapable of guaranteeing citizens' peace and security. Meanwhile, Juan Francisco Alfaro Mijangos, Congress third vice president, has said: "We must admit that the lack of experience of those who are in the government is leading the country to chaos due to the lack of coordinated programs such as in the case of public security." He concluded: "Consequently, we realize we are at the mercy of any group of power or any sector interested in creating chaos, a situation that seems to worsen as we get closer to the referendum." President Ramiro de Leon Carpio is leading the country to chaos, political leader Rodolfo Rosales Garcia Salas said today when commenting on what he described as an "unprecedented institutional crisis." He added that trying to solve that problem with a referendum is what unfortunately justifies the terrorist wave, which has caused so far only damage to shops and public buildings. He added that even though the terrorist actions are rejected by all--as they endanger the lives of innocent people--President de Leon Carpio is responsible for the situation of instability, because he does not have the qualities of a statesman for ruling. Rosales Garcia-Salas has assured that the constitutional reforms proposed by the president do not satisfy the people's needs, as these reforms are the product of settlements with deputies who have betrayed the confidence the people gave them, he concluded.
