ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Agricultural Marketing Service, United States Department of Agriculture, proposes to revise its regulations in 7 CFR Part 110, governing recordkeeping of federally restricted use pesticides by certified applicators. The regulations governing recordkeeping of federally restricted use pesticides by certified applicators were published on April 9, 1993, and became effective on May 10, 1993. Since that time, issues have been raised regarding the regulations. A lawsuit was filed challenging the substance of limited portions of the regulations. The changes specified in the proposed rule would clarify certain provisions of the regulations, ensure consistency with the objectives of section 1491 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, and provide for a more pragmatic approach to the implementation of the Pesticide Recordkeeping Program. DATES: Comments must be received on or before June 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments concerning this proposal should be sent to Bonnie L. Poli, Docket Manager, USDA&hyph;AMS, Science Division, 8700 Centreville Road, suite 200, Manassas, Virginia 22110, and should refer to the docket title and number located in the heading of this document. All comments submitted in response to this proposal will be available for public inspection in Room 3507, South Agriculture Building, 14th & Independence Avenues, SW., between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bonnie Poli, Chief, Pesticide Records Branch, Science Division, AMS, 8700 Centreville Road, suite 200, Manassas, VA 22110, 703&hyph;330&hyph;7826. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule has been determined to be non-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by OMB. This proposed rule also has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq. ). This proposed rule will (1) clarify certain definitions within the regulations; (2) clarify the availability of pesticide record information to facilitate medical treatment or first aid; (3) clarify the utilization and release of pesticide record information by licensed health care professionals; (4) modify the time period by which the information required by the regulations shall be officially recorded, and (5) ensure uniformity in recording the location of pesticide applications by removing the distinction between recording spot applications and other applications of federally restricted use pesticides. We do not anticipate that any of these proposed changes will result in any significant additional economic impact on certified (private and commercial) applicators of federally restricted use pesticides. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If adopted, this proposed rule: (1) Will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule; (2) will not have any retroactive effect; and (3) will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507), the recordkeeping provisions included in this proposed rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), number 0581&hyph;0164. The proposed rule does not change the data elements required for a record or the collection of information.
