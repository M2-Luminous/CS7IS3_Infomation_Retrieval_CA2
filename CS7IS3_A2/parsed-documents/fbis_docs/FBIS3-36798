The people of Ukraine have great esteem for the friendly Lithuanian nation with which we share ancient historical ties dating back to ancient times. Our relations trace their roots from the times of Kiev Rus which played a significant role in the establishment of Lithuania. In its turn, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania helped Ukrainians to a great extent in preserving their traditions, language, and religion, and keeping the original culture of our people from extinction. It was during that period close ties between our states and our people originated, now adopting a new nature. Who knows whether linguists are right in asserting a similarity between our languages? But when we hear the melodious Lithuanian language, it is indeed reminiscent of our native Ukrainian. At any rate, the name Kravchuk in Ukraine is usually followed alphabetically by names like Lytvyn, Lytvynchuk, and the like. A notable event in the history of our relations was the peace treaty between Ukraine and Lithuania signed in 1921, according to which the then Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Lithuanian Democratic Republic recognized each other's sovereignty and independence. A qualitatively new stage in the relations between our countries began in 1991, after Ukraine and Lithuania acquired state independence. It is symbolic that Ukraine was among the first to recognize Lithuania as an independent state, while Lithuania was among the first to recognize Ukraine's political independence. We attach priority significance to our relations with the Lithuanian republic. They benefit not only from the old historical ties, but also from the common positions and views shared by our countries on a wide range of international and regional issues. A factor which brings our people closer is the presence of a large Ukrainian community in Lithuania. I would like to take advantage of this opportunity and express through the esteemed Lithuanian Seimas our deep gratitude to the Lithuanian people, the president and the government of Lithuania for the attention they give to the national and cultural needs of Ukrainians. Lithuania is one of Ukraine's biggest trade partners. However, the development of trade and economic ties between our states has not yet achieved its full potential. Ukraine and Lithuania could cooperate to mutual advantage in practically any area. This includes export of ore, coal, coke, rolled metal and metal products, electronic technology, and machine-building products from Ukraine. For its part, Ukraine expects to receive various products from Lithuania including consumer goods such as footwear and clothing, as well as products of the chemical and the electronic industries. We have broad possibilities for cooperation in the area of transport. For example, Ukraine is interested in having access to the Baltic Sea and at the same time Lithuania could use the potential of Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea. I cannot omit to mention the broad perspectives for the development of cultural cooperation between our countries that have ancient traditions. It was here in Vilnius that Taras Shevchenko, the great Ukrainian poet, artist and thinker, took his first steps in art and literature. Lesya Ukrayinka, the distinguished Ukrainian poetess, was in the famous resort of Druskininkai. And the eminent Lithuanian poet Jonas Maironis worked in Kiev. In my opinion we are obliged not only to preserve these traditions but to multiply them in every possible way and pass them on from one generation to another. In the period that has passed, a great legal foundation was laid on bilateral relations between our two states along diplomatic channels. Today we will sign a treaty on friendship and cooperation with President Brazauskas and I am convinced that it will open a new stage in the development of equal and friendly relations between our states. There is much that unites our peoples. Unfortunately, today we have common problems. The transition to a market economy is quite a difficult and often painful process and we have felt this. However, Ukraine and I am convinced that Lithuania also, have consciously chosen this path and we will move step-by-step, by means of economic reform and interaction and one state helping another. We are gradually carrying out privatization and demonopolization, are putting in order the financial and banking system and have adopted a program of anti-inflationary measures. Obviously, we have not managed to do all this quickly and effectively. There are factors, both internal and external, that stimulate this process and there are objective and subjective factors. Despite this we regard the future with optimism and are convinced that with time we will overcome these difficult times and these difficult processes because there is no other alternative. We hope to have mutually beneficial cooperation with all other states including with the Republic of Lithuania. Our emerging from the economic crisis will significantly speed up this process. As the Lithuanian popular saying goes, more is done when two people are at work. Both Ukraine and Lithuania were always considered to be European states and we link our future with the new Europe and for this reason we aspire to be integrated with the European political, economic and other structures. Ukraine views positively the partnership for peace programme which was recently adopted at a NATO session in Brussels. We consider that an important step has been made in the area of building a new system of general European security and bringing Eastern Europe closer to the West. In connection with this, we welcome the signing of this important document by the Republic of Lithuania and on our part we are preparing to carry out corresponding measures in the near future. Today our minister of foreign affairs is in Brussels. From the point of view of the mentioned special urgency, in our opinion Ukraine could put forward an initiative on the creation of a zone of stability and security in the Central and Eastern European region which would include all the countries of the Baltic and Black Sea region. It is possible that this initiative to some extent coincides with other projects regarding the general European security system. In its declaration of state sovereignty, Ukraine proclaimed its intention to adopt a non-nuclear status, thus becoming the first state to voluntarily give up the nuclear arms it inherited. By this, it proved once again the peaceful nature of its foreign policy aimed at defusing tension in Europe and the entire world. An important step towards strengthening of international security and stability was the recent signing by Ukraine, the United States and Russia of a trilateral statement which envisages elimination of the nuclear arms deployed on the territory of Ukraine. Esteemed ladies and gentlemen! Our peoples had to suffer bitter times and injustice on their road to freedom and independence. But in spite of that, we are building our statehood, reviving national culture and spirituality, we and look to the future with hope. I am convinced that this can be greatly helped by the development of friendly and mutually beneficial relations between Ukraine and the Lithuanian Republic, and by constant contact between the leadership of our countries, including that at the top level. In conclusion, I would like to wish the esteemed Seimas fruitful work, and the friendly Lithuanian people - happiness, peace and prosperity on the road of independent development. I sincerely hope that relations between our states will develop and strengthen for the benefit of our peoples. Thank you for your attention.
