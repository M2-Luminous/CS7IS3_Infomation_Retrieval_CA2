Political and Economic Instability in Russia Complicates Cooperation With the West"] [Text] From the purely formal point of view, relations between the long-standing opponents in the "cold" war in Europe -- the Soviet (now Russian) army and NATO -- have changed substantially. Merely a few years ago, in 1989, the two gigantic groupings were confronting each other, ready to fight. In spite of all talk about "new" thinking, both sides continued to build up their military might, while the disturbances in the GDR, which preceded the fall of the Berlin wall, could, it seemed, have put both sides on the verge of a large war, just like during the earlier Berlin crises of 1949 and 1961. Now the new Russia and NATO are "partners," almost allies, "for peace." Reciprocal official and working visits by military delegations have become so common that they do not arouse great interest. This week, for instance, German Army General von Ondarza, commander of NATO Allied Armed Forces in the Central European War Theater, arrived in Moscow. The visit, however, is of a fairly nostalgic character: this war theater as such does not exist any longer; von Ondarza is resigning while the prospects for the future of the hitherto most powerful NATO forces in Central Europe are quite dire -- the enemy is gone, apparently for a long time, if not forever. At present the remnants of the combat effective units of the Russian troop grouping are being pulled out of Germany and all that will remain by spring will be the 6th Berlin Brigade, designed exclusively for military ceremonies, and some rear and special services. By August the withdrawal of the Russian troops will be completed. Both NATO and the Russian Defense Ministry are now looking for a new raison d'etre for their coexistence on the same continent. General Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian General Staff, told General von Ondarza that "we are now studying with great interest the Partnership for Peace program: it contains some sound ideas." The text of an agreement on a program of cooperation between NATO and the Russian Federation Defense Ministry has been prepared and in fact is ready for signing. Russia is interested in closer interaction with NATO in the area of planning, organizing, preparing, and conducting peacekeeping operations and above all, in according the peacekeeping battalions -- the 27th Motorized Rifle Division in the Dniester Region, a battalion in South Ossetia, and the 201st Motorized Rifle Division in Tajikistan -- a more "reliable" international legal status (as UN or CSCE forces). NATO member states, however, concerned by the results of the 12 December elections and the danger of the "revival of Russian imperialism," do not intend to oblige Russia on this issue. Generally, any practical moves toward implementing the Partnership for Peace program are unlikely any time soon. Primarily for economic reasons. True, joint command and staff exercises by the U.S. 3d Infantry Division and the Russian 27th "peacekeeping" Motorized Rifle Division of the Volga Military District have been planned for 1994 but the Russian Defense Ministry has no funds to conduct real joint maneuvers with NATO forces. The ministry has no funds even for official visits, although it has been flooded with invitations literally from all NATO countries. In the near future however economic problems will apparently not be the main ones. The ministry is agitated by serious rumors about an early and inevitable drastic reorganization (resubordination of the General Staff directly to the president, and so forth) of the military department patterned after the reorganization of the Security Ministry last December. It seems that the Yeltsin administration is considering the third variant of the edict on reorganizing the Russian Federation Defense Ministry. In any event, the idea of "Partnership" today does not seem to be very topical.
