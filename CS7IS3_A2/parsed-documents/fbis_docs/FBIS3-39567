In an article published in yesterday's IRISH TIMES, Sir Patrick used new and more straightforward language to address some of the concerns and uncertainties arising from the Downing Street declaration and to offer a more detailed vision of what could lie beyond a permanent end to violence. His message came as it emerged at Westminster that Sir Patrick has given the hardline Democratic Unionist party [DUP] a virtual assurance that the Anglo-lrish conference will not meet while political talks are taking place. Mr Peter Robinson, the DUP deputy leader, said a letter recently received from the Northern Ireland secretary indicated "a willingness to suspend" the conference. The DUP -- which is boycotting the talks process -- last week wrote to Mr John Major requesting a meeting before the prime minister's next encounter with Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, on Saturday. According to Mr Robinson, Sir Patrick also stressed that there was no requirement for the DUP to accept the joint declaration as the basis for political talks. In yesterday's article, Sir Patrick forcefully reiterated the government's insistence that the IRA must end hostilities and that Sinn Fein must renounce the justification of violence and commit itself exclusively to the democratic process. But he also attempted to edge forward on some areas cited by republicans as being in need of clarification. His remarks were welcomed by Mr Reynolds. Sir Patrick repeated his view that, in the event of an end to IRA violence, Sinn Fein could be admitted to exploratory talks "within three months" rather than at the end of a three-month quarantine period. He said that once it was clear that all terrorist violence had ceased for good, the benefits to the community would include "our ability to manage without troops being deployed in support of the police and without emergency legislation." Sir Patrick said Britain "cannot and will not adopt the role of persuader for any particular outcome" and that "with or without" Sinn Fein, the process would go ahead. He added: "We are, however, persuaders who urge the really committed to search for widely-based agreement." In a passage intended to assure nationalists, Sir Patrick said he wanted to see "substantial devolved powers" in Northern Ireland but he emphasised that this would not be done on a unilateral basis but through agreement within the so-called three-stranded talks process which includes the Irish government. "We cannot revert to a system of government in Northern Ireland with which only one part of the community can readily identify." In Ulster, local politicians yesterday voiced alarm over the rise in attacks by loyalist paramilitaries. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said members of his party were increasingly being singled out as terrorist targets.
