Enterprises of the Ministry of Atomic Energy, the State Committee for Defense Industry, Arzamas-16, LOMO [Leningrad Optical-Mechanical Association], the Az NPF Joint-Stock Company and many others offered their products. The exposition of Russian defense industry enterprises evoked high interest among the plenum's participants.
