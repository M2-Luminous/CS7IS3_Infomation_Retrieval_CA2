When Americans and West Europeans met they used to discuss "high politics": nonproliferation and deterrence, detente and armament. But these problems have meanwhile become classical history. What is more: Unemployment, health insurance, and immigration have become international politics. Why? One reason is that traditional security problems have disappeared -- for the time being: There may be many small wars going on all over the world, but not a single one of them poses a strategic threat to the West. Second, the fate of Western governments hardly depends on traditional foreign policy any more: Neither Clinton nor Kohl will topple over Bosnia or Somalia -- a dramatic contrast to the internal uproar that the Vietnam War or the stationing of Pershing produced. Unemployment, however, is the most dangerous time bomb ticking under the thrones of the powerful -- just remember George Bush, the glorious winner of the Gulf War, who was ousted by recession 20 months later. After all: Even the last backwoods politician has now realized that his domestic policy problems -- meaning unemployment or immigration -- cannot be solved exclusively within the structure of the national state. This is the logic that created the job summit. That not much would come of it was predictable, because summits rarely produce anything that was not put on paper beforehand in painstaking detail. In addition, few of the G-7, the big industrial nations, face the same economic situation requiring the same economic solution. How, for example, are the highly indebted Germans to carry out the economic policy program demanded by Clinton? But what is more important than the outcome of the summit is the process -- the mere event as such. The G-7 seem to have realized -- or they suspect it -- that globalization is taking a little more of their autonomy away from them every day and that increasingly less can be tackled on a purely national level. Also, worldwide recession -- 36 million unemployed in the OECD area, the highest figure since the great depression -- has made the arrogance disappear that used to be linked with terms such as "model Germany." With 12 percent unemployment in France and 10 percent in Germany it is difficult to teach the others what is what. But the Americans, who have created 34 million new jobs over the last 20 years (the more populous Europe produced only 10 million), are no longer very happy with their "job machine" either. Very often wages are extremely low, and middle-class incomes are stagnating. This has made the two sides willing to learn from one another. With their high wages and social contributions (the highest in the world), the Germans are condemning more and more people to permanent unemployment; at the same time, generous social benefits are not a great encouragement for people to look for a job. A little more "Americanization" -- fewer subsidies, more competition -- would do no harm. The Americans, on the other hand, are fascinated by German and Japanese vocational training: A week ago, Clinton presented a $3.4 billion program to this end. The only question is whether such models are transferable: It is doubtful whether a young American would work for a meager apprentice payment for three years to get his certificate of qualification. Another question is whether the German model -- it goes back to the Middle Ages -- is still up to date. It may work quite well for tradesmen and industrial workers, but most of the new jobs are created in the service and information sectors. Is an apprenticeship the best way to become a computer programmer or marketing manager, for whom creativity is more important than trade discipline? After all, young Germans are beginning to doubt this method as well, judging from the increasing number of students compared with apprentices. And what about the formerly highly praised German managers? Many of them cannot leave high-rising hierarchies behind, while in America and Japan one middle-management layer after the other is cut out of the pyramid. It is worth considering how General Motors and Ford could gain market shares in Europe in 1993, while total sales of new cars dropped by 15 percent. These are questions that cannot be answered at the summit: Show effects are more important than facts there. Nevertheless, Clinton must be praised for the initiative because it enhances the necessary shift in awareness. "High politics" increasingly have to deal with the "darker sides" of social and economic policy; at the same time, nobody can escape globalization by concentrating on national issues. Detroit has not achieved much, but it has shown what the states still have to achieve before the turn of the millennium.
