The document was the climax of the UCR leadership plenum meeting presided over by Raul Alfonsin. The UCR president listened to some 20 reports on the crisis in regional economies, and said: "An economic policy cannot succeed if it does not take the people into account." The Radicals stressed that the economic program of the Carlos Menem government "has tremendously aggravated the trend that leaves the poor increasingly behind," considering that "an irresponsible confidence in the spontaneous workings of the free market has turned the opening up into a experimental balancing act conducted without a net and without any training." The document says that the Argentine opening up has been "a shock" without "any reconversion program designed to orient and support productive activities." The document also says that the decline in basic economic activities and the crisis affecting provincial public administrations, which was aggravated by the transfer of services, "has produced an unprecedented deterioration in the population's health, education, and public security." The document, entitled "The Chain Breaks at Its Weakest Points," recalls, and not without irony, that the year that is ending should have been the year marking "the beginning of the payment of the social debts," in accordance with government announcements within the framework of the Social Plan launched with a lot of noise at the beginning of 1993. "Instead, violent demonstrations have been what called our attention to the situation in the provinces," the document points out, referring to Santiago del Estero and La Rioja social outbursts. More than 20 UCR provincial presidents spoke during the meeting. They progressively painted a map of the situation in the provinces, each with different specific characteristics, but which together described a crisis in the regional economies. The assessment made by most speeches put the blame for the social chaos in the provinces not only on the economic adjustment being sponsored by the national government, but also on Justicialist Party administrations, many of them installed in the provinces since 1983. Salta Province leaders Jose Napoleon Gambetta and Osvaldo Camisar said in their report that the policies implemented between 1983 and 1991 by two Justicialist administrations "accentuated the deterioration of the public administration, leaving it in a virtual state of bankruptcy." Rio Negro Governor Horacio Massaccesi -- UCR first vice president -- presented a detailed and harsh report. The governor mentioned the contributions that Justicialist governors received during the 1993 electoral year, and noted the careless way in which many of them, who now suffer ruinous treasury situations, spent public funds. Alfonsin spoke at the end of the meeting to stress that the party will not only criticize government policies, but UCR representatives will soon visit government offices to present alternative proposals to the economic plan in order to face the crisis afflicting the regional economies. Former Mendoza Governor Jose Octavio Bordon could not escape the wave of criticism. Fernando Armeniague, UCR provincial president, recalled that former UCR Governor Felipe Llaver handed over a clean and ordered administration to Bordon, who is currently a Justicialist senator, while in a short period of time Bordon put the Bank of Mendoza in the red. The head of the La Rioja UCR branch, Roberto Nieto Brizuela, spent time talking about the careless way former Governor Carlos Menem spend public funds during his administration, an attitude that is in sharp contrast with the president's current attitude of "adjustment policy without anesthesia." Brizuela outlined the way La Rioja was administered in the past, which would partly explain its present state of bankrupcy.
