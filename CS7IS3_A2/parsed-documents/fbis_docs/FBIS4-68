According to KZP Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During, the emergency regulations would be known on Friday and they would be discussed in a meeting between himself and leaders of the SA Police and SA Defence Force. "We have to discuss the precise nature of the regulations. It's obviously of necessity and our policing methods will have to be adapted because it becomes law and you have to abide by that," Gen During said. The KZP worked in "close conjunction" with other security forces and Friday's meeting would definitely arrive at joint policing strategies for certain areas, he said. The emergency would probably allow greater movement to security forces and give them greater access to violence flash-points, he added. "It may have the effect of stabilising the situation, and we sincerely hope that it will have that effect." Gen During said he did not expect Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, as kwaZulu minister of police, to defy the emergency because it was the law and Mr Buthelezi was a "Christian and law-abiding citizen".
