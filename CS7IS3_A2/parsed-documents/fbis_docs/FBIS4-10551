This will give Brazil 30 years to repay the principal, which amounts to $45 billion, of which $35 billion is owed to foreign banks, and $3.8 billion is "fresh money" -- from previous agreements -- loaned after 1983. The rest is owed to Brazilian banks abroad. The new bonds, which will be issued by the national Treasury, are like promissory notes that will be delivered to creditors in exchange for the old promissory notes the country failed to honor. Those promissory notes will be transformed into six new types of bonds: discount, parity, temporary interest reduction, capitalization, conversion, and "fresh money" bonds. However, to implement the exchange, Brazil tomorrow will have to present $2.8 billion in guarantees of a total of $4.6 billion. The balance will be paid over a two-year period in six-month installments. In order to calculate the total renegotiated amount, the Central Bank added all public sector debts -- overdue and about to fall due -- plus $28 billion that state institutions already have paid to foreign creditors but has remained deposited at the Central Bank. This has happened since 1983, when the debt crisis began, and when the country had few international reserves and could not make any payments. That money will be transferred to the Treasury, which may use it only for reducing the domestic debt, which in February stood at $48 billion. The government has not decided yet how this payment will be made. According to Central Bank technicians, with the new agreement, the foreign debt will stop being a problem because the government will be able to schedule the payments. Technicians believe that by that time, the country will have reached economic stability, a condition that will facilitate the repaying of obligations owed to international creditors.
