Dear fellow countrymen: I hope that during the New Year of 1994 all your wishes are fulfilled and you enjoy happiness. Last year, we inaugurated the new government and initiated changes and reforms to create a new Korea. With the inauguration of the civilian government and reform, our country's international position has been amazingly enhanced. The world is watching us. Indeed, our society has been changed remarkably over the past year. I sincerely thank you, the people, for joining in the changes and reform. This is the second year of change and reform. It is the year to pledge a new upsurge and consolidate last year's achievements. The Uruguay Round [UR] negotiations, which have dragged on for seven years, were settled late last year. Thus, the world has entered an era of unlimited competition. The world and international competition are no longer empty words, but rather a reality. We must exchange our narrow vision for a wide vision of the entire world. Only the nations that win the competition will become the masters of global history. The nations left behind in the competition will barely survive. It is our task this year to determine how to cope with the fierce flow of world history. I want the new year's goal of the state administration to be to strengthen the nation's competitiveness. While setting this goal, I would like to discuss the direction of overall state affairs. First, I will continuously push for change and reform in a bid to enhance the country's competitiveness. Through reform, we should advance in the world and through change, we must prepare for the future. The world has entered an era of competition through reform. We must adjust laws and regulations so that there will be innovations in efficiency and productivity in all domains of state affairs. We must continue to eliminate authoritarianism, corruption, and irregularities that block internationalization and slow our advance to the future. In order to adapt to the changed international order, we must first change all the government's functions and roles. The government itself should take the initiative in eliminating and rectifying inefficient practices. The government should strongly push ahead with ongoing reforms and change so that the people can actually feel them in their routine lives. The government should become a government that always contributes to alleviating the people's inconvenience and that serves for the welfare of alienated people. Change should also be effected in politics. In today's turning point of the state and society, those involved in politics should display the leadership of pooling the strength and wisdom of the people. Now is the time to do so. With the form of politics we had in the past we could not succeed in the era of unlimited competition. Without changing our policies we cannot enhance the international competitiveness of our country. The people ardently want to see the politicians adapt to the changing world and sincerely discuss matters to cope with it. Today we urgently need such policies with which to lead communities and provide guidance in carrying out change and reform. Policies in the interest of the people and for their welfare are urgently required. We need policies that alleviate the sufferings of the people in all fields, including education, traffic, environment, and public security. The creation of such a political climate in which confrontation and competition are vigorously carried out is desirable. Policies that foster collective egoism should be eliminated. Political reform by the politicians themselves should precede all other reforms. We should firmly establish clean politics. I expect the bills on political reform to pass soon. I will strengthen our economy's international competitiveness through the steady promotion of the Five Year-Plan of the new economy. The expansion of social overhead capital and facilities, the balanced development of national land, the alleviation of regulations imposed on economic activities, and the development of science and technology are our priority task to strengthen international competitiveness. Our economy faces difficulties today. The government will further accelerate the expansion of social overhead facilities to strengthen our potential for economic growth. For this, I will provide mechanisms so that civilian capital is actively induced into social overhead facilities. At the same time, I will epochally rectify imbalances in regional development. This is my long-cherished will and resolution. I will provide a breakthrough and foundation for rectifying imbalances between regions during my term of office without fail. I have already directed the new economic team to provide comprehensive measures and implementation plans so this work will be initiated on a full scale beginning this year. The new economic team will make public to the people the framework of these projects in the near future. Only when free and fair competition is carried out, can sound enterprises be fostered. Since unnecessary restrictions may work as a cause for corruption, I will abolish, as part of my reform drive, regulations that restrict business activities. The government has already formed a team, which has already begun activities, for examining ways to relax restrictive regulations. We will drastically restructure more than half of the government-supported enterprises, which have been operated loosely or for which the nation's management is considered no longer necessary, so that they are integrated, dissolved, or privatized. We cannot enhance international competitiveness of our economy without technological development. In the new year, we will push ahead with bolder policies for the promotion of science and technology. We must develop ultramodern industrial technology, including introducing precision new materials and developing the life sciences. At the same time, we must effect innovations in each existing technology in our industrial fields. We will increase the investment in and intensify support of technological development to foster the intelligence industry. With a view to creating a climate for vigorous business activities, we will make efforts to stabilize wages and to lower monetary interest and land prices. For this, we will readjust laws and regulations pertaining to land and will further expand the opening of the door for inducement of foreign capital, including commercial loans for social overhead capital and facilities. At the same time, we must thoroughly comprehend and cope with the changes of the time. For example, the environment issue is not only our nation's problem. We must prepare ourselves now to effectively cope with the forthcoming environmental discussions. I will direct all efforts to work out measures to deal with the problems of farmers and fishermen, who are in a difficult situation due to the opening of agricultural markets, and on agriculture and fisheries. Our agriculture, fisheries, farms, and fishing villages are facing a great turning point as the result of the settlement of the UR negotiations last year. The shock and frustration of farmers and fishermen was painful to all of us, but also to me. However, we should surmount today's difficulties. We can surmount them. We should make a new start with new methods for this. As was promised, the government will complete the 42 trillion won-scale farm and fishing village development project three years ahead of schedule. I will see to it that this project is carried out according to the local situation. A special tax will be established by this year to strengthen the competitiveness of agricultural and fishing products. Through this special tax the government will set aside 1.5 trillion won every year to invest in farm and fishing villages for the next 10 years. I have established a secretarial position in the presidential offices for agriculture and fisheries in an effort to effectively promote agricultural policies. Soon, I will also form a farm and fishing village development committee which will be a presidential advisory organ. I will establish within the first half of this year practical and fundamental measures to secure the international competitiveness of our agricultural products and to effect innovations in the development of the rural environment. I will directly preside over the meeting of the farm and fishing village development committee which agriculture-related ministries will attend. Thus, I will directly oversee the smooth promotion of various agricultural policies. I will see to it that all of our people pool their wisdom and strength so as to protect and revive farm and fishing villages. Fourth, I will actively promote educational reform to enhance our international competitiveness. Our country's international competitiveness is determined, in the end, by people. Along with education of people, our education should foster talented individuals who will be able to cope with globalization and opening up. Educational reform will be the core of the reforms and changes we seek. The government will strengthen professional and technological education to deepen education in science and to supply able human resources to the industrial and administrative sectors. The education reform committee which will soon be formed under direct presidential authority, will provide a comprehensive education reform plan, and I will see to it that the education reform plan is implemented consistently. We should make our 5,000-year-long culture the foundation of our national strength. The spirit of being devoted to people's welfare is the foundation of our national culture. Believing the characteristics of our national culture to be the characteristics of world culture, we should foster and cultivate our culture. This year marks the 600th anniversary of the selection of Seoul as the capital. This year also is Visit Korea Year, and the year of Korean traditional music. I expect that vigorous efforts will be made this year to make our art internationally renowned. Fifth, I will carry out bold policies to internationalize and globalize all of our society. We will pursue active opening, not passive globalization. This is because we ourselves must cultivate our own national destiny, which must not be determined by other people. The degree of the globalization of a country, as well as its economic and military strengths and the level of its culture, are important factors in determining its national strength. Globalization means deregulation, opening up, and rationalization [jayulhwa, kaebanghwa, hamnihwa]. To promote cooperation and compete with the world fairly, we must globalize the people's consciousness and their capabilities as well as our systems. Globalization must be pursued both in the central government and in the regional governments. I expect practical reforms for globalization will be made in all fields of our society. Practical diplomacy [silli oegyo] is called for more urgently than ever in an era of globalization. Heads of state of various countries are busy promoting their own national interests. I will rush to any place in the world if it is beneficial to the country and people. And, the government will prudently fulfill its duties to promote peace in the world and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. We will strengthen diplomacy in economic affairs and trade to positively adjust ourselves to [chokkuk taeung] the international trade environment, which has changed since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations. Sixth, this year, I will do my best to build a foundation for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and improving South-North relations. The North Korean nuclear issue is an issue over which the existence of 70 million fellow countrymen is at stake. It also constitutes a threat to peace in the world. North Korea must, though belatedly, come forward with the correct attitude of trying to resolve the Korean peninsula problems through South-North Korean dialogue. I hope North Korea will realize that it is a correct way to get assistance for what it needs within the nation through South-North dialogue, instead of trying to get it from outside. If the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved, substantial relations between the South and North can be promoted at a very rapid speed. Fortunately, North Korea shows signs of change, and I expect we will be able to find clues to resolving the issue in a few days [kummyonggan]. Of course we should refrain from being too hastily optimistic. However, North Korea's closed and isolation policy, rather than helping it maintain its system, will only burden it. I clearly believe that North Korea will gradually become aware of this fact. This is because as the era of unlimited competition emerges, North Korea will have to take part in globalization to survive. The sooner North Korea takes part in the trend of reform and openness, the more it will hasten our whole nation's globalization. As president, I will carry out my work so that not an inch of error in national security emerges. I will continuously promote reform and modernization of our military to assume a posture of security so as to prevent any kind of provocation. While there can be no sanctuary in eradicating injustice and corruption, the people's love and faith in the military must not be shaken. I hope all the people will encourage the military's rebirth. I would like to thank our officers and men who are taking pains to defend the armistice line in this cold winter. Dear fellow countrymen: I would like to ask exceptional cooperation from you, the people, as I reveal my plan for administrating state affairs this year. First of all, I would like to address businessmen. The most important force of competition in an era of globalization and internationalization is the business sector. The government will provide all the assistance necessary to make our country the most appropriate country for business. When this is carried out, businessmen must exert efforts for invest resolutely and develop technology and markets. Economic war is competition in quality. I hope that businessmen make products under the goal of making the world's highest quality products. Lacking harmony between the labor and management, there can be no competitiveness. As today's economic growth was achieved though the sweat of workers, tomorrow's international competitiveness will be impossible without the determination and participation of workers. Labor and management must harmonize so that the economy can be saved, and the economy must be alive for there to be a share for you and me. I would like to propose that labor and management make this year a year of no labor-management disputes. The government will also prepare to carry out, without fail, an employment insurance system in 1995. Once again, I sincerely appeal to you, farmers and fishermen, not to be discouraged. We must concentrate all our wisdom on overcoming the high wave of global competitiveness and openness from now on and make efforts for its realization. We must make efforts to adapt ourselves to the new circumstances. Also, organizations of farmers and fishermen must start anew. I address the 900,000 civil servants. Last year, many civil servants disclosed details of their assets to the public for the first time in history. This served as an important occasion for regaining the people's trust in your reputation. You are the master of change and reform, as well as the driving forces of international competitiveness. The fate of the state depends upon your awareness and efforts. I hope you discard an easy-going attitude and stand at the forefront of change and reform. Also, I extend my appreciation and sympathy to you and your family members who shared the pain of last year's pay freeze. I will surely keep my word to raise the wages of the civil servants to the level of employees at government-operated corporates before 1997 by formulating a four-year plan for the improvement of the civil servant wage system. I address my fellow countrymen. As we are only several years away from the 21st century, the coming years are the most important period for our nation. What we need now is faith to carry out changes and reform, and conviction for their certain success. The people's moral awareness and sense of mission in these times are the basic factors in overcoming internationalization and openness. We must advance while carrying out reform. Also, we must carry out reform while advancing. It is our goal to achieve national reunification and to lead the creation of a new civilization in the Asia-Pacific era by entering the ranks of developed countries. We will surely reach it. Let's cherish the firm faith of opening a great era for the Korean nation. Let's all advance together toward that glorious day. Finally, the United Nations has named this year the year of the family. Therefore, we should realize the importance of family and fill all our families with love and happiness by further developing our good family system. Thank you.
