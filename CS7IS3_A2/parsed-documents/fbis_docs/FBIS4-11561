Let us listen to Jean-Claude Martineau. [Begin Martineau recording, in Creole] They have spoken of a certain meeting held in a Washington hotel. It was a public meeting during which the president discussed how to get out of the crisis with a great number of Haitians. Contrary to statements by the men who pretend otherwise, I do not believe any plans stemming from this meeting are being carried out. First, I would like to say that these men have been killing people for years. So, such a slight pretext will not relieve the military -- who are slaughtering people left and right, then laying their bodies in state [as heard] until pigs eat them in the streets -- of their responsibilities. [words indistinct] as if they are defending themselves against the wishes of an entire nation and the entire world. This is something. It is drug dealers' rhetoric. [end recording] That was President Aristide's spokesman Jean-Claude Martineau.
