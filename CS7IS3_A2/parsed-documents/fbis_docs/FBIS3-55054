[Kebich] A total of 25 documents had been prepared for discussion at the level of heads of state, and 19 -- at the level of prime ministers. Some of those documents, indeed, we did not sign, including the agreement on assistance to Tajikistan in proportion to national budgets. We were among those who opposed adopting this resolution, saying that as long as we receive no assistance in eliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl accident, we cannot grant financial aid to Tajikistan. We have nothing against sending foodstuffs and other products there, but we do not agree to pay a VAT just for them. Russia backed us on this issue, and so did other states. It was decided to send the draft for completion. Another document that we did not sign stipulated the unification of prices and taxes, and thus, the lifting of customs duties. The document was not approved at the initiative of Russia and Belarus. We cannot grant equal conditions to all the states, because Russia and Belarus spent a long time paving the path and we should receive the status of trailblazers. We also refrained from signing a document on the mechanism of enacting the collective security treaty, because in fact, we had not joined the treaty. This happened because CIS members did not acknowledge the onetime declaration by Stanislav Shushkevich, and maintained that the document should be signed without provisos. On the other hand, the collective security treaty has not been ratified by the Belarusian Supreme Soviet as of yet. We also did not sign a number of less relevant agreements. [Reporter] Which of the signed agreements do you consider most significant? In general, what can be regarded as the most momentous outcome of the Ashgabat summit? [Kebich] First of all, I want to emphasize the agreement on investments. Similar agreements had been signed with foreign states, but somehow this had fallen through the cracks and they had not existed within the CIS framework. That was a paradox. The signing of this document facilitates investments in neighboring states, the forming of joint-stock companies, and leasing enterprises in CIS states. Our legislative opposition has always stressed the urgent need for such an agreement. The treaty was signed by all the participants, and so were the agreements on joint financing of the Interstate Economic Court and the Television and Radio Company. The most important thing was that agreements vital for the functioning of the economic union were signed. I also want to underline the fact that Turkmenistan has become a legal member of the union. Thus, only Ukraine has not joined the economic union yet, but we believe that the situation will change in the immediate future.... Among other important agreements there are also the ones on communications and medicine.... Medicine will be exempt from VAT, and thus will be cheaper. The cooperation agreement alone was worth going to Ashgabat. It envisions that if we receive oil or gas as part of cooperation deals, that is if the end product is returned to the producer of raw materials, we will not pay any taxes or customs duties. This will significantly reduce prices. At the same time, we also held bilateral talks in Ashgabat. I signed a bilateral agreement with Kazakhstan, while Uladzimir Zalamay signed such agreements with all the other republics except Russia, Moldova, and Tajikistan. I will be visiting Moldova soon, while we need time to reach an accord with Tajikistan. With regard to Russia, after we sign an agreement on merging our financial systems, we will not need any bilateral agreements at all. There were a lot of personal talks in Ashgabat, including my meeting with Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. Bilateral talks with the Turkmen leadership also yielded dividends. Turkmenistan remains our primary debtor. We agreed with Chernomyrdin that Russia will not hinder shipments of Turkmen gas via its territory. In addition in 1994, Turkmenistan is going to supply us with 1,000,000 metric tons of industrial oil. Kazakhstan also agreed to ship industrial oil to Belarus, while our commercial organizations will be able to buy Kazakh oil. There is one more thing. In January, we will receive 90,000 metric tons of high quality wheat as compensation for the work of Belarusians in Kustanay Oblast. Truck and tractor drivers and combine operators who took part in harvesting in that oblast will receive another 11,000 metric tons. [Reporter] Can we anticipate the merging of financial systems in the immediate future? [Kebich] We are rapidly approaching this goal. I want to get this straight to everybody -- forming a monetary union with Russia will not preclude pursuing independent policies. By the way, we adopted the national budget some time ago. In Ashgabat, Aleksandr Shokhin told me: "You were faster, and now Russia will have to adjust its budget to the Belarusian one." This means that politically, we have gained a lot. [Reporter] What other Russian leaders did you confer with in Ashgabat? [Kebich] I talked to almost all of them, including a short conversation with Boris Yeltsin. He confirmed our agreements with Chernomyrdin and Shokhin. [Reporter] Who among the Russian leadership supports the merging of our financial systems, and who opposes it? [Kebich] There is no opposition, although some people may have doubts. However, there is one problem. When we resolve issues at the highest level everything goes smoothly, but every bureaucrat at lower levels wants to demonstrate his omnipotence. Thus, we decided that there will be no more agreements at the level of clerks. Agreements should be signed by the highest officials and then be carried out by clerks. [Reporter] Will a political declaration be announced soon? [Kebich] Although we agreed on this, both the Russian and Belarusian schedules are so packed with events that the declaration may be postponed through a lack of time and not a lack of desire. As we know, the Russian leadership is concerned with the future of its two legislative chambers. Anyway, I believe, that a political declaration will be made shortly after the New Year. This is my forecast. [Reporter] The CIS Charter has not been ratified by our legislature. Do you think there may be complications in the course of the ratification process? [Kebich] I believe there will be no problems until the clause dealing with collective security is discussed. This will initiate another great debate. We have plenty of experts majoring in disputes.
