In the past, that is to say about 10 years ago, the export of military goods to countries in the Middle East would have met with insurmountable problems. This changed somewhat following the Egypt-Israeli peace agreement (Camp David). Minesweepers were allowed to demonstrate their abilities in Alexandria, top military personnel and secretaries of state (Van Houwelingen in 1985) cautiously tested the market during sneaky trips to the Nile. No real weapons were involved: after all, electronics, patrol ships and fishing for mines in the Red Sea did serve the general interest. In 1988, the Royal Navy also made a call in Egypt to once again demonstrate the quality of the Dutch bottoms. But Egypt did not have any money. In thanks for services rendered during the Gulf war, it received generous military assistance from the United States so that it did not have to put its scarce resources into Dutch goods. But now a small breakthrough is in the offing. It concerns real weapons, and the supplier is once again the Dutch Government itself. The disarmament race in Europe has led to an enormous surplus of weapons. Minister Ter Beek has 727 armored infantry vehicles, model YPR-765, for sale. The oldest are only 20 years old, the youngest were made in 1987. Now Egypt would like to acquire as many as 500 to 600 of them. According to the ministry's sales brochure, they should yield between 400,000 and 700,000 guilders each, hence a total of something like 250 million guilders. According to reports, Pakistan had also expressed interest, but the idea of Daf armored vehicles on the front line against India was going a bit too far. Even though a war between Egypt and Israel is really no longer a matter of consideration, the planned sale to Egypt is not uncontroversial. First of all, the possibility of an "Iranian" development in Egypt, where fundamentalists and the government are fighting hard, is not excluded. To deliver to Egypt means more or less lengthy military relations with that country (maintenance, reserve parts), unless the United States is willing to provide the follow up care (even during crises). The willingness to enter into military ties with Egypt shows that the Dutch arms export policy is in the process of changing. Evenhandedness requires that Israel no longer be an undesirable destination either. Before you know it, we will have moved from a quasiembargo of the Middle East as a "sensitive region" into a policy that comes down to calling yourself neutral as long as you supply all countries with equal amounts. Countries such as Iran and Iraq excluded, of course. The pressure to export becomes even greater because the defense budget takes income from future exports into account. Now that a large part of the discontinued equipment is bad, produces little return, and meanwhile is rusting away, the Ministry of Defense cannot afford to miss another major hit in the Middle East.
