According to the Ministry of Agriculture, such associations started to flourish in the 1980s, with their focus first solely on grain production in the ten provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan, Guangdong and Sichuan. Since then, such associations have expanded to different areas, including capital investment, technology, production, processing, and supply and marketing, as farmers come to depend more and more on the market. A recent survey by the ministry shows that seven percent of these associations focus on technology extension, over 50 percent of them concentrate on various production services, and another 36 percent provide complete sets of help for farmers from production to marketing. The best known of such organizations is the Changcheng township vegetable association of Zhucheng city in east China's Shandong Province. As most of 2,400 household members are well versed in vegetable production, the association helps them with technical training, introducing fine seeds and supplying services for vegetable processing and sales. Farmers from other villages make up the majority of the association members, as they want to learn more from the Changcheng farmers. Another outstanding example is the Edible Fungus Association in Feixiang county, in north China's Hebei province. The association embraces 14 percent of the households in 100 villages specializing in edible fungus production.
