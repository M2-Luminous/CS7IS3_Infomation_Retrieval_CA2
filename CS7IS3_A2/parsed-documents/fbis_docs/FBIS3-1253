UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye has already arrived back from his trips to secure help from Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Moroccan King Hassan II. Whatever he may have brought back has not yet had any effect on the obstinacy displayed by the negotiating teams. In Zimbabwe, the UN special representative talked of progress and accused the media of speculating when it talks of a stalemate at the talks. There is arguing against facts, though: No plenary meetings have been held in the Zambian capital over the last 20 days because there has been nothing to narrow the gaps between the two sides. Simultaneously the least and most important thing to have happened at the peace talks so far is that the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, has rejected the ministerial portfolios, provinces, and communes proposed by the government. Lusaka-based analysts are advising that the talks go into recess, at least until some new and active influence can be brought to bear on the correlation of forces. They note that international observers are also beginning to disagree among themselves. The Angolan Government team went to State House again today to meet Zambian President Frederick Chiluba. The UN special representative's spokesman was here at the hotel for talks with the government team.
