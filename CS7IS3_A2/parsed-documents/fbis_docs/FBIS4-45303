The use of and the trafficking in drugs have become widespread, thus causing extremely adverse effects on many countries around the world. Therefore, the issue of narcotic drugs has now become a problem which must be tackled by all countries. The above-mentioned statement was made by Souban Salitthilat, deputy foreign affairs minister and chairman of the Lao National Committee for the Control and Suppression of Narcotic Drugs, at the opening of a meeting to launch an overall plan for controlling and suppressing narcotic drugs until the year 2000. The meeting was held in Vientiane early this week and attended by drug control and suppression representatives from ten northern provinces. In his statement, Souban Salitthilat also said: To achieve better results in suppressing narcotic drugs, cooperation and coordination must be earnestly established between the drug producing and using countries. If the user countries only blame the producer countries, mutual suspicion will be further deepened and cooperation will become designed for unilateral interests only. The minister stressed that Laos is ready to cooperate with all countries and international organizations in solving this problem with its own ability and on the basis of mutual respect for each other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and mutual benefit. The chairman of the Lao National Committee for the Control and Suppression of Narcotic Drugs stressed that on the basis of the aforementioned principle, the Lao Government, with cooperation from the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, has mapped out an overall plan on suppressing narcotic drugs until the year 2000. This plan spells out urgent requirements, strategy, and policy for practical implementation. The plan consists of 16 projects, requiring a budget of U.S. $35 million to implement. The long-term objectives of the plan are aimed at gradually reducing the planting of poppy crops, doing away with the planting of marijuana for commercial purposes, decreasing and controlling the needs [of consumption] of narcotic drug users, suppressing drug trafficking and production as well as any illegal acts committed in violation of narcotics suppression laws, controlling any legal activity on the use of drugs, and providing convenience and cooperation to the international organizations. The Lao Government has paid close attention to enforcing our narcotics suppression laws to suppress trafficking by establishing a narcotics control and suppression organization staffed with more than 20 police officers to carry out drug suppression drives in cooperation with local police, Customs, and postal authorities. The Lao National Committee for the Control and Suppression of Narcotic Drugs was formed in 1990 under the chairmanship of Souban and is composed of members from various state agencies, namely the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, the Customs Department, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Public Health Ministry, the Justice Ministry, the Education Ministry, and the Prime Minister's Office.
