FBIS4-21944 "jptot015__l94109" JPRS-TOT-94-015-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 2 April 1994 WEST EUROPE GERMANY FOCUS Says Two RAF Members Escaped at Bad Kleinen FOCUS Says Two RAF Members Escaped at Bad Kleinen BKA Filmed Couple at Site AU0504104194 Munich FOCUS in German 2 Apr 94 p 31 AU0504104194 Munich FOCUS German BFN [Christian Sturm report: "Beard and Bald Head"] [Text] The pictures are slightly blurred. The hand that guided the video camera must have shaken, probably from excitement. Through the lens the official of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] sees RAF [Red Army Faction] member Birgit Hogefeld. Beside her walks Klaus Steimetz, liaison man of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. The film was made on 24 June 1993 at Bad Kleinen railroad station -- three days before the shoot-out during which RAF member Wolfgang Grams and GSG-9 man Michael Newrzella were killed. The video tape also shows another couple, who were clearly on good terms with Hogefeld and Steinmetz. Only after the failed antiterror operation did the BKA start a nationwide search for the unknown couple -- exactly at 1850 hours [1650 GMT]. Too late, the two had long disappeared. Today it is clear that the BKA investigators let two people slip through their fingers, who are linked with the assassination of Trust Agency chief Detlef Karsten Rohwedder on 1 April 1991. An internal BKA paper notes soberly: When evaluating the video tape, the experts discovered that the man might be the unknown person seen during the attack on Rohwedder. Some days before the attack a suspect -- 190 cm tall, bearded, and bald -- was observed spying on Rohwedder's villa in Duesseldorf from nearby gardens. According to the BKA, this is the man filmed in Bad Kleinen chatting with Hogefeld and Steinmetz. A so-called covert search is currently underway all over the country -- so far without the involvement of the media. At the beginning of March the BKA sent photos of the unknown couple to all police stations, with a warning in bold print: Pay particular attention to your own safety [Eigensicherung besonders beachten]! According to information obtained by FOCUS, another suspicious couple got in front of the BKA observation group's hidden camera on 27 June 1993, five hours before the shoot-out at Bad Kleinen railroad station. Only later did it become clear who wanted to meet with Hogefeld and Grams there: RAF member Daniela Klette and Ernst-Volker Staub, both wanted on an arrest warrant since 1991 for suspected participation in the attacks on Trust Agency chief Rohwedder and State Secretary Hans Neusel. What is embarrassing is that the RAF couple noticed the officials and, as the BKA report says, "took photos of them in return."
