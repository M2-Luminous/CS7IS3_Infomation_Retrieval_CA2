In his letter dated March 23, Mr. Christopher notes that he has sent messages of congratulations to Foreign Minister Andrejevs and Foreign Minister Kozyrev on the successful conclusion of troop withdrawal negotiations. "The United States considers the Latvian-Russian agreement to be an important milestone toward our mutual goal of seeing all Russian forces withdrawn from the Baltics, including Estonia, by August 31, 1994." Mr. Christopher further assures Mr. Luik that the United States "will continue to urge the Russian Government to live up to its commitment to withdraw its forces." Strong international support for the withdrawal of ex-Soviet forces from the Baltics played an important role in Russia's decision to continue Estonian-Russian talks April 5-6 in Moscow and to abide by the agreed-upon date for withdrawal. Yesterday, in Riga, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania called upon "the international community to continue its vigilance that this date will be observed."
