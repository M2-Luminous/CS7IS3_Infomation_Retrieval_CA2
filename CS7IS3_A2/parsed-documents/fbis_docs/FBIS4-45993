Chiang said the government's policy to build the fourth nuclear plant will not change despite overwhelming opposition to the plant by villagers who live near the proposed site. Chiang said he was not surprised by the result of a public poll in Kungliao Sunday [22 May], and said he will ask the state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) to step up its dialogue and communication with people in Kungliao, a village some 35 km east of Taipei. In a vote Sunday, some 5,669, or 96.1 percent of the voters, voted against the plan to construct the nuclear plant in Kungliao, while 176 voters supported the plan. Taipower officials said that it attached great importance to the vote, and will study the reason for villagers' opposition before embarking on another round of communications with them. They noted however that only 58 percent of the eligible voters turned out to vote. Taipower also announced that it will subsidize electricity fees for Kungliao villagers as soon as the budget for the fourth nuclear power plant is approved by the legislature. Taipower President Chang Shih-min will lead Taipower officials to visit Kungliao leaders Tuesday to solicit their support for the plan. Chang said that the vote is not legally binding and that the plant should be constructed for the welfare of the nation. Plans to construct the plant should not be swayed by the vote alone, he said. Chang reiterated that the fourth nuclear plant will boast the world's best security and environmental facilities. Chao Kuo-tung, chief of Kungliao Village, said he was thrilled that most of the voters were against the plan, but said that the 11,000 residents in Kungliao do not have enough strength. Chao asked Taipei County Magistrate You Ching to hold a public poll in Taipei County to solidify the opposition force. You said he supports the idea of a poll but will have to spend time studying the issues first. Anti-nuclear activists said they are not content with this "triumph" and have planned other actions to prevent construction of the plant' Legislator Chou Po-lun said that if the ruling Kuomintang tries to force the budget for the nuclear plant through the legislature next month, he will mobilize Kungliao villagers to form a self-defense force to block the construction of the plant. He said that anti-nuclear groups will begin a series of protests this [words indistinct] the Legislative Yuan Tuesday and National Assembly and the Presidential Office Thursday and stage a large demonstration against the nuclear plant next Sunday.
