Peter Rohac has more to say about their agenda today. [Rohac] [passage omitted] Although both senators are experts in defense and foreign policy, they also have great experience in the working of autonomy and coexistence between citizens of different ethnic backgrounds from their own country. [passage omitted] On the other hand, Peter (Baby), a deputy for the municipal council, expressed the view that the local Hungarians, although Slovak Republic citizens, belonged to the Hungarian nation, which was artificially divided. He alleged that the present Slovak state power was trying to assimilate the Hungarians rather than integrate them into a unified Slovak Republic. Our other state administration representatives reacted against this opposition standpoint. Senator Nestor Hubert Pecriaux, who is a member of the Council of Europe, remarked that they knew about the Hungarian political parties' complaints, but there was no need to dramatize the ethnic minority problem. On the basis of their experience here [in Slovakia], he thought that all who wanted to coexist could prove that this was possible. It is apparently clear that all of the European communities have a different approach to these questions, and it is logical that everybody has the right to organize himself according to how he feels, but, on one condition, and that is that all voters and citizens are satisfied.
