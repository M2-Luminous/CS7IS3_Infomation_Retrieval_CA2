FR940314-1-00013 FR940314-1-00004 Paragraph (d)(3) of the proposal would require that, within the time schedule approved by the FAA, the operator must accomplish the basic tasks in the affected areas on the remaining airplanes in its Model F&hyph;27 series fleet to ensure that any other Level 3 corrosion is detected. Paragraph (e) would require that, upon finding corrosion exceeding Level 1 during a repetitive inspection, an operator must adjust its program to ensure that future corrosion findings are limited to Level 1 or better. Where corrective action is necessary to reduce corrosion to Level 1 or better, an operator must submit a proposal for a means of corrective action for the FAA's approval within 60 days after the determination of corrosion is made. That means, approved by the FAA, must then be implemented to reduce future findings of corrosion in that area to Level 1 or better. With regard to paragraph (e), it should be noted that if corrosion is found and it is not considered representative of the operator's fleet, no further corrective action may be necessary, since a means to reduce any corrosion to Level 1 or better will have already been implemented in the operator's program in accordance with proposed paragraph (a) or (b). For example, if a finding of corrosion is attributable to a particular spill of mercury or other unique event, or if corrosion is found on an airplane recently acquired from another operator, the means specified in the existing program may be adequate for controlling corrosion in the remainder of the operator's fleet. Similarly, if an operator has already implemented means to reduce corrosion in an airplane area based on previous findings, no additional corrective action may be necessary. In reviewing the reports submitted in accordance with the AD, the FAA will monitor the effectiveness of the operator's means to reduce corrosion. If the FAA determines that an operator has failed to implement adequate means to reduce corrosion to Level 1 or better, appropriate action will be taken to ensure compliance with this paragraph. Paragraph (f) of the proposal concerns adding airplanes to an operator's fleet, and the procedures that must be followed with regard to corrosion prevention and control. This paragraph differentiates between procedures applicable to added airplanes that previously were maintained in accordance with this AD and those that were not so maintained. For airplanes that previously have been maintained in accordance with the proposed requirements of this AD action, the first basic task in each aircraft zone to be performed by the new operator would be required to be performed in accordance with either the previous operator's or the new operator's inspection schedule, whichever would result in the earlier accomplishment date for that task. For airplanes that have not been maintained in accordance with the proposed requirements of this AD action, the first basic task in each aircraft zone to be performed by the new operator would be required to be performed before the airplane is placed in service, or in accordance with a schedule approved by the FAA. With regard to the requirements of paragraph (f), the FAA considers it essential that operators ensure that transferred airplanes are inspected in accordance with the baseline corrosion prevention and control program on the same basis as if there were continuity in ownership. Scheduling of the inspections for each airplane must not be delayed or postponed due to a transfer of ownership; in some cases, such postponement could continue indefinitely if an airplane is transferred frequently from one owner to another. The proposed rule would require that the specified procedures be accomplished before any operator places into service any airplane subject to the requirements of the proposed AD. Paragraph (g) of the proposal would require that reports of Level 2 and Level 3 corrosion be submitted to Fokker within certain time periods after such corrosion is detected. A note has been included in this paragraph indicating that reporting to the FAA of any Level 2 or Level 3 corrosion found as a result of any opportunity inspections is highly desirable. Operators are not relieved, however, from reporting corrosion findings as required by FAR section 121.703. The FAA estimates that 55 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. It would take an average of approximately 7 work hours per basic task to accomplish the 75 basic tasks called out in the Document; this represents a total average of 525 work hours. The average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators for the 6-year average inspection cycle is estimated to be $1,588,125, or $28,875 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive. Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD. A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that this cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
