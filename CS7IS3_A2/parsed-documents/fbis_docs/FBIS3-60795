In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, Muhammad Nazzal, Hamas representative in Jordan, said that he "personally met with some of those Western diplomats and officials in the British capital." To spare them embarrassment, Nazzal declined to give the names of the Western diplomats and officials with whom he met. He said: The contacts revolved around Hamas's position on the Gaza-Jericho agreement and other developments in the occupied territories, especially the qualitative military operations that the movement carried out against the occupation troops and settlers. Nazzal said that he explained to those officials that the movement has a clear position regarding the need to continue military action until the occupation is removed. In response to a question on the Israeli occupation authorities' recent contacts with Hamas in the occupied territories, Nazzal said: These contacts were initiated by the Israeli side. They were held with some Hamas officials in Israeli prisons to convince them to ask Hamas leaders outside prison to halt military action. Nazzal revealed that Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation to the negotiations with the Palestinians on withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, is one of those who held such contacts. He stressed that Hamas has rejected those offers because the occupation, which is the justification for the continued military action, is still there. In response to a question, Nazzal denied any contacts between Hamas and Israeli officials outside Israeli prisons. On what has been reported about a cease-fire offered by Hamas, the Hamas representative said that the truth of this offer has been distorted by the Israeli mass media. He said the cease-fire was not comprehensive and final, but was for three days only and covers only the settlers. He noted that this ultimatum is over, and that the al-Qassam battalions have declared a resumption of military operations against the settlers. In response to a question, Nazzal denied that the 10 faction-bloc has broken up. He emphasized that the 10 factions will meet in Damascus on Thursday [31 December]. However, he admitted the existence of differences and various views regarding the organizational formula, which is currently under consideration. He said: The 10-faction bloc will remain the minimum level through which the resistance to the occupation and to any agreement that relinquishes the Palestinian people's rights can continue. He said: Hamas has every respect and appreciation for all its allies in the 10-faction coalition, but it does not want charges to be leveled against it by any of those allies through the media. Nazzal hoped that a "brotherly spirit would prevail between Hamas and its allies." He stressed that "the points of agreement are more than the points of disagreement." Nazzal criticized the "phenomenon of some Palestinian factions' claiming responsibility for some operations that have been carried out by the al-Qassam battalions, especially since the factions that claim responsibility for such operations are among the 10 factions." It is noteworthy that some military operations in the occupied territories were claimed by both Hamas and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The latest operation was the one in which two settlers were killed in Baytuniya near Ramallah.
