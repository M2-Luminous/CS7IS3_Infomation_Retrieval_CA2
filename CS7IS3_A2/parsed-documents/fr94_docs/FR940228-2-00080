Procedures for the conduct of and participation in ACRS meetings were published in the Federal Register on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51118). In accordance with these procedures, oral or written statements may be presented by members of the public, electronic recordings will be permitted only during the open portions of the meeting, and questions may be asked only by members of the Committee, its consultants, and staff. Persons desiring to make oral statements should notify the ACRS Executive Director, Dr. John T. Larkins, as far in advance as practicable so that appropriate arrangements can be made to allow the necessary time during the meeting for such statements. Use of still, motion picture, and television cameras during this meeting may be limited to selected portions of the meeting as determined by the Chairman. Information regarding the time to be set aside for this purpose may be obtained by contacting the ACRS Executive Director prior to the meeting. In view of the possibility that the schedule for ACRS meetings may be adjusted by the Chairman as necessary to facilitate the conduct of the meeting, persons planning to attend should check with the ACRS Executive Director if such rescheduling would result in major inconvenience. I have determined in accordance with Subsection 10(d) Public Law 92&hyph;463 that it is necessary to close portions of this meeting noted above to discuss information that involves the internal personnel rules and practices of this advisory Committee per 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(2), and to discuss information the release of which would represent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy per 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(6). Further information regarding topics to be discussed, whether the meeting has been cancelled or rescheduled, the Chairman's ruling on requests for the opportunity to present oral statements and the time allotted therefor can be obtained by contacting the ACRS Executive Director, Dr. John T. Larkins (telephone 301&hyph;492&hyph;4516), between 7:30 a.m. and 4:15 p.m. EST. Dated: February 22, 1994. John C. Hoyle, Advisory Committee Management Officer.
