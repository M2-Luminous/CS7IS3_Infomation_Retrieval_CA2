Snegur spoke in favor of an agreement on mutual settlement in an interview with Interfax. "It is not normal when a country cannot settle its accounts with another country," Snegur stressed. He also pointed out that Moldova was interested in signing another document concerning the human rights of ethnic minorities within the CIS. Snegur considered it a mutual commitment towards ethnic minorities in the CIS republics. Snegur said he had no worry about this issue in Moldova. He stated that all linguistic problems had been resolved and that Moldova had the most democratic law on citizenship (which automatically grants Moldovan citizenship to everyone living on its territory). Commenting on Kazakhstan's initiative on the establishment of a Eurasian union, Snegur said he had not had enough time to examine it in detail. "If this means the establishment of a new structure similar to the CIS, it will be better to make the CIS work. The idea of the CIS itself is good, at least we need a single economic space. If Nazarbayev's proposal is a hidden attempt to reestablish the former Soviet Union, Moldova would not be in favor," Snegur stressed.
