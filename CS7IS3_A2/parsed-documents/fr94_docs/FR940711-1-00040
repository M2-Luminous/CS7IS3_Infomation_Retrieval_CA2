ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy proposes to amend the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation (DEAR) to establish DOE policies and procedures for establishing a program to achieve a ten percent goal for awards of prime contracts and subcontracts for specific types of universities and of small disadvantaged concerns, including women-owned businesses, in the implementation of section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. DATES: Written comments on this proposed rule must be received by September 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to: Robert M. Webb, Office of Policy (HR&hyph;521), Office of Procurement and Assistance Management, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, D.C. 20585.

Discussion Section 3021(a) of Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486) requires that DOE, to the extent practicable, provide that the obligation of not less than 10 percent of the total combined amounts obligated for contracts and subcontracts pursuant to competitive procedures be expended with small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals or by women, historically Black colleges and universities, or colleges and universities having a student body in which more than 20 percent of the students are Hispanic Americans or Native Americans. DOE today proposes to amend the DEAR to establish DOE policies and procedures for implementing section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act. The proposed amendments would add a new Part 926, Other Socioeconomic Programs, as the primary regulatory coverage concerning section 3021 requirements. Part 952 would also be amended to add solicitation provisions and contract clauses needed to effect section 3021 requirements in procurement actions. Finally, Part 970 would be amended to address the application of section 3021 to DOE management and operating (M&O) contracts. The specific amendments to the DEAR needed to implement the requirements of section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act are described below. This rulemaking provides changes to the DEAR that will supersede an earlier internal DOE directive that provided guidance to DOE employees on the implementation of section 3021. The policies implementing the legislation are tailored to achieve the intent of Congress in enacting section 3021, but they go beyond previous contracting and subcontracting mechanisms which have been used to meet participation goals for small disadvantaged business DOE contracts and subcontracts. DOE interprets section 3021 of EPACT as requiring the accomplishment of expanded contracting and subcontracting goals and as providing DOE with the discretion to find appropriate methods to do this. DOE believes that its approach to implementing the requirements of section 3021 is consistent with both the intent of the Congress in passing the legislation and the long-standing policies of the Government to place a fair proportion of contracts with small businesses and small disadvantaged business and to offer maximum practicable opportunity to those organizations to participate as subcontractors. B. Section-by-Section Analysis The regulations at 48 CFR Part 9 are proposed to be amended to add a new part 926, Other Socioeconomic Programs, consisting of Subpart 926.70, Implementation of Section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
