Among others the gathering was addressed by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, president of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR]. SNO representatives pointed out that the meeting was organized to mark the 49th anniversary of the victory against fascism and as a harbinger of the upcoming Serbian victory. Addressing the rally, Zhirinovskiy said that Russia would get a new government and a new president soon. "The day after we will renew all our relations with Yugoslavia and Serbia, sending you all necessary aid, including military aid," Zhirinovskiy said. According to him, a new holiday will be marked soon -- "the day when the last foreign soldier left the Balkans, the day when sanctions against Yugoslavia are suspended." Zhirinovskiy said that if representatives of the Serbian nation ask the Russian Parliament for aid, "hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers would soon arrive in the Balkans." Expressing his opinion that the conflict in the Balkans could escalate, Zhirinovskiy said that "If NATO and the Muslim world begin a third world war" the Slavs would celebrate 9 May in the future "in all Western cities," while all capitals of NATO members "would be dealt with in the same way as with Berlin in 1945." He pointed out that the Russians do not have to fight. "We will just let our defective nuclear submarines sail toward the West and that will be the end of Western Europe," Zhirinovskiy said.
