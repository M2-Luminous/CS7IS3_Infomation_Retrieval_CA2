What do you think was the cause of the breakdown? A Gap Between Supply and Demand [Kobayashi] I think it was the fact that the Japanese side did not fully understand what President Clinton wanted. The political reality which surrounds President Clinton is severe. President Clinton defeated President Bush by criticizing his weak policy toward Japan. Against this background, he had to get visible results from Japan. They may have been too optimistic in reading the situation, assuming that "even if things were not satisfactory, he would not corner Mr. Hosokawa," because they thought the president felt favorably toward Mr. Hosokawa. Of course, on the Japanese side there was the political reality surrounding Mr. Hosokawa and the fact he could not fully respond to President Clinton's demands. There was a gap between supply and demand. [Nakajima] What was it that President Clinton wanted that the Japanese side did not fully understand? [Kobayashi] He was looking for a macropolicy which would make a strong impression, such as an increase in domestic demand, measures to buoy up business conditions, and so on. The president said clearly at the news conference that he did not seek numerical targets. [Nakajima] The Japanese side maintains that the talks broke down because of numerical targets. [Kobayashi] President Clinton said he was not seeking numerical targets, but objective standards by which market opening could be judged. He even declared that he would not use the semiconductor agreement as a model. Numerical targets are a sectoral issue. The effect individual sectoral targets have on the overall problem is not significant. We must attack the trade issue with a 70-80 percent macroeconomic policy. Why did we have the framework talks to begin with? The U.S.-Japan Structural Impediment Initiative was a similar case: It derived from the worry that we had to do something to deal with U.S. feelings that the Japanese market was closed. Individual industries are a problem; but above all else the issue is a macroeconomic one. Macroeconomic measures can be effective, hence a selling point in the proposals. But in Japan's proposals, there was nothing that could be called macroeconomic measures. But in the Japanese proposal, there was nothing you could describe as good macropolicy. [Nakajima] What is your feeling about the reaction of the American business sector? Microeconomy Was Sacrificed [Kobayashi] They see that something has to be done about the stark reality of the huge Japanese trade surplus. This is a worldwide problem. But each industry has a different view of individual retaliatory measures. It is not a situation in which one industry stirs up another by saying "go after them, go after them." We have to take it case by case. It is not going to be all-out war. But there were also those who said although 95 percent of the U.S. businessmen present were Republican supporters, they would support the current president's policy 100 percent. It was not Japan-bashing. They realized that unless the U.S. Government followed a moderate and balanced policy, it would be the United States which would get hurt. Nonetheless, the proposals Japan brought to Washington were not well received. [Nakajima] What about the view that the reason the talks broke down was because the U.S.-Japan relationship has matured? [Kobayashi] I don't think we should attach that much meaning to them. It was President Clinton who first said no. He said no because he could not evaluate our macroeconomic policy. I understand that they had arrived at the stage where there was partial agreement on some individual sectors. They had approached a workable stage on insurance, for example, but in the end the talks broke down because there was no macroeconomic policy to follow and an agreement on insurance was sacrificed as a result. As far as the microeconomy is concerned, there is still room to achieve results by continuing the negotiations. [Nakajima] What do you think must be done to satisfy U.S. requirements on macroeconomic policy? There Is No `Worst Case Situation' [Kobayashi] For the expansion of domestic demand and an upturn in economic conditions, we need something more than a policy which is good for one year, we need something which will take us into the future. A tax cut which lasts for only one year will not satisfy the United States, even if it was acceptable in Japan. Deregulation is also necessary. I do not mean to follow the lead of President Clinton, but the attitudes of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Finance are also a problem. The microeconomy should not stop at the war of rhetoric, but make actual progress, but the macroeconomic policy is the issue on which everything is at stake. The United States will lose patience if our reaction is simply to say that the talks broke down because the United States demanded numerical targets, and that the United States wants a managed trade system and Japan opposes them because it is pursuing a free trade policy. In the private sector there is enough ground for individual industries to make good progress. I think it is better to leave the industrial issues to the private sector. What the Japanese side worries about is that even efforts toward industry-based targets can be construed as a government promise. However, the highest authority in the United States, President Clinton himself, has said very clearly that he will not use the semiconductor agreement as a standard. I think we should believe him. [Nakajima] What do people in the United States think about the way Motorola gets the government to take action? [Kobayashi] Most consider Motorola an exceptional case. But since there is no other good precedent, when it comes to a case study, Motorola is used. However, there are also those who say the Motorola method is not a good one, and that the government should refrain from giving special support to a specific enterprise. [Nakajima] There is a pessimistic line of argument that says that U.S.-Japanese relations are following a dangerous course if events continue the way they are at the moment. [Kobayashi] I do not think relations will degenerate as far as some believe, there is no merit in that for either side. The key will be how much of a positive contribution the Japanese side can offer to deal with the political reality that President Clinton is confronting. Depending on the degree of that contribution, will be the point at which the United States lowers the fist it has raised.
