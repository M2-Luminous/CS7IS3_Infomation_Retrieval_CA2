In 1986 the Ministry of Public Health launched on unprecedented large-scale study on parasitic infection. According to the report given in the "National Survey on Distribution of Human Parasites," 62.6 percent of Chinese people are infected with 56 kinds of parasites, among them, 19 are protozoa, 16 flukes, 12 nematodes (eelworms), eight cestodes (tapeworms), and one thornheaded worm. The Taiwan thornbelt fluke found in Fujian, tiny spinous fluke and narrow testis thornmouth fluke found in Anhui and Fujian, are the two first time-reported parasites, and the Fujian spinous fluke is a newly-discovered species in China. There are more unidentified newly-discovered parasites found in every province. According to the report, among 147,7742 [as printed] people surveyed, 10.315 percent are infected with protozoa, 0.573 percent with flukes, 0.195 percent with cestodes, 59.022 percent with nematodes, and 43.33 percent of the surveyed population are cross-infected with two or more kinds of parasites, some are even infected with nine kinds of parasites. Some children under five years old are already infected with six kinds of parasites. Higher roundworm (46.999 percent), hookworm (17.166 percent) and whipworm (18.796 percent) infections are also reported in the above surveyed population. The data indicate that in China, by estimate, about 531 million people are infected with roundworms, 194 million with hookworms, and 212 million with whipworms.
