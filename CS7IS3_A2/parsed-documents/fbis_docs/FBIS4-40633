FBIS4-40633 "drsov118_d_94006" FBIS-SOV-94-118 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 Regional Affairs Shakhray: Emergency Situation Regarding Supplies to North Shakhray: Emergency Situation Regarding Supplies to North LD1706215794 LD1706215794 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian at 1118 GMT on 17 June broadcasts a report from Krasnoyarsk where Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray is leading a special commission at work there today. He assessed the situation regarding the delivery of cargo to the Russian far north as an "emergency." He says that the Russian Government will do everything possible to ensure that fuel and food are delivered in full to the northerners, though there will be difficulties with technical cargo and building materials, most of which have not yet been delivered to the river and sea ports. The Yenisey River Shipping Line manager has said that only a third of its 2,200 vessels are ready for the navigation season since customers have failed to pay for the 1993 delivery season and conclude new agreements for this season. This has resulted in many of the staff being sent off on enforced holidays. Some have started resigning. It was pointed out at a meeting between the government commission and heads of administration of the northern regions of Krasnoyarsk Kray and the Taymir and Evenkiy autonomous districts that money had been allocated from the federal budget, but only for the delivery of goods. Shakhray told ITAR-TASS on the issue of northerners leaving the north that a total flight of people from there should be prevented. Northerners should be given assistance in relocation. He hopes that they will be relocated to eastern regions of Russia where the climate is similar to that of the northern regions and where the jobs' issue is not so difficult. Shakhray stresses that the Russian north and polar regions are very important to the country's economy and they have a future. People should work on a shift basis and not live there permanently. The deputy prime minister also points out at a final news conference that "in spite of all the economic difficulties, we will continue to allocate money for the needs of the indigenous peoples of the north. These people have nowhere to go and they must have a humane standard of living."
