Kalinin and Cand Naval Science G. Morozov: "The Black Sea Fleet and the New Russian Military Doctrine"] [Text] The present stage of transformations in the Armed Forces and the Navy requires a new approach to evaluating the role and place of the Black Sea Fleet in the life of Russia and other CIS states. Historical experience shows that the Navy played far from the last role in determining Russia's fate. The fleet's significance rose especially under Peter I, when his forces attained the Baltic and Azov seas. It was then that Russia became a naval power. Today, despite easing of the world situation and the agreements with the United States and countries of the European community on armed forces reductions, it is obviously premature to totally exclude the possibility of military actions directed against the Commonwealth of Independent States as a whole and against any of its members in particular. Centers of tension still exist in the world--in the Near and Middle East, in Central America [sic; Asia?]. Some regions in Africa, in the Balkans and in other areas are restless. And in general, for that matter, there's a sense of anxiety in the world community. States are regrouping, policies of certain states are being reoriented, and formation of new blocs, commonwealths and so on can be discerned. All of this is generating instability in the world situation, and harbors explosions and conflicts. It is difficult to overstate the place and role of the Azov and Black seas in Russia's life on the modern road of historical development. We are astonished in this connection with the position taken by the leadership of the Russian Federation and Ukraine in relation to the fate of the Black Sea Fleet--a position that is leading to its disintegration and gradual liquidation. The lines of communication in the Black Sea that must be defended are something Russia and the CIS need in order to enter the world economy, and to develop multilateral ties with the world community in the southern sector. Having lost over 20 major ports owing to the collapse of the USSR, Russia is now experiencing difficulties in marine shipping in this region. The objective necessity for increasing marine cargo traffic will force its government to expand existing port facilities and build new major ports and terminals in the vicinity of the Kiziltashskiy Estuary and rayons adjacent to it. In addition the coastline from Taganrog to Adler is around 1,000 km long. It would be impossible to defend all of this from invasion, seizure and attacks from the sea without a modern fleet. And as reality shows, now that the fighting capability of the armed forces has decreased somewhat due to ill-conceived reform, Russia's neighbors have immediately started making territorial claims upon it, covertly in some instances and openly in others, while in certain of its marine economic zones resources are literally being plundered without any countermeasures. The situation in the Black Sea is changing as well. A certain decrease in the potential of the Black Sea Fleet is making it possible for Turkey to become the real boss of the Black Sea, upon which it is making claims at various forums being conducted in this region. A certain "interest" in the Black Sea has also arisen on the part of the command of the U.S. Navy and NATO. Despite assurances that the United States and Russia are not adversaries, the Pentagon is nonetheless finishing its work of drafting political agreements on stationing ship formations (groups) in Bulgaria and Romania. Given the existing range of Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships against naval targets--500 km, and against objectives on land--2,000 km, U.S. and NATO ships will be able to hit targets in Ukraine, Moldova, the Transcaucasus, in the south of Russia and Belarus from the vicinity of Burgas and Constanta. Consequently one need not be a great strategist to understand the damage caused by loss of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia and other CIS states. On acquainting ourselves with the basic provisions of the Russian Federation's military doctrine, we are confronted by many puzzling questions regarding discrepancies between the doctrine's provisions and reality. Thus, "build-up of troop groupings (forces) by the borders of the Russian Federation to levels disturbing the existing correlation of forces" is named among the factors promoting escalation of the military danger into a direct military threat to the Russian Federation. However, for practical purposes the collapse of the Black Sea Fleet has already altered the correlation of forces with the Turkish Navy that had existed on the Black Sea prior to 1991 from 2:1 in favor of Russia to 1:1 in late 1993. And this correlation continues to change in Turkey's favor. The doctrine goes on to say that in order to deter a potential aggressor "the combat potential of peacetime general-purpose troop (force) groupings is being maintained at a level ensuring repulsion of aggression of a local (regional) scale." Juxtaposing this postulate with reality, we can say once again that what is being done in relation to the Black Sea Fleet is hardly supported by the basic provisions of the doctrine. It is written in the doctrine that the armed forces accept the responsibility "for providing for action by the UN Security Council and other international organizations to support or restore international peace and security at the earliest possible stage of development of a threatening situation or conflict." But for practical purposes no real measures are being undertaken to preserve the potential of the Black Sea Fleet. On the contrary this potential is gradually decreasing. What kind of forces would be needed to carry out the missions foreseen by the doctrine in the most explosive contiguous regions of the Near East, North Africa and the Balkans? We've forgotten the wise counsel of our predecessors regarding the need for maintaining a strong fleet in the Black Sea. Experience shows that in these uncertain times the Black Sea Fleet has already carried out peacekeeping missions in Abkhazia and in the vicinity of Poti. The Black Sea Fleet is a necessity not only to Russia but also to all CIS states. "The main goal of developing the armed forces written in the doctrine is to create and develop troops (forces) capable of providing for the defense of the country's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the safety of citizens and other vitally important interests of society and the state, corresponding to the military, political and strategic situation in the world...with regard for the country's geopolitical and geostrategic position." We need to dwell on this premise in greater detail. The collapse of the former Union gives Turkey a chance to resurrect its past might, which is obviously something its government is striving to do. Its political actions and demarche in Azerbaijan, Nakhichevan and the Central Asian republics and rearmament of its army and navy can be examples of this. Statements are being made that the Caspian Sea is a Muslim sea. And certain historians are even prophesying domination by Turkic-language nations in the next century. Exercises of Turkey's 3d Field Army by the southern borders of the CIS and an increase in frequency of visits to the Black Sea by NATO ships also raise red flags. Having become independent, our former union republics are now gravitating more and more toward rapprochement with Russia. Thus, Azerbaijan and Georgia recently joined the Commonwealth. Steps are being taken toward integrating measures to ensure collective security. We are coming to understand the indisputable fact that on its own, not one of the former republics of the Union is able to maintain armed forces corresponding to the proclaimed principle of reasonable sufficiency of forces for defense. And this pertains first of all to ship building. Modern ship building, development of the infrastructure and maintenance of the fleet require superlarge economic expenditures, which not a single CIS state will be able to make on its own under current conditions. The optimum solution is for the CIS to have a unified fleet in the Black Sea, which up until this time has been a guarantee of stability in this region. The Black Sea Fleet will carry out missions in the interests of all states of the Commonwealth: protecting their shores from invasion and attacks from the sea, covering administrative and industrial centers and troops in coastal regions, providing for the freedom and safety of navigation and the productive activity of vessels of civilian departments in the southern sector and fishing grounds, and participating in peacekeeping missions in the Black and Mediterranean seas, and in the Near and Middle East. Considering the missions and the defensive orientation of military doctrine, the Black Sea Fleet must be founded upon highly maneuverable forces, shore-based missile systems, and naval attack aviation capable of decisively parrying the blows of an adversary. In order to defend shipping interests in the Mediterranean Sea and in fishing grounds, the fleet must contain formations of large and midsized surface ships capable of fulfilling their mission. But if Russia is serious about participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions, as the doctrine says, then the fleet must contain amphibious forces consisting of fast amphibious warfare ships and marine infantry. Threatening no one, and existing under Russian jurisdiction, the Black Sea Fleet will have to maintain parity on the southern flank of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and provide protection to the considerable economic traffic linking them to all continents. The majority of politicians in Russia and other CIS states are now beginning to understand the obvious truth that neither the West nor states of the NATO bloc need a strong Russia, or any of the individual states of the Commonwealth. This is why all of the West's promises of aid and assurances of friendship give way to practical actions sharply contrasting with its prior mealy-mouthed assurances. And it would be naive to expect that the United States and its allies, who have the power, will concede there interests in Grenada or Panama, in the Persian Gulf or the Baltic, in the Black Sea or in the Near East, or in the World Ocean as a whole. If Russia and the CIS generally want to be a power to reckon with, they cannot allow sharp reduction of the fighting capability of the armed forces as a whole and of the Black Sea Fleet in particular, which are a powerful tool in resolving political issues in the southern sector. If we fail to preserve and improve the Black Sea Fleet and its infrastructure through combined effort today, in the future we will have to overstress the economy and impose a severe burden upon the peoples of the Commonwealth to restore the former might of the fleet, and a breach will appear in the collective defensive system of the CIS in the southern sector, into which interested western and southern neighbors will immediately try to drive a wedge.
