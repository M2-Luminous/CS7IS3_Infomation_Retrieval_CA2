Nakamura said in a statement through his lawyer that the truth and substance of the bribery scandal would be distorted if he were to agree to be questioned by prosecutors. He said he would rather have prosecutors issue a warrant of arrest to "get it settled once and for all in court." Prosecutors have requested permission to issue an arrest warrant against Nakamura, who has repeatedly refused to voluntarily present himself to prosecutors for questioning on suspicion of taking the 10 million yen bribe from leading general contractor Kajima Corp. in 1992.
