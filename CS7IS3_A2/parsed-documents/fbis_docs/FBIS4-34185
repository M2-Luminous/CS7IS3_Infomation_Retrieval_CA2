They all believe they have the solution to each and every one of Colombia's problems. The truth is, however, they may all know many things, but most of them do not really know how the people live, how you live. They have never seen the places you call home. They do not know the effort it takes to pay bills or to stretch your budget to try to make ends meet. They do not have to worry, as you do, about how to educate your children and provide the opportunities for new jobs in a new economy. The experts, the economists, and ranking officials do not have in their homes the staples that you can barely afford on your salary. They have not seen you sweating as you work. They do not live the life of anguish you live. The time has come to have a government and president who will be in contact with you and your problems, who will understand that behind every abstract and cold word, words that fill the socioeconomic policy documents, there are men and women of flesh and blood who have a heart and soul and real frustrations and illusions. Due to old political machines, they have been disillusioned because thousands of promises have not been kept one election after another, because many things were said but not done. The time has come to have a president who believes and governs, inspired by the will to change, with the conviction that what is good for the people is good for Colombia. As you know, I do not come from a family that has lacked opportunities. Some time ago, before,and during this campaign, I worked to understand the problems Colombians face, not only as they appear in the documents which my advisers have prepared or in the lectures by experts, but through face-to-face contact with each and every one of you, learning firsthand of your anguishes and difficulties. You and I have shared moments in your neighborhoods and communities, throughout the length and breadth of the country. For me, the most important thing of this campaign is not the thousands of people who have thronged enthusiastically to attend the rallies or pack the plazas in small cities and towns. The most valuable thing about this effort has been the opportunity to talk to thousands of Colombians, person by person, in the country, on our coasts, and in the poorest neighborhoods of our cities. All of them have had something to say and something to contribute. You and I can learn many important things from statistics, but statistics do not breathe. Statistics do not cry, in fact, they do not care if Colombia achieves a change. If a change is not achieved, different figures will follow. With your common sense, you are the experts from whom I have learned the most. The people, with their votes, are the ones who have always given me the posts I have held. I have never been appointed to a public post because I have never been part of the machinery; that is what has inspired me to have faith in this campaign. If you give me the opportunity, I will govern from the Presidency with a profound commitment in my heart and conscience, with the determination to return to my fatherland at least a little of what it has given me. I have heard thousands of questions from the people, and they all reflect what is most important for each one of them. I am seeking the Presidency to truly serve the people. I have not improvised in accordance with changes reflected in the polls, but I have presented a comprehensive program of changes that I have discussed with you on television, radio, in our multiple face-ta- face meetings with the people. I am certain that you have not found contradictions or opportunism in this program. Our program offers new jobs, not as a simple slogan repeated to obtain votes, but these are actual, productive, well-paying jobs based on the creation of new companies and the attraction of new investments to the cities and countryside as well as the development of the capability and qualifications of all Colombians. We have provided for training and the qualification of more than 2 million workers by strengthening the National Apprenticeship Services, initiating a revolution in education that will allow each child between the ages of five and 15 years to go to school, and by upgrading training centers that will open the doors to job opportunities for 99 percent of Colombian youths who have not had access to universities. For this, I will personally make it my responsibility that those who have the honorable task of being teachers of the new generations will once again be awarded the place of esteem they deserve with good working conditions, facilities to develop their tasks, and a fitting salary that recognizes the importance of their work for our present and our future. Only by doing this will our people be prepared to receive betterment and our nation able to offer good jobs with good 21st century salaries. Definitely, the way to confront, without deceit, the cost of living is to give Colombians the possibility of learning more to achieve a better standard of living. In developing our government program, we will construct 660,000 new housing units for compatriots who need them, and we will take potable water to more than 10 million Colombians. More than being good for the economy, it is the government's moral obligation to make all Colombians participants of prosperity. As president, I will not privatize any of the government's basic services. The political establishment is trying to scare our people by lying in this regard. They do not want it to be known that the people who work for the government are good and qualified. Those who are not good or qualified are certain politicians who regard the government as booty. To this I say the response is not to attack the workers; the response is to defeat the old political establishment. Our program also provides for strong action to combat insecurity in the cities and countryside. In the struggle against guerrilla violence, what is needed is a dynamic strategy that will prevent any delay in the dream for peace. I have already said the government does not choose between war and peace. The government must protect the lives, honor, assets, and human rights of all Colombians. Make no mistake: We will not compromise in this task. If the guerrillas are truly determined to achieve peace, I will personally sit down to negotiate with them on concrete bases to achieve concrete results. In my government, I will not permit a dialogue by deaf people, a dialogue that would lead to nowhere while extortions, kidnappings, murders, and the blowing up of pipelines continue. I have been proposing for quite a while a strategy aimed at eliminating obligatory military service and replacing it with a professional army, an army well paid and well equipped in order to defend us all. I have been proposing this for some time, through conviction and not because a poll has indicated this is a popular position; this is why I did not have to change my opinion during the campaign. Nevertheless, this will not be the only type of insecurity we will fight. We will continue our intense struggle against drug trafficking and narcoterrorism and we will combat with full force the crime that has taken over our cities. In conjunction with the military forces we will strengthen the police, intelligence, and investigative institutions, and we will create expert armed corps to deal with muggers, apartment burglars, car thieves, and all other urban mafias. There is another issue that has been floating about during this campaign, an issue poised as a dark shadow over our democracy, an issue that has influenced our people not to vote, despite the longing for change. How can you know if the promises a candidate has made will be kept once he reaches power? In my opinion, there is only one valid answer: Colombia does not need any more candidates who chase the people's votes. We need a president who will again listen to the voices of Colombians. For a long time, for many generations, politicians have appealed to you. They have made you promises, and you in turn have responded with your support, but once they reach the Presidency, you never see them again, except when the presidential motorcade passes by with its guards and sirens. They do not think about you again because your problems quickly fade from the mind of the presidential politician. I am bent on changing this. The change I intend to implement and which I will explain to you now will be fundamental so that all the other changes we want will come about. The president will take office on 7 August. On that day, I will not limit myself to entering Narino Palace and not coming out again. On 7 September, I will take all my ministers to a small town for a face-to-face meeting with the people. The people will be able to ask questions at this time and tell us how they think we started our administration, where we are making mistakes, or where we have not done enough. They can also suggest to us another way of doing things. On the seventh day of every month during my Presidency, I will hold a meeting, face to face, in a poor neighborhood, or in the countryside, a school, or a university, in different parts of the country. On the seventh day of each month during my Presidency, I will consult with the real experts, the real polls, the real advisers -- the Colombian people. As president, I will go back to the people the seventh day of every month for a face-to-face meeting. I am not asking you to vote only for a change. I am asking you to form part of this change. You already embarked on this change on 29 May, but your responsibility does not end on 19 June. We will meet again as we have done throughout this campaign on the seventh day of each month. Power will be in your hands, in the hands of the people. The president will be there to hear you, and I will take your concerns back with me to the Presidency of the Republic. Your vote plus one will equal victory on 19 June, not the victory of a candidate, but a victory of a cause, for a government that is genuinely of the people and not only dubbed with that name, a victory for a government that is not isolated at the presidential palace but, rather, a victory for a government in permanent contact with the people, a victory for a leadership that responds with actions to the millions of Colombians who have fallen behind or have been left off the road to progress. Those of the establishment, their bureaucratic quotas, and their politicians are working overtime and at full speed to hold back the change, but your vote plus one on 19 June will be more powerful than that old political establishment. Your vote plus one will be the most powerful voice of Colombia on that day. Do not allow that old establishment to score a win. Give me your support, and your voice will be heard on election day and during the next four years. Give me your support, and together we will change Colombia on 19 June and every day of my Presidency. Together, let us take a risk to change and struggle and make Colombia the nation of which we all dream. I ask today that you and I, together, be the ones to change Colombia.
