General Khazheyev mentioned that it is unreal for the withdrawal to take place by 1 July 1994. He said that several years are needed for the 14th Army's withdrawal. He also pointed out that Dniester representatives who take part in the negotiations will have the possibility to make public their position on this matter. Khazheyev said that he is confused that the Dniester representatives took part in the negotiations only as observers. "The Dniester Republic should take part in the talks with full rights," he said. Khazheyev pointed out that the Tiraspol Supreme Soviet's decision to pass the 14th Army's property to Dniester will not be annulled.
