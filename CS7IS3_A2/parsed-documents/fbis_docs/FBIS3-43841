Foremost among the problems faced by the newspaper was a R[rand]1.5 million defamation suit brought against it and the Weekly Mail by former police forensics chief Lieutenant-General Lothar Neethling. The papers published stories in 1989 linking Neethling to death squad activities by allegedly providing poisons and knockout drops to former police captain Dirk Coetzee. The Supreme Court found the stories were true on overwhelming probability, a judgment that was overturned by the Appeal Court. The amount of compensation still has to be determined. Du Preez was unrepentant, saying he would not have done anything different. "Our closure will leave a vacuum, but we played an interesting role. My regret is not being part of the election coverage. This effectively gives Nasionale Pers a monopoly of election coverage in the Afrikaans press." Du Preez and his 10 editorial staff members are now looking for jobs, but he added that he had been approached last year to present one edition of AGENDA on TV1 each week.
