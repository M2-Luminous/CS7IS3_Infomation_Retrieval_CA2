We draw our dear viewers attention to this interview. [Correspondent] The deputies and various commissions of the Islamic Majles have proposed amendments to the Budget Bill for the year 1373, some of which were ratified. The Majles has approved the ceiling for the revenue earned from the sale of oil, and also the revenue from taxation. I would like to ask Mr. Masud Roghani Zanjani to explain the government's revenue for the year 1373 and the effect of the Majles amendments. [Zanjani] Up until now, that is 725 [figure not further clarified], the total revenue originally proposed by the government is reduced by 3 trillion rials. Since we are in the second reading of the expenditure debate, it is not yet clear how the esteemed Majles intends to distribute the cut among various departments. No doubt there will be some cuts in the current expenditure and some in the [long-term] development plans. It is certainly clear that if we were to put this into practice, it would be impossible to implement some of the country's current plans. We have to wait and see what policies the Majles will adopt vis-a-vis the expenditure now that revenue is reduced. [Correspondent] What sort of price have you envisaged for a barrel of oil to reach the figure of revenue ceiling from the oil sale? And what will be the daily production figure? [Zanjani] The Majles has compiled the budget at [estimated figure of] 13 dollars [per barrel]; whereas the government's figure was different. For the same reason the oil revenue is reduced. [Correspondent] What about taxation? [Zanjani] The Majles has proposed increased taxation figure. That is, we had proposed taxation revenue of 6.4 trillion [rials]; whereas, the esteemed Majles has proposed 7.88 trillion rials for the time being. The figure has not been finalized yet.
