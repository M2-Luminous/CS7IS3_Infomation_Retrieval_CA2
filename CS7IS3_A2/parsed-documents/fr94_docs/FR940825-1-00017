FR940825-1-00017 FR940825-1-00002 6. Width and Capacity of Means of Egress (a) The capacity of the means of egress for any floor, balcony, tier, or other occupied space shall be sufficient for the occupant load thereof. (b) The minimum exit width shall not be less than 28 inches for existing ATCTs and not less than 36 inches for new ATCTs. (c) Exit width shall be measured in the clear at the narrowest point of the means of egress. (d) A door during its swing shall not reduce the width of the means of egress to one-half of the required exit width. (e) When fully open, a door shall not project more than 7 inches into the required width of an aisle, corridor, passageway, or landing. (f) Where a single way of exit access leads to an exit, its capacity in terms of width shall be at least equal to the required capacity of the exit to which it leads. Where more than one way of exit access leads to an exit, each shall have a width adequate for the number of persons it must accommodate. (g) Means of egress shall be measured in inches per person. The ATCT egress capacity shall be 0.3 inch per person for stairways and 0.2 inch per person for level components. (1) Level Egress Components. (including Class A Ramps). If an entry doorway has 28 inches clear width, a discharge doorway has 28 inches clear width, and a stairway is 30 inches wide, the egress capacity would be 100 persons, or the smallest of the three capacities. Example: 28 in./0.2 = 140 persons for the entry doorway 28 in./0.2 = 140 persons for the discharge doorway 30 in./0.3 = 100 persons for the stairway (2) Inclined Egress Components (including Class B Ramps). For Class B ramps used for ascent, the width per person shall be increased by 10 percent beyond what is required for Class A ramps. Widths for Class B ramps used for descent shall be calculated the same as for Class A ramps. (h) A ramp shall be designated as Class A or Class B based on the following table: ␣ 1␣ 1Class A 1Class B Minimum width 44 inches 30 inches. Maximum slope 1 in 10 1 in 8. Maximum height between landings 12 feet 12 feet.
