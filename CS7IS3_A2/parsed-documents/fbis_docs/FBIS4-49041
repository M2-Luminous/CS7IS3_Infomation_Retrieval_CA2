AMOCO is a big enterprise occupying an important position in the international oil and natural gas field. It began cooperation with China in oil exploration and production and petrochemical industry in the late seventies. It is the first U.S. company to sign an agreement with China on oil exploration on land. It also participates in the development of oil fields in the South China Sea. AMOCO Chairman (Lawrence Fuller) and others accorded a warm reception to the visiting Chinese guests at the company's head office in an 80 story building in the center of Chicago. He reviewed the company's fruitful cooperation with China in the past and presented a concept of further participating in China's energy development. Zou Jiahua expressed his appreciation and support for AMOCO's policy and plan that attach importance to long-term cooperation with China. At a banquet hosted by (Fuller) in honor of Zou Jiahua and his party in the evening, (Fuller) said he believed Vice Premier Zou Jiahua's visit will play a role in promoting the company's friendly cooperation with China as well as the development of U.S.-Chinese relations. Addressing the banquet, Zou Jiahua expressed thanks to AMOCO for its efforts for the unconditional renewal of the most-favored-nation status by the United States for China and for its support for the restoration of China's position as a GATT signatory. He said economic relations and trade between the two countries have enjoyed continuous development through the joint efforts of the Chinese and American peoples, U.S. industrial and commercial enterprises, and U.S. personages with breadth of vision. He pointed out that there is a very strong possibility for Chinese and U.S. economies to supplement each other, and that economic relations and trade between the two will surely further enjoy rapid development so long as both sides solve the problems that crop up on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Prior to the banquet, the China National Petroleum Corporation and AMOCO signed a "letter of intent on cooperation in conducting research in coal seam and gas at areas south of the Eerduosi Pendi [Basin]." In the morning, Zou Jiahua and his party visited Motorola, Inc. near Chicago.
