FR940826-0-00021 FR940826-0-00008 When that exemption provision was established in the early 1970's, the quantities of raisins exported to Mexico were relatively small and were of off-grade quality. It was determined at that time that the export exemption would not interfere with order regulations or with accomplishing program objectives. Diminished demand in recent years for off-grade raisins and raisin residual material for distillation in California has made export in natural condition to Mexico a relatively lucrative market. The Committee has confirmed reports that large volumes of poor quality raisins, including lots as large as forty to fifty thousand pounds, have been exported into Mexico from southern California and other areas of California. This is a significant departure from the situation which existed when the exemption was first implemented. Raisins from areas which are not exempt from the provisions of the order appear to be passing into Mexico in violation of the regulations. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has effected the removal of import duties and license requirements, opening the Mexican market to raisins which meet the quality requirements of the order. Hence, there is now an opportunity to build an export market in Mexico for high quality raisins. The Committee believes that all raisins eligible for export to Mexico need to be subject to the quality requirements of the order. The Committee also believes that the regulation of such raisins is essential to meeting program objectives and improving compliance efforts. On the basis of this information, the Committee, on April 16, 1994, unanimously recommended the removal of the exemption that applies to raisins produced from grapes dried on the vine in southern California and exported in natural condition to Mexico. Notice of this action was published in the Federal Register on July 15, 1994 [59 FR 36093]. The proposed rule provided a 15-day comment period which ended August 1, 1994. No comments were received. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's unanimous recommendation and other information, it is found that the issuance of this final rule, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this final rule until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The 1994&hyph;95 crop year began August 1, 1994, and the final rule should cover as much of the crop year as possible to accomplish program objectives and improve compliance efforts; (2) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting; and (3) the proposed rule provided a 15-day comment period, and no comments were received.
