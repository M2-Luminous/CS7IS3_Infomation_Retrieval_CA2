The CIS presidents have met in the Kremlin and the prime ministers in the President Hotel, says a Presidential Press Service communique released from Moscow. After the meeting of the CIS presidents, Mircea Snegur signed the document of joining the CIS with the proper amendments. The amendments say that Moldova as a CIS member will not participate in discussing problems regarding collective security and military-political collaboration. The meeting of prime ministers decided to create a commission for economic cooperation. "It is very important to sign the draft agreement regarding the creation of a free trade zone. It is worth noting that Moldovan delegations were taken into consideration. Most important is that the CIS states are allowed to develop commercial ties with other countries beyond the CIS. The session also signed the draft regarding the Payments Union. This is, as Vice Premier Valentin Kunev said, the first document that brings us closer to the economic union. By elaborating the other agreements this union should be supported. It insures a market for Moldovan output. The document on labor migration and workers' social protection was also signed. This document is very important for Moldova which faces unemployment problems. By signing these agreements, Moldovan citizens have the same rights as the citizens of the state where they work." The prime minister examined the agreement guaranteeing the rights of national and religious minorities. The discussions over this agreement will be continued in the second half of May. The declaration on respecting the sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of the CIS member states' borders was also discussed. Viktor Siniov, representative of eastern Moldova, was among the members of the Moldovan delegation. According to Kunev, Siniov took an active part in discussions and this shows that the disagreements can be overcome. Beginning at 1400 the presidents and premiers will meet to sign the agreements, says the communique.
