[Soglo] The effects started well before that. When the new majority came to power in France and when Mr. Balladur's letter arrived (in mid-September last year), there was great speculation. So much so that the devaluation was called the "tom-tom devaluation." No devaluation has ever been discussed for so many years. But there had been no preparations for it. Things speeded up over recent months, to such an extent that the exodus of capital finally reached 1 billion CFA francs per day. That is unreasonable and was very costly. [Nicaud] At what point did devaluation seem inevitable? [Soglo] Back in April 1992, the French prime minister visited Cameroon. Then four African heads of state came to France and met with President Mitterrand (31 July 1992). It was then that we really began to be aware of the scale of the problem. We did the accounts and noticed that many African countries had huge arrears in the payment of their debt. So, what happened? France settled the arrears with the IMF or the World Bank. In other words, this money did not profit the French enterprises or African countries. That was when we really realized that there was no other way out. Feeling of Abandonment [Nicaud] Before you became president of Benin, you were vice president of the World Bank. Does this mean that you were in favor of devaluing the CFA franc from the start? [Soglo] When we began to talk of devaluation, Benin was the only country in the area to have an adjustment plan. We were therefore relatively at ease. In fact, our situation would have enabled us only to devalue by between 20 and 30 percent. But the economy of some countries, like Cameroon, the Congo, Niger, and the Cote d'Ivoire were in such a state that we had to go to 50 percent. We therefore agreed out of solidarity. There would be no point in leaving the group midstream. The fact remains that the Dakar meeting in January was one of the most difficult that I have had to attend. France then told its African partners: "If you do not want to devalue, that is your right, but you will have to reach agreement with the IMF and World Bank" (to negotiate structural readjustment agreements and aid). That said it all. [Nicaud] Did you feel betrayed? [Soglo] In this kind of meeting, the dimension is not just economic and monetary, it is also emotional. Some African heads of state had the impression that France was abandoning them. That was also very difficult to explain to the population, even if this devaluation enables us to win back our internal markets, especially in the agricultural sphere. In addition, this was not the first devaluation of the CFA franc. In the past, it was devalued several times following devaluations of the French franc. This time, what people dislike is the divorce between the CFA franc and the French franc. Once we realized that it was inevitable, we began to negotiate accompanying measures. And that took a long time.... Democratization and Economic Reforms [Nicaud] Judging by the demonstrations and riots that have taken place in several countries in the Franc Zone -- Togo, Senegal, and Gabon -- in the past few weeks, these measures seem inadequate... [Soglo] We must look at things from three angles: the past, the present, and the future. The past is the debt. From the viewpoint of bilateral aid, France has canceled this debt in full for the least developed countries and by 50 percent for the countries with moderate revenues. That leaves the multilateral debt. I have just returned from Japan, where I tackled this problem, and I also know that the Americans are ready to make an effort within the Paris Club (which brings together the main creditor countries). The present is inflation, in other words the housewife's shopping basket. To absorb the inflationary effects of devaluation, the state must play its role. It must ensure that the essential products imported (oil, sugar, milk, cement, pharmaceutical products...) do not increase too much. To do this we have asked the World Bank for permission to subsidize them for a short time because the increase would be too high. But the state cannot stand alone. Everybody must play his part: For instance, we have asked the enterprises to reduce their profit margins (many of them had built up stocks before the devaluation), and the employees not to ask for wage increases which are too high (the negotiations are not yet over). The future is investment. A rate of 10 percent (compared with GDP) only just makes it possible to maintain the existing equipment. It must reach 20 percent. In Benin we have gone from 13 percent to 18 percent and more. The problem is that in Africa we must simultaneously do two things which are generally regarded as incompatible: democratization and economic reforms. In many cases, the latter is done first and once that stage has been completed, there is democratization. We have seen that with several countries, Chile, Turkey, and now China. When I left the World Bank to become president of Benin, I found myself in the field, so to speak. And I can now say to my former colleagues, paraphrasing Catherine of Russia: "Take care: You are working on a sheet of paper which has no feeling, and I am working on human skin which is very sensitive." In other words, the people in those institutions must wake up to what is feasible and what is not immediately feasible.
