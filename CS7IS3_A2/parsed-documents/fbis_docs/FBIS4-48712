But the ANC has not discarded the possibility of resorting to court actions to remedy the situation. The sources said Zuma agreed to accept an Inkatha victory in the province at a private meeting with ANC President Nelson Mandela during the weekend of April 30-May 1. The ANC's decision to accept the poll in Natal was based on Zuma's confidence that Mdlalose would "co-operate" in the Natal cabinet in the interests of national reconciliation. ANC hopes for a settlement were pinned on talks between Mandela and Inkatha Freedom Party leader Chief Buthelezi, who were set to meet in Cape Town last night. ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus said there was little sign of goodwill at provincial level. In a speech to the Natal legislature on Friday, Buthelezi appealed to the Premier and the cabinet to resist making deals at leadership level. Democracy would be "smashed on the rocks of expediency" if deals were done in secret "to appear reasonable", he said. Inkatha was awarded 51 percent of the Natal vote in last month's election, and currently holds six of the 10 ministerial seats in the new cabinet. The ANC has refused to accept the three portfolios offered to it and is demanding the police portfolio described by ANC Midlands chairman Harry Gwala as "the difference between liberation and oppression in Natal". Natal University analyst Mary de Haas said ANC leaders were primarily concerned with reducing violence by not provoking Inkatha. However, any decision to concede such a substantial victory to Inkatha was "short-sighted in the extreme". ANC-aligned lawyers confirmed they had sworn affidavits from Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) officials claiming that Inkatha's final poll was the result of "massive fraud". The ANC last week suspended an application to the Special Electoral Court from its Natal region to review the election result. Niehaus confirmed that the ANC objections were suspended in the interests of finding a political settlement in Natal. The possibility of reversing this decision could give the ANC added "leverage" in negotiations with Inkatha. Further, if Inkatha remained intransigent, the Constitutional Court could be asked to declare the Natal cabinet's decisions null and void on grounds that the cabinet was not properly constituted. Administrators could then be appointed to run the province, he said. Zuma had "a good working relationship" with Mdlalose, said De Haas. The dispute over portfolio allocations reflected intervention by hardline factions within Inkatha, at whose insistence Prince Zulu Gideon had been granted a seat in the cabinet in favour of Mike Tarr. IEC chairman Johann Kriegler confirmed that political parties had been involved in negotiations with the IEC during the elections count. The IEC had hoped to resolve objections lodged by parties over the IEC's handling of the elections, he said.
