According to Kamov, it is no accident that the BSP is demanding that the government review the action or lack of action of all top state officials in delaying to provide information on the UN request for an air corridor. The socialist deputies claim that Noev attempted to present in the National Assembly his political assessment of the situation, which is in sharp contradiction to the Constitution. The BSP leadership regards Noev's resignation as a lesson for all state servants who intend to undertake actions not in conformance with their powers or the law.
