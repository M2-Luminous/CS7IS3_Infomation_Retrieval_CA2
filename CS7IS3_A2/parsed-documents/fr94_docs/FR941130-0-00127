ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department expands its rules on Super Bowl tours to cover air tours to other types of special events. The new rule requires that operators of tours to special events that are promoted as including admission to the event must have those event tickets in hand or under contract before they advertise or sell the tours, and that they must refund the entire tour price to any customer who does not receive a promised event ticket. This rule also extends the charter rule's prohibition on last-minute price increases to non-charter special event tours. This initiative arises as a result of problems on certain tours to the 1994 Rose Bowl on which participants did not receive game tickets that were promoted as being included in the package, or were required to make additional payments in order to receive tickets.
