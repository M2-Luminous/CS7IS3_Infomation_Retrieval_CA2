Analysts said yesterday that they are not surprised that BAe has accelerated its search for alliances. The pressure to reduce costs brought on by declining defence spending has become more urgent following the ending last year of an agreement guaranteeing 80 percent of Ministry of Defence orders for explosives and propellants. Against the background of sweeping cuts throughout the British Army, Royal Ordnance has found it difficult to offset reduced home demand with export orders, although about 40 percent of the estimated 550m [million] pounds annual sales are sent abroad. Last year Royal Ordnance received what is likely to be its last major order from the Ministry of Defence -- a 200m pound contract over five years to supply small-arms ammmunition, cannon and naval gun shells and tank training rounds. Despite cuts which have reduced the workforce from 12,000 in 1987 to 6,700, including 1,000 in Germany, the company remains the largest ammunition maker in Europe with estimated operating profits around 50m pounds. It also claims to make the greatest range of ammunition in addition to small arms, artillery systems warheads and rocket motors. Redundancies have been a constant feature and trade unions arguing for diversification into civil markets are certain that even without European collaboration more of the remaining 11 sites ranging from Bridgwater to Glasgow face closure. When BAe paid 190m pounds for the business there was intense speculation that the price did not reflect the true valuations of what BAe concedes still amounts to "thousands of acres" of land. But the vacant Enfield and Waltham Abbey sites in the London region, which were expected to become development goldmines remain undeveloped although three-quarters of a 44-acre Blackburn fuse factory site was sold to Barratt for housing development. Analysts say land which has been used for weapons manufacturing usually requires costly decontamination treatment before development if it is not to carry the risk of containing unexploded shells.
