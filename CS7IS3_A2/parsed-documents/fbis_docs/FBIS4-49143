In the past quarter there have been 16 heterosexual HIV transmissions reported compared with only one homosexual transmission, narrowing the gap to just eight cases, according to Health Department statistics. There have now been 157 HIV infections in the territory that were heterosexual transmissions compared with 165 homosexual infections. In January, the Health Department's AIDS consultant, Dr. Lee Shui-shan, predicted that the heterosexual/homosexual transmission gap would disappear by the end of the year. But in a review of the HIV infection pattern during the first quarter of this year, Dr. Lee said yesterday heterosexual transmission was likely to overtake homosexual transmission by the middle of the year. "What we are seeing is a dramatic rise in heterosexual transmission of HIV although the important message is that this gap is closing," Dr. Lee said. Last month four men and two women were found to be infected with the AIDS virus, bringing the total number of reported cases of HIV in Hong Kong to 435. One new case of full-blown AIDS was also reported to bring the total to 100, 65 of whom have died. "Although we are still seeing a steady increase in the number of HIV infections we are seeing an explosive increase in the number of AIDS cases as more people infected with the virus are developing AIDS-related illnesses," Dr. Lee said. In the past quarter there have been eight new AIDS cases compared with only one in the previous quarter. Dr. Lee said the number of deaths from AIDS did not include "several" people with HIV who had committed suicide. The Health Department's AIDS unit is now setting up a community charter to tackle the problem of discrimination against HIV carriers in the workplace. "Most of those infected are of working age and so there is a need to actively educate people not to discriminate at work," Dr. Lee said.
