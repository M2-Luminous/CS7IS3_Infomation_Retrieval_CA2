"Thailand will not be happy with us but we have pictures to prove (it)," the prince told reporters during a break in the second session of parliament. "I can show you a picture of Pol Pot, his house being attacked, and Pol Pot escaping with cars and a convoy of trucks driving on a tarmac road inside Thai territory," the prince said. The prince was adamant that the shadowy guerrilla leader -- who was responsible for the Khmer Rouge's 1975 to 1979 reign of terror during which some one million Cambodians died of illness, starvation or execution -- escaped through Thai territory. "It was not inside Cambodia. Cambodia does not have such good smooth roads in that region," he said. He did not specify how the photos were obtained. Government forces seized the rebel headquarters and the surrounding resource rich region March 19. The Khmer Rouge financed their guerrilla organisation by selling logging and mining concessions to primarily Thai business consortiums, many of which are believed to be controlled by or have links with the Thai military.
