The order further provided that on or before December 6, 1993, the licensee, Dr. Bauer, or any other person adversely affected by the order could submit an answer to the order, which could include a request for a hearing. On December 2, 1993, IRCC and Dr. Bauer filed a request for a hearing regarding the order. The Commission referred this filing to the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel on December 13, 1993, for the appointment of a presiding officer to conduct any necessary proceedings.
