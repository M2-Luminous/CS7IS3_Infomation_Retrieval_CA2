"We take it for granted that we'll be running alone in some municipalities at the administrative elections," said Luigi Negri, national secretary of the Lombard League, the regional branch of the Northern League. The decision would thus rule out presenting joint candidates with Forza Italia, the Northern League's ally in the March 27-28 general elections. Municipalities scheduled to go to the polls include Como, Sesto San Giovanni, Abbiategrasso, Melegnano, Cernusco sul Naviglio and Rho.
