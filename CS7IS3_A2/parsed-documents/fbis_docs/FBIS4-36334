Some of them slammed the door and decided to form another political organization, called the Movement of Independent Democrats [MDI]. (Abel-aid Ould Kebde), the new party's leader, explains here to Salem Meshbouh Salem the reasons for his decision to pull out of the UFD: [Begin recording] [(Kebde)] We are of the view that the UFD no longer provides us leadership, because it now serves merely as a shock absorber that enabled the government to carry out painfulessly, under the most ideal political and social conditions, reforms which in the final analysis were not reforms at all -- and I think the present frustrations of the independent press clearly show to what extent authoritarianism has surged back. All in all, when one takes stock of the democratization process, not much is left. [Salem] Does this mean that the other movements which have supported you so far -- the Party for Liberty, Equality, and Justice and the [word indistinct] movement -- have also pulled out? [(Kebde)] I think you are aware that we are right at the beginning of this process, and I understand that consultations between these two movements are under way. It appears that within the next 24 to 48 hours they will announce their decisions -- which could be to remain with the UFD. As I said, we are at the beginning of a process which could in due course involve other forces which were originally outside the present UFD, or informal forces formerly within that organization. I do not think it is possible to predict what is likely to happen next. [end recording]
