Twenty fishing vessels sealed off the major French port, immobilising three freighters inside while a ferry from Plymouth was forced to wait offshore. Fishing boats from Honfleur across the Seine estuary meanwhile blocked the entrance to the river and the inland port at Rouen. The Havre fishermen complained they would not get "one cent" of aid promised by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in negotiations Friday with Brittany fishermen in Rennes, the Brittany capital. [passage omitted] In the Mediterranean port of Marseille, more than a tonne of fish from Algeria and Senegal was held up by health inspectors who said the catches did not have the right documents. On Thursday, French authorities ordered stricter checks on imported fish as protestors blamed imports for a collapse in prices.
