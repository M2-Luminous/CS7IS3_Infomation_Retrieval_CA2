"A consequent influx of foreign higher-quality and lower-cost services will pose a threat to China's international balance of payments," said Chu Xiangyin, a professor at the University of Foreign Trade and Economics. China signed a general agreement on trade in services as part of the final act of the Uruguay Round of Gatt talks in Morocco last month. While admitting that China will benefit somewhat from the agreement, Chu says the challenges are demanding. The core of the agreement on trade in services is transparency in trade regimes, unconditional most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment, greater market access and equal treatment for domestic and foreign businesses operating in China. All in all, China, like other signatories, will have to open its markets wider to foreigners when the agreement takes effect early next year. Chu outlined three major threats to China's service industry: -- First, the inflow of foreigners will squeeze domestic sectors still in their infancy. Although he did not elaborate, it's apparent that banking is one of these sectors. -- Second, sectors such as aviation and telecommunications are related to State sovereignty and security, and lack the guidance of a complete legal system. "When there's not a complete law to regulate the operation of foreign transnationals, the potential threat (to State safety) cannot be ruled out," Chu said. -- Third, China's trade in services is still on a low level, despite fast development over the past decade. The service trade in China has yet to regain the form of its heyday in the 1950s, let alone catch up with developed countries or even some developing nations. Chu pointed out that services accounted for a smaller portion of China's gross domestic product, than the average level among developing countries for 1984, which the World Bank put at 37 per cent. Peter Sutherland, Gatt's Director-General, said in a recent speech in Beijing that poor availability of services, including finance and transportation services (especially in inland areas), is among the challenges still to be faced by China's reforms. But Chu also pointed to some positive factors for China's service trade when the country gains access to Gatt. On the one hand, he said, developed countries are seeking opportunities to provide technical assistance to developing countries such as China. On the other hand, foreign competition will force domestic suppliers to improve their quality. Moreover, while opening up its own market, China will gain easier access to foreign markets. He suggests that the government find ways to bolster the country's service exports. Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi has said China will strive to seek a balance of payments in its service trade. Chu also suggests that China make public regulations for its service trade, except those that might threaten State security. "Now, it's time for us to develop our service trade in full swing," Chu said, adding that China should absorb what it can from all over the world. "But," he cautioned, "foreign services which may lead to environmental pollution or the leakage of State secrets should not be encouraged."
