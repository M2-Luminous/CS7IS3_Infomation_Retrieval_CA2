The Russian minister has assured his partners that the withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany will be completed before 31 August this year, and military property will be removed before May. Grachev has also stated Russia's intention to cooperate within the framework of the Partnership for Peace program, but in that initiative he sees only a proposal for cooperation rather than a step toward a merger with NATO.
