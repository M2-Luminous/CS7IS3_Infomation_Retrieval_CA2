In the seven months since the signing of the Gaza-Jericho Autonomy Accord between 'Arafat and Tel Aviv, this is the third time that Israel has unilaterally trampled upon the deadline agreed for withdrawal and postponed it in utter disregard of Palestine and international public opinion. Israel has implied that the pullout could take place in the last days of Ordibehesht [21 April-21 May] but the Palestinians, even those participating in the compromising talks, do not trust these deadlines. In practice, the Palestinian region has witnessed more violence, clashes, arrests, and massacres of Palestinians since the signing of the Gaza-Jericho Accord. The face of the occupied territories has not changed as regards peace and compromise and Zionist units continue in their operations of pursuit and killing. Palestinian citizens still suffer the throes of hunger, disease, arrests, and annihilation. In this period, the usurped territories, especially the Gaza Strip, have experienced the most prolonged economic and military siege. These areas have been resealed for many consecutive weeks. But do not ignore that even if Israel has ostensibly agreed to withdraw from the Gaza-Jericho region, in practice, it has continued to renege on adhering to these agreements. Basically, it has no intention of doing so. What will be implemented, if it ever is, will be a mere reshuffling of arrangements and deployment of the occupying forces in these regions. All that will be achieved is the removal of the Zionist forces from the streets in Gaza and Jericho and the deployment of Palestinian forces. They will be stationed around the 19 Zionist settlements in the region. Although this will remove the Zionist forces from public view, the change in the array of forces will fully reveal the true military nature of the Zionist settlements. Despite the Zionist regime's constant reneging or rearranging of its forces, the series of 'Arafat's talks with this regime continues. Every round results in a new retreat by the compromising Palestinians and new concessions for the Zionist regime. What is interesting is that in time, as the privileges given to the Zionist regime increase, the hope of its withdrawal decreases. 'Arafat has gambled in this dangerous game and has staked his reputation and his political and military resources and has closed every path of return for himself. This has resulted in his forfeiting the support of the Palestinian nation and its popular base. He is the main loser in this dangerous game, which has no prospects.
