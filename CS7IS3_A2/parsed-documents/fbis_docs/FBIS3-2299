Chief Secretary Anson Chan, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's deputy, will meet senior members of the U.S. administration, congressional leaders in Washington and business and trade groups in New York in late April to lobby for the unconditional renewal of MFN for China in June. Chan, who is expected to be in the United States for five days, said "the United States and China are Hong Kong's two largest trading partners and a good relationship between them will be a vital factor in Hong Kong's long-term success." It is estimated that failure to renew MFN would cut Hong Kong's growth in gross domestic product (GDP) by up to three percentage points -- a loss of between 19 billion-to-26 billion Hong Kong dollars (2.4 billion-to-3.3 billion U.S.) in income, and cost up to 75,000 jobs. "I shall be setting out in no uncertain terms Hong Kong's commitment to free trade as a general principle and the importance of the unconditional renewal of China's MFN status to Hong Kong," she said. U.S. President Bill Clinton has demanded improvements in China's record on human rights, trade and arms sales, before renewing its MFN status for another year. Renewal falls due in June. Since Friday, China has detained some dissidents in defiance of U.S. warnings that improvements in its human rights record are a precondition to MFN renewal. The issue is likely to top the agenda when U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher visits Beijing on Friday. However, Chan said: "Hong Kong, more than any country, is concerned about human rights, but we don't think, in principle, it is right to use trade as a tool to achieve other objective." "I also believe China's continued growth in economy will also become more liberalize over the passage of time in its political outlook," she said. [sentence as received]
