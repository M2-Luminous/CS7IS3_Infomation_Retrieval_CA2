Tsai] [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- A Taiwan food industry delegation left Friday [15 April] for Subic Bay in the Philippines, where it will look at investment possibilities. Led by Fu Kuang-yen, secretary-general of the Taiwan Gourmet Powder Industrial Association, the group comprises a dozen senior business executives. Group members include Secretary-General Shen Ta of the Taiwan Association of Frozen Food Industries, Secretary-General Wang Yuan-chuan of the Taiwan Regional Association of Carbonated Beverage Industries, and Secretary-General Shih Fu-yuan of the Taiwan Association of Frozen Vegetable and Fruit Manufacturers. Taiwan and the Philippines are jointly building a 325-hectare industrial park in Subic Bay, and Lu said Taiwan investors could use the site as a production base from which they could sell foodstuffs to neighboring Vietnam and Singapore, whose residents have a taste for Chinese food. The delegation is scheduled to return to Taipei on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Vice Chairman Wu Kuan-hsiung of the China External Trade Development Council (CETRA) will head a mission to the Philippines and Indonesia beginning April 24. Wu said the CETRA mission will go to Subic Bay and to Batam, Medan, Surabaya, and Jakarta in Indonesia to seek trade and investment opportunities for Taiwan's machinery manufacturers. The visits of the two delegations are regarded as part of domestic investors' efforts to push for increased investments in Southeast Asian countries in response to the government's southern strategy.
