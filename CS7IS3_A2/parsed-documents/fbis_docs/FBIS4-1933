There is a total of more than 200,000 positions, ranging from those as senior as government department heads to those as junior as street cleaners. Hong Kong's civil service system, which has taken shape and operated effectively over many years, ensures the Hong Kong Government's highly efficient operation. Generally speaking, Hong Kong civil servants are better paid and well fed. They also understand clearly that their pay comes from Hong Kong taxpayers' money, so they work with might and main. When staying in Hong Kong, this writer, as required by my job, came into contact with government departments concerned on many occasions and had the personal experience of being warmly received by functionaries who responded to my queries and dispelled my doubts with their adept professional knowledge. Moreover, this writer witnessed scenes in which the police risked their lives to capture robbers in the street. My general feeling is that Hong Kong civil servants are of high quality and quite professional, and most of them are dedicated to their duties. Today, Hong Kong has become the "Pearl of the East," enjoying prosperity and stability, but this success is inseparable from the efforts made by vast numbers of civil servants. As far as this writer understands, a well-knit mechanism of inspiration and supervision has been built in the Hong Kong civil service system and a stringent system for assessing civil servants has been implemented, with rewards and punishments meted out fairly. In addition, the Independent Commission Against Corruption is responsible for monitoring corrupt practices committed by civil servants of the executive. As proved by practical experience, these measures help government organs bring their executive functions into play. The mainland also drew on Hong Kong's relevant practices in the process of studying the implementation of a civil service system. More important is that if our country wants to realize a smooth transition when resuming the exercise of our sovereignty over Hong Kong, a stable contingent of civil servants is a very essential aspect and a direct factor. To stabilize the contingent of civil servants, it is necessary to maintain the continuity of the civil service system. Actually, issues related to civil servants have been defined clearly in the Basic Law. Under the principles of "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong" and "a high degree of autonomy," the Basic Law stipulates that following our country's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, civil servants serving in all Hong Kong Government departments may all remain in employment in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Regional [SAR] Government. Entering the post-transition period, with the year 1997 approaching, some misgivings have arisen among Hong Kong civil servants which are largely unnecessary worries, such as concerns over a "great reshuffle" and the possible loss of existing positions and benefits. To deal with these misgivings, the Preliminary Work Committee's political sub-group studied them as major issues and openly dispelled relevant doubts, thus more explicitly and concretely guaranteeing the future of civil servants. This move should pacify some of the civil servants who are in a state of disquiet. The Chinese Government sets much store by the role of Hong Kong civil servants and has repeatedly made clear its wish for the continued service of Hong Kong civil servants in the SAR Government after 1997 so as to serve the people of Hong Kong. This is a sincere invitation sent by the Chinese Government. It is believed that Hong Kong civil servants -- particularly the Chinese civil servants, who account for over 90 percent of the contingent -- will positively orient themselves toward 1997, in a gesture of mastery, along with vast numbers of the people of Hong Kong, will live and work in peace and contentment, and will develop their capabilities to the full. In addition, the issue of having better communications, stronger ties, and closer cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland in the post-transition period also should be placed on the agenda.
