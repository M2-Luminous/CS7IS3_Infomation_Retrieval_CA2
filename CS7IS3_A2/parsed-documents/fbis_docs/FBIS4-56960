On 5 May CREMERJ canceled Fayad's medical license on charges of having supervised the torture of political prisoners during the military regime. Fayad is currently serving as the Army's deputy health director. The communique says: "The Brazilian Army strongly rejects any innuendo concerning the behavior of its members when the appropriate legal procedures have not been followed." It adds that Fayad, whom President Itamar Franco promoted to brigadier general on 31 March, "has an outstanding record of services rendered to the Army and to the nation, both as a physician and as an officer." Fayad was charged with having worked for the DOI-CODI [Internal Operations Department-Internal Defense Operations Center] at the then 1st Army in the Tijuca district in Rio de Janeiro, where he allegedly worked with Lieutenant Amilcar Lobo -- a psychiatrist who had his license canceled by CREMERJ in 1988 -- in evaluating the physical resistance of torture victims and in providing guidance to torturers. The Army communique, which is signed by Cecomsex Chief General Gilberto Serra, adds that pursuant to Law 5526 of 1968, military physicians cannot be held accountable before regional medical councils for the technical-professional duties they may be required to perform as servicemen. Besides, the communique adds, the amnesty law has rendered any excess that either side may have committed unpunishable.
