A special United Nations envoy meanwhile said the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) had agreed to open discussions about a ceasefire with the army on Monday, a UN spokesman said. The army has already agreed to the principle of a ceasefire to allow the UN to fly desperately needed food and medicine to the survivors of a six-week bloodbath in which up to half a million of Rwanda's seven million people are estimated to have been butchered. "The commanders of both sides have accepted the proposal of the special representative of the secretary-general to open ceasefire talks," spokesman Abdul Kabia told AFP by telephone from Kigali. "These talks will be held in Kigali and will start Monday. The top commanders will not come, but will be represented at staff level by their deputies," Kabia said. Kabia said an army brigadier and a rebel commander would attend the UN-mediated meeting. But UN military sources and diplomats said that with the rebel takeover of Kigali imminent, and demoralised government soldiers short of ammunition and starting to join a massive exodus of terrified civilians from the capital, the discussions may come after the effective end of a three-year civil war. [passage omitted covered in referent items] The UN military sources meanwhile reported that army commanders and some ordinary soldiers were starting to join thousands of terrified Hutus streaming out of Kigali on foot. "Rumours that the city is about to fall are spreading and people are scared of retaliation for the killings of Tutsis," said a UN official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official estimated that a rebel victory was "a few more days away." Minority Tutsis dominate the rebel movement, led by Rwandan exiles who fled to Uganda to escape ethnic massacres in the runup to independence from Belgium in 1962. Kabia, speaking by telephone from Kigali, said the RPF had agreed to meet army commanders Monday to discuss a ceasefire. But a senior Western diplomat familiar with Rwanda said the battle-weary government forces "could simply be forced to surrender." "They're short of ammunition, their morale is low, their government has run away to a town outside the capital, and they're scared of taking the blame for the massacres," a UN military source in Kigali said. The rebel agreement to discuss ceasefire terms nevertheless signalled a breakthrough for Riza, but the rebels still oppose the planned deployment of 5,500 UN peacekeepers in Rwanda and demand a maximum of 2,500. The UN, condemned by aid agencies for withdrawing all but 400 of its 2,500 soldiers from Rwanda after president Juvenal Habyarimana's death in an alleged April 6 rocket attack on his plane, is struggling anyway to muster the planned new force. [passage omitted] Riza was to leave Rwanda on Friday to review another heavily criticised UN peacekeeping operation in Somalia's anarchic capital Mogadishu, where the failure of tens of thousands of foreign soldiers to end factional fighting has dampened enthusiasm for another perilous mission in Africa.
