That way conflicts in developing countries in particular could be managed and prevented. Cooperation Development Minister Pronk made his comments yesterday in a speech at Groningen University. He referred to the importance of much tighter policies on arms exports. Pronk said that the proliferation of light weapons like mortars, grenades, land mines and machine guns caused more instability than the proliferation of heavy weapons. That had been proved in practice. Out of the 30 large armed conflicts which took place in the world in 1993, 26 were fought virtually entirely with small and light weapons. Pronk said that the countries of the former Soviet Union and the Central and East European states in particular should increase their monitoring of light arm exports.
