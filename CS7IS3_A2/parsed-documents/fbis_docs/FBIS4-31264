Following his talks with Yasushi Akashi, UN special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, Karadzic said at a news conference: "We have conducted difficult but constructive talks. Our suggestion about a general 12-month cease-fire was not accepted." Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the Srpska republic assembly, said to a TANJUG correspondent: "We expect that a document will be signed on an all-encompassing four-month cease-fire, but we still have to wait for the Muslim side's reply. Yasushi Akashi is expected to meet the Muslim delegation this afternoon. Afterwards, a plenary session may take place and, eventually, documents may be signed. Everything is still uncertain, though."
