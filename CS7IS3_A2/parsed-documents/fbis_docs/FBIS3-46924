That is by 521.6 thousand less than in 1992. Among the five kinds of animals there is observed an increase in the number only for goats. As is shown by the preliminary data there are some 367.4 thousand camels, 2,189.8 thousand horses, 2,730.4 thousand bovine, 13,778 thousand sheep and 6,106.9 thousand goats in the country. In 13 out of 18 aymags of the country the total number of cattle has recorded to be reduced. Among the consequences of the natural calamity occurred in the three western aymags of Mongolia, the growth of cattle number has been affected by an uncontrolled slaughter of meat and a remarkable weakening of maintenance and care of animals provided in many cattlebreeding units. [sentence as received] This might be seen from the fact that the six aymags with the most favourable weather conditions for the last winter-spring period failed to increase the number of cattle, specialists of the statistical board points out.
