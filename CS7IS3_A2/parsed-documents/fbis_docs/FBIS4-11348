FBIS4-11348 "drlat080_i_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 Nicaragua Warns Against Disbanding Army Warns Against Disbanding Army PA2604012694 Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1934 GMT 25 Apr 94 PA2604012694 Panama City ACAN Spanish BFN [Text] Managua, 25 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- In Managua today, General Humberto Ortega, the chief of the Nicaraguan Armed Forces, warned that "if the Army should disappear (in this country), there will be war." The Sandinist People's Army (EPS), founded in 1979, has been reduced from 84,000 to 14,000 men over the past four years. There are sectors in the country, however, that argue in favor of the complete abolishment of the Armed Forces. Ortega's warning, according to what political analysts believe, was directed at the Nicaraguan Civic Movement. This group wants Nicaragua to have no army, as in Costa Rica. Ortega was one of the speakers at a two-day seminar on the relationship between the military and civilians, which was hosted by the National Assembly. During his speech, Ortega stressed, "There would be total anarchy without an army in Nicaragua." The forum was funded by the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (INDI). "Allow me to tell those who argue the Army should not exist that, if we should disappear, then 10 or 15 armies of the various antagonistic political and economic forces that still have some degree of clout would appear on the scene tomorrow," Ortega said. The four-star Sandinist general underscored that "with no army, there will be more armies and war in Nicaragua." "There are sectors in Nicaragua that argue that democracy should mean the complete undoing of the historic changes that occurred in 1979 (when the Sandinists defeated Somoza in an armed conflict). "Others, namely the ultra-leftists, think democracy should be founded on the revolutionary past, which was necessary at the time, but is long gone," the military leader pointed out. "We are the ideal of those who believe that some day there will be no Army," Ortega said, "but when the United States has no Army then Nicaragua will have no Army. That is something we would really like to happen." Ortega, who has commanded the EPS since its founding, told those present that the Armed Forces collaborated in the seizure of 180,296 weapons of all types during 1992 and 1993. The weapons were in the hands of civilians who contributed to the country's lack of security. The military leader called for a consensus regarding the "consolidation" and "legalization" of the Army against those who still believe that it is possible to change Nicaragua's history and throw the country into another war. "The Army is no longer the armed branch of the party, as it was in the past for the Sandinist Front. Nevertheless, it is not going to be an instrument of the other party, and much less the armed branch of the wealthy classes," Ortega warned. According to the Sandinist general, Nicaragua's main problem is not the relationship between civilians and the military. Instead, it is the backwardness "of a nation that has no democratic experience whatsoever and the conflict between those who want democracy and those who do not." Ortega insisted that the Army has respected all economic, diplomatic, social, and financial policies that the Violeta Chamorro government has instituted, although some have criticized these policies as "good" and others as "bad." Other speakers at the first part of the seminar were Nicaraguan Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo, National Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman, and INDI President Kenneth Whollack. The forum also features experts from the United States, Spain, Portugal, Chile, and Argentina.
