When announcing the reshuffle of the minister of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries today, Chu Ton-sik, spokesman for Chongwadae [presidential office], said: President Kim Yong-sam admitted that the Uruguay Round implementation plan had been revised for farmers and would be beneficial to them. However, Minister Kim had told the people, as well as the president, that he would not correct even one word of the implementation plan. Therefore, by revising this plan, he deceived the people and the president and tarnished the morality of the civilian regime. So, the president had no alternative but to hold the minister responsible and replaced the minister with the former vice minister of home affairs.
