Yogie S.M. stressed that political reform is a consequence of increasing openness and democratization. This reform is being spurred in order to create increasingly stable quality as a nation and greater progressiveness and self-sufficiency in life as a state. Although there are now many challenges, the desires for political changes by part of society are a product of the success of national development. "Therefore, we view them positively and do not belittle the demands of society, because the reformation produced by openness and democratization must be consistent with Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution." Yogie said this Wednesday [26 January] at the Department of Home Affairs, Jakarta, in a limited working meeting of governors from throughout Indonesia in connection with preparations for implementation of the 1994-95 RAPBN [Draft National Budget] and RAPBD's [Draft Regional Budgets]. There was also discussion of political upbuilding, stabilization of the mechanism for selecting heads of first and second level regions, and implementation of the INPRES [Presidential Instructions] Program for Backward Schools (IDT). He also said, "Because of growing public political awareness, political upbuilding of the people must be inspired by the people's aspirations, which naturally carry much weight. Good aspirations are those that benefit the prosperity of all the people and avoid giving attention to only one group. Because giving attention to only one group could trigger disintegration, it must be avoided." Besides, he said, approaches based on aspirations can be properly realized only if supported by a strong political infrastructure and superstructure. An awareness needs to be implanted among the people that the aspirations that are developing, as an aspect of openness, must adhere to norms, ethics, and rules. The same point of view on the part of the government and the people will create future political communications marked by dialogue and harmony. Such communications require a society that is full of aspirations as people who are independent and free from pressure and dependency. The domestic political supervisor also said that because democracy is a situation that is always developing, it is not possible to determine a standard model, let alone make the democracy of any specific country a model that must be imitated. "Democracy cannot be developed immediately as merely a single phase. Basically, democracy develops spontaneously (not engineered). There may be many natural characteristics. Democracy should not be developed through `social experimentation' and certainly not by repeatedly trying things, because what is at stake is the nation's security and the country's unity," the minister of home affairs said. Touching on the 1994-95 budget, he said the Department of Home Affairs has established a set of programs to cover nine sectors, 14 subsectors, 23 programs, and 105 projects, with funds totaling 40.476 billion rupiah, which means an increase of 7.5 percent over the 1993-94 budget.
