On the contrary, Silvio Berlusconi seems to agree completely with Gianfranco Fini. We have just been to his house in Rome, near Piazza Navona, where he gave us this exclusive interview: Your alliance came out of these elections well. Do you think you will be able to give this country a government soon? [Berlusconi] I hope so, because voters gave a very clear indication. I think that for the first time Italians were able to choose between two clear proposals. The first, the one on the freedom and good government alliance, is a liberal, free-market proposal. There is great stress on the economy, on the need to relaunch the country, to reduce unemployment, and to reduce state spending. The other, the left's proposal, called for state intervention [in the economy]. But at least they [the left] had a clear program. This had never happened before. I think that this first happened thanks to Forza Italia. For the first time since 1948 a political force has come forward saying clearly what its intentions are and presenting a clear and wide-ranging program. The other forces responded to that and I think that, for the first time, Italians could choose between two forces. One won. I think that the winner received a clear indication that it should give the country a government. I hope we will be able to do so. [Vespa] If we finished the interview here, viewers would go to sleep convinced that there will be a government tomorrow. Instead, you have already started arguing. Once again Bossi has said, as he said during the election campaign: No, the prime minister must be a League candidate. Why is he out to get you? I have asked you this question before and I will ask it again. [Berlusconi] I must correct you. It is not true that we have already started to argue. Bossi is following the same line he followed during the election campaign. He voices his doubts and marks his territory. I think that this is the way he acts in politics. I think that political life should change, that when one strikes a deal one should keep his word, that one should speak clearly, and that one should not become a theorist of double-crossing strategies. But I hope that beyond all that, Bossi is also aware of the promise we all together made to the country. I am sure that many of the candidates indicated by the League are aware of that. [Vespa] Is it the usual horse-trading among allies when a government has to be formed? [Berlusconi] I cannot say that it is usual, as it is the first time I have tried. I do not want to talk about a usual thing because it clashes with my style. I think that we will have to sit around a table very soon with a precise program and that we will have to discuss that program. All I did today was work on the program I will submit to my allies. I held talks with many of these allies. I am looking forward to meeting Bossi and the people of the League. [Vespa] During the campaign there was talk of forming a government by cutting off the wings and of leaving Gianfranco Fini out. [Berlusconi] I think voters showed there is a liberal-democratic bloc and the whole bloc must be in the government. [Vespa] Do you intend broadening it? Are you looking toward the center or do you think you can make it by yourself? I would like to remind you that you do not have an absolute majority in the Senate. [Berlusconi] Yes, but it is a gap that can easily be filled with other forces. [Vespa] Which ones? [Berlusconi] There are senators from the Trentino Alto-Adige region, of the Sud-Tiroler Volkspartei. There are also the life senators. I do not think we will have any problem in finding extra votes in the Senate. I really do not think it is going to be difficult. As far as I am concerned -- as I have always said and as I told Mario Segni and Mino Martinazzoli before the elections -- since our programs are not so far apart, I am convinced that it will be possible to work together. [Vespa] As we are talking about programs, Achille Occhetto told us a short while ago that he hopes Berlusconi will keep the promises made to voters. This is what voters want as well, I must say. [Berlusconi] This is what Berlusconi wants, more than anyone else, if I may say so. [Vespa] You somehat exaggerated. You said: One million new jobs. [Berlusconi] I did not exaggerate. I am convinced that it is feasible. Let us send a reassuring message to Mr. Occhetto, so that he is left with no doubts. I met the people in charge of coordination and program this morning, and this morning we assigned the tasks to transform the various points in the program into bills. We did not do that before because we were superstitious. But as of today, we have started to work. [passage omitted] We want to be ready to have these points in the program transformed into bills immediately after the chambers start working. As for employment, I am absolutely certain that...[pauses] This morning I spoke...[pauses] I spoke so much today. I kept in touch with people from the business community, with politicians and journalists. It was a big day indeed. I spoke to many industrialist friends, industrialists from large concerns and with those from medium and small businesses. [passage omitted] They are all eager to receive a precise signal they can trust. They want to be stimulated by the government. I think that we have very clear ideas about what measures are needed to give that signal. These will be the first steps taken by the government. You will see that what I announced will be realized. All Italians will be able to see. We are poised for a recovery and new jobs. We will also save the jobs that today are considered to be under threat. If we have the possibility to govern, if the opposition is with us in desiring good for our country, then I think that we will be able to do a lot. We will be able to go in an absolutely positive direction, in the direction of economic welfare. [Vespa] Did not any of these people with whom you talked tell you: Mr. Berlusconi, you have too many interests of your own to be a steady prime minister. [Berlusconi] They do not tell me these things directly. [Vespa] Second hand information maybe? [Berlusconi] I have just seen a television interview of a politician who was saying precisely that. I think that I made it clear that I have resigned from all the managing positions in my group. [Vespa] You are still the owner though. [Berlusconi] Yes, but I feel very detached from concrete problems. I have heard that some people have said that if I want to be prime minister, I must sell my companies. Let them come forward. If there is someone willing to buy them from me, I have nothing against it. It is a joke but it may well become true, if it were possible. But I want to assure all those who voted for me and also those who are worried at the thought of our future government -- if we have the responsibility of forming a government -- that as far as I am concerned, I will work in everyone's interest. I will certainly work more in everyone's interest than in the interest of those who are on our side. I will remember that a government must be everyone's government. My personal interests will be left behind, they will eventually be forgotten, I think. [Vespa] Let us carry on with your joke. If someone came to you with the money and said can you sell me a television channel? What would you say then? [Berlusconi] Here it is, it is ready. Of course if there was no expropriation, no confiscation, and if the price is right, if it reflected the true value of something that had been built with blood, sweat, and tears . [passage omitted] [Vespa] Do you have any ideas about who the ministers will be. [Berlusconi] Yes, of course. I do not think that this is the right time to give names. The names must be found with the agreement of all the allies. But I think that more than the names of ministers, what is important is the points of the program on which all the allies will find agreement. I believe this will happen very soon. I am about to start work on that. [Vespa] Will the ministers be technocrats or politicians? [Berlusconi] A long-lasting government, as I think the next one will be, must be a government formed by responsible people, with a political responsibility given to them by the voters. This does not mean that there will not be any experts, they will probably be advisers. They may also have government responsibilities. But this must be a political government because this is what the voters clearly asked for. [Vespa] Fini said that it seems acceptable to him to discuss with the opposition who the next speakers in the chambers will be. Do you agree? [Berlusconi] I have not spoken about this with him. I cannot rule out the possibility of electing very experienced institutional figures. These are posts that require a lot of experience. But we did not discuss that detail. I think that the result indicates that there is a majority that forms the government and a minority that must be the opposition. I personally think that the people responsible for the various institutions must be chosen from the people within the ranks of the majority. [Vespa] If you realized that your bid to be prime minister is a hindrance to forming a government, would you step aside? [Berlusconi] I would step aside immediately if the alternative solution proposed were the better solution. [Vespa] Thanks Mr. Berlusconi. [Berlusconi] Thank you.
