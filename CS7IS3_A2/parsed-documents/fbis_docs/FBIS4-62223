The program covers a period between 1994 and 1997. The head of the State Sanitation Control Agency Yevgeniy Belyayev, who submitted the document, said that the necessity for the comprehensive program is prompted by the growing flow of migrants to Russia, the worsening of the epidemiological situation in CIS and certain foreign countries as well as a sharp increase in imports of poor-quality, harmful goods. Belyayev said that in 1993 his agency had to ban the sales of 1000 big batches of imported food. A total of 18.2 percent of imported alcoholic drinks do not meet medical standards. The same applies to 7.3 percent of canned food. The official said that 11 cases of cholera were registered in Russia in 1993, all of foreign origin. In each case three million rubles were spent to prevent an epidemic. The draft program provides for the formation of a network of sanitary control bodies on the borders, sea and air ports and railway stations. At the federal level 77 checkpoints should be constructed or modernized in centers for forced migrants, 10 quarantine posts at railway stations, nine veterinary laboratories, 25 plant laboratories and 143 plant quarantine posts on borders. According to Finance Ministry estimates, in 1994 this will require 26 billion rubles of spending.
