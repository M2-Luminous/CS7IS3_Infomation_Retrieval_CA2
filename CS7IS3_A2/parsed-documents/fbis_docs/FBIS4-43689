"We must still define some points," Gnutti said after meeting the European competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, adding: "There are no particular problems, it's a question of setting times" for application of the agreement. The European Commission yesterday came up with a new plan allowing the Italian government to give steel companies 415 million ECUs (493.5 million dollars) to finance production cutbacks through plant closings. Gnutti said his talks with Van Miert were going very well and that the Rome government may approve the plan and set aside the funds at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. The plan, which was declared all but dead last month, would have Italy to reduce its production by some five to six million [metric] tons, allowing the EU [European Union] to near its goal of reducing overall capacity production by 19 million tons. The plan will have to be approved by EU industry ministers who will meet in Brussels next Wednesday.
