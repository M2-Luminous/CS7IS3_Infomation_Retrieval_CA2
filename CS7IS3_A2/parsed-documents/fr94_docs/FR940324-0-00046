FR940324-0-00046 FR940324-0-00020 DATES: Under Clean Air Act sections 307(b)(1) and 307(d)(7)(B), TFI may seek judicial review of the decision by EPA to partially deny its August 3, 1992 petition only by filing a petition for judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit within 60 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register . FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jacolyn Dziuban, Air Standards and Economics Branch, Criteria and Standards Division (6602J), Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC 20460, (202) 233&hyph;9474. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Phosphogypsum is a waste resulting from wet acid phosphorus production. Phosphogypsum stacks are piles of waste or mines utilized to store and dispose of phosphogypsum. EPA issued a National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) applicable to radon emissions from such stacks in 1989, 40 CFR part 61, subpart R (54 FR 51654, December 15, 1989). As part of that standard, EPA adopted a work practice requirement that all phosphogypsum be disposed in stacks, thereby permitting control and measurement of gaseous radon-222 which is emitted when radium present in the phosphogypsum decays. Subsequent to issuance of Subpart R, EPA received petitions for reconsideration from The Fertilizer Institute (TFI), Consolidated Minerals, Inc., and U.S. Gypsum Company. These petitioners objected to the requirement that all phosphogypsum be disposed and managed in stacks, because it operated to preclude various alternative uses of phosphogypsum, including use of phosphogypsum in agriculture, construction, and research and development. Because EPA had not fully considered the implications of its work practice standard for alternative uses, EPA agreed to convene a reconsideration proceeding in which the risks associated with alternative uses and the procedures under which alternative uses might be permitted could be evaluated (54 FR 9612, March 7, 1989). Rather than setting forth one specific proposal for revision of subpart R, EPA requested comment on a variety of substantive issues, including specific types of proposed alternative uses of phosphogypsum and the health risks associated with these alternative uses. EPA also requested comment on four general options for regulation of alternative uses: (1) No change in the work practice requirement, (2) changing the definition of phosphogypsum to exclude from the work practice requirement material with radium-226 concentrations up to 10 picocuries/gram (pCi/g), (3) permitting use of phosphogypsum in research and development on processes to remove radium from the phosphogypsum, and (4) permitting alternative use of phosphogypsum only after specific permission from EPA. After analyzing the risks associated with the various alternative uses of phosphogypsum which were proposed and evaluating the comments which were received, EPA issued a final rule revising subpart R (57 FR 23305, June 3, 1992). The approach which EPA ultimately adopted was a hybrid of the options it had previously identified. For phosphogypsum use in agriculture, EPA decided that it would be impractical to require case-by-case approval. Based on its analysis of potential risks associated with long-term use of phosphogypsum in agriculture, EPA set a maximum upper limit of 10 pCi/g for radium-226 in phosphogypsum distributed for use in agriculture. Rather than excluding material at or below 10 pCi/g from the standard, EPA established sampling, measurement, and certification procedures permitting such material to be removed from stacks and sold for agricultural use. Based on analysis of potential risks associated with the research and development use, EPA decided to permit use of up to 700 pounds of phosphogypsum for a particular research and development activity. EPA also decided to adopt procedures permitting approval of other uses of phosphogypsum on a case-by-case basis. After EPA issued its final rule concluding the reconsideration proceeding and revising subpart R, The Fertilizer Institute (TFI) sought judicial review of the 1992 revisions of subpart R in The Fertilizer Institute v. Environmental Protection Agency , No. 92&hyph;1320 (D.C. Cir.). TFI also filed a petition dated August 3, 1992 seeking further reconsideration of the revisions of the rule pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B). TFI, EPA, and ManaSota-88, another petitioner who sought review of the 1992 rule in ManaSota-88 v. Browner , No. 92&hyph;1330 (D.C. Cir.), later reached an agreement to jointly move the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to stay judicial review of the 1992 rule, and the Court granted the motion. As part of that agreement, EPA agreed to make a final decision whether to grant or to deny the TFI petition for reconsideration by January 31, 1994. This notice sets forth the Agency's decision concerning the TFI reconsideration petition. II. Standard for Reconsideration Under Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), the EPA Administrator is required to convene a reconsideration proceeding if: (1) The person raising an objection to a rule can demonstrate to the Administrator that it was impracticable to raise such objection within the time permitted for public comment or the grounds for the objection arose after the period for public comment, and (2) if the Administrator determines that the objection is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule. Therefore, reconsideration is not required if the objections by a petitioner were raised or could reasonably have been raised during the pendency of the rulemaking. Moreover, even in the circumstance where a particular objection could not have been raised earlier, reconsideration is not required if EPA determines that such objections would not have altered the outcome of the rule had they been raised earlier.
