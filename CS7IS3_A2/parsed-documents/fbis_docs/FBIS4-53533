FBIS4-53533 "dreas098_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 20 May 1994 North Korea Dailies Comment on South's Response on POW's Dailies Comment on South's Response on POW's SK2005104894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1020 GMT 20 May 94 SK2005104894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Far-Fetched Argument for Sinister Purpose" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- The North side in recent telephone messages respectfully requested the South Korean Red Cross to immediately send back to the North Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, prisoners of war and unconverted long-term prisoners, and take measures to allow the children of Kim Pyong-chu, an unconverted prisoner who died a few years ago, including the eldest daughter Kim Chi-hyon suffering from a serious disease, to come to the North to receive medical treatment and be protected in their livelihood. The South side, however, has taken no positive measure for the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, arguing that they do not belong to the category of prisoners of war, and blindly turns down the request as regards Kim Chi-hyon. It is self-evident that this is a far-fetched argument for a sinister purpose, directed by the South Korean authorities behind the scene, says NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today. The news analyst says: The argument that Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan do not fall under the category of prisoners of war is a sheer distortion of fact. They are prisoners of war who were arrested by a warring party while active as guerrillas (militiamen) during the last war. The South side's argument is a violation of international law on humanitarianism and a far-fetched one. What the South side argues about "acquirement of nationality" is also absurd. Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan have long since wished to return to the North and asked International Red Cross organisations to help them in their repatriation. It is unreasonable to try to keep them in South Korea for the reason of their "acquirement of (South Korean) nationality." Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan are not "killers of innocent people" as described by the South side but patriots who fought with arms in hand against foreign aggressors and the traitors of South Korea who plunged the innocent people into the scourge of war. The South side is rejecting our hand of relief while failing to look after sick Kim Chi-hyon and give her medical treatment. This is an act which can be done only by those devoid of humanism and national conscience. Either in view of the requirement of international law or in view of the Red Cross idea of humanitarianism, it is only too natural that the prisoners of war should be repatriated and fellow countrymen suffering from poverty and illness be rescued. The South side must send them to the North as soon as possible. A MINJU CHOSON analyst demands that the South Korean Red Cross meet the North's just demand with the original attitude of Red Cross.
