Volodin, first deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Committee for the Press. We received the latest "reprimand" for the same reason -- because IZVESTIYA published in issues Nos. 14-18 1994 an article by I. Dementyeva entitled "War and Peace in Prigorodnyy Rayon." Quoting several sections from the article, the author explains why the "warning" has been given. Certain claims and statements "serve to kindle ethnic intolerance and enmity." Following this formidable, peremptory criminal-legal diagnosis it only remained to cite Article 74 of the RSFSR Criminal Code under which the offender should be indicted..... But the point is that the Russian Committee for the Press has clearly gone beyond the bounds of its competence and exceeded its authority. The only bodies that could in this instance determine the legal nature of the article are the prosecutor's office and a court. But things did not reach the courts since the Russian General Prosecutor's Office refused to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the publication of I. Dementyeva's article owing to absence of criminal events and corpus delicti. You get the impression that when formulating its decision the Russian Committee for the Press availed itself of the ruling on this matter produced by the Court of Appeal for Information Disputes, whose findings the editorial office categorically rejected (see IZVESTIYA No. 59 for 30 March this year). But even this ruling does not say a word about kindling ethnic enmity. It is quite possible that some third body, which has arbitrarily assumed the functions of a reincarnation of the censor, will draw an even more radical conclusion. Incidentally, attempts to take charge of the press are becoming more and more aggressive. Recently a certain current information center sent to IZVESTIYA the actual ruling of the Court of Appeal for Information Disputes and the Republic of North Ossetia Supreme Soviet decree. The accompanying letter peremptorily asked for these documents to be published and ended with the unprecedented postscript: "Please inform us of the dates of publication." The center's leader A. Remizov could not find anything to say in response to our official query (a purely rhetorical query, to be frank) as to the normative documents on which this request was based and he did not press for his demands to be met. There have recently been repeated attempts to subordinate IZVESTIYA and you know how they have ended. The editorial office and the creative collective are resolutely rejecting the latest attempts.
