President Ntaryamira left by air this morning and returned this afternoon. [passage omitted] The visit of our head of state, His Excellency Cyprien Ntaryamira, is taking place just after the newly formed government was reshuffled. Opposition parties rejected the composition of the first government as inconsistent with previous agreements. We asked Joseph Nzeyimana of the Rally for Democracy and Economic and Social Development party, who is now minister of commerce and industry in the newly formed government, for his comments: [Begin recording] [Nzeyimana] I would like to tell those listening to me that what the child of a king cries for is always granted by God. That is what happened yesterday. We fought for peace and respect for agreements. That is what we got. You know that the head of state promised that he would form a government to bring Burundians together. We were not after posts because we already had them. We were not after wealth. We wanted to be in the government so that we could work for peace, so that we could fight for those who cannot [passage indistinct]. [Unidentified correspondent] I want to ask you about the men and women members of the new government: Do you think you will be able to understand each other in day-to-day activities? [Nzeyimana] We will have to understand one another, otherwise we would be heading for disaster. [passage indistinct] [end recording] Another person who commented on the government is the leader of the Guarantor of the Freedom of Speech in Burundi, Dr. Alphonse Rugambarara, who is now the minister of youth, culture, and sports. [Begin recording] [Rugambarara] The government that has just been formed satisfies us to some extent because the head of state and the prime minister noticed that we were not happy about what [words indistinct]. They have just changed that. We are happy about this, but there are still some minor problems. However, if people are willing, the problem will be removed. It concerns the communal administration. You know that security matters are dealt with by the Interior Ministry. Many people have died in this country; they have killed one another. We must, therefore, be fully aware of who should deal with the communal administration. Things are still not very clear, but we think that they will be clarified for us so that we can work effectively. [passage omitted]
