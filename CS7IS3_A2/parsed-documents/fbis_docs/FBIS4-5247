The sources said the Vietnamese side urged Japan to accelerate direct investment in the country to help promote its economic development. The Japanese delegation took a cautious stance on the issue, seeking Hanoi to consolidate legal and infrastructural measures to promote the inflow of Japanese capital, they said. The Japanese panel expressed disappointment at slow progress in improvement particularly in electric power, transportation and communications industries, and the double pricing system for public utilities rates, the sources said. The conference, the second session of a joint Japan-Vietnam economic conference, drew attention as it took place amid the changing international situation in favor of Vietnam, such as resumption of aid by international financial institutions and the lifting of economic sanctions by the United States, they said. The 117-member Japanese delegation consists of representatives from about 60 major corporations. The Vietnamese panel was led by Vice Premier Tran Duc Luong.
