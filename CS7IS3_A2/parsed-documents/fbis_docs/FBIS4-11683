Under the agreement Saudi Arabia consented to the dispatch of 110,000 Iranian pilgrims to that country and also to the performing of the Disavowal of Infidels ritual during the hajj period. Three years after the sending of Iranian pilgrims was halted, following the tragedy of the massacre at the holy shrine in 1369 [1990], the foreign ministers of Iran and Saudi Arabia signed an agreement which has been implemented over the past three years. [sentence as heard] Now, within the framework of its commitments in its relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia is expected to provide the necessary facilities for the reception of Iranian pilgrims eager to visit the holy House of God. Since adherence to the Koranic and legal principle of honoring commitments is considered as a basis for international relations, its violation is considered a violation of international regulations and norms and would undoubtedly reduce Saudi Arabia's international credit. Saudi Arabia's adherence to its commitments concerning its bilateral and multilateral relations notwithstanding, the Saudi rulers should be aware of their present position and of their sensitive responsibility for managing the two holy shrines. They should know that their main duty, if they value that management, is to help eligible Muslims to perform their religious duty of hajj. Saudi Arabia's sudden, unconventional, and unethical decision to reduce the number of Iranian pilgrims by 50 percent, in addition to delaying hundreds of thousands of eager Iranian pilgrims in the performance of their hajj duty, would completely prevent about 177,000 septuagenarian Iranian pilgrims [accumulated backlog of elderly still waiting to undertake pilgrimage] from performing this divine duty. Undoubtedly, this is contrary to the Saudi rulers' religious and moral commitment to assist Muslims in the performance of their religious duty. Although the Saudi Government, by insisting on its criterion -- that is, accepting one pilgrim per thousand of the population of each country -- is trying to reduce Iran's quota, it is perfectly obvious that many countries are sending a much smaller number than their quota. Therefore, sending 110,000 or more Iranian pilgrims, as in previous years, would not have a fundamental effect on the management of the pilgrims' affairs. Arabistan [Saudi Arabia] is insisting on reducing the quota of pilgrims agreed with Iran, while every year several countries send more than their set quota to the House of God. In this connection one can mention Egypt, which has a smaller population than Iran but exceeds the quota set by Arabistan by tens of thousands of pilgrims. Such contradictory assertions and behavior by the Saudi rulers give rise to the thought that the Saudi Government has adopted a political attitude in relation to the hajj. This of course is not in harmony with that country's obligation to manage the affairs of the two holy shrines. Adopting a politically laden attitude toward people's religious obligations is a sensitive issue which can, furthermore, induce sensitivity. This attitude, moreover, cannot be justified or interpreted coherently within the framework of the two countries' friendly relations, which Iran has always tried to maintain. It is appropriate that while there is still time the Saudi rulers should adopt a more careful stance toward the uncompromising behavior of some of their diplomats in connection with the issue of the hajj, and in particular toward the issue of pilgrimage by hundreds of thousands of Iranians, so that, as it did a few years ago, this political and Islamic ritual can take place in an appropriate and fitting fashion.
