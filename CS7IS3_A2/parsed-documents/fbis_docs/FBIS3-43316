In a communique published today and signed by its delegate general, Mr. Antoine Folly, the UDS said that in line with the decisions made on 23 November 1993 not to take part in the 23 January 1994 legislative election in the current conditions, the party has not put forth a candidate to stand in that election and therefore no candidate can claim to have been mandated by the UDS. The UDS states, and I quote, it had set up conditions for its participation in a free and fair election and regrets that these conditions are not met.
