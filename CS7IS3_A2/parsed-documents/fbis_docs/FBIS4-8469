The cabinet members broke into applause and the news of the result achieved by their colleague Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov. The first member of the government to comment on the news in an interview for national radio was Deputy Finance Minister Svetoslav Gavriyski. He interpreted what he called this logical result by saying: From now on the ball is in our court; it is our job to implement the remaining elements presented in the government program so as to get the money. According to Deputy Minister Gavriyski, after the expected foreign financing is received and added to our foreign currency reserves, the country will have about 2 billion dollars at his disposal, which will be sufficient to service the deal with the London Club and to stabilize the country's balance of payments. We may expect Bulgaria to be treated more favorably within the frameworks of the bilateral treaties with the member countries of the Paris Club, Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov added as his own comment on the news. From the upcoming visit this evening of his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel he expects to find solutions to the topical problems recently under discussion, such as the balance of the former GDR [German Democratic Republic]. Minister Daskalov also expects that during this visit Germany will demonstrate a greater commitment to encouraging investments in Bulgaria and to opening up the European markets for Bulgaria. [passage omitted on other matters discussed at cabinet meeting] The team of consultants treating Prime Minister Berov is expected to meet at 1300 today. After examining the results of the laboratory analysis, the consultants are expected to make a final diagnosis on the Prime Minister Berov's state of health. Everything else is whistling in the wind, Health Minister Tancho Gugalov said regarding the various stories being circulated by certain media. In the health minister's words, this morning's information indicates that the clinical picture is returning to normal extremely rapidly and that the patient has no typical symptoms of hepatitis. We expect that the health minister and chief doctor will give a news briefing this afternoon.
