The two-year bonds will carry an interest rate of 13 percent, 1.3 points higher than bank deposits of the same term. Interest rates for the three-year bonds will be 13.96 percent, 1.72 points higher than a three-year fixed deposit. These bonds will be sold to both individual investors and institutional buyers. This bond issue comes at a crucial time for the Finance Ministry, which hopes treasury bonds to become a key tool for raising capital from residents. And starting this year, State treasury bonds will be the sole means of offsetting the national deficit--estimated at 60 billion yuan ($6.9 billion) for 1994. Meanwhile, the two-year bonds are expected to be traded in markets two months after the issuance concludes on May 31. The three-year bond purchasers will be given certificates to prove ownership, rather than the normal paper bonds. This should be more convenient for buyers. The three-year issuance is expected to end on June 30. In addition, to attract more investors, the ministry will encourage people to cash in their 1991 three-year treasury bonds -- due on July 1 -- and the five-year 1989 special treasury bonds early and use the money to buy the new bonds. These buyers will get 1 percentage point more interest for their old bonds. And investors will also be able to cash their new three-year certificates in advance and still earn more interest than bank a deposit if they hold the bonds for more than six months. The ministry is optimistic this year's bond issue because of the high interest rates, the flexible means in floating the bonds, the improved macro-economic order and the central government's determination in controlling the inflation. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli vowed on Wednesday that State employees will not have to buy into its treasury bonds flotation this year. "I believe issuance will be much easier than last year since we are operating a better financial market," he said. Last year's 30 billion yuan ($3.45 billion) bond flotation was hampered by illegal fund raising early in 1993 which siphoned off bank deposits. China plans to issue a total of 100 billion yuan ($11.5 billion) in treasury bonds this year. In January, the ministry issued six month and one year paperless treasury bonds mainly to institutional buyers.
