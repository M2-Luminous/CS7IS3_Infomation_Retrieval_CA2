With various measures gradually put in place, grain and oil prices have started to stabilize and will drop to the previous level. Agricultural workers and the vast numbers of peasants should have a sober understanding of this. The current fluctuation in grain and oil prices is abnormal, with some temporary, psychological, and speculative factors playing a promoting role. In spite of this, it has also sounded the alarm to people: We must not lower our guard on the grain issue and on no account should we relax grain production. Taken as a whole, the current price of grain purchased according to contract or at a negotiated price is still on the low side. To a certain extent this has affected the enthusiasm of peasants to grow grain and sell it to the state. If we have grain in our hand, we will not be in a commotion. Only when the state has ample grain reserves in its grain depots can it allocate and transfer grain as necessary and keep grain prices at an appropriate level. The grain in state grain depots is purchased from the peasants according to contract or at negotiated prices. Only when the prices are right will the peasants enthusiastically sell grain to the state and only thus can the state grain depots be stocked with ample grain. Therefore, appropriately raising grain purchasing prices is something that should not be overlooked. The state is gradually solving this issue. The need to attach great importance to grain production is a fundamental issue. Although the psychological factor contributes considerably to the rocketing grain and oil prices in some parts of southern China, grain is still relatively insufficient in specific places. This tells us that grain is a special commodity indispensable to all people in their daily life. There should be an ample supply of grain at any time, and this should be based on a bumper harvest with increased output. For this reason, it is necessary to maintain certain grain acreage and ensure a stable increase in grain output; increase input in grain production, improve grain-growing conditions, and raise per-unit yield; and pay attention to adjusting the grain products structure and improving grain quality so as to meet people's gradually increasing needs in material life. It should be mentioned that some localities have blindly opened development zones. In doing so they have used many grain fields and caused a reduced grain output this year. As there is less grain, prices naturally rise. As a result, they have to buy grain in other places and are very worried. This is a lesson worth learning. In opening up development zones we must make overall plans, take all factors into consideration, and ensure that grain acreage will not be reduced. In such a big country with a large population like ours, this should be taken as a principle. The fluctuation in grain and oil prices is a signal we must correctly grasp. Seeing that grain prices are rocketing, some peasants become more enthusiastic to grow grain. This is beyond reproach. However, we should also stress quality. That is to say, we should grow strains that are readily marketable. Otherwise, if the products are unmarketable, it will be a burden. Seeing that the state is keeping down grain prices, some other peasants are less enthusiastic to grow grain. This is incorrect. In keeping down grain prices, the state wants to keep them at an appropriate level. It is not aimed at keeping them as low as possible. Rather, the state wants to keep grain prices at a level which enables grain growers to have a reasonable income and which the grain-consuming urban residents can afford. We should unswervingly attach importance to grain production and strive to gain a bumper harvest with increased grain output.
