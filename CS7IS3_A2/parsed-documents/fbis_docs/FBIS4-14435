Nonetheless It Is Ready for Dialogue"] [Text] The results of the preliminary talks in Moscow between Chechen Republic State Secretary Aslambek Akbulatov and Russian presidential administration chief Sergey Filatov have not as yet received official approval in Groznyy. According to Republic parliament chairman Yakhyat Idigov, Chechnya regards the positions outlined by both sides at this stage as fairly satisfactory. Russia's conditions (there are two) are that Chechnya will continue to be a component of the Russian Federation and that democratic elections be held there, Sergey Shakhray, Russian nationalities and regional policy minister, told a State Duma session. It is another matter, Idigov said, that the Chechen leadership is in no haste to accept these terms as an expression of the government viewpoint on the issue of relations with the republic. "We know Shakhray's position," NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent was told, "but this does not mean that these are actually Russia's terms." Groznyy knows that there are forces in Russia capable of abandoning the old- fashioned ambitions. In this respect, the interlocutor made clear, Groznyy does not see the Russian State Duma and the Federation Council as reliable allies. Primarily because in the eyes of the incumbent Chechen authorities their Russian colleagues do not represent legitimate executive bodies. Nonetheless, Groznyy is left with no other option than to accept the inevitable, especially given that over here "it is traditional to respect the choice of Russia's peoples who have elected the present composition of the Federal Assembly." With respect to the possibility of the anti-Dudayev opposition's using the name and authority of Ruslan Khasbulatov, who now lives in Groznyy, Idigov noted that Ruslan Khasbulatov, a citizen of Chechnya, a well-known advocate of the idea of "a single and indivisible Russia," will not find it very easy to retain his authority among his fellow countrymen. Recalling the details of the nearly two-centuries-old Russian-Chechen "alliance," speaker Idigov observed that furthermore, on the issue of Chechnya's independence, the anti-Dudayev opposition fully shares the position of Groznyy officialdom and that no Khasbulatov or his admirers, "bent by Soviet rule," will manage "to buy the hard-won freedom so cheaply." Neither will this "maneuver" come off with certain Russian politicians who are trying, as it is known to Groznyy, to "involve" Khasbulatov in the complicated Russian-Chechen relations.
