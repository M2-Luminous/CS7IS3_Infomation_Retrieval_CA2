It is a sacred duty for these forces to protect citizens, guarantee their security, and preserve the country's stability. It is the gang of rebellion and secession who is carrying out such treacherous acts of hostility. They sold themselves, their consciences, and their minds to the devil, imagining that this would help them internationalize the Yemeni issue and promote it in foreign media and in public opinion. Therefore, they attribute these ugly criminal acts to the forces protecting and national achievements and the people, foremost of which are unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. The source said the gang, which is committing crimes against the people and the homeland, has won nothing internally but the rejection and hatred of all Yemeni people throughout the country. These criminal acts will never achieve their illegitimate and unpatriotic objectives. They will backfire on the perpetrators, bringing just and deterring punishment. The source said that cease-fire initiatives and the political leadership's efforts to entrench them and the state's constitutional authority are based on an ability to confront all acts of hostility and to state practically that the opportunity for dialogue has never been closed, in light of the principled and declared bases. Many opportunities have been provided for many of those who have been misled to speak and to define their positions bravely and to be confident that they will find in the ranks of unity and constitutional legitimacy all safety, protection, appreciation, respect, and understanding of all the pressure and the means of repression exercised by the rebels to draw them by force into the tunnel of disgrace and destruction. The source said the rebels are stepping up their hostile, hysterical action against the places in which the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy are located in the al-Huswah, al-Basatin, Shaykh 'Uthman, Madinat al-Sha'b, al-Mansurah, [?Amad al-Mindarah], [?'al-Kyus], Bi'r al-Nasirah, Bi'r Nasir, al-'Imad, and other places. They are fiercely shelling civilian and economic installations in Little Aden, believing they have no way to achieve their illegitimate objectives other than more destruction and the escalation of the death machine that engulfs them. The forces protecting unity and legitimacy are working to silence the rancorous military hotbeds that never responded to all the cease-fire initiatives. The source emphasized that all Yemeni people are determined to stop the machine of destruction run by the rebels and to silence it forever so there will be no solutions except one based on understanding and dialogue, not on intransigence and the demented and rancorous use of the machine of destruction.
