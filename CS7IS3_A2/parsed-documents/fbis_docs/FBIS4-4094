Since the cause of the Qiandao Lake boat fire has come to light, the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) has twice invited SEF and experts concerned to come to Zhejiang to hear briefings by mainland specialists. Sources from Taibei [Taipei] said that the Executive Yuan's mainland committee and SEF agreed on going to Hangzhou after a meeting last Saturday night. The Qiandao Lake accident happened on March 31, when three armed locals robbed and burned 32 people to death, including 24 Taiwanese tourists, on a pleasure boat which was cruising on Qiandao -- or Thousand Island -- Lake in central Zhejiang Province.
