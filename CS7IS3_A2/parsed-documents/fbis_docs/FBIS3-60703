Speaking at the oath taking ceremony of the office bearers of the Rewalpindi Press Club, the senate chairman said the amendment is discriminatory and has tilted the military balance in favour of India. He added no law and morality can permit such kind of legislation. Wasim said the Pressler amendment has totally failed to achieve its objective of checking nuclear proliferation in the region. However it is causing harm to America's age old friend Pakistan. He said India exploded its nuclear device in 1971. U.S. experts have confirmed that India is also making missiles. The Senate chairman maintained that India will achieve the capability in the year 2000 AD to make missiles which can even target the United States. He reminded that India has already made intermediate missiles. In this situation, he said, imposition of Pressler amendment is one-sided and unjustified. He vowed ``we will render every sacrifice but will not bow before any discriminatory pressure.'' He told the audience ``we have made it clear to the visiting U.S. Senators that Pakistan will turn to other options if Pressler law stays.'' He added that we can buy better military hardware on soft terms from other countries. Wasim Sajjad said the amendment has affected our military defence capabilities which is deplorable in the existing circumstances. Speaking on the Kashmir issue, the Senate chairman urged the media to project the Kashmir issue vigorously at all levels and air voice against the violations of human rights there. [sentence as published] He said Western countries, specially the U.S. has started to realise the gravity of the Kashmir problem. He said he had very useful talks with the U.S. Senators, and noted that U.S. desired a peaceful solution of Kashmir. He expressed satisfaction over the realising of the violations of human rights in Kashmir by the Western countries. The House of Commons also desired an honorable solution to the Kashmir problem through use of the right of franchise to the Kashmiris, he added. Wasim Sajjad said both government and the opposition should play their due role for strengthening the democratic process in the country and should also play their effective and constructive roles for the progress of the country. It was high time, he added, to adopt a strategy and to introduce a system which guaranteed the integrity and solidarity of the country. He said the early solution of Kashmir issue was imperative for the congenial atmosphere among the two neighbouring countries i.e. India and Pakistan. He said Pakistan was facing various challenges including poverty, unemployment, health and education which need urgent attention of the government. He said the press has the power to change human thinking. ``I think responsibility of the national press has increased. Journalism is not only a profession but also a mission,'' Wasim Sajjad said adding the journalists should work to maintain peace, unity as well as promote positive thinking He stressed that journalists should also play their positive role in increasing awareness among the masses to root out the causes hindering progress and prosperity of the country. He paid glowing tributes to journalists for their sacrifices rendered for the freedom of press. ``I believe in the freedom of expression as I consider it the first condition for strengthening a democratic system,'' he added.
