[Rupees] 206 crore for 1993-1994. "...Strong Indian companies should go overseas with their products and services as India's flag bearers," ITC Chairman K.L. Chugh observed while reporting a gross income of Rs. 4,280 crore in the last fiscal. Explaining his company's corporate strategy in a liberalised regime Mr Chugh said: "It has been my firm belief that in order to integrate ourselves fast with the global economy, foreign investment and technology should be inducted through multinationals in areas that are needed." Mr Chugh's observations made after a meeting of the board here yesterday are significant because the company recently thwarted British American Tobacco (BAT)'s [as published] efforts to get a controlling stake and hive off some of ITC's non-traditional businesses. It was, however, obvious that Mr Chugh's corporate philosophy of taking on multinational predators applied only to hostile takeover bids. Though the ITC Chairman did not specifically mention the Centre for its support during his successful operation to stonewall BAT, it was clear that the company perceives a period of closer ties with the Union Finance Ministry. ITC's profits before tax increased 34 percent over that of 1992-93 to Rs. 350 crore (Rs. 261.48 crore). With a market capitalisation of Rs. 6,794 crore it continued to be among India's blue chips. The company's foreign exchange earnings totalled Rs. 822 crore.
