Further research has been conducted to determine the optimum age of the inflorescence and to identify the respective conditions resulting in more effective callus formation and regeneration during in vitro culture of the study hybrids. Inflorescences of various age (from the setting of the spikelet tubercle to meiosis) and lengths (from 0.8 to 80 mm) were sterilized, divided into small segments measuring 1-2 mm each, and placed in agar-treated Murashige-Skoog medium supplemented with 2,4-D (2.5 mg/l). The inflorescences were cultured at 28�C. Every 2-3 weeks, they were subcultured in modified media with a graduated decrease in the concentration of 2,4-D or replacement of 2,4-D in the medium by 6-BAP (0.5 mg/l), _a_-NUC (0.2 mg/l), and casein hydrolysate (1 g/l). To regenerate plants, the callus tissue was placed in a lit climate chamber with a temperature of 26�C and relative humidity of 70 percent. Callus incubation was observed 4-8 days after explantation and was most active, i.e., nearly 100 percent effective, in those inflorescences that were 20-40 mm long and in the pre-meiosis stage of development. Different types of callus were observed to form depending on the development of the explant in the starting medium. Embryoid-like structures grew most often in the hormone-free medium. Depending on the stage of the inflorescence's development, the number of plants regenerated per explant ranged from 1.4 to 64.6. Several of the calluses in the experiments remained capable of morphogenesis for 10 months. The appearance of embryoid-like structures from callus tissue formed by immature inflorescences and their development into plants were taken as confirmation of the possibility of breeding the said intergeneric hybrids by somatic embryogenesis.
