Now Russia is facing a new task: to broaden the framework of this memorandum, make it a pact not only between authorities and political forces but also an agreement among all citizens of the country. This was said today by participants of the ceremony of signing the accord at St. George's hall at the Kremlin. Those chapters of the document in which the parties pledge to strengthen the federal system and national relations, are giving the hope for the soonest and peaceful settlement of inter-ethnic conflicts. "The accord is opening the way to peace in Caucasus," President of Ingushetia Ruslan Aushev told ITAR-TASS in an interview. He expressed the wish that the conciliatory commission which would control the implementation of the terms of the accord, should pay close attention to the "working out of a mechanism for its enforcement so that this document would not repeat the sad fate of many earlier concluded agreements". President of North Ossetia Aksarbek Galazov shares Ruslan Aushev's standpoint. President of Tatarstan Mintimer Shaimiyev expressed a specific attitude to the signed accord: He will insist on additions to the document concerning Tatarstan. President of Ingushetia is counting on concluding a bilateral treaty with Russia. It is noteworthy that even those several political leaders who did not sign the accord -- leader of the communist Party of the Russian Federation Gennadiy Zyuganov, and chairmen of representative bodies of power in the Kemerovo and Vladimir Regions, Tuleyev and Vinogradov, were present at the ceremony not wishing to be considered opponents of the accord. "Our party has made a decision to continue a dialogue no matter what the situation is because civil war is not our choice. We are participating in all processes which lead to reconciliation, and are prepared to cover our part of the road for reaching this all- national purpose," Gennadiy Zyuganov told ITAR-TASS. Participants in the ceremony of signing the document were unanimous to think that the signed accord is not a tribute to the momentary political situation but a prologue to the revival of a strong great power.
