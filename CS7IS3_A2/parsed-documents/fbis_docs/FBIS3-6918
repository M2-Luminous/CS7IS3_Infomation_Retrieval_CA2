Shortly before the meeting, U.S. President Bill Clinton sent a "personal letter" to Kim Yong-sam the puppet, "reaffirming the United States' commitment to defending South Korea" and its determination "to strengthen the joint U.S.-South Korean defense posture." NODONG SINMUN today brands the puppets' fuss at "Chongwadae" as a reckless act to deliberately bring the situation to the phase of war after breaking up the working-level contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and South. The news analyst says: The Kim Yong-sam clique declared they would resume the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers against the fellow countrymen in the North and introduce Patriot missiles in a short time. This clearly shows they are a group of despicable traitors who seek a way out in harming fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces. As we have declared time and again, we are fully prepared to answer dialogue with dialogue and war with war. We are not afraid even if the South Korean puppets resume the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers and deploy in a short time Patriot missiles and anything more sophisticated. We do not like an empty talk. Our people and People's Army will severely punish the traitors attempting to stifle fellow countrymen in conspiracy with outside forces, and will resolutely defend our socialist motherland and the security of the nation. The United States had better know that there is nothing to gain and nothing good for it even if it instigates and gives a shot in the arm to such a fool as Kim Yong-sam who is floundering in the mud as a target of overthrow, forsaken by the nation.
