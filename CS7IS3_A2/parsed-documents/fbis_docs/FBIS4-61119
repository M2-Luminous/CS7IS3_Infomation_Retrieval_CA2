Kebich team on the absurdity of his intentions to implement the so-called unification of monetary systems of Belarus and Russia. This is useless. Even the Constitution, which was adopted by the Supreme Soviet, cannot stop him. A bankrupt, procommunist Belarusian Government, due to its inability to manage an independent state, is making attempts to remain in power by undertaking unusual methods -- abolishing the state itself. Comrade Kebich has recently stated that he is being nominated as a candidate for president only because he is taking into account the wishes of those who bet on him. It is not difficult to guess who had bet on him. Most likely, they are the people who are scared of "sorting things out" if new, principally honest people, who are able to pull the Republic out of the crisis, come to power. When the Belarusian statehood is mentioned, the current Belarusian Government -- represented by former bolsheviks-Leninists -- has rather a complex of state inferiority than a feeling of national pride and responsibility for the destiny of the governed state. At the same time, the Russian Government is working out its strategy for incorporating a sovereign state without the use of force (for example, through the so-called monetary merger) aimed at further widening this experiment to other CIS states and not only them. In addition, it does not conceal its imperialist intentions to restore the Russian empire and does it professionally and with a great deal of responsibility. However, hardly anyone from the parties, who is interested in this experiment, can predict the developments in these states. At the same time, these developments cannot be so harmless. At the same time, the adversaries of the so-called money merger -- we have to note that there are many of them both in Belarus and Russia -- begin to analyze the economic and political consequences of this unification. Let us, esteemed readers, discuss one of the proposed prospects for the development of the economic situation in Belarus over the postunification period, if the unification is really carried out. Saying nothing about the controversial clauses of the monetary merger agreement, which -- it has been repeatedly written and spoken about -- contradicts the new Belarusian Constitution, adopted on 15 March, in many details, we can assume that the unification of monetary systems will be implemented on "x-day" and, according to the agreement between the Russian and Belarusian Governments, Belarus will receive a certain sum of Russian rubles in cash and a recalculation of noncash Belarusian rubles to Russian ones on the basis of the agreed course be carried out. As a matter of fact, the money received should be sufficient to provide for a turnover of goods on the domestic market. So, what will happen after the "x-day"? Most likely, after a certain amount of money is allocated, the flow of goods from other CIS states, first and foremost from Russia, will go to Belarus because Belarusian prices and wages will be higher over a certain period of time. Money from Belarus will flow away, goods will "be eaten away," and the deficit of payment means will grow. Belarus will require a new portion of money to provide for the domestic turnover of goods, and purchases of goods and raw materials in Russia. To settle old debts and obtain new Russian credits, the Belarusian Government will have to sell for a song or hypothecate a controlling interest in such highly profitable and costly enterprises like "Beltranshaz" (what it has already done), the Belarusian metallurgical factory or the biggest oil and chemistry enterprises which had already attracted the attention of the Russian financial oligarchy and their lobby in the Russian Government circles. To create economic obstacles, Russia will want to financially isolate Belarus in the so-called ruble zone of a new type. There are many mechanisms for doing this. For example, Russia can complicate the transfer of payments from Belarus to Russia; it can establish a situation whereby Belarusian noncash money has no status and is not recognized by other states, primarily, by CIS partners. This will virtually repeat the 1992 scheme, when the Central Bank of Russia, according to Yeltsin's edict from 21 June 1992 "On Measures To Protect Russian Monetary System," effective 1 July 1992, began to keep accounts with Belarus through a single corresponding account of the Belarusian National Bank and the Central Bank of Russia. The experience of 1992-93 showed that such measures could bring about a situation whereby Belarusian enterprises will not be able to independently buy raw materials and many essentials for its industry products and resources abroad, first and foremost, in Russia, and will be forced to exchange them for Belarusian products sold abroad on a barter basis for convertible currency or Russian rubles. Due to this, the state budget will suffer greatly and inflation will grow. To service the domestic goods turnover and protect the consumer market, Belarus will be forced to introduce -- parallel with the Russian rubles -- new, or, maybe, old Belarusian "hares." Then Russia could "slightly" liberalize its domestic prices and wages and forget to simultaneously satisfy Belarusian needs in cash and noncash money. This, in turn, will exacerbate the problem of a lack of cash and noncash money in the accounts of Belarusian enterprises. In this case, Belarus will have to trade its products to every swindler coming from Russia for cash to be able to pay wages to its workers. Further, Russia can introduce such effective measures as economic pressure on Belarus, including customs duties, licenses, quotas, and other mechanisms, which will be imposed by Russia without any agreement with Belarus. The main goal of such measures is to enhance economic difficulties, lower the competitiveness of Belarusian goods, primarily on the Russian market with which Belarus is closely connected -- and Russia does not want to leave Belarus out of its scope of interests. Of course, all these measures will enhance the economic dependence of Belarus on Russia, in which Russia is strongly interested. Thereby, this is a vicious cycle. As a result of the so-called unification of monetary systems, Belarus will find itself in complete financial isolation and will be forever connected with Russia. After that, Russian governmental strategists, rich financial corporations, industrial groups and organisms will begin dividing the national wealth of Belarus. This process will be carried out according to the following scheme. The debts of Belarusian enterprises will be bought by big Russian banks or financial companies which control the deliveries of strategic goods and energy resources to Belarus. The Russian Government, through a specially set up network of economic difficulties (pricing, customs, export and import mechanisms), will set up tough conditions, owing to which all monetary and material resources will be withdrawn from Belarus. To survive, Belarus will make attempts to find foreign creditors but will be refused because virtually all foreign loans will be directed at the repayment of Russian debts and Belarus will not be able to persuade anyone that it will be able to repay its debts. Russia will also block these attempts because it does not need Belarus burdened with huge foreign debts. After that, Russia will toughly demand that Belarus begin urgently repaying its debts. Since that there will be nothing to pay with, controlling interests of Belarusian enterprises will be handed over to the Russian state or Russian financial corporations. The issuing of vouchers in Russia will be over by 30 June 1994, and effective 1 July, privatization for money will begin. As for Belarus, the distribution of vouchers will begin only on 1 July 1994. Is this being done by chance or not? In my opinion, this is a well-planned action by the Russian special services which are actively working within the Belarusian Government and the legislature. It is more profitable for Russia to acquire Belarusian enterprises for a song when they are still state property. This will require only Kebich's signature while after privatization they will require the shareholders' consent which will not be easy to obtain. Thereby, after the unification of Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, Belarus will lose its highly profitable enterprises, its unprofitable enterprises will go bankrupt, and the standard of life of the population will sharply decrease. A complete loss of economic independence will be the consequence of the monetary merger. After this, political annexation will follow. All the Belarusian population will hardly agree to this. A new stage of the fight for the restoration of independence of Belarus will be launched. So, is it necessary to first lose freedom to assess its value later? The last point. Why is the Belarusian Government so stubbornly pushing Belarus to the so-called monetary merger? There are many speculations on this issue. In my opinion, the key reason is a chance to remove the responsibility for economic collapse and keep power in their hands. They count on the presidential elections because a president will receive unprecedented powers to form executive bodies. It is no accident that Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin was so slow with signing the monetary merger agreement. He waited for the establishment of the date of the presidential elections in Belarus. Presidential elections should be held at the moment when Russian money -- acting hypnotically on Belarusian voters -- is transferred to the Belarusian economy. Russia requires a puppet president in Belarus who will dance to the Russian tune. Comrade Kebich suits Russia. If Judas betrayed Jesus Christ for silver, Kebich would sell Belarus for banknotes with the Kremlin printed on them. As I have already mentioned, Belarusian voters will sober up soon. But the power will be in the hands of those familiar to us -- people for whom personal interests are more important than the interests of their state and people. It is high time that the Belarusian Government stop carrying out its experiments with setting up an independent state without its own currency because this will not lead to anything good. To whom is the lack of Belarusian money and credit policy profitable? Let us recall how last February the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet exceeded its constitutional powers and issued trillions [currency not specified] in credit line to the agricultural-industrial complex under the Cabinet of Ministers' pressure. The National Bank took this money out of the air and earmarked it to the Cabinet of Ministers. But does anyone control the purposeful use of this uncovered money? If there is no control, this money could be quickly poured into trusted commercial companies. For example, these companies could be issued short-term credit lines from these purposeful funds. These companies could buy convertible currency, sell it immediately after the total fall in the exchange rate of the Belarusian "hare," and profit from the difference of the exchange rate. After that, the issued loan, which is uncovered and devalued, could be granted to the agricultural sector. Do people who deal with this kind of business need a rigid independent money and credit policy? The answer is unequivocal. No! The analysis of the roll-call vote on the issue of the Belarusian money and credit policy in the Belarusian legislature demonstrates that the deputies, who occupy the top positions in the state administration, do not want the order installed in the money and credit sphere. First and foremost, these are Prime Minister V. Kebich, Supreme Soviet Chairman M. Hryb, his deputies, chairmen of oblast executive committees, and their followers. I would like to address my colleagues in the legislature, who are not indifferent to the destiny of the Belarusian state, to weigh and sort out all the consequences of the so-called monetary Russian-Belarusian merger before ratifying this agreement and introducing changes to the new Constitution. There are many mechanisms, which could provide for financial integration with the CIS on equal terms, without being swallowed by another state. My colleagues from other states-partners and we should look for and introduce these measures in legislative acts. The government should observe the legislative acts, especially that of the Constitution adopted by the Supreme Soviet. Otherwise, it should drop its office.
