Havel has on several occasions condemned the expulsions, which were the result of decrees made by President Edvard Benes in 1945 and which affected over 2.5 million people. The Czech Borderlands Club was formed in 1992 in an attempt to counter the "Germanisation" of Czech border regions and now has 10,000 registered members. The KCP congress sent a letter today to the Czech government and parliament protesting against the possibility of Czech NATO membership and involvement in the Partnership for Peace project. The club demands Czech neutrality. Participants applauded as they heard deputy Kvetoslava Celisova (Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia) dismiss parliament as a body of people enriching themselves at other people's expense and Ognan Tuleskov (chairman of the non-parliamentary Christian Social Movement) declare that government coalition parties were financed by German foundations. Speakers reviled the government for condoning Germany's economic "Drang nach Osten' ("push to the east") and condemned the "humiliating rate of the Czech crown in relation to the German mark". Among delegates were former Communist Party general secretary for the Usti district Vaclav Sipek, communist-era editor-in-chief of the daily RUDE PRAVO Zdenek Horeni and other erstwhile functionaries of the communist regime.
