NEC will begin to take orders in December of 1993 for the 0.5&mgr;m cell-based LSI ``CB-C 8 Series'', which provides users with this type of design environment for the first time. The chip was developed in conjunction with Synopsys Inc., a major U.S. manufacturer of logic synthesis tools, and adopts a delay model that calculates the effects of input waveform degradation and other effects using a table format. In this manner, line delay can be calculated in a short time within an accuracy of 10% relative to the SPICE simulation method. The delay test method can be used not only to evaluate timing, but also to confirm that delay time meets requirements for logic synthesis. Test results can be incorporated during logic synthesis. NEC will begin taking order in December of 1993 for the 0.5&mgr;m cell-based LSI ``CB-C8 Series.'' this chip provides the user for the first time with a method that calculates line delay taking into account the effects in input waveform degradation and output load capacitance for the design of cell-based LSIs. The NEC-designed delay model (which includes line equivalency circuits and approximation methods for signal waveforms) can be used for verification of timing and also for calculation of delay time used for reference during logic synthesis. (See Table 1.) Delay Model Determines Success in 0.5&mgr;m Products LSI manufacturing companies (such as NEC, Matsushita Electronic Industrial Co., etc.) agree that the success of the 0.5&mgr;m generation cell-based LSI relies upon the ``line delay model.'' Even in the 0.8&mgr;m generation, when designing LSIs having a high operating frequency, ``one-chip system versions could not be achieved due to the absence of a delay model'' (Casio Computer Co.). However, according to Fujitsu, the cost involved in rebuilding the design environment was the underlying problem. In the 0.5&mgr;m generation, high frequency applications such as in image processing are on the rise, and NEC reports that ``this problem can no longer be ignored.'' Matsushita Electric and Toshiba, which have preceded NEC in commercializing 0.5&mgr;m cell-based LSIs, have not released this type of delay model to customers. Matsuthita Electric recently reported that although input waveform cannot currently be taking into consideration, a second-generation model that includes the effects of the input waveform will be announced in 1994. Toshiba is also reportedly prepared to release such a model. Calculation of Delay for Input Waveforms The parameters emphasized by NEC in the determination of line delay are the degradation of input waveform and gate output load capacitance. The test model and CAD methods were developed together with Synopsys Inc. To calculate delay attributed to input waveform and output load capacitance, the delay times written in a table format are referenced. The SPICE simulation is a method which is generally used to accurately calculate line delay arising from the input waveform. However, the verification time needed for lines in LSIs which have several hundred thousand gates, becomes extraordinary. NEC's delay evaluation method which uses a table format, greatly reduces the verification time required, and also provides accuracy within 10% error of the SPICE simulation. The new evaluation method can be used not only for timing verification, but also for predicting line delay for logic synthesis. Delay time calculations can be done while performing logic synthesis in order to meet the timing and other conditions established by the design engineer. In the past, it was difficult to add revisions to incorporate the results of timing verification, because the delay model used for timing verification was not the same as the model used for logic synthesis. Establishment of the design environment for 0.5&mgr;m generation cell-based LSIs has made it possible to use high performance CPU cores. In the CB-C8 series, the CPU cores which can be used include the ``V30 MX'' 16-bit processor, the low power-consumption type RISC processor ``V810'', and the MIPS-related ``Vr series'' RISC processors. There are also peripheral function blocks, including a RAM bus interface which transfer 500M bytes of data per second. The chips will reportedly be profitable in the market for high-end workstations. Chip samples will be produced at the Sagamihara plant, and mass production will take place at NEC Yamaguchi. Once the 0.5&mgr;m technology gains a foothold in the market, plans call for mass production at NEC Kyushu and NEC Hiroshima, which are currently producing the CB-C7. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.
