They did not board it because they were very busy with the macroeconomic reform. It is obvious today, however, that they made a mistake because the train was carrying the political foundations of stability for the new economy. If the Salinas group (well, what is left of it) starts running after it, they still just might be able to clamber onto the caboose. It would not be a very elegant maneuver, but as we shall see, the alternative is worse. As things now stand, the Salinas group's main problem is credibility. How are we to define political credibility? A not particularly scientific, yet accurate definition would be as follows: credibility is something that the Mexican Government currently lacks but that it cannot do without or substitute for in order to effectively exercise authority in times of crisis. Credibility is nothing more than a predisposition to believe someone or something in spite of inadequate objective evidence. In the specific case of a government's credibility, it represents the degree to which citizens (or at least a majority of them) are satisfied with the deeds, explanations, promises, and character of the authorities. To say that the Mexican Government suffers from a growing lack of credibility is neither new nor unfounded. Let us look at a current example. Mori de Mexico, the polling firm run by Miguel Basanez, posed the following question to 312 persons whom it interviewed over the telephone in five major cities between 8 and 10 April: "Do you think that the people who are really to blame for Colosio's assassination will ever be found?" Forty-three percent said no; 34 percent said they did not know, and just 23 percent said yes. So, just slightly more than two of every 10 respondents showed complete confidence in the government regarding something as important as solving the murder of the state party's presidential candidate while he was being guarded by the Presidential Staff. As for the official investigation into the assassination of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo last year in Guadalajara, the bishop of Cuernavaca, Luis Reynoso, speaking at the Conference of Mexican Bishops, declared: "We (bishops) are not satisfied but we do hope to learn more." I do not think that I am exaggerating if I say that many of us Mexicans feel worse than the bishops: dissatisfied with the investigations into the assassinations of Colosio, Posadas, and many others (Buendia, Ovando, the Ocosingo five, the "Morelia" ejido three, etc.) and without much hope of seeing these cases solved. Trust in the authorities is an indispensable, irreplaceable element of a good government. True, a government can, in principle, compel obedience to its authority by sheer force, but in the long run, force or fear has never been the foundation of good government. And although the threat of force to compel obedience underlies every form of government, the modern exercise of authority ought to be based on persuasion, not coercion. Ideally, political authority ought to be synonymous with "legitimate power," and obedience ought to be the upshot of such legitimacy. But legitimacy is not possible without credibility. Therefore, it is urgent to restore the credibility of the governmental structure in our country. Only a massive infusion of trust in government action will enable the country to cope successfully with the complex and dangerous dynamics already unleashed by the major political event that is hurtling towards us: the 21 August elections. According to the previously mentioned Mori poll, the gap between the presidential candidates of the State party (PRI) and the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] is barely 10 percent, which is just about how far the PRD candidate is in front of the PAN [National Action Party] standard-bearer. Moreover, one-quarter of the respondents declined to voice a preference. So, the actual outcome of the election is going to depend on them, in other words, the people who are not sure or do not wish to say for whom they are going to vote. One can, of course, argue about how representative and statistically reliable the Mori survey is (90 percent), but there can no longer be any doubt that the upcoming election will be genuinely competitive. After ludicrous, shameful experiences like the unopposed candidacy of Jose Lopez-Portillo, the fact that electoral competition is finally taking root in Mexico is very encouraging. Institutionalizing such competition is the only path to a truly democratic political system because only then will the electorate have real choices in terms of leaders and programs. Nonetheless, darkening what should be a bright horizon is the fact that in 1994 this competition is going to take place amid civic skepticism. True electoral competition against a backdrop of mounting mistrust, marked by doubts about the impartiality of the government during the campaign and, above all, about the accuracy of the official returns, is a perfect prescription for turning the post-election period into precisely what it ought not to be: a conflict that swamps institutional channels, a conflict of whose origin we are well aware but of whose outcome we are not sure. And an ungovernable country is one of the outcomes it may hold for us. PRI's preparations for 21 August and whatever comes afterward are not at all reassuring. According to a PRI document that the newspaper REFORMA (16 April) obtained a copy of, the party already has a plan, designed by propaganda experts, to use the supposedly neutral authorities for its benefit, among other things. Specifically, the plan "envisages the selection of groups of officials from political organizations, such as the IFE [Federal Electoral Institute], the Interior Secretariat...to issue discreet, programmed, and timely statements with the message and of the intensity deemed necessary to define and control the direction of the debate." Since the problem is credibility, not an official victory, PRI already intends to proclaim victory on 21 August and to back it up with, among other things, the "testimony of polling-place officials, stating that they had seen no anomalies." Therefore, the State party is alive and kicking. The separation between PRI and the government Colosio announced shortly before he was assassinated has not taken place; much less is there a determination to hold clean elections. PRI is not showing any real willingness to change its long-standing policy, the one that says: elections in Mexico are useful for a lot of things, except to decide who is to govern. And the fact that the famous "Atlacomulco group," headed by Carlos Hank Gonzalez, is the one that has has been charged with seeing to it that PRI's new candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, wins makes it even more unlikely that the outcome of the election next August will be credible. The "Atlacomulco group," which is monopolizing leadership posts in the Zedillo campaign, does not exactly have a reputation as a friend of modern democracy. Quite the opposite: it is known for its iron-like determination to prolong the authoritarianism that has turned out to be such a good deal for many of its members. While Mexican politics was conducted against the backdrop of the authoritarian normalcy that was created and bolstered during 65 years of uninterrupted control by a State party, electoral credibility was not a particularly important factor because average Mexicans had no choice but to abide by the dictates of the government, whether or not they believed or liked it. Until 1988, we Mexicans had no real political options. The situation is different today. Going against the grain and overcoming countless obstacles, the options have finally emerged, and therefore, the elections are going to be competitive. This time, however, the opposition (the Cardenas people in particular) is better organized than in 1988, and it will be harder for the president and PRI to assure the country's governability if the opposition refuses to accept the legality of the election results. When trust in the authorities is something more than just resignation, credulity, or naivete, it is the result of experience, something born of a pattern of conduct by government officials towards the governed, whereby they keep their promises and make their actions consistent with their words. The Salinas group has been credible only in the realm of macroeconomics. Hence, Salinas' credibility is strong only among the financial elite. As far as the overseas audience is concerned, Salinas' major promise was to carry out neoliberal economic change while maintaining social order and political stability. Since the latter part of the promise has not been kept (Chiapas, Tijuana), Salinas' credibility abroad has declined dramatically. One good example of this is the recent article by Michael Elliot in the 4 April issue of NEWSWEEK. According to him, today, Mexico is paying the price for having brought about economic change while trying to save itself the political cost. Salinas' "fatal error," which, according to Elliot, Asian and African leaders should take note of, is this: "If a society is granted economic freedom, it will also have to be given other freedoms: to elect its authorities and to express its desires openly. If this does not happen, the supposed economic liberator will be consumed by the fire of unfulfilled expectations." At the beginning of this article, I stated that perhaps all is not lost as far as credibility is concerned. Indeed, the president can still lessen the long-term consequences of his "fatal error." For example, he could and should make a dramatic gesture to separate his government and his economic reforms from the fate of Ernesto Zedillo in particular and PRI in general. He could summon the leaders of the authentic opposition (PRD and PAN) to a "summit meeting" and at last lay the groundwork for a true historic pact. Such a gesture could transform what threatens to be a disastrous finale for his six-year term into something positive and different: a transition from authoritarianism to democracy. What is at stake today is the governability of the country after August. Without such governability, the gains that have been made in the neoliberal economic agenda run the risk of being undone. If that were to happen, there would be neither political nor economic modernity, and the losers would not be just, as always, the people on the bottom but also the ones on top.
