A statement issued here Tuesday by John Garang's SPLA faction said its forces of Maridi-Mundri, reinforced by those from Rumbek, under the command of Gier Chuong Aluong and Jadallah Wani, destroyed two tanks, and 16 lorries, forcing the enemy to run in disarray. During their flight, the government forces abandoned seven landrovers and four Toyotas mounted with heavy machine guns, ammunition of various categories and food, the statement said, adding that SPLA forces also captured a radio communication set and one of its operators, a man from the Nuba Mountains. The Sudanese Government has persistently denied that its forces had mounted a major offensive in southern Sudan, where a bloody civil war has been raging since 1983 between government forces and southern rebels seeking to end domination of the mainly Christian and animist south by the Arabised Moslem north. Khartoum has instead said the fighting has been between the different faction of the SPLA, a claim that has been strongly denied by the southern rebels.
