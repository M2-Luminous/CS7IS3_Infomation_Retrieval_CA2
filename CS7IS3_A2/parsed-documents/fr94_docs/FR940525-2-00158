FR940525-2-00158 FR940525-2-00081 [Release No. 34&hyph;34082; File No. SR&hyph;DGOC&hyph;94&hyph;01] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Delta Government Options Corp.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Modifying the Definition of Expiration Date May 18, 1994. On January 18, 1994, pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 Delta Government Options Corp. (``DGOC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change that modifies the definition of expiration date. On March 31, 1994, the Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the Federal Register to solicit comment from interested persons. 2 No comments were received. This order approves the proposal. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33805 (March 23, 1994), 59 FR 15249. I. Description The proposed rule change amends DGOC's definition of ``expiration date,'' found in Article I of DGOC's Procedures, to provide that the expiration date may occur on any business day on or before the second anniversary of the writing of the option contract. 3 The proposal is a response to DGOC participants' requests that DGOC afford them the opportunity to select expiration dates that match more precisely the tenor of other financial contracts developed in the over-the-counter market and in other trading environments. The proposal enables participants to submit for processing at DGOC treasury options trades that prior to this proposal could not have been submitted to DGOC because their stated expiration dates were not available through DGOC. 3 Previously, DGOC's rules provided that the expiration date could have been on any Friday that occurred not later than the last Friday of the month in which the second anniversary of the writing of the option occurred. II. Discussion Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act that the rules of a clearing agency must promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and must remove impediments to and must perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. 4 The proposal enlarges the class of treasury option trades eligible for clearance and settlement at DGOC. By potentially increasing the number of trades that will be cleared and settled through DGOC, which is a registered clearing agency with automated clearance and settlement procedures, the proposal facilitates the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transaction. Furthermore, more trades can be processed through the national clearance and settlement system that otherwise would have to be settled through decentralized and more inefficient operations. 4 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988). In addition, the proposal affords DGOC participants with additional flexibility to adjust duration in relation to their overall treasury security portfolios. This will enable participants to manage their risks more effectively. III. Conclusion For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act. It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DGOC&hyph;94&hyph;01) be, and hereby is, approved. For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
