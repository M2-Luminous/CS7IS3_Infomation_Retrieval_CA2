The Contractor shall provide and maintain all such guard lights and other protection for the public as may be required by applicable statutes, ordinances, and regulations or by local conditions. d. The Contractor shall do all things necessary or expedient to protect properly any and all parallel, converging, and intersecting lines, joint line poles, highways, and any and all property of others from damage, and in the event that any such parallel, converging and intersecting lines, joint line poles, highways, or other property are damaged in the course of the construction of the Project, the Contractor shall at its own expense restore any or all of such damaged property immediately to as good a state as before such damage occurred. e. Where the right-of-way of the Project traverses cultivated lands, the Contractor shall limit the movement of his crews and equipment so as to cause as little damage as possible to crops, orchards, or property and shall endeavor to avoid marring the lands. All fences which are necessarily opened or moved during the construction of the Project shall be replaced in as good condition as they were found and precautions shall be taken to prevent the escape of livestock. Except as otherwise provided in the descriptions of underground plowing and trenching assembly units, the Contractor shall not be responsible for loss of or damage to crops, orchards, or property (other than livestock) on the right-of-way necessarily incident to the construction of the Project and not caused by negligence or inefficient operation of the Contractor. The Contractor shall be responsible for all other loss of or damage to crops, orchards, or property, whether on or off the right-of-way, and for all loss of or damage to livestock caused by the construction of the Project. f. The Project, from the commencement of work to completion, or to such earlier date or dates when the Owner may take possession and control in whole or in part as hereinafter provided shall be under the charge and control of the Contractor and during such period of control by the Contractor all risks in connection with the construction of the Project and the materials to be used therein shall be borne by the Contractor. The Contractor shall make good and fully repair all injuries and damages to the Project or any portion thereof under the control of the Contractor by reason of any Act of God or other casualty or cause whether or not the same shall have occurred by reason of the Contractor's negligence. (i) To the maximum extent permitted by law, Contractor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Owner and Owner's directors, officers, and employees from all claims, causes of action, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) for personal loss, injury, or death to persons (including but not limited to Contractor's employees) and loss, damage to or destruction of Owner's property or the property of any other person or entity (including but not limited to Contractor's property) in any manner arising out of or connected with the Contract, or the materials or equipment supplied or services performed by Contractor, its subcontractors and suppliers of any tier. But nothing herein shall be construed as making Contractor liable for any injury, death, loss, damage, or destruction caused by the sole negligence of Owner. (ii) To the maximum extent permitted by law, Contractor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Owner and Owner's directors, officers, and employees from all liens and claims filed or asserted against Owner, its directors, officers, and employees, or Owner's property or facilities, for services performed or materials or equipment furnished by Contractor, its subcontractors and suppliers of any tier, and from all losses, demands, and causes of action arising out of any such lien or claim. Contractor shall promptly discharge or remove any such lien or claim by bonding, payment, or otherwise and shall notify Owner promptly when it has done so. If Contractor does not cause such lien or claim to be discharged or released by payment, bonding, or otherwise, Owner shall have the right (but shall not be obligated) to pay all sums necessary to obtain any such discharge or release and to deduct all amounts so paid from the amount due Contractor.
