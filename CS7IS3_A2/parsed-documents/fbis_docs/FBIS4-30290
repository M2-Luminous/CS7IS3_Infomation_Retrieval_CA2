It said the U.S. authorities must give the top priority to the welfare and interests of the 70 million Korean people with regard to the problem of the Korean peninsula. Urging the United States to declare no more that it regards military action as a policy option on the Korean peninsula, the statement said it must admit that dialogue and negotiation are the most reasonable and just means of ironing out its differences with the DPRK. It said attention must be drawn to the danger of the nuclear weapons possessed by nuclear states including the United States and steps be taken for a total elimination of nuclear weapons. All parties concerned must, above all, prevent the recurrence of the destructive war in Korea, it said. It warned that international "sanctions" will only increase the tension. We consider a permanent solution to the question is dialogue, not the means of arms, it said.
