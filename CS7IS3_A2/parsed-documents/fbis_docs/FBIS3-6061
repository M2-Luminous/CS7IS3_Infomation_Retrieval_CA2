Currently, Korean firms or individuals wanting to register with local administrative bodies as the suppliers of goods and services to the U.S. army have to meet a set of requirements. For instance, the firms should be capitalized at 50 million won ($62,000) or more, while individuals need to maintain a minimum daily deposit of 10 million won for one month upon application. In addition, the suppliers also have to meet certain qualification conditions in terms of manpower and facilities stipulated by separate business laws. The biggest obstacle for the would-be suppliers, however, has been the requirement to join a cooperative of purveyors which awards a clean bill for security to its members, another must to become a military supplier government officials said. The capital and qualification requirements will be abolished under the new rules, which will be fixed at an administrative deregulation meeting next week. The provision which obligates the obtaining of security approval will also be removed, the officials said. As of the end of last month, there were 534 purveyors to the U.S. army, and their 1993 business volume reached $327 million, they said.
