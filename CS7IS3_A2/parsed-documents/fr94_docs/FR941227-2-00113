FR941227-2-00113 FR941227-2-00078 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION Documents Containing Reporting or Recordkeeping Requirements: Office of Management and Budget Review AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Notice of the Office of Management and Budget review of information collection. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has recently submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review the following proposals for the collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). 1. Type of Submission, new, revision, or extension: Revision. 2. Titles of the information collection: Proposed rule: 10 CFR Parts 11 and 25, NRC Licensee Renewal/Reinvestigation Program. 3. The form number is applicable: NRC Form 237. 4. How often the collection is required: On occasion. 5. Who will be required or asked to report: NRC regulated facilities and other organizations requiring access to or control over special nuclear material or NRC classified information. 6. An estimate of the number of responses: A reduction of 300. 7. An estimate of the total number of hours needed to complete the requirements or request: A reduction of 60 hours (12 minutes per response). 8. An indication of whether Section 3504(h), Pub. L. 96&hyph;511 applies: Not applicable. 9. Abstract: 10 CFR Parts 11 and 25 require that access authorizations expire five years from the date of issuance and require that applications for renewals be filed with NRC at least 120 days prior to expiration. For those individuals who have an active Department of Energy (DOE) ``Q'' or ``L'' or comparable access authorizations and who are subject to the DOE or other Federal agency's Reinvestigation Program, the renewal paperwork submission requirement consists of an NRC Form 237, ``Request for Access Authorization.'' The expiration date and the use of NRC Form 237 for renewal are being eliminated for these individuals. The individual's submission of the reinvestigation application required by DOE or other Federal agency will satisfy NRC renewal submission and paperwork requirement. Copies of the submittal may be inspected or obtained for a fee from the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, N.W. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Comments and questions can be directed by mail to the OMB reviewer: Troy Hillier, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, (3150&hyph;0046, 0050, 0062), NEOB&hyph;10202, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. Comments can also be submitted by telephone at (202) 395&hyph;3084. The NRC Clearance Officer is Brenda Jo Shelton, (301) 415&hyph;7233. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 19th day of December 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Gerald F. Cranford, Designated Senior Official for Information Resources Management.
