As many as 125 of 156 deputies have voted for this decision. Addressing the session, President Levon Ter-Petrosian, who was the initiator of this extraordinary session, expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that Armenia is far behind in the privatization process. In his words, until now Armenia has made only two serious steps in this direction, namely privatization of land and housing. "It's a shame to call privatization what we are discussing now because these are just those first elementary moves which had to be made much earlier. These moves don't even have any connection with the economic policy," underlined Ter-Petrosian. As he said, "the private sector always existed and played a certain role in the sphere of the economy in normal communist states, for example, in the previous German Democratic Republic, Hungary, or China." The president believes that the third serious step to be made in the near term should provide for issuance of cash totalling 20% of industrial enterprises'cost value to their workers. He also deems it necessary to expand lists of sites destined for privatization. In his interview with Interfax Ter-Petrosian pointed out that Armenia plans to carry out "a widescale privatization of small sites" and this, to quote Ter-Petrosian, must "give a noticeable stimulus to the republic's economic life." IF Note: According to the program confirmed by the parliament, 8,913 sites will be privatized in 1994, 61% of which are uncompleted construction sites, agricultural sites, state trade enterprises, and catering and servicing enterprises. In 1995-1996, the percent of these sites is to grow to 74%. Small enterprises are the first to be privatized (there are 75% of them in the republic), with the number of workers at 80% of these enterprises not exceeding 5 people.
