FBIS4-52651 "dreas092_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-092 Daily Report 12 May 1994 North Korea ROK Family Interviewed After Defection ROK Family Interviewed After Defection SK1205152694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1516 GMT 12 May 94 SK1205152694 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- Kim Chae-su who had been the manager of the East Fisheries Company No. 100 of South Korea before defecting to the North through a third country and his family which came with him were interviewed here today. Hailing from Chunchon, South Korean Kangwon Province, he, 34, served the puppet Army and then worked as a ground man of an airline company and a crime-prevention team member of a police box. He has in South Korea his father running a rice mill, his stepmother and two half brothers and two half sisters. He said he came to the North because he hated the U.S. imperialist aggressors and the South Korean rulers courting their favor. "When I was six years old, GI's stormed into my house and violated my mother. Later, my mother suffered from insomnia and left home and her whereabouts is still unknown," he said, and continued: "I have keenly felt that the Yankees are not only the enemy who brought tragedy to our family but also the enemy of the nation who divided our country into two and imposed sorrow and sufferings upon the whole nation." He said he began to sympathize with the independent politics of the North, and he felt his deep-seated grudge was wreaked by General Kim Chong-il when he drove Americans into a tight corner through DPRK-USA talks, standing in solo confrontation with the United States to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. "I could not repress an urge to rush at a run to the general and make a deep bow to him in gratitude," he added. He said he decided to carry into practice his long-conceived plan to go over to the North and, at last, came over to the embrace of the great President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Kim Chong-il, together with his family. Pointing out that anti-American sentiments are growing among South Korean puppet Airforce units, he said if the United States and the traitor Kim Yong-sam unleash a war against the North, the "ROK Army" would turn their guns at the U.S. troops and their stooges, not fighting the fellow countrymen in the North. The wife of Kim Chae-su, Mun Chong-cha, 34, referring to the educational conditions of South Korea, said that in the South there must be a colossal amount of money if one want his child to receive a higher education and acquire a special knowledge. "One must have 50,000 dollars to get his child through schools up to the high school," she added. She said she saw that everything was wonderful in the North, but particularly grateful was that the state was bringing up children and enabling them to bring their talent into full play. She said she felt like giving birth even to ten children in such a society good to live in. Touching upon the public sentiments toward the present "civilian" regime, Kim Chae-su said it is the present-day feeling of the people in the South that nothing can be expected of Kim Yong-sam and he must be removed. He said: "Now, there are various queer nicknames for Kim Yong-sam, such as a fascist maniac, traitor and illiterate, the like of which no other ruler in the world had ever been called by. They are nicknames ridiculing him about his treacheries, perfidy, falsity and deception. "There is nobody in the South who feels sympathy with Kim Yong-sam. Everybody says he must be killed. The public sentiments of the South being such, the day is not far off when he will meet his doom." Kim Chae-su's son, Kim Un-chol, 11, said he practised Taekwon-do in the South to protect himself from rogues but, now, in the North, he would develop his Taekwon-do skill with redoubled vigor so as to fly high the flag of the DPRK in the world. Kim Chae-su said: "The history of our nation and the realities of the North and the South show that the destiny of a country and nation entirely depends on its leader. "Now the North is displaying its might as a big power worldwide and the country is prospering and all the people are living in happiness. It owes this to the great President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Kim Chong-il."
