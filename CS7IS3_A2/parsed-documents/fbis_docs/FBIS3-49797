[Correspondent Iwona Parchimowicz; identified by caption] The visit will last two to three days. It will most certainly take place on Saturday and Sunday, as there are no meetings of the State Duma then. It will depend on the situation in the parliament whether the visit will be extended to Monday, 31 January. The Grunwald battlefields, Krakow, and Auschwitz are still on the program of the visit. Zhirinovskiy's colleague has also mentioned a visit to some large enterprise, preferably an arms industry enterprise. Bryczkowski is convinced that several important Polish politicians would like to meet Zhirinovskiy in the hope of getting closer acquainted with this Russian marvel. The personal protection of the Moscow guest is Bryczkowski's greatest concern. Most probably he will hire professionals from the antiterrorist brigade operating at Okecie airport. Because of the long route of the visit and a short stay, the guests will travel in Poland by helicopter.
