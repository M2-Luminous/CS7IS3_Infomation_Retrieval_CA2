A summary of estimated national annual compliance costs associated with the exclusion option and the special collection option, along with estimated baseline compliance costs are presented below in exhibit VII.1. Also presented are estimated incremental savings above baseline compliance costs for each option. Costs were annualized over a twenty-year period, using a 7% discount rate. The analysis used projected growth in the U.S. population over the twenty-year time frame of the analysis to estimate the increase in growth of spent lamp generation. Total estimated annualized savings range between approximately $85 million and $102 million for the exclusion and savings estimates for the special collection option range between $16 million and $20 million in savings. The above savings estimate is based on the assumption in the baseline that all facilities are properly managing their mercury-containing spent lamps as Subtitle C waste. Currently, however, some lamp generators may not be aware that fluorescent lamps are hazardous waste and therefore may not be following Subtitle C requirements. Hence, estimated savings may represent savings from a future scenario of full compliance with current law, rather than savings from current lamp management. EPA expects that if no regulatory action is taken, Subtitle C management of mercury-containing lamps will become more prevalent over the next few years.

Average total savings per generator for both options were simply assessed by dividing total savings by the estimated number of generators above (refer to the methodology section). The average annual baseline Subtitle C cost per generator is estimated to be between $2,000 to $2,250 per generator. Average per generator savings for the two deregulatory options are indicated below in exhibit VII.2. Individual generator savings, however, will vary due to facility size, proximity to disposal or recycling facility, and regional disposal/recycling costs.

($2,000)_Low Savings Scen. ($1,600)_Best Estimate. Special Collection ($300)_High Savings Scen. ($300)_Low Savings Scen. ($300)_Best Estimate. c. Savings Per Waste Lamp Generated. As with average savings per generator estimates, average savings per waste lamp generated were derived by simply dividing total upper and lower bound costs (savings) by the estimated number of waste lamps accounted for by small and large quantity generators in states without specific spent lamp management standards. The average baseline Subtitle C cost per bulb is estimated to be $.34 to $.36. The resulting savings per lamp is estimated at $.27 per bulb for the conditional exclusion option (both high and low savings scenario) and at $.05 per bulb for the special collection option. Again, cost per bulb may vary significantly due to site specific factors.
