"We are awaiting the Burmese junta's decision on whether to meet with us, and on the place and the time of the meeting," said the guerrilla, who is a colonel. However, the meeting should be held openly, he said. "The meeting must be held outside the territory controlled by the junta. If possible, it should be a neighboring country where the mass media will be allowed to observe." The Karen team will first sound out the Burmese junta on the subjects to discuss at the peace talks. Initially, low-level representatives from both sides could meet to prepare an agenda for a meeting of higher-level officials, he said. Gen. Bo Mya, the KNU's president will not take part in the first talks. Two months ago, the KNU appointed a team, headed by Brig. Gen. Maung Maung, its joint secretary, to meet with Burmese junta representatives. But a new team will be appointed when the Burmese junta is ready for talks, he said. The Karen colonel, who is a close aide of Gen. Bo Mya, said the KNU regards the peace negotiations as very important to settling its prolonged conflict with Rangoon.
