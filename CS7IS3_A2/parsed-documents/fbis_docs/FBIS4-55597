On the basis of the report approved by the government on Wednesday [11 May], the NATO leadership will draft the specific program of cooperation with the Czech Republic and submit it to Prague. "The proposal for cooperation with NATO is realistic," Ivan Busniak, director general of the Foreign Ministry Euroatlantic Section opines. According to the experience of the diplomats, the ideas of certain other states that signed the Partnership are too ambitious for NATO. In the end, there will apparently be fewer than 20 countries that join the project. Although the plan of close cooperation with the North Atlantic Alliance facilitates an individual approach on the part of the Alliance to each of the countries, it is expected that the mutual relationship that each of the Central European countries will have with NATO will be analogous and closer than that of the East European countries or the former Soviet Union. "NATO will not wait with the cooperation plan for Central European countries until it is clear what the position of Russia will be with respect to the Partnership," Ivan Busniak concludes. The Partnership for Peace does not give the countries that join it any security guarantees from NATO; rather, it assures them of security consultations with the Alliance in the event their independence or territorial integrity are threatened. The outcome of the consultations could be, above all, diplomatic activities of the NATO countries. Direct military assistance is considered only as the last recourse. The expenses arising from the participation of the Czech Republic in the Partnership are estimated at tens of millions annually. According to Busniak, however, the Czech Republic is one of the few states that have realized from the very beginning that they will have to pay the necessary costs. The Czech Republic offered NATO in the presentation document the UN base near Cesky Krumlov and training facilities in Boletice. This year, the Czech military zones are to be used for exercise purposes also by French and German soldiers. The joint training and cooperation with the NATO armies should also facilitate the participation of Czech soldiers in UN peace operations. After all, the core of UN peacekeeping forces is often the units of the NATO-member countries.
