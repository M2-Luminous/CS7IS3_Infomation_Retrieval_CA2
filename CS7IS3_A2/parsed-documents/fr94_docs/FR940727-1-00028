FR940727-1-00028 FR940727-1-00014 Wednesday July 27, 1994 Part IV Environmental Protection Agency 40 CFR Parts 260, 261, and 273 Hazardous Waste Management System; Modification of the Hazardous Waste Program; Mercury-Containing Lamps; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 143␣/␣Wednesday, July 27, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Parts 260, 261, and 273 [FRL&hyph;5020&hyph;1] RIN 2050&hyph;AD93 Hazardous Waste Management System; Modification of the Hazardous Waste Program; Mercury-Containing Lamps AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: Mercury-containing lamps (light bulbs) may be hazardous waste under the Toxicity Characteristic Rule issued under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and if so, must be managed as a hazardous waste, unless they are a household waste or are generated by an exempted small quantity generator. Mercury-containing lamps include fluorescent, high pressure sodium, mercury vapor and metal halide lamps. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is today seeking comment on two alternative approaches for the management of mercury-containing lamps. First, EPA is seeking comment on whether an exclusion from regulation as hazardous waste is appropriate for mercury lamps, provided they are disposed in municipal landfills that are permitted by States/Tribes with EPA approved municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill permitting programs or managed in mercury reclamation facilities that are permitted, licensed or registered by States/Tribes. The second approach would add mercury lamps to EPA's Universal Waste Proposal (February 11, 1993, 58 FR 8102). The Universal Waste approach is a streamlined, reduced regulatory structure, which is designed to address the management of certain widely generated wastes currently subject to full Subtitle C RCRA regulations. Today's proposal presents management options that would be considered less stringent than the existing Federal regulations because they would exempt certain activities now within the purview of RCRA Subtitle C (hazardous waste management). Therefore, States authorized under RCRA section 3006 to administer and enforce a hazardous waste system in lieu of the Federal program would be allowed flexibility in modifying their programs to adopt less stringent regulations regarding the management of mercury-containing lamps, should one of the proposed options be promulgated as a final rule. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be submitted on or before September 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Persons who wish to comment on this notice must provide an original and two copies of their comments, include the docket number (F&hyph;94&hyph;FLEP-FFFFF), and send them to EPA RCRA Docket (OS&hyph;305), U.S. EPA, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.
