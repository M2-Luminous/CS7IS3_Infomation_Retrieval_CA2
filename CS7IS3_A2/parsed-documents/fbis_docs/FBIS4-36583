The foreign minister explained that many sisterly and friendly states, including the UN Security Council permanent member states, support Yemeni unity and democracy. He indicated that many of these states stress that they cannot deal with a secessionist government, that they are not ready to deal with anything outside the framework of Yemeni unity, and that what is going on in the Yemeni arena is an internal affair that concerns the Yemeni people. Addressing deputies, Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah added: We have in hand very strong cards, represented by the fact that Yemeni unity has crowned the Yemeni people's longstanding struggle and was achieved peacefully and democratically. Afterward, the Republic of Yemen's Constitution was put to popular vote, winning full popular support throughout the Republic of Yemen. Afterward, general elections were held. Those elections, which are the source of constitutional legitimacy, have shown which party enjoys more popular support. The foreign minister asked the people's deputies to help Yemeni diplomacy in all that serves Yemeni interests and supports unity. The deputies expressed extreme appreciation for the Foreign Ministry's ability to deal with political issues and anything that will support Yemeni unity. Meanwhile, the House stressed that the secessionist elements' move of forming a secessionist government is null and void, deeming it a flagrant insistence by the secessionist clique on violating UN Security Council Resolution 924 and a glaring breach of the UN Security Council cease-fire resolution, which demanded a peaceful settlement within the framework of the Republic of Yemen. Earlier, the House listened to and approved the minutes of its previous session. The House will continue its work on Sunday to discuss a number of issues and topics on the agenda, including some financial and supply issues, and other issues that will be raised for discussion. The parliamentary committee following up the developments experienced by our country will complete within three days the tasks that the House has entrusted to it. It will submit a report to the House during the next session, which will be held Sunday morning, God willing.
