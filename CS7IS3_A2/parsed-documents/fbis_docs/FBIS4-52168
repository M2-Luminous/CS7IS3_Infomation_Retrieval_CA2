A Ministry spokesman says he hopes both sides would focus on their larger mutual interests and put this incident behind them. He said the United States and Singapore have always enjoyed the strong relationship based on many common interests and shared strategic objectives. The spokesman said it would be regrettable if the action of one individual who transgressed Singapore law and had been punished according to the law were allowed to affect bilateral relations. The spokesman was responding to a statement by the acting spokesman for the U.S. State Department, Christine Shell. The statement was issued after a meeting between Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord and Singapore Ambassador S.R. Nathan. The statement noted Mr. Lord said the incident would have to be taken into account in the overall relationship between the U.S. and Singapore.
