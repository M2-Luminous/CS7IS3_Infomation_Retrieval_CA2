Ye Zhen said: According to statistics, compared with February, when commodity prices rose dramatically, consumer prices in the nation's urban and rural areas declined by 1.5 and 0.1 percentage points, respectively; the prices of services declined by 0.3 percentage points, and the prices of capital goods declined by 5.1 percentage point in March, thus demonstrating that the momentum of commodity price increases has been alleviated. The preliminary results achieved in controlling commodity prices can be attributed primarily to the greater efforts exerted by the central government and local governments at all levels. As a result of the actions taken by local governments at various levels as well as the efforts made by the State Council in intensifying the control over investments in fixed assets as well as consumption needs, in promoting agricultural production, specially the "food basket" project; in supervising the prices of people's living necessities and services, and in conducting nationwide price inspection, preliminary results in controlling price increases were achieved within a short time. In analyzing the causes of the sharp commodity price increases early this year, Ye Zhen said that they were primarily caused by irrational phenomena -- such as the mentality of jumping on the bandwagon as well as unscrupulousness in raising prices -- following the introduction of the new tax system. Market prices rose quite rapidly especially after price controls for most commodities were removed and before mechanisms for effective macroeconomic regulation and control were established or improved. This phenomenon to which the masses responded strongly was particularly noticeable in the prices of basic necessities, such as food, clothing, services, and other items closely related to people's daily life. Although macroeconomic regulation and control over commodity prices have produced results, Ye Zhen stressed: Compared to the same period in 1992, the nation's retail prices during the first quarter still increased 20.1 percent. The extent of this increase is still way above the target set by the state. All quarters must therefore continue to exercise strict control over commodity prices and should not lower their guard in the least.
