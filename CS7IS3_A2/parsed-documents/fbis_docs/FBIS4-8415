Reception is poor. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st Corps Information Service reports on the situation in Sarajevo that "since the morning the chetniks have been firing with small arms at the defense lines and the city itself. From the region of Perivoj they fired cumulative [kumulativni] grenade launchers at Vis, Dobrinja was under small arms fire all morning, while a sniper from Azici wounded a member of our army. Grenade explosions could be heard today near the FAMOS factory in Hrasnica, grenades that were fired from the direction of Vojkovici. The same weapons were used from the temporarily occupied territory of Grbavica and another of our fighters was wounded on the defense line." Hajrudin Sermic reports on the situation in Maglaj that "the general alarm was sounded at about 1215 as the chetniks from the direction of Teslic fired six 155-mm howitzer shells at the town. The chetniks have over the last few days been intensifying their artillery and small arms fire, particularly at night, at the positions of the 201st Brigade. They have also been firing antiaircraft machine guns and snipers at the northern part of the town." In his report from Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that "Karadzic's terrorists have intensified their attacks on the defense positions on the Buzim part of the front and Buzim itself, including the surrounding villages of (Cava), (Mahmici), (?Strabanda) and others. The artillery attacks are also continuing on the free Bosanska Krupa territory. The outskirts of Bihac have also been shelled, while the defense positions on Grabez and the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau are under constant artillery fire and fire from antiaircraft weapons." He says that "on top of all this, the Kladusa rebel traitors have intensified their attacks on the free Bihac territory. They have been cooperating with Karadzic's fascists on the Buzim front, and this morning launched several major infantry and artillery attacks in the region of (Pecina) in the Cazin commune." Reporting from Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that "the Serbian aggressor is carrying out extensive preparations for the continuation of the chetnik offensive launched two days ago. The defense lines of the free Brcko territory are again being targeted today by enemy artillery. In attacks on our positions the aggressor is mostly using mortars and recoilless guns, while heavy fire with antiaircraft guns and machine guns is being directed at (Djukici) and (Kladje). On several occasions this morning the aggressor fired a 155-mm howitzer at residential areas inside the free territory." He says that "the enemy has not completed the grouping of his forces. The aggressor has brought in new artillery pieces along the front line." Mahmet Bulic reports from Lukavac that "yesterday's shelling of the defense lines seemed to have been only an introduction for today's fierce aggressor's attacks. Since early morning the Serbs have fired hundreds of mortar rounds and artillery and howitzer shells at the area. Karadzic's followers have also attempted several infantry breakthroughs but they have all failed, and the enemy has suffered great losses in manpower. And as always when the army of the so-called Srpska republic are frustrated on the front, they have turned their artillery at the civilian targets. Today they fired several howitzer shells at the town itself." The studio announcer says that "the general alarm has been in force in Travnik since midday as the chetniks from Mt. Vlasic have been firing with howitzers." The correspondent from the town, Ahmed Begicevic then reports that "at almost the same time they started to shell the defense lines in Turbe. This small town some six kilometers from Travnik is at the moment being shelled with howitzers from (Komare) and Mt. Vlasic. At the time of filing this report, and it is now just after 1300, artillery shells are pounding Travnik and the citizens are being warned to exercise maximum caution."
