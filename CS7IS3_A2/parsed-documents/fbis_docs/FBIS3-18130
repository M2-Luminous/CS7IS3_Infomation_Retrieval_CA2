That way they want to avoid a possible lack of political consensus following a change of government in Bonn, the BERLINER ZEITUNG (Monday edition) reports. According to the report, the industry will save the Defense Ministry quite a few million marks in interest if the latter pushes through the procurement of four new U 212-type submarines worth DM 2.8 billion before the election. The industry is prepared to bring forward the construction work on the four new submarines to 1995, the report says. According to a report from the naval arms working group, the project was "of such crucial importance" to the industry that the industry would be prepared to allow interest-free advance financing. In return the Defense Ministry is to yield to the industry's demand for "definite plans" that "the project will be dealt with in parliament before the Bundestag election on 16 October 1994."
