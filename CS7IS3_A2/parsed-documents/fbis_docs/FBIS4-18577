FBIS4-18577 "drweu067_p_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-067 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 GREECE Embargo, Participation in UN Force Discussed Embargo, Participation in UN Force Discussed 94P20618 94P20618 CSO [Editorial Report] The embargo Greece imposed on The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), a citizen's protest against it, as well as Athens' refusal to participate in a peacekeeping force that would include Turkish UN troops elicited commentaries from the Greek press. Embargo Protest Discussed An article in the 25 March Athens daily I KATHIMERINI by Athens University alternate professor of political communications Khristos Lirintzis discusses the public denunciation of the embargo on the FYROM by 21 Greek intellectuals, who asked that Greek foreign policy on this issue be reviewed. While one can disagree with the writers' message and its publication, writes Lirintzis, the initiative of three Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) deputies, who called the denunciation "treason" and demanded that the professors involved be barred from teaching, is "an unprecedented attempt to prohibit freedom of expression and foster alignment with official policy." Fortunately, the deputies' request had no resonance in the Chamber, and about 300 individuals have defended the "group of 21" and the Greeks' right to free opinion and dialogue. While most of the press did not publish the full text of the professors' denunciation and some newspapers' comments were "relatively low-key," others termed the "group of 21" and its supporters "a fifth column, Skopje agents, or antistate elements," an example of Greek "unfortunate" populist practice, according to which disagreement on important national issues turns the protester into an "enemy, a traitor, and an organ of foreign interests." By rejecting a dialogue, this practice abolishes discussion, depicting disagreement as a "black and white conflict in which the choice is between the good guys and the bad guys." Lirintzis concludes that things are usually more complex, and a society that tends to simplify political issues significantly restricts knowledge of self and the control of power. Mikhalis Moronis, writing in the 21 March Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA, contends that by following a purely nationalistic policy in the area, Greece, with its more robust economy, strong democratic institutions, and membership in the European Union (EU) and NATO, is forfeiting the opportunity to play an important role in the post-Cold War Balkans. However, the "golden opportunities of 1990 are turning into disastrous prospects in 1994." By-passing Greece, our allies and partners have created strong diplomatic conduits for regional intervention with our neighbors and the countries that emerged from the former Yugoslavia, he writes. Even the development of ties between the United States and Serbia is a possibility, as Belgrade openly wishes and Washington cannot afford to ignore, given that Serbia, the strongest state in the former Yugoslavia, holds a key position in the Balkans, Moronis continues. Finally, Greece's European card is losing its significance, since the development of ties between Greece's neighbors and the EU is occurring in our absence. Meanwhile, Athens continues to create the impression that we are still living at the beginning of the century with the Balkan wars, we are the area's "troublemakers" and our "nationalistic explosions are just a cover for the sense of insecurity that pervades us. Such `phobias' derive from the Greek practice of foisting responsibilities on others and refusing to assume our own by paying the price for our national and individual survival," Moronis comments. A brief article in the 29 March daily TA NEA contends that by asking that Athens give in to Skopje's demands about the name, symbols, and irredentist propaganda issues promoted by Skopje President Kiro Gligorov, Greece's EU "partners" prove they are "openly inimical" to us and fail to understand the problems they are creating. Additional proof lies in the fact that they are threatening to remand Greece to the European Court of Justice over the imposition of the embargo even while negotiations are continuing. With Germany in front, Greece's "partners are pushing for more confrontation as if their role in the collapse of Yugoslavia were not enough," the article contends. UN Peacekeeping Force According to Potis Paraskevopoulos writing in the 27 March Athens KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA, the UN Security Council decision to dispatch Turkish troops to Bosnia is "thoughtless" and will undermine peace in the wider Balkan area. It is also a studied move by certain interests to modify the region's geopolitical map and impose a new order, Paraskevopoulos contends. Turkish troops are unrelated to peacekeeping activities, since peace in Bosnia was imposed solely through NATO ultimatums and air power. This "positive development" should have been followed by an attempt to dissolve the Bosnian Serbs and Serbia's mistrust of international peacekeeping initiatives. Instead, the dispatch of Turkish troops to Bosnia compounds the Serbs' lack of confidence and constitutes a "provocation" against Serbia, Greece, and other Balkan countries, as well as against the UN, whose Security Council repeatedly condemned the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, Paraskevopoulos comments. Turkish troops will not be in the region to monitor peace between Bosnian Muslims and Croats, since the two sides have agreed on a federal state, or to enhance the Bosnian Muslims' sense of security, ensured through other UN blue helmets. Moreover, as Slavs, Serbian Muslims do not feel especially close to Turkey. Those who do are Albanians, and Kosovo and Skopje Albanians, Paraskevopoulos affirms. While Turkish UN troops are sent to the North, they will be used in the South, where their presence will encourage the separatist tendencies of Kosovo Albanians and the Albanians' expansionary views. Herein lies the threat against peace in the Balkans, Paraskevopoulos contends. The "troublemaking and provocative" role of a Turkish military presence in the former Yugoslavia masks a punitive plan for the territorial diminution of [President Slobodan] Milosevic's Serbia by using Kosovo as a target: Turkish UN troops are the "lance in the attack and the Skopje U.S. blue helmets are its shield." While this scenario may be considered a "figment of the imagination," the goal of the UN decision is unquestionably "crafty" and portends threats of war. The choice the Greek Government faces is clear, Paraskevopoulos comments. Athens must not send troops to the area and should not get involved in "war games," even if the principal actors are UN troops. Greece should play the role of "firefighter and arbiter" in support of a peace that obviates the expansion of military activities to southern Yugoslavia. Athens should not be swayed by the threat that Turkish troops in Bosnia upgrade Ankara's regional role, for the "damage is small compared to ensuring peace at all costs," Paraskevopouios concludes. A different view is expounded by Kostas Iordhanidhis in a 27 March I KATHIMERINI article. While it is clear that through a military presence Turkey will share in a settlement in the Balkans, from where it was expelled after the 1912-1913 wars, it is "naive" to expect that Greece can play a role in the area by watching local developments from the outside simply as a member of the EU, writes Iordhanidhis. It is "self-delusion" on the part of some Greek politicians to think that participation in the EU geographically moved the country to Central Europe and modified the nature of its problems. These are still related to major political instability on its northern borders and the fate of Hellenism in the Balkans, he continues. If Greece is to be the vector of the EU's Balkans policy, it will only do so through active intervention, as Ankara has consistently done. Iordhanidhis concludes that while a rejection of the Turkish offer of troops would have been preferable--as would have been a UN refusal to dismember Yugoslavia in 1991--and Greek participation in peacekeeping activities may entail human losses, Greece should nevertheless enter the fray, notably in view of the fact that this is requested by Serbia, with which Greece maintains strong ties of friendship, Iordhanidhis concludes.
