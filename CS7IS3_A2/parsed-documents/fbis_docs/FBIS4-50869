Chiang said Saturday [21 May] that Taiwan's indirect trade volume with Mainland China is helping to offset its trade deficit with Japan. Chiang made the remarks Saturday while speaking on challenges to Taiwan's economy at Chinese television system headquarters. The speech was sponsored by GLOBAL VIEWS MONTHLY. Chiang said that in 1993, Taiwan's indirect exports to Mainland China via Hong Kong reached U.S.$12 billion, almost offsetting its US$14.2 billion trade deficit with Japan. He said the mainland market has become increasingly important to Taiwan despite the fact that Beijing is trying to isolate Taiwan internationally, and added that cross-strait economic and trade activities would be complementary except for Beijing's policies. Chiang said that although Taiwan can be proud of its past economic achievements, it needs to focus on future development, which he said it can do by improving the environment for production technology. He said Taiwan is experiencing a great change in its economic development that can be seen in the drastic trade surplus decrease, the shift in export markets from Europe and America to Asia, and the remarkable increase in exports to developing countries. For example, he said, Taiwan had a trade surplus of U.S.$18.7 billion in 1987, U.S.$16 billion of that with the United States. By 1993, he said, the trade surplus had declined to U.S.$7.8 billion, of which U.S.$6.8 billion was with the United States. He estimated that this year's trade surplus will drop to U.S.$3 billion. Moreover, he noted, rising wages and labor costs, land-acquisition problems, the government's financial burden, and environmental protection disputes are making it hard for industries to survive. Chiang said Taiwan needs to upgrade technology and industrial levels, as well as produce goods of higher added value and actively seek to join international economic organizations in order to ensure its continued economic development.
