The huge rise is blamed on further declining production and continued changes affecting the business world. In an economic report released recently, the government also said that the number of people entitled to unemployment benefits this year will reach three million, up dramatically from last year's figure of less than 50,000. The report said that the government's major task this year is to stick to relatively tough financial and monetary policies so as to lower the budget deficit and reduce the inflation rate to between five and seven percent by the end of 1994. In 1993, the budget deficit consumed about seven percent of Russia's general domestic product (GDP), which fell by 12 percent from the 1992 level due to continued economic recession. Employees are expected to be paid three times more than last year's level in terms of face value of their wages, with average monthly income hitting 240,000 rubles (about 200 U.S. dollars according to the current exchange rate). Meanwhile, commodity wholesale prices will rise by 2.6 times, the report forecast. Reviewing last year's economic situation, the report commented that reform efforts toward establishing a market economy had led to an increase in the private sector, which utilized about 40 percent of the country's labor force. It said as much as 70 percent of Russia's commercial businesses, food industry and service trade had been privatized by the end of 1993. And the service trade alone produced 42 percent of last year's GDP, representing a nine percent increase from that in 1992, it added. According to the report, about 2,000 commercial banks were set up during 1993, while a unified grain market also came into shape.
