Prime Minister, I would like to ask two questions. The first concerns the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks which failed to hammer out an accord. I feel moves will increase in the United States to take retaliatory action against Japan. How will the Japanese Government respond to those moves? Prime Minister, you said that awhile ago you had breakfast with the President. Would you give the details of what you and the President talked about during breakfast? [Hosokawa] I would like to answer your first question. As for U.S. sanctions against Japan, I believe and strongly hope that the United States will not take unilateral steps that run counter to the rules of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade [GATT]. As I said awhile ago, I intend to make energetic efforts to promote negotiations in areas in which the two countries failed to reach an agreement following a period of cooling off. This morning, I had breakfast with the President. As I said awhile ago, the President and myself talked about the Cuban and Latin American situations as well as issues in the Asia-Pacific region. The President and myself spent much of time looking around the White House. The President showed me a room where President Lincoln signed documents as well as other historical rooms. [Tanabe] I am Tanabe from KYODO NEWS AGENCY. Prime Minister, I would like to ask you two questions. My first concerns the Japan- U.S. economic framework talks that ended yesterday. The Clinton administration has persistently asked Japan to establish numerical targets. Prime Minister, do you think the Clinton administration's trade policy is tilting toward managed trade? During the past six months of negotiations, the United States has criticized the Japanese bureaucracy. Prime Minister, do you think the U.S. criticism is accurate? [Hosokawa] I would like to answer your first question. As I said awhile ago, there has been substantial progress in negotiations on procedures for individual areas. However, the two countries failed to bridge their differences on the relationship between objective criteria and numerical targets, although they exchanged their views and asserted their respective positions. The issue of objective criteria is one aspect of the economic framework talks. My understanding is that it will not have a harmful impact on overall Japan-U.S. relations. I repeatedly told the President I cannot accept numerical targets which could lead to managed trade. Japanese negotiators have repeatedly asserted Japan cannot accept numerical targets. The objective criteria which the United States has proposed has been interpreted in various ways. I told the President that objective criteria and numerical targets are one in the same. During the talks, I also told the President they are incompatible with the thinking of the Hosokawa government, which is promoting deregulation as its primary policy. I told the President that for this reason I cannot agree with them. As for your question about U.S. criticism against Japanese bureaucrats, it is very hard for me to answer. Foreign nations are liable to adopt such views. Although this question is related to the first, officials in various ministries and agencies have repeatedly maintained in the negotiations that the government could not commit itself to resolving issues which are out of the government's jurisdiction through measures like managed trade. However, I think foreign nations may see Japan as Japan Incorporated, and may have a certain prejudice against Japan. During the current negotiations, I made some decisions transcending the jurisdictions of various ministries and agencies after having studied what sort of measures are desirable for the national interests of Japan and the survival of Japan within the international community. [Domoto] I am Domoto from NHK. I would like to ask about domestic affairs. You will have to tackle the Diet session shortly after you return to Japan. What will be your most important domestic agenda for the time being? Do you intend to manage politics without reshuffling your cabinet, at least until the ordinary Diet session ends? I would like you to answer these two questions. [Hosokawa] Needless to say, the most important issue in domestic politics is to pass the draft budget as soon as possible. I intend to do the utmost to tackle this issue. This is the most important task for me for the time being. Moreover, other important bills -- such as the Product Liability Bill -- have been submitted to the current Diet session for consideration. In view of the present economic situation, the most urgent task is to have the draft budget pass the Diet as soon as possible. As for reshuffling the cabinet, I am not thinking of it at this moment because until now I have devoted myself to the Japan-U.S. summit talks, tax system reform, political reform, and other issues. [Jim] Prime Minister, I am Jim from the LOS ANGELES TIMES. During your current visit to Washington, you stated the Japanese Government would cooperate in imposing economic sanctions against the DPRK over its suspected development of nuclear weapons under the scope of Japanese law. Do you mean Japan is considering economic sanctions? Could you tell us specifically about what Japan is preparing to do? I think whether Japan will stop remittances to North Korea is an issue. [Hosokawa] From a viewpoint of settling the issue through continuous discussions, Japan will continue to work with the United States, the Republic of Korea, and China. If the international community or the United Nations decides to take measures against North Korea, then it is natural for Japan to take responsible action. I cannot predict what sort of results the talks between the IAEA and North Korea, which are to be held at the end of February, will yield. As I said awhile ago, if sanctions are imposed against North Korea, Japan will take measures based on its responsibility under the scope of its laws. A question was asked on the issue of remitting money to North Korea. We do not know exactly how much they are sending to North Korea. The human rights issue is also involved in this. Therefore, we have to take these points into consideration. [Doya] I am Ayako Doya from THE JAPAN TIMES. Some U.S. Government officials, including U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, are of the opinion that sanctions should be imposed against Japan should Japan refuse to accept numerical targets. Others are saying we should not let the issue of numerical targets damage Japan-U.S. relations. Roughly speaking, they are divided into two groups. However, the President is the one who is going to decide on this matter. You have spent many hours in discussions with the President. Which side is the President leaning towards, and how much of your explanations did the President understand? [Hosokawa] As I said earlier, I think Japan-U.S. relations have entered a new era. In the past, both countries mutually refrained from saying things which were really difficult to say. By surmounting each situation, they cleared hurdles one by one. As a result, Japan gave answers which could be interpreted in different manners. Japan eventually viewed U.S. attempts as outside pressure [gaiatsu]; through outside pressure, the United States tried to get a compromise from Japan. I have a feeling both countries have such an impression of each other. The United States, Canada, and Europe candidly talk about matters which are difficult to discuss. Earlier I called it mature relations. I am of the opinion that Japan-U.S. relations should also be that way. In this sense, I think my recent visit was a very good one. You asked what President Clinton thinks of sanctions. I feel he thinks the same way. As I earlier said, I do not think sanctions will be immediately imposed against Japan. [Unidentified correspondent] I have two questions. The first is this. You have said that for awhile both countries will have a period of cooling off. I understand reviews will be made twice a year. Do you have a plan to visit the United States before six months have passed to meet President Clinton again? Another question is about the comprehensive economic measures you recently announced. It seems the measures are ill spoken of by some U.S. Government officials. Can you comment on this? [Hosokawa] As for the economic stimulus package, as you said the United States did not favorably evaluate it. However, when we look at the tax cuts specified in the package, the amount of the reductions is considerably larger than those which Japan carried out when former President Reagan was in office. Moreover, my cabinet has laid out plans for promoting discussions by the end of this year on drastic tax reform measures. I asked the President to understand this. I also stressed that major economic stimulus measures amounting to over 15 trillion yen will certainly have a favorable effect on our efforts to establish and promote a domestic demand-oriented economy. What was your first question? [Correspondent] The next visit to the United States at an earlier date. [Hosokawa] So far I am not thinking about paying a visit to the United States at an earlier date. But I want to discuss the scheduling of the next visit with the secretariat, although I have no idea how long a cooling off period we need. [Komori] I am Komori with SANKEI SHIMBUN. You have stressed several times that Japan-U.S. relations have entered the stage of mature relations, like relations between the United States and European nations. Taking a look at relations between the United States and European nations, I find that although they exchange sharp debates on economic issues, their relations are solid because they share a very similar basic sense of values on such matters as security, diplomacy, democracy, and human rights. So they base their disputes over economic affairs on their solid relations. In the case of relations between Japan and the United States, I wonder if Japan and the United States share a similar sense of values, particularly on security. Do you still have confidence in maintaining basic bilateral relations while the two countries are engaged in heated disputes over economic issues? [Hosokawa] I think we have to let our relations enter such an era. Moreover, I feel such an atmosphere is being steadily created through a series of talks between myself and President Clinton -- including the summit talks yesterday as well as the previous summit talks -- as well as ministerial and working-level talks. [Unidentified correspondent] I am with AP. As regards objective criteria, the U.S. Government has said it will not resume negotiations until Japan changes its position. In a meeting held in the morning, Japan said it will not change its position, thus showing a tough stance. If both sides establish a cooling off period, is there any possibility Japan would propose some kind of compromise, or do you think a compromise should be proposed by the United States? [Hosokawa] On the issues of government procurement or insurance, for example, Japan and the United States are moving closer to each other, and an agreement is within their reach. The problem is objective criteria, and it runs counter to the principle of our negotiations. Japan holds its basic stand that one way or another it is necessary to avoid objective criteria that goes against our efforts in promoting deregulations and leads to managed trade. Japan will not change its position in this regard. However, as I said earlier, since finishing touches on negotiations on some individual trade sectors are being put into place, I would like to find a clue to break the deadlock after a cooling off period. This is what I feel now. [At this point NHK concludes its live relay of the Hosokawa news conference]
