According to its president, Jacques de Larosiere, the meeting was successful and its outcome positive. One person I spoke with in the Tavricheskiy Palace was Boris Nemtsov, governor of Nizhniy Novgorod, where an EBRD pilot project to assist in the creation of small and medium-size businesses has been up and running for a long time. "What the European Bank is aiming at above all," B. Nemtsov said, "is small production outfits and the services sphere, not trade in its present mass resale form. EBRD repesentatives carry out a most meticulous study of the partner, right down to his moral character and habits, before providing credit." You could say that the EBRD's policy is not only tough (in terms of partner selection), but also one of high principles and integrity. The bank's own reputation is extremely important to it and, as we know, it is based on the results of what it does. When the EBRD okays participation in a project it means that it adds its own 35 percent to the one-fourth of the funds put up by the particular enterprise. The very fact that it is involved in the particular business then changes things radically: The quest for a third partner to make up the difference is no longer a problem when the EBRD is operating in tandem. That, briefly, is the way the bank operates in Russia, and this mechanism really is working, although the volume of financing is not so great at the moment compared with the scale of activity in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast. The experimental projects that are under way in Nizhniy Novgorod and Tula will soon spread to Tomsk, Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin confirmed in his speech in the Tavricheskiy Palace. The Russian emphasis in the EBRD's activities markedly strengthened when Jacques de Larosiere became president, many financial experts acknowledge. The new bank chief has already managed to do a great deal to restore the EBRD's reputation and confidence in it, following the scandal resulting from overexpenditure on its own needs under his predecessor. [Portanskiy ends] At the very same time (16-19 April) as the bank forum organized by the EBRD was taking plce with great pomp and ceremony in the Tavricheskiy Palace, on the other side of the road, in the famous Kikin Apartments, another international conference was in progress. The conference, organized by the European Investment Journal and the "Dixon" company, also attracted the attention of banking and business circles. The idea of the "Dixon" firm's conference was simultaneously to present a number of St. Petersburg projects that had been selected for Western businessmen to look at and possibly invest in. The conpany's experts had carefully studied and analyzed more than 300 promising projects and finally selected around 20 for this review. They inluded projects by the "Impuls," "Pozitron," and "Balt Elektro" science and production associations and a number of others. The techniques and methods of assessment used by the "Dixon" firm differ from the EBRD's expert evaluations. The EBRD goes for large-scale projects, whereas the "Dixon" company's experts believe that, given the political and economic instability in Russia, Western businessmen are unlikely to put their capital at risk, therefore it is more realistic to expect them to participate in small but well planned and well costed projects. Although Company President Mark Dixon criticized the EBRD and believes that its current leadership needs to overcome bureaucratic tendencies in its work and make more flexible use of the bank's potential for active involvement in the Russian market, he is prepared to participate in some EBRD projects. Having studied the current situation, the "Dixon" company's experts arrived at the conclusion that around 10,000 Russian enterprises can lay claim to real investment support on the part of the West. At the same time, every year only around 500 out of approximately 50,000 promising projects find investors, so Western companies and firms need to step up their activities in this sphere, Mark Dixon stressed. At the final press conference on the results of the meeting the "Dixon" company president announced that St. Petersburg City Hall officials had done their level best to prevent the conference from being held in the Kikin Apartments and even tried to wreck it. This is intolerable, Mark Dixon believes, in a civilized democratic society in which people should be free to express different views and opinions.
