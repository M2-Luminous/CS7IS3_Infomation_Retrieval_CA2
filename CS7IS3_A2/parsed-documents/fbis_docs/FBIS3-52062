The agreement, signed this week, is part of arrangements with Paris Club member countries allowing Jamaica to receive support for its economic reform programme through debt-resheduling arrangements. Under the agreement signed by Finance Minister Omar Davies and Japan's Charge d'Affaires in Kingston, Hiroshi Funakoshi, repayments of the debt will begin in September, 2000 and should be in 18 installments at an interest rate of 8.2 per cent annually. Up to October last year, Jamaica owed Japan just over 350 million US dollars. Jamaica's external debt currently stands at 3.64 billion US dollars.
