At the outset of a special interview he gave to Qol Yisra'el, I said to him: I heard that you would like to transfer Israel elsewhere. He replied: I said Israel was put in a region where there are over 100 million Arabs, and there has always been a war between Israel and the Arabs. Had an island been chosen for Israel, such as Madagascar, Cyprus, Malta, or some other island where there are no neighbors and where there would be 10, 20, or 30 million Jews, there would have been no problems and the whole matter would have been over. You have been at war with the Arabs for over 40 years, however, and this war will continue. You signed a peace, but the war has continued and there are casualties every day. I asked: Do you recognize Israel's right to exist? The State of Israel must exist, Zhirinovskiy replied soothingly, but Russia and the United States should work together to finalize Israel's borders. We have influence with Syria and Iraq, while the United States has influence with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. We should reach a definitive agreement about Israel's final borders and never change them again. War and extremism would then be over. Everything possible must be done so that life is calm for a long time, forever. Should the Jews of Russia emigrate to Israel? Zhirinovskiy replied: If Russian Jews want to go to Israel, let them. After all, the communists barred them from doing so for a long time and even threw them in jail. If they want to stay, however, they are most welcome, seeing that the Jews have always been highly educated people who can contribute a great deal to their country of residence. Are there any Jews in the Liberal Democratic Party? An incredulous Zhirinovskiy repeated after me: Are there any Jews in our party? Then he regained his composure and answered: There may be one, two, or three of them. I do not know their exact number, because when people join our party we do not ask them to disclose their nationality. There has been talk that you are of Jewish origin, that your father was a Jew, I said to him. It is all propaganda, Zhirinovskiy exclaimed. People say my father was Jewish, that I am an anti- Semite, a Zionist, an extremist, a fascist, a communist, and that Saddam Husayn gave me money. The latest tale about me is that the communists in East Germany gave me 80 million German marks, but what I said was: Give me 8 marks. These are outright lies. So, you are not dangerous, I said. No, I am not dangerous, Zhirinovskiy answered. The magazine BILD carried photographs of a young girl and reported that Zhirinovskiy had a sexual liaison with her when he was in Austria. He said: Where is that woman? I would gladly meet her, but where is she? It is sheer propaganda, as always. If you are invited to Israel for a visit, will you come? Yes, we will come, Zhirinovskiy replied resolutely. I guess we had better start getting ready.
