A Toast in Solitude"] [Text] It would seem that the new year will be toasted in solitude in Tatarstan this year, without Russia. There have been neither elections to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation nor a referendum on the Constitution. If elections had been conducted successfully it would have meant the destruction of the three years of work of the local leaders, the essence of which amounts, strictly speaking, not so much to separating Tatarstan from the Federation as to removing the authorities of Tatarstan from the jurisdiction of the Russian authorities. All the power has actually been concentrated in the hands of a single person--the local president, Mintimer Shaymiyev. He is the one who appoints the chiefs of rayon and city administrations; through the presidium he has taken charge of the republic's Supreme Soviet; last year he pushed his draft of the Constitution through, reinforcing his executive authority; he gave his edicts as much force as legislative acts in the sphere of "power management" (the Law of Tatarstan on Emergency Measures in Fighting Crime), and so forth. Day and night the entire propaganda machine has been working to make sure that sovereignty is firmly associated in the everyday awareness with low prices of products and stability of interethnic relations. And right at that moment the mother country starts "poking its nose" into Tatarstan with its constitutional reforms. Its initiative evoked a statement from M. Shaymiyev to the effect that he himself personally would not go to the elections and that anyone who values republic sovereignty would probably follow his example. Half the work was done: At least the rural areas could boldly exclude voters from the lists. Two districts were excluded from the voting ahead of time with the help of games played by the apparatus. These included not informing the citizens (eight out of 10 people in Kazan received neither written nor verbal notification and many customary precincts changed their locations), an information blockade of the press and even the candidates concerning preparations for the 12 December elections, and "undercounting" on voter lists (they were practically not verified and as a result entire buildings "turned up missing," while minors and even deceased citizens ended up on the voter lists). The administration chiefs conducted special "training sessions" with chairmen of electoral commissions, whose nature need not be especially discussed in light of the position of the authorities. Even such "trifles" as flying state flags at the precincts were not observed. For example, in Sovetskiy Rayon of Kazan there was not a single flag of the Russian Federation; only flags of Tatarstan were flown, as if actions of the "neighboring state" had nothing to do with them.... And what is not trivial is the powerful one-sided conditioning of the population by the local mass media. But what else can one expect when 90 percent of them are under government jurisdiction? The "war" of the leaflets had a dual character. Only "imported" posters, that is, brought in from Russia, were in favor of the elections and referendums; against them were leaflets of clearly local but unspecified origin, which were signed, true, in an extremely attractive way--"Movement for Justice," "Committee of Soldiers' Mothers," "Council of Veterans" (veterans of what--was not specified), the "Free Rus" (?) group, and so forth. It is noteworthy that the output of these still unknown authors was 10 times greater than that of the Russian opponents. Thus the newspaper of the National Radical Committee, SUVERENITET, unexpectedly and completely free of charge ended up in a half million mailboxes. The nature of the local epistles seemed extremely diverse at first glance--from Jesuitical: "through your failure to participate in the elections you are peacefully resisting the adventurers who are fleecing you and your children" and "through the boycott we have confirmed our confidence in the public policy of the leadership of Tatarstan" to slogans that are clearly stretching acceptable limits: "participation in the elections means betrayal of the state interests of your homeland--Tatarstan!" But while establishing the differences one cannot but note a direction that was common to all--all of them called not simply for voting against the draft Constitution or a specific candidate, but for generally ignoring the elections themselves. This position played exclusively into the hands of the republic leadership, who can now work with the thesis: "The population of Tatarstan does not need a federal Constitution and, consequently, it needs [as published] representation in Russian elective organs." And this fits extremely well into the context of their idea of building a Federation "from bottom to top," whereby all that is left for the center to do is pick up the crumbs of the authorities delegated by Tatarstan which it charitably allots from its republic table. The results of the voting in this area have come out right four times. Will this happen a fifth time as well? But the question is left hanging in the air because of the unexpected success of Mr. Zhirinovskiy and his by no means liberal and not at all democratic ideas. The absence of the majority of the reasonable population at the ballot boxes created the vacuum whereby the activity of proponents of a firm hand grew into a critical mass. Sovereignization in the version of the local authorities evoked rhetoric like "unified and indivisible" even in the astonishing version of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. As for the politically inert population of the republic, they got what they deserve--a double defeat in civil rights. First, there are practically no deputies from Tatarstan in the federal parliament. Second--and this is the main thing--the authorities have now cast doubts on the legitimacy of the newly adopted Constitution of Russia. Although in the local basic law dual citizenship--of Russia and Tatarstan--is unequivocally guaranteed. But with the system of relations between the state and the individual that exists in Tatarstan today, the guarantees for citizens of the Russian state seem more and more questionable from these positions than they did before the December date. As one of the local readers noted bitterly: "You did not care? Do not complain now...." [begin box, page 3] When conditioning enterprise leaders they did not shrink from direct threats regarding the positions they held. The victory of the LDPR was even very predictable because of the position of that same Mr. Shaymiyev, who actually excluded the entire republic from the political struggle. [end box]
