A Defense Ministry spokesman said in Bonn on Thursday [26 May] that a German-Russian staff exercise is scheduled to be held in Russia next year. There will be no combat units involved, just military staff units. German and Russian warships will meet for a joint exercise in the Baltic Sea before the end of this year. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe plans to hold a joint exercise of Bundeswehr units and the Russian Army on German soil in 1996. The legal framework to enable this still has to be created, the spokesman said. There are presently no laws regulating maneuvers of eastern troops in Germany. Details on exercises of NATO partners are laid down in the annex to the NATO troops charter. According to the Defense Ministry, an exercise of German, Polish, and Danish engineering troops will be held in Denmark this October under the code name "Carbon Gap." Prior to that, in September, the German Navy will conduct exercises together with Polish and Danish ships in Mecklenburg Bay. In 1995, an exercise involving Hungarian, German, and British units is to take place in Hungary. Polish, Danish, and German military units will be conducting an exercise in Poland next year. Once the necessary legal framework has been created, Danish, Polish, and German troops will hold maneuvers in Germany in 1996. All exercises held together with Poland and Hungary will be conducted within NATO's Partnership for Peace program.
