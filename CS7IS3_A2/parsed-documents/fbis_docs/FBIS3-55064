Ubaidullayev said four suspects of a murder of nine people in the village of Novobad near Dushanbe late at night on December 30 were arrested yesterday. He added that the suspects did not conceal that they had committed the crime with the aim of robbery. Ubaidullayev also said that the motive for the murder of Father Sergy, a priest of the Russian Orthodox Church in Dushanbe on the same night, still remained unclear. The investigating bodies were working on a number of likely versions, the high official said. The Tajik Interior Ministry announced a considerable financial reward for information helping to solve the case. On behalf of the republican government, Ubaidullayev expressed condolences to the family and friends of the murdered.
