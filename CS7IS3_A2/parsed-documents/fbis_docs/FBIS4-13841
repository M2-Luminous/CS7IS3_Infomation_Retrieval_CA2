[passage omitted]. We are coming through days, which are the turning points of history. Once upon a time there was an international community in the world. Then World War I started. After World War II the major powers, which had faced the scourge of war, set up the United Nations and the Security Council. They told the world that the objective was to respect borders and to stop one [country] violating another. How far have the United Nations and the Security Council come today? What has happened? What are human societies witnessing today? The Security Council, which used to say it wanted to maintain world security, and the United Nations, which used to say it wished to safeguard the rights of all mankind, have become supporters of arrogant powers and a witness and observer in the arena, where the innocent and defenseless people are rolled into dust and blood. This is their fate today. It is lying that it cannot do much. This is a lie and all members of mankind should understand that it is lying. It is even withdrawing its forces from Bosnia and such zones as Gorazde. It says it cannot do anything. It is pleading that it is incapable. Whereas when it faced the Iraq-Kuwait problem, it promptly condemned [Iraq] and called on everyone to go to war. It asked for troops and money. On the other hand we saw when a gang of criminal Serbs attacked this city, it took the Security Council three months to condemn the attack. The United Nations issued a feeble resolution on the issue. And now whatever they say is nothing but slogans. The only side telling the truth under this blue sky is Iran -- the Islamic Republic of Iran. This fact is being proven across the world. We -- that is the Iranian nation -- realized after the revolution that many things are false, including the United Nations and the Security Council. But there were many who believed that those are true and correct. But what occurred in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Palestine and -- these days -- in the oppressed town of Gorazde, was the coup de grace delivered to the hope of all the hopeful people. It delivered the coup de grace to all those who hoped -- though we were not among them. They realized that the United Nations is a lie. What sort of accounting is that? To gather Muslims in a mosque and then set fire to the mosque! To rip open the stomach of pregnant women just because they are carrying a Muslim child! To make a bet on whether the fetus is a girl or a boy and then laugh their heads off over the bet! What atrocities they perpetrate! The Russian president, Mr. Yeltsin, tells the Serbs to be careful so that world sentiments are not moved against them! Now, what do they do themselves? What assistance they give! What green light does the East and West give them! I say in all truth and earnestness, with what is going on now -- the crimes that are being committed -- the nations watch. We do not watch. The beloved leader of the revolution, may God grant him victory, with his precise political stances -- beside his enthusiasm for science and religious jurisprudence, his piety and truly befitting aspects -- has announced that the armed forces must be prepared. The Islamic Republic of Iran has not denied [the Bosnian Muslims] anything and will not deny them anything. But those who perpetrate crimes and those who watch those crimes will all be punished. One can see that coming. [passage omitted] We are living under conditions where a great many crimes are being committed against humanity. And that is the way the United Nations acts! Muslims must think about forming an organization, a united nations, a united nations that protects weak countries. Not just Muslims -- all countries should free themselves of those who do as they please using their power of veto with America in their forefront. They commit so many crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Gorazde, Palestine on the other hand, and also in other parts. [passage omitted]
