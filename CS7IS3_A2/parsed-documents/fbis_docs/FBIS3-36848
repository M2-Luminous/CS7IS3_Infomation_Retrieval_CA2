On the contrary, the geography and common economic problems point to the need for a consolidation of efforts in the interests of the whole of Maritime Kray. The most urgent task is to shake up the mining and fur industries in these regions by spring, to protect the environment, and prevent natural resources being exported. The organization will be a kind of economic mini-community within Maritime Kray, which is a Russian Federation subject, and it will not have any political goals.
