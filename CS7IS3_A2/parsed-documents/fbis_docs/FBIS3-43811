About 175 representatives of General Aidid's Habr Gedir clan and the Abgal of Ali Mahdi are taking part in the talks. They have been convened and chaired by a respected Islamic leader, the Imam of Hirab. But the talks are being funded by the United Nations. The world body has opted for a lower-profile, "catalytic" role in brokering the restoration of civilian authority in the increasingly lawless Somali capital since talks among the main warlords collapsed without agreement in Addis Ababa last month, senior UN officials said. "We welcome the talks. They are being held among clan elders and we will not interfere," said a senior official of Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA), Issa Mohamed Siad. "They are non- political," said Issa, who denied reports that a senior SNA official, Abdi Qaydid, was attending. Independent Somali observers said no talks could achieve a lasting settlement without the participation of the warlords themselves. UN officials, however, expressed optimism about the inter-clan talks in Mogadishu. "Pressure is building from the rank- and-file to stop fighting," said one official. "The foot soldiers are tired."

The brother of SNA secretary-general Abdulkarim Ahmed Ali was shot dead by bandits who stole his car on Thursday, SNA officials said. The sandy, potholed roads leading out of Mogadishu, choked with donkey carts and overloaded, antiquated trucks, are again infested with armed bandits to an extent not seen since before the multinational military intervention began 13 months ago, UN officials and Somali residents said. "We've reduced our presence on the streets and people are paying the price in terms of banditry, but it's time for Somalis to understand that the international community only has limited patience and limited resources for Somalia," one senior UN official said. On Thursday about two dozen Somalis with gunshot, shrapnel and knive wounds streamed into UN hospitals in Mogadishu, but the cause of the violence in which they were hurt remained mysterious. Food prices have risen ahead of the Moslem fast Ramadan, and the value of the Somali shilling has fallen 10 percent against the dollar, making foreign products more expensive. "As the Western forces pull out, merchants have stopped bringing in commodities," said a Somali businessman, Mohamed Sheikh, who imports domestic goods from Kenya on dhows, the traditional Arab boats that ply the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. "Everyone fears insecurity," said Mohamed, 50. Aidid remained in Nairobi on Saturday, where he has met other factional leaders and US envoy Richard Bogosian, a US official said. The outcome of his contacts with representatives of the Group of 12 factions led by Ali Mahdi that oppose him seemed uncertain. Meanwhile five US congressmen were expected here later Saturday for a brief fact-finding tour. Leading the delegation is Representative John Murtha, chairman of the House Defence Appropriations Committee, a Democrat from Pennsylvania. [passage omitted]
