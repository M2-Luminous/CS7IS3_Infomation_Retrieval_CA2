This is the location of the Trade and Economic Department of the Embassy of the Republic of Poland in Ukraine. It is headed by Commercial Attache Michal Uzemblo. Our BIZNES correspondent met with Mr. Uzemblo and asked him to describe the state and prospects of the development of Polish-Ukrainian trade and economic relations. [Kvitko] Mr. Uzemblo, it is far from your first year in Ukraine, and you are well acquainted with our economic situation. Tell us, please, are there practicable prerequisites for an increase in mutually profitable cooperation between our countries? [Uzemblo] Ukraine has been an independent state only for three years. It is natural, therefore, that you have had this whole time to surmount the well-known difficulties of the formation of statehood. In addition, Ukraine inherited from the former USSR quite a complex and unregulated economy, and the economic relations that had operated for years both with countries of the former USSR and with the participants in the disintegrated Council for Economic Mutual Assistance (CEMA), one of the biggest partners among which was Poland, were disrupted. The command levers of the control of cooperation, which had frequently flouted considerations of elementary advantage, ceased to operate, and commodity turnover between our countries declined. Account also has to be taken of the fact that by the time Ukraine had acquired its sovereignty, Poland had already implemented a number of economic reforms en route to the market. This meant that trading as before was no longer possible. You yourself will realize that perfectly understandable considerations of advantage, without which a real market is inconceivable, came into play. The decline in commodity turnover was perfectly natural, therefore. A payments crisis, when Ukrainian enterprises were unable to pay for supplies from Poland in hard currency and your national currency rapidly declined in value, was superimposed in addition. The situation was rescued neither by commodity-exchange transactions nor so-called barter.... Nonetheless, I would like to mention that at the interstate level Poland was one of the first to sign with Ukraine, in May 1992, a treaty on good-neighborliness, friendly relations, and cooperation, which laid the legal foundations for a qualitatively new system of relations between our states within the framework of the process of transformations in Central and East Europe. Today economic relations between Ukraine and Poland are regulated, aside from the said treaty, by: 1) the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation of 4 October 1991. 2) The Convention on the Avoidance of Dual Taxation and the Prevention of Income and Property Tax Evasion of 12 January 1993. 3) The Agreement on the Mutual Promotion and Protection of Investments of 12 January 1993. 4) The Agreement on Interregional Cooperation. An Intergovernmental Commission on Trade and Economic Cooperation, whose activity is contributing to the further development of bilateral economic relations, was formed on the basis of the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation and the protocol of 12 January 1993. [Kvitko] And how productive has the commission's contribution to bilateral cooperation been? [Uzemblo] You know that we do not have the right to dictate to our entrepreneurs with whom they should conclude deals. But at the government level the parties have agreed for the establishment of efficient mutually profitable cooperation to promote a resumption of relations between enterprises and to support their development at small and medium-sized business level, to contribute to the creation of joint ventures, and to establish a system of mutual notification of the parties of legislative instruments in force in their countries that regulate financial, legal, customs, and economic matters. The commission has been quite productive, I believe. According to Polish customs data, commodity turnover increased from $337 million in 1992 to $386.8 million in 1993. In addition, the practice of joint entrepreneurial activity is characterized by the fact that Poland is in first place in terms of the number of joint ventures on the territory of Ukraine. Their number has risen to 580. The exports of these ventures constitute $22,980,900, and imports, $18,092,100. According to figures of the Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine, Polish-Ukrainian joint ventures constitute 17.8 percent of the total number of those operating in the country. [Kvitko] Nonetheless, use is, most likely, being made of far from all possibilities for the development and expansion of cooperation. And the reason is by no means a lack of interest in Ukraine among our Polish partners. What can you say in this connection? [Uzemblo] Polish business has a tremendous interest in Ukraine. Proof of this is not only the first place in terms of the number of joint ventures but also the fact that approximately 50 of our firms have opened and registered their offices in Ukraine. In addition, Polish entrepreneurs are readily participating in many exhibitions which are being held in Ukraine and actively inviting their Ukrainian partners to exhibitions and fairs in Poland.... But the fact that there has yet to be in Ukraine the total liberalization of foreign economic activity, economic and financial stabilization has not been achieved, and your national unit of currency has not become even internally convertible is a reality also. Given the least signs of stabilization in Ukraine, the Polish entrepreneur would respond appropriately. And our Ukrainian partners are well enough aware of our possibilities. This includes agricultural production and also machinery and equipment for food and light industry, wood processing and furniture production, medical equipment, the manufacture of medicines and veterinary preparations, and much else. What I have listed, I believe, is merely a small particle of the possible interaction of our enterprises and entrepreneurs....
