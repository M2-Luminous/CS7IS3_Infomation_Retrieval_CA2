During his meeting with Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, Wasmosy acknowledged the situation but at the same time lashed out at peasant leaders, stating that they spend their time blocking roads but do not plant a single square meter of cotton. Watson also asked the Paraguayan Government to explain why U.S. troops and materiel were not allowed to enter Paraguay. The U.S. Government is closely following recent problems with Paraguayan peasants. These problems are a source of some concern, given the social outbursts that have taken place in Latin America, namely in Santiago del Estero Province in Argentina, in Chiapas Province in Mexico, and in some Central American nations to a lesser degree. Assistant Secretary Watson clarified certain controversial items that had caused some tension in Paraguayan-U.S. relations, asked President Wasmosy for caution and prudence in dealing with the demands of Paraguayan peasants, and advocated dialogue and consensus between the parties involved. Wasmosy admitted that the high-ranking U.S. official had indicated that the peasant problem should be handled very carefully, and reported that he explained to Watson that the people blocking roads were not exactly peasants. "I told him that the people who are blocking the roads are leaders who have not planted any cotton themselves. There are, however, some peasants who -- because of low productivity -- will not be able to recover from three years of bad crops, even if the price of cotton hits 850 guaranies per kilogram," Wasmosy said. Wasmosy also reiterated his pet argument that in the framework of a free market economy it was not up to the government to set the price of cotton. Asked about the U.S. reaction to the conditions that the Paraguayan Government had set to admit U.S. troops, Wasmosy answered that the doors are open to any joint exercise with the Paraguayan Army and civilians, "provided it does not violate any constitutional principles. I believe that we made this very clear and he (Watson) was very satisfied," Wasmosy added. President Wasmosy stated that the U.S. State Department official wanted to know firsthand the official report on the aborted military operation that the United States had asked to be allowed to conduct in the area of San Pedro. It would seem that Watson listened to this report carefully, as it may have a bearing on any further U.S. military assistance to Paraguay. Watson also reiterated that the U.S. Government is still concerned over the evidence it has that Paraguay continues to be a key link in regional drug trafficking. "I told him that we need help, training, and resources, to fight drug trafficking," Wasmosy said. He emphasized that Washington's envoy heard out the concerns of the Paraguayan Government and will relay them to the appropriate U.S. drug enforcement officials. Together with the other chiefs of state who have arrived in Santiago, Wasmosy went to Valparaiso at noon on 11 February to attended President Eduardo Frei Ruiz Tagle's installation. President Wasmosy will return at approximately 1500 local time today together with OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente Baena Soares. There is no official information on the agenda of Baena Soares in Paraguay.
