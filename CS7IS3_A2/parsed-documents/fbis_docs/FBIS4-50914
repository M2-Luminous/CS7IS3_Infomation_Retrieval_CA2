FBIS4-50914 "drchi100_a_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-100 Daily Report 23 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General Justice Ministry Denies Detention, Prison Labor Allegations Justice Ministry Denies Detention, Prison Labor Allegations OW2305165194 Beijing XINHUA in English 1631 GMT 23 May 94 OW2305165194 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, May 23 (XINHUA) -- An official of China's Ministry of Justice said here today that the May 19 report of bodies like "Human Rights Watch-Asia" alleging that there were about 500 newly reported detainees from the 1989 anti-government turmoil was a sheer fabrication with ulterior motives. The report alleged that there were nearly 500 newly reported detainees from the "June 4" incident of five years ago being held in the Beijing No.2 Prison and the Qinghe Reform-Through-Labor Farm. It claimed that they had been badly treated. "This is a sheer fabrication with ulterior motives," the official said in an interview today. The official said that in the "June 4" incident which took place five years ago, a small number of people were charged, according to the laws of China, with criminal responsibility for carrying out activities with the aim of sabotaging the government, or committing crimes, such as beating, smashing, looting, arson or killing, under cover of the chaotic situation. The overwhelming majority of them had been released, either because they had been dealt with leniently, or because they had finished serving their terms, said the official, adding that there was no such thing as nearly 500 such detainees. The so-called "new discovery" of the "Human Rights Watch-Asia" and other organizations was just their newly fabricated lies. As to the allegation that the prisoners of the Beijing No.2 Prison were forced to be quality inspectors for production of rubber gloves for export to the United States, the official said that investigations showed that the prison signed a contract in 1991 with a factory in Beijing for inspecting the quality of rubber gloves on behalf of the manufacturer. The contract contains a clear stipulation that the inspected gloves can only be marketed on the domestic market, and this has been effectively implemented, said the official. He added that there had been no such exports inspected by prisoners to the U.S.A., nor had the Beijing No.2 Prison produced any gloves for export either. The official said that in China, all prisons, including the Beijing No.2 Prison, have to treat prisoners humanely, according to law. The laws of China clearly stipulate that corporal punishment and violence against prisoners is forbidden, and "we act strictly according to relevant laws -- we carry out civilized management over prisoners according to law, and there are laws guaranteeing it." China's criminal law stipulates that any acts of using bodily punishment or maltreatment of prisoners, as well as actions which seriously infringe on the legitimate rights of prisoners, should carry criminal responsibility. People's procuratorates at various levels have opened special offices in prisons and assigned special officers to these prisons to oversee the implementation of these aspects of the legal code. The allegation that the Beijing No.2 Prison had used beating, scolding or other bodily punishment to maltreat prisoners was a "completely groundless fabrication," the official said. It is not the first time that the "Human Rights Watch-Asia" and other organizations have made up such sensational rumors about the conditions in China's prisons and spread them to mislead the public, the official said. Lies will be lies, he said. Such malicious slanders by the "Human Rights Watch-Asia" and similar organizations can only show their hostility toward the Chinese people.
