However, the only possible way is not to alter the status of Crimea or the territorial integrity of Ukraine, Kravchuk told journalists on Sunday when he was present at a Cossack celebration in the city of Pervomaisk in the Nikolayevsk Region. Kravchuk emphasized that territorial integrity was the borderline which must not be violated. This holds for Crimea as well, Kravchuk stressed. He also said that the crisis could be solved as soon as the Crimean parliament cancels its decision to reinstate the 1992 constitution which introduces dual citizenship and relations with Kiev based on agreements.
