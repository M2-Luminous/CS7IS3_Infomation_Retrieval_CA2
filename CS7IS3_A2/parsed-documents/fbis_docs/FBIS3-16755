They discussed questions of the development of agriculture, the fight against crime, restrictions on migration to the kray, and the stationing of military formations on its territory. The president approved the local administration's actions. Boris Yeltsin was told of the active dissatisfaction of the heads of major collective farms in the kray with the latest recommendations by the president's analysis center. Anger at price parity that puts the countryside at a disadvantage, at tax policy, and so on is now commonplace. But the proposal on breaking up farms immediately, on the threshold of the spring sowing, provoked the most vigorous protest. It is a delicate matter. Why indeed destroy something that is at least functioning, feeding, and providing a service. And actually doing not badly, by Russian standards. At any rate, in the Kuban agriculture is better developed than anywhere else in the Federation. And it is actually based on the kolkhozes, not on anything else -- for history deemed it so. On the other hand, the local agrarian leaders are equivocating, claiming that the communal form of land use is a traditional one in the Kuban and cannot be revised. In the first place, it is not traditional, the Kuban has run the entire gamut in the past. Second, for decades no one has attempted to operate in any other way than as a kolkhoz. Anyway, the latest news is that the president has been persuaded to leave the Kuban and its kolkhozes alone for the moment.
