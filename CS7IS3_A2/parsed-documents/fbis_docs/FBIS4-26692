The China Youth Development Foundation (CYDF) yesterday filed a lawsuit in the Hong Kong Supreme Court against the Next Weekly Publishing Co. for its allegedly libelous charges. "We are confident that we will win the case because our foundation has a clean record," said CYDF Secretary-General Xu Yongguang. The lawsuit is crucial to the future of the Hope Project in China, the huge charity programme inaugurated five years ago to raise funds for improving the country's primary education, especially in underdeveloped areas. The foundation sent a written protest on June 16 to the magazine, after it had reported that the foundation had misused the donations. The report has caused some overseas Chinese to hesitate in donating money for the project, according to the CYDF. The foundation asked that the magazine indemnify it for losses due to the alleged libel and publish an apology. The foundation demanded the magazine reply within one week and warned that it would take legal actions otherwise. The magazine has not responded, according to the foundation. On January 21, 1994, the weekly magazine carried a story, saying "donations for the Hope Project had gone missing." The article said that the funds had been intended for repairing a dilapidated primary school in Xianghai Township of Jilin Province. According to the CYDF, the school got the donations of 180,000 yuan ($21,000) on July 29, 1993 and the main building of the school had been put into use before the article appeared. "The report which was inconsistent with facts and used insulting phrases has produced harmful effects both in China and among overseas Chinese," said Xi Jieying, CYDF spokesman. Many other facts in the report were also wrong, he added. He said donated funds, from home or abroad, are carefully recorded in the computer system of CYDF.
