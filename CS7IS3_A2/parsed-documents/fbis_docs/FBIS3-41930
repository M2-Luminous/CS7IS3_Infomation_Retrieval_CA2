The group, comprising representatives of Shell, Akzo, DSM [Dutch State Mines], Philips, Stork, and Fokker, fears that, if RDM's deliveries to Taiwan are carried out, it will have a negative impact on their trade relations with the PRC. RDM has an opportunity to deliver nonstrategic parts for submarines to Taiwan. Such an order, which is expected to be worth several hundred million guilders, is very important for the Rotterdam company's existence. Van der Stee, who is chairman of the China section of the Netherlands Center for Trade Promotion (NCH), confirmed this morning that he had recently talked to Prime Minister Lubbers, Economic Affairs Minister Andriessen, Finance Minister Kok, and Foreign Minister Kooijmans in an attempt to protect the Netherlands companies' interests in the PRC. ``The Chinese surely will condemn us for our hypocritical policy and this will have a negative effect on our trade relations,'' Van der Stee claimed. ``China currently has a 10-13 percent growth rate and the Netherlands should profit from that. One must avoid anything that could conflict with this interest.''
