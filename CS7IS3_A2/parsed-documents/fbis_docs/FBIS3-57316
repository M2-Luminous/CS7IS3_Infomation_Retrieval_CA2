Talks in a bilateral and trilateral format with the Russian Federation and the United States of America were initiated by us to implement the Supreme Council resolution. As a result of intense talks in Kiev, Washington, and Moscow, a trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia was elaborated, which was signed in Moscow on 14 January of this year. The text of the statement and the appendix to it contain clauses going in the direction of implementing the issues noted in the resolution. In particular the accords reached in Moscow envisage granting Ukraine guarantees of its national security after the START I Treaty comes into force and Ukraine accedes to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. They contain pledges regarding confirming independence, sovereignty, and existing borders and refraining from threats of force or using force or measures of economic pressure; a pledge by the United States to grant Ukraine a minimum of $170 million for the dismantlement of nuclear weapons with the possibility of the size of this assistance being increased; moving all nuclear warheads in Ukraine to Russia for their dismantlement with simultaneous compensation being granted in the form of deliveries of fuel assemblies to Ukraine for the needs of its nuclear power engineering. "In addition, and this is of especial political significance, it was confirmed that Ukraine, the United States, and Russia will cooperate with each other as fully fledged and equal partners and that relations between them should be developed on the principles of respect for the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of every state. "The United States also stated its readiness to render assistance to Ukraine in creating a market economy in Ukraine. In this way, the trilateral statement and the appendix to it, and also their implementation, meet the demands set forth in the resolution of the Supreme Council of 18 November 1993. In connection with this, in accordance with an article of the constitution of Ukraine, by way of a legislative initiative I am submitting proposals to remove the reservations contained in the resolution of the Supreme Council of 18 November 1993 concerning article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol and Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. A draft of a corresponding resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine is appended." Appended to the document is the Supreme Council's draft resolution on this issue of the following contents: "The Supreme Council's resolution on the implementation by the Ukrainian president and the Ukrainian Government of recommendations contained in Paragraph 11 of the Ukrainian Supreme Council's resolution on the ratification of the Treaty between the USSR and the U.S. on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Nuclear Offensive Weapons, signed in Moscow on 31 July 1991, and the protocol to it, signed in Lisbon on behalf of Ukraine on 23 May 1992; "Taking account of the specific steps that were taken by the Ukrainian president and government in the period from November 1993 to January 1994, in respect of the implementation of the provisions of the Supreme Council's resolution of 18 November 1993; "Proceeding from the results of the meeting between the Ukrainian, U.S. and Russian Federation presidents in Moscow on 14 January 1994 and the trilateral statement and appendix to it, signed by them; "Taking account of the fact that it was confirmed to Ukraine by the U.S. and Russian presidents that they were ready to extend to Ukraine national security guarantees after the START I treaty is brought into effect and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is acceded to by Ukraine as a nuclear-free state; "As well as taking account of the obligations by the United States, Russia, and Great Britain relating to Ukraine, to respect its independence, sovereignty and existing borders, refrain from the threat or use of force against its territorial integrity or political independence, as well as refraining from economic pressure, and taking account of their obligation not to use any weapons against Ukraine; "In view of the confirmation from the Ukrainian, American, and Russian presidents that they will build their relations on the basis of respect for the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of each of the states, as well as the confirmation of their readiness to assist Ukraine in setting up an effective market economy; and "Acknowledging the fact that the United States assured Ukraine of providing technical and financial assistance to dismantle nuclear weapons securely and safely and preserve fissionable material, as well as of promoting the speedy implementation of the agreements on this assistance, that are already in existence, the Supreme Council of Ukraine resolves: "1. Taking into account the specific measures taken by the president and Government of Ukraine regarding implementation of the resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine on 18 November 1993 and the steps on the part of the United States and Russia to meet Ukraine half way, to remove the reservations regarding Article 5 of the Protocol to the START I Treaty signed in Lisbon on 23 May 1992. "2. To charge the Government of Ukraine to exchange instruments of ratification of the START I Treaty. "3. To accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty of 1 July 1968, which will henceforth be called the Treaty, as a state not owning nuclear weapons, with the following statement: "1) Ukraine owns the components of the nuclear weapons that it inherited from the former USSR. After the weapons are dismantled and destroyed under its control and in accordance with a procedure that will rule out the possibility of reusing these weapons' components for the original purpose, Ukraine intends to use the material extracted from them exclusively for civilian purposes, as fuel for Ukrainian AES [nuclear electric power station]'s in particular, or receive compensation for them; "2) The Treaty does not fully cover the unique situation that arose as a result of the disintegration of nuclear power of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The presence of nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine until they are eliminated entirely, as well as appropriate activity to maintain, service, and eliminate them, does not contravene Articles 1 and 2 of the Treaty. "3) Ukraine will hold talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency with the aim of concluding agreements regarding the guarantees envisaged by the Treaty; "4) The violation of the territorial integrity or inviolability of Ukraine's borders on the part of any nuclear state will be viewed by Ukraine as a violation of the Treaty."
