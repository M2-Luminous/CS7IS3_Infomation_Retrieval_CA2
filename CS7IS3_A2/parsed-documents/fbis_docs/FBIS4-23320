Aid flights have been interrupted and, according to government figures, the death toll at Cuito has reached 200, with 800 wounded, and the figure is expected to rise. It is ironic that the fresh eruption in the war comes at a time when the peace talks in Lusaka are apparently on the verge of a conclusion, with only the crossing of T's and the dotting of I's outstanding. On the line to Luanda, Akwe Amuso asked Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Chikoty why, in view of the progress in Lusaka, the fighting had eruped again. [Begin recording] [Chikoty] We think that UNITA has been using constantly some kind of pressure on the military side. Maybe UNITA was expecting that the government might not make important concessions, as far as their participation is concerned in government. We have now made all the concessions, as far as their participation in government is concerned and so far there has been very little reaction on that. But on the other side, what we have felt is that there is intense fighting around Cuito. As I say, we have registered many deaths and we are going to register many more because they have been shelling the city of Cuito for the last five days, I think, and you can imagine that they are launching over Cuito as many as 500 bombs a day, and that is a lot. [Amuso] UNITA, for its part of course, is accusing the government of having been largely responsible for escalating the situation. In fact, it is accusing the government of using chemical weapons in Cuito. [Chikoty] No, first of all is that this is wrong. You cannot say that the government is responsible for the situation in Angola. UNITA has been fighting against the government after loosing the elections, taking over a number of places. The government has never been in an offensive position. The government has always been in a defensive position, as you may know. If UNITA wants, in fact, to end the crisis, they have to accept unconditionally the offer that the government has made: we stop everything, we sign a final cease- fire through the negotiations that are taking place in Lusaka. The problem is that there is constantly a tendency in some international media to give reason or to be promoting UNITA's cause. [Amuso] But whether you or I like it or not, UNITA is in a position to go on prosecuting this war. Doesn't that mean that you are going to have to make more concessions in Lusaka? [Chikoty] We have made last and final concessions. What we have given to UNITA so far is what is most acceptable to everyone. This offer was considered as extremely important, as we have gone beyond what the mediation has asked the government to do. We have offered everything that could be acceptable. [end recording]
