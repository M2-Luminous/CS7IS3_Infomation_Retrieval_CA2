FBIS4-28841 "dreas114_d_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 South Korea Warning `Weaker' Than Expected Warning `Weaker' Than Expected SK1406051294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0449 GMT 14 Jun 94 SK1406051294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korea was certainly caught by surprise but the situation looked better than first imagined Tuesday after a night of fumbling over North Korea's announced withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). "We always worked with a situation in mind where North Korea would go ahead and pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)," said one Foreign Ministry official on condition of anonymity. "This is weaker than that, although it is apparently a prior warning." Even when North Korea does formally quit the IAEA, its NPT membership still requires it to accept nuclear inspections by the agency. North Korea was apparently well aware of this. In a Foreign Ministry statement Monday night announcing its IAEA withdrawal, Pyongyang said it would not comply with IAEA safeguards measures. For a South Korean Government that stood ready to counter the North's NPT withdrawal, Monday's announcement was, as another ministry official put it, "the mildest action North Korea could take." Predictable changes will first occur at the UN Security Council. The United States still hasn't tabled its draft resolution and is now expected to harden the tone of the resolution to show firmness toward North Korea. "But the draft, if it is to change in tone, will not veer away from the original strategy," said the Foreign Ministry official. The original strategy is to seek step-by-step sanctions starting, for example, with a cultural and technological embargo. Seoul's immediate concern is former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's visit to Pyongyang, which begins Wednesday. North Korea has used the repeated ploy of sending a double signal -- hard-line and conciliatory -- at the same time to sow confusion. If the IAEA withdrawal is a hard-line message, then North Korean leader Kim Il-song may use Carter's visit to deliver a conciliatory message to the United States that Washington will find hard to either ignore or accept officially. What North Korea suggests now can change the momentum at the UN Security Council, especially regarding China, which may insist on more diplomatic dialogue. For now, Pyongyang is using the IAEA withdrawal card as a double-edged sword, waving it as a threat and trying to force the United States to the negotiating table. Interpretations by officials here, in essence, focused on North Korea's need to show its threats were not merely words, especially before the UN Security Council resolution comes down. By showing that it can quit the NPT and actually leaving [as received] the IAEA, North Korea tried to hit a weak spot in Washington, which champions the NPT regime as a major element of foreign policy. At the same time, North Korea strategically minimized the impact of its action by leaving its ties with the NPT intact to save this card for later in countering UN sanctions. There is little that Seoul can do now, officials say, except to make sure that Carter understands South Korea's position on the current crisis and to ensure that its stance is reflected in the upcoming Security Council resolution.
