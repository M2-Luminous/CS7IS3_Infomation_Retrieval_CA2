FR941220-1-00003 FR941220-1-00001 Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent a low cycle fatigue (LCF) failure of the high pressure turbine rotor (HPTR) stage 2 disk, which could result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft, accomplish the following: (a) Remove from service HPTR stage 2 disks Part Numbers (P/N) 1474M49P04, 1474M49P05, 1474M49P06, 9045M35P15, 9045M35P17, and 9045M35P18, in accordance with the following: (1) For disks that have accumulated less than 3,500 cycles since new (CSN) on the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), remove disk from service prior to accumulating 7,080 CSN. (2) For disks that have accumulated 3,500 CSN or more, but less than 7,080 CSN on the effective date of this AD, remove disk from service prior to accumulating 7,080 CSN, or prior to accumulating 3,100 cycles in service (CIS) after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, but not to exceed 9,700 CSN. (3) For disks which have accumulated 7,080 CSN or more on the effective date of this AD, remove disk from service at the next piece-part exposure, but not to exceed 9,700 CSN. (b) Remove from service HPTR stage 2 disks P/N 9264M58P01, 9264M58P02, and 9264M58P03 prior to accumulating 7,080 CSN. (c) This AD establishes the following new LCF retirement lives which will be published in Chapter 5 of the CF6&hyph;50 Engine Task Numbered Shop Manual, GEK 50481: 7,080 cycles for HPTR stage 2 disk P/N 1474M49P04, 1474M49P05, 1474M49P06, 9045M35P15, 9045M35P17, 9045M35P18, 9264M58P01, 9264M58P02, and 9264M58P03. (d) GE CF6&hyph;50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;1069, dated September 12, 1994, describes an FAA-approved rework procedure for the affected disks. Accomplishment of this rework increases the FAA-approved LCF retirement life to 8,750 or 9,700 cycles, depending on the CSN of the disk when the rework is performed. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Engine Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Engine Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this airworthiness directive, if any, may be obtained from the Engine Certification Office. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the aircraft to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Burlington, Massachusetts, on December 14, 1994. Kirk E. Gustafson, Acting Manager, Engine and Propeller Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
