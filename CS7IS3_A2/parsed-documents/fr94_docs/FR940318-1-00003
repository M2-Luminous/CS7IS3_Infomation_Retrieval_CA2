FR940318-1-00003 FR940318-1-00001 In compliance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR part 1320) which implement the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .), the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule have been previously approved by OMB and were assigned OMB control number 0581&hyph;0009 under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). It is anticipated that the proposed changes, if adopted, would be made effective July 1, 1994, as provided by the Cotton Statistics and Estimates Act. Fees for Classification Under the Cotton Statistics and Estimates Act of 1927 The user fee charged to cotton producers for High Volume Instrument (HVI) classification services under the Cotton Statistics and Estimates Act (7 U.S.C. 473a) was $1.87 per bale during the 1993 harvest season as determined by using the formula provided in the Uniform Cotton Classing Fees Act of 1987 as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;237. The fees cover salaries, cost of equipment and supplies, and other overhead costs, including costs for administration, supervision, and standardization. This proposed rule establishes the user fee charged to producers for High Volume Instrument (HVI) classification at $1.80 per bale during the 1994 harvest season. Public Law 102&hyph;237 amended the formula in the Uniform Cotton Classing Fees Act of 1987 for establishing the producer's classification fee so that the producer's fee is based on the prevailing method of classification requested by producers during the previous year. HVI classing was the prevailing method of cotton classification requested by producers in 1993. Therefore, the 1994 producer's user fee for classification service is based on the 1993 base fee for HVI classification. The fee was calculated by applying the formula specified in the Uniform Cotton Classing Fees Act of 1987, as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;237. The 1993 base fee for HVI classification exclusive of adjustments, as provided by the Act, was $1.91 per bale. A 2.7 percent, or five cents per bale increase due to the implicit price deflator of the gross domestic product added to the $1.91 would result in a 1994 base fee of $1.96 per bale. The formula in the Act provides for the use of the percentage change in the implicit price deflator of the gross national product (as indexed for the most recent 12-month period for which statistics are available). However, this has been replaced by the gross domestic product by the Department of Commerce as a more appropriate measure for the short-term monitoring and analysis of the U.S. economy. The number of bales to be classed by the United States Department of Agriculture from the 1994 crop is estimated at 16,550,000. The 1994 base fee was decreased 15 percent based on the estimated number of bales to be classed (one percent for every 100,000 bales or portion thereof above the base of 12,500,000, limited to a maximum adjustment of 15 percent). This percentage factor amounts to a 29 cents per bale reduction and was subtracted from the 1994 base fee of $1.96 per bale, resulting in a fee of $1.67 per bale. The formula requires addition of a five cents per bale surcharge to the $1.67 per bale fee since the projected operating reserve would be less than 25 percent. The five cent surcharge would result in a 1994 season fee of $1.72 per bale. Assuming a fee of $1.72, the projected operating reserve would be 6.6 percent. An additional 8 cents per bale would be required to provide an ending accumulated operating reserve for the fiscal year of at least 10 percent of the projected cost of operating the program. This would establish the 1994 season fee at $1.80 per bale. Accordingly, in §28.909, paragraph (b) would be revised to reflect the reduction in the HVI classification fees. As provided for in the Uniform Cotton Classing Fees Act of 1987, as amended, a five cent per bale discount would continue to be applied to voluntary centralized billing and collecting agents as specified in §28.909 (c). Growers or their designated agents would continue to incur no additional fees if only one method of receiving classification data was requested. The fee for each additional method of receiving classification data in §28.910 would remain at five cents per bale, and it would be applicable even if the same method was requested. The other provisions of §28.910 concerning the fee for an owner receiving classification data from the central database and the fee for new classification memoranda issued for the business convenience of such an owner without reclassification of the cotton would remain the same. The fee for review classification in §28.911 would be reduced from $1.87 per bale to $1.80 per bale. The fee for returning samples after classification in §28.911 would remain at 40 cents per sample.
