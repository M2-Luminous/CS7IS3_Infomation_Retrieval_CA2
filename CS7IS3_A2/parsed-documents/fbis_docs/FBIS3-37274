He noted that many of the country's latest hardships were the result of the emulation of the American monetarist model. "Reforming the Russian economy is a prolonged process, which will take years," Mr. Soskovets said. He said he doubted that the United States would provide any substantial assistance for the development of the Russian economy and that France was a more proximate and reliable partner for Russia. Mr. Soskovets said that Russia and France could co-operate in metallurgy and aerospace industry and hold consultations on the price, investment and banking policies. The French defence minister, for his part, assured the Russian vice-premier that his country was prepared "to follow the logic of partnership" and wished to see Russia "a leading manufacturing power rather than a supplier of raw materials".
