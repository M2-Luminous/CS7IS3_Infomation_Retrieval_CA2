According to the threats, the embassy was going to be blown up with ground-to-air missiles if the internal crisis in that country was not resolved. The threats, which were received on 5 October, were only revealed today when Alexandre Liapin, the embassy's first secretary, and Rafhil Eivazof [names as received], head of the consular section, presented charges to Federal Judge Gustavo Adolfo Literas, who is now in charge of the investigation. The investigation was initially in the hands of the Federal Police, which carried out the pertinent investigation through its Foreign Affairs and Worship Department in order to identify the threats' perpetrators. The two Russian officials confirmed that the threats were received at the embassy, located at 1971 Rodriguez Pena Street in this capital. The threats referred to the internal crisis the Russian Federation had been experiencing since the takeover of Parliament by groups that opposed the government of Boris Yeltsin. According to courtroom leaks, the case also was presumably evaluated by the Supreme Court in utmost secrecy before the courts went into recess for the month of January. The Supreme Court ratified the qualifications of Judge Literas, who now will continue the investigation. The court, through then-President Ricardo Levene, had been in charge of the investigation of the bloody attack on the Israeli Embassy on 17 March 1992, but the court could not identify the perpetrators of the attack in which more than 20 people died.
