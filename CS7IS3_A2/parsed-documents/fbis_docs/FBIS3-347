Military sources in Calabar, the capital of Nigeria's Cross River State on Sunday [6 March], said the "routine" visit was to Army units in the state, including the disputed oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula. Informed sources said the Army chief was in the area to reassure the troops about Nigeria's diplomatic efforts to resolve the dipsute peacefully. According to reports in Calabar on Sunday, the situation in the disputed territory was calm after reported skirmishes on 18 and 19 February. Nigeria has denied a Cameroonian report that there was a clash in the area saying that its own troops were fired on by Camerooninan gendarmes, but did not return fire. Cameroon has taken the case to the United Nations and informed the International Court of Justice at The Hague and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). Nigeria has also intensified diplomatic efforts after it accused France of introducing "an elemement of war" by sending its paratroopers, a frigate and arms to Cameroon under their defence pact. France last week sent a diplomatic mission to Cameroon and Nigeria, while Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema also met the leaders of the two countries in another diplomatic move to avert hostilities.
