Its formation is planned to be finished by the end of next year. They took as an example a relevant sub-unit of the Scandinavian countries. It is likely that the main base of the battalion will be the Lithuanian military unit in Alytus. Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian lawyers will have to prepare and agree upon legislative acts that will ensure the normal function of the battalion. The Baltic servicemen also agreed that it is necessary to have joint control over air space. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia consider participation in the Partnership for Peace program as a step toward integration with Western Europe and as a bridge that will help them to be closer to NATO. One cannot ignore, however, the fact that it is possible that Russia will join the program to blow up this bridge. This opinion was also expressed by the servicemen at a news conference. It is difficult as yet to calculate how much it will cost taxpayers to participate in the partnership. However, the Baltic politicians and servicemen underline that when one talks about security there is no room for bargaining.
