The People's Party leadership yesterday began to prepare its strategy for the state of the nation debate, scheduled for two weeks hence, after reviewing the political developments of the past few days, especially the atmosphere of corruption, the so-called democratic impetus talks, and the coming election campaigns. At its first meeting since Easter Week, the Executive Committee heard a report from Mariano Rajoy on the European and Andalusian elections, scheduled for June, before giving the People's Party chairman the floor. Satisfaction Jose Maria Aznar discussed with his party's leaders the latest opinion polls published, expressing his satisfaction at the favorable prospects for the People's Party. Despite this, he called on the party for a greater effort, especially in its capacity of presenting new proposals, warning that the election campaigns, in which the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] will be bound to start to recover, will be beginning soon. The People's Party leadership then discussed the atmosphere of corruption existing in Spain, but without entering into specific cases. Sources in the main opposition party expressed with concern the idea that, despite the latest cases which have appeared in the press, the government is taking no steps to tackle the phenomenon. Bearing in mind that corruption is persisting, some People's Party leaders called for the resubmission of the package of ethical regeneration measures which the People's Party group brought before the house in the previous legislative term and which was rejected by the PSOE. This option could be readopted within the next few weeks. The state of the talks on the so-called democratic impetus was also examined. The People's Party says that it is prepared to reach an agreement, but maintains its stance that regeneration requires revitalizing the institutions; that is, something more than simply changing personnel or merely sharing out power among the parties. It also insists that the vacancies -- from the ombudsman to the Spanish Radio and Television Company board -- must be filled jointly, since all laws are equal and all must be obeyed. With respect to the Congress [of Deputies] standing orders, the People's Party reaffirms its opposition to the PSOE's latest proposal, deeming it "standpat." Last, the National Executive Committee began to prepare the People's Party's strategy for the coming state of the nation debate. The first proposals were made, and Aznar outlined what could be his speech at that parliamentary session. However, no details have been made known, on the grounds that "it would not be advisable to reveal strategies."
