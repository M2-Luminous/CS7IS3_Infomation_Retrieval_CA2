The government delegation is worried because its proposal has so far been in agreement with the thinking of the mediator and the troika of observers. The numbers proposed by the government for the participation of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in the national police and the rapid intervention unit are about 15 percent and 18 percent, respectively. UNITA always distant, has on various occasions changed its proposal on percentages to be adopted for its participation in police, but so far, it has not been able to convince the mediator to the point of convening a face-to-face meeting or a plenary session to resolve the issue. The Black Cockerel's negotiators want 35 percent participation in national police and 50 percent participation in the riot police.
