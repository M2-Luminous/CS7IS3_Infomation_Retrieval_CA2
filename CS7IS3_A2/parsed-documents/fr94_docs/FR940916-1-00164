FR940916-1-00164 FR940916-1-00016 (iii) The sample size was large enough; and (iv) The sample time was sufficient. (3) If the submitted statistical analysis meets the requirements of Part 232 Appendix B (c)(2), the FRA shall determine it to be valid. (4) If the plotted result of the valid statistical analysis falls on or between the limits of the control band on the appropriate chart given in paragraph (b)(6) of this appendix, the time between required periodic freight brake or single car tests shall remain unchanged for that population of equipment. (5) If the plotted result of the valid statistical analysis falls below the control band on the appropriate chart given in paragraph (b)(6) of this appendix, the time between required periodic freight brake or single car tests for that population of equipment shall be increased by the following amounts without further rulemaking: (i) 3 months for non-high utilization equipment used in conventional freight trains. (ii) 2 months for high utilization equipment used in conventional freight trains. (iii) 1 month for equipment used in intermediate speed freight trains. (iv) 1 month for equipment used in conventional passenger or commuter trains. (v) 1 month for equipment used in intermediate speed passenger or commuter trains. (vi) 1 month for equipment used in high speed passenger trains. (6) If the plotted result of the valid statistical analysis falls above the control band on the appropriate chart given in paragraph (b)(6) of this appendix, the time between required periodic freight brake or single car tests for that population of equipment shall be decreased by the following amounts: (i) 3 months for non-high utilization equipment used in conventional freight trains. (ii) 2 months for high utilization equipment used in conventional freight trains. (iii) 1 month for equipment used in intermediate speed freight trains. (iv) 1 month for equipment used in conventional passenger or commuter trains. (v) 1 month for equipment used in intermediate speed passenger or commuter trains. (vi) 1 month for equipment used in high speed passenger trains. 4.0␣Limitations on Use (a) Application of the statistical process shall not be repeated for the same or nearly the same equipment population more than once every two years. (b) Repeated application of the statistical analysis shall not cause the time interval between required periodic freight brake test, single car test or single unit train tests to be less than: (1) 6 months for non-high utilization equipment used in conventional freight trains. (2) 6 months for high utilization equipment used in conventional freight trains. (3) 3 months for equipment used in intermediate speed freight trains. (4) 3 months for equipment used in conventional passenger or commuter trains. (5) 2 months for equipment used in intermediate speed passenger or commuter trains. (6) 1 month for equipment used in high speed passenger trains. (c) Repeated application of the statistical analysis shall not cause the time interval between required periodic freight brake test, single car test or single unit train tests to be greater than: (1) 60 months for non-high utilization equipment used in conventional freight trains. (2) 60 months for high utilization equipment used in conventional freight trains. (3) 36 months for equipment used in intermediate speed freight trains. (4) 24 months for equipment used in conventional passenger or commuter trains. (5) 12 months for equipment used in intermediate speed passenger or commuter trains. (6) 6 months for equipment used in high speed passenger trains.
