Answering the question in whose hands is the fate of peace in the Balkans, Bulatovic stressed that the big powers follow their own interests and create spheres of influence in the Balkans and beyond. `It is clear who does not want peace, and the Serbs are certainly not among them,' neither those (Serbs) from the war-shattered former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina nor the ones in Yugoslavia, Bulatovic specified. He said that in both world wars the aggressors' aim had been to exterminate the Serbian and Montenegrin peoples, but that they had not been successful in that, and now they are doing it in a much more perfidious way `fighting against us by applying low-intensity strategy', without direct involvement in war. `This people must resolutely defend their freedom, as they had managed to do throughout their history. It has no other choice', said the Yugoslav defence minister.
