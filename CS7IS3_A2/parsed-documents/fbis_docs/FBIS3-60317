They said the four countries had won the right to maintain high environmental and health standards which exceed the E.C.'s harmonised single market rules. Swedish European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel said: "This is a major breakthrough." The term was also used by Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock to describe the enlargement negotiations which must be finalised by March 1 next year if the four applicants are to join the E.C. as scheduled by the 1995 target date. Tuesday's negotiations between E.C. foreign ministers and their counterparts from the four applicant countries did not touch on agricultural subsidies -- the most controversial unresolved issue. Norway, Finland and Austria are all insisting on retaining their high levels of protection for fragile Alpine, Arctic and sub-Arctic farms, which are far higher than the maximum levels permitted by the E.C. But Mock said he believed this problem could be overcome by the target date of March 1. E.C. officials said the candidate countries had been given a four-year period -- until 1999 -- to maintain their high environmental standards after joining the E.C. Over that period the E.C. will try to raise its own standards to match those of the newcomers. The decision applies to such issues as automobile emissions, lead-free petrol, product health labels, waste disposal and restrictions on toxic substances. The E.C. had earlier objected that excessively strict "green" regulations could hinder the free flow of products around the enlarged community. But the four countries all replied that their electorates would not tolerate a lowering of environmental standards as the price of joining the E.C. Pressed on whether Sweden and the other three countries might have to lower their standards after 1999, the Swedish minister said: "There is no reason whatsoever to believe that there will be any lowering of standards." In another concession, the E.C. also gave Swedes an exemption from a community health law that bans wet snuff or "snus" -- a tobacco derivative. And Sweden will be allowed to continue selling snus to Norwegians. Dinkelspiel called this a "Christmas present" from E.C. negotiators, which overcame emotional Swedish resistance to any ban on wet snuff. Sweden will also be allowed to maintain a state monopoly on retail selling of alcohol, but not on liquor imports or wholesaling. The monopoly, an attempt to limit alcohol use, contravenes E.C. free trade regulations. Diplomats said the four candidate countries had unconditionally accepted most of the E.C.'s Maastricht union treaty, which came into force on November 1. It provides for common foreign and security policies, economic integration leading to a single currency, and cooperation in immigration and justice affairs. However, there was no final accord on the single currency issue because of a Spanish threat on Monday to hold up the enlargement negotiations on the grounds that the four candidate countries, being relatively wealthy, would upset the economic balance in the E.C. Spanish European Affairs Minister Carlos Westendorp had said enlargement would make it more difficult for Spain to qualify for a single currency bloc by 1999. But Mock said this was just an "internal problem" of the E.C. And Dinkelspiel warned that the four candidate countries would not accept any special rules to reduce their influence in the process to decide when the single currency bloc would be established and which countries were eligible to join.
