The deputies discussed how to make coal industry, state- owned large and medium-sized enterprises, and light industrial enterprises extricate themselves from their difficult position. State Councillor Li Guixian; Wang Senhao, minister of coal industry; and comrades of relevant departments and committees of the state attended the meeting. Deputy Suo Changyou, mayor of Harbin city party committee, gave a speech on how to accelerate the pace of technological transformation and revitalize the old industrial base. He said: The current prominent issue of Harbin city which is an old industrial base is the issue of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. At present, about 85 percent of state-owned enterprises in Harbin have historical burdens; their debt rate is high; their funds are seriously in short supply; the increase in fixed assets is insufficient; the reserve of fixed assets is not in flexible use; technological transformation projects are few in number; and technical installation is far below the national average. These reasons have kept the economy of Harbin, and even Heilongjiang, tagnant. He proposed that the state set aside a certain amount of money from the increased portion of the financial revenue it has gained after abolishing tax reduction and exemption for the old industrial base of Harbin so that it can use this special fund for a special purpose, and increase loans for technological transformation. He also urged the state to give priority to supporting state-owned large and medium-sized key enterprises, help them raise funds through reform of the shareholding system, relatively increase Harbin's open collection of shareholders from society and the amount of shares listed. Deputy (Gu Shouxian), director of Jixi Coal Mining Administration, offered some ideas and suggestions for solving some major issues of coal enterprises across the province, which must not be neglected. He said: At present, Heilongjiang's coal enterprises are in a difficult position of maintaining normal safety, production, and operation. The state should strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control over the coal market, improve the transport capacity, increase the number of railway carriages, urge the users to settle and directly pay the railway transportation payment, arrange the market in a unified manner, forbid coal in Shanhaiguan to be delivered to northeast China, delegate coal export power to Heilongjiang, support coal mining areas to develop tertiary industry, readjust their contracting work index, and solve their historical burdens and the badly needed circulation funds. Deputy (Chang Baoshi), a worker technician of (Faan) Machinery Plant in Qiqihar, introduced the difficulties of light industrial enterprises. He proposed that the state help them extricate themselves from their predicament as quickly as possible. Deputy Ni Zhirong, chairman of the provincial Trade Union Council, gave a speech on strengthening democratic management among workers; and Deputy Yang Guojun, mayor of Mudanjiang city, also gave a speech on the suggestions and demands of invigorating state-owned, large and medium-sized industrial enterpirses. After listening to the suggestions, State Councillor Li Guixian, said: The state should help Qiqihar's (Faan) Machinery Plant solve difficulties. This is not a minor matter. The raw material products turned out by Heilongjiang have been suffering money losses during transactions. These industries are the economic pillars of Heilongjiang. They are also of great signifiance to the state. At present, the distortion of prices of these raw material products has greatly affected not only Heilongjiang's economic development but also the national economy of China. Regarding enterprises of the war industy, the state is actively doing what it can to help this industry rid itself of difficulties. After that, Wang Senhao, minister of coal industry, said: Heilongjiang is the state's important coal producing base. At present, it has reached a situation in which its difficulties must be resolved. As a minister, I feel very unhappy. This year, the central authorities are concentrating efforts on solving the default of payment for workers, and will invest 2 billion yuan in coal industry and use 500 million yuan to help coal mines develop tertiary industry. I believe the prospects for the coal industry to be bright.
