Commission on Human Rights adopted here today a Chinese motion that no decision will be taken on the draft resolution entitled "The Situation of Human Rights in China." Similar draft resolutions presented by some Western countries at the previous three U.N. human rights sessions were rejected. At today's session, the motion put forward by Jin Yongjian, head of the Chinese delegation received 20 votes for, 16 against and 17 abstentions. Jin pointed out that those who don't prejudice against China can see how it currently enjoys political and social stability, sustained and rapid economic development while its democracy and legal system continues to be perfected. The living standard of Chinese people has gone up significantly and they are enjoying wider human rights and more fundamental freedom than in any of its previous periods of history, Jin said. Jin said that the aim of those countries who had colluded to draft the resolutions was only to exert political pressure on China and to obstruct China's economic development, thus forcing Chinese people to change the path of development which they have chosen according to their own national conditions. "China is willing to cooperate internationally in the field of human rights, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter and on the basis of mutual respect and equality," Jin added. "However, China is firmly opposed to any attempt by any country or blocks of countries to vilify it in the name of protecting human rights," he said. Before the vote, deputies from many developing countries such as Cuba, Mauritius, Syria, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Iran, expressed their support for the Chinese delegation's motion. They pointed out that the international community should be aware of the great progress that China has made in nearly every aspect. The Chinese Government has accepted the challenge of efficiently managing such a big country, which has a quarter of the world's population and has ensured that the living standard of Chinese people has gone up consistently. China's contributions to the world should be highly praised and encouraged, they said. They also pointed out that some Western countries are used to imposing their own views on others, and their draft resolution about China has been put together with clear political intentions.
