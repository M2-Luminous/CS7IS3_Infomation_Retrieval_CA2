In an interview with the London-based Lebanese newspaper AL-HAYAH, published today, she emphasized that Jordan's interest lies in coordination with Syria and Lebanon. Answering a question on whether Jordan is heading for a final agreement with Israel apart from Syria and Lebanon, she said: What I understood from the details of the closed parliamentary session-- in which these issues were discussed and from which I was absent--is that the Jordanian Government is showing reservations about the subject of comprehensive coordination, and of course I am opposed to this position. She asked: Where is reason, logic, and interest when we opt for coordination with Israel and the Palestinian entity and ignore coordination with Syria and Lebanon?
