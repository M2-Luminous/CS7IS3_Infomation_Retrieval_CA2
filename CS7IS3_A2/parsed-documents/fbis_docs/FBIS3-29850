The move is apparently designed to capitalize on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which allows companies to make good use of cheaper labor costs in Mexico for production of products for export to the United States and Canada. The official said, however, Honda has yet to make a decision on when to start production, the scale of production and models to be made. Honda now produces motorcycles and automobile parts at a plant in Guadalajara, west of Mexico City. The big three U.S. automakers, Volkswagen AG of Germany and Japan's Nissan Motor Co. have already established auto manufacturing plants in Mexico.
