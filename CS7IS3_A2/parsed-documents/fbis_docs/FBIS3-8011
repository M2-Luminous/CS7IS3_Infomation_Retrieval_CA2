Milah Hulik, member of the preparatory committee, said that the application was turned down because only 700 out of a total of 1,570 signatures supplied were accepted. The law requires at least 1,000 signatures for a political party to be registered. Allegedly, another reason for the decision was certain unusual features in the Democratic Union's program. Milan Hulik was hopeful that the reasons for turning down the application would be removed and that the new right-wing party would be registered as soon as possible.
