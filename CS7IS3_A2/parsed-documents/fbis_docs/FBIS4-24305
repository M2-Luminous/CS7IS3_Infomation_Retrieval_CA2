It was drawn up by the national constitutional conference commission which based the agenda on the memoranda submitted to it. The first item on the agenda is on the philosophical foundation of the Nigerian state. It proposes four different terms for consideration by the conference. These include the philosophies of one united country or a unitary state, as well as a federation or confederation. An analysis by the constitutional conference commission shows that 60 of the total memoranda received were in support of one united country, while 205 were in support of a federation. The philosophy of a confederation received the support of 43 memoranda and only one memorandum was in support of a unitary government. Another point of the agenda concerns the political structure of the Nigerian state. The constitutional conference is to consider three different forms. One is a two-tiers system which has a central government and a local government without state administration, or a central government with state governments without local administrations. The second form is a three-tiers system like the present one in the country while the third proposal is a four-tiers system of central government, regional governments, state governments, and local governments.
