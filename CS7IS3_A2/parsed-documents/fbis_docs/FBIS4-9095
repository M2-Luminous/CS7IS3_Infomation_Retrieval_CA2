Power for its own sake? [Strak] I will put it bluntly: lack of a better alternative for each of the coalition's partners. And this lack of an alternative is a more serious problem for the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] than it is for the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. The numbers currently in parliament determine the fact that the SLD, along with the Democratic Union [UD], could possibly create a parliamentary majority, whereas the PSL would have to gain the support of two parties. [Paradowska] What could one possibly establish that would be creative, based on a lack of an alternative? [Strak] Lack of an alternative gives room for breathing and makes it possible to conduct politics without a dramatic fear that everything is about to collapse at any moment. So one can plan various measures a few years in advance because the time for the government to be verified is still somewhat in the future. [Paradowska] This way, one can earn the "government of stagnation" label. [Strak] We will see whether there will be stagnation. The opposition can attach any label it wants, but let us wait peacefully for what this government will be doing precisely in this longer kind of term. I think the evaluation will not be complete until the end of the parliamentary term. In my view, the length of authorities' term of office is a sanctity in a democracy. Unless we learn to respect it, it will turn out that, when it comes right down to it, we have not yet matured sufficiently to be able to function in a democratic regime. [Paradowska] I came across the following sentence in one of your interviews: "The PSL finds it easier to say what it does not want rather than what it wants, which means it is easier for the PSL to present its political vision with precision and to regard it as a program." That is not a very encouraging confession, coming from a representative of a team that has gained power and wants to remain in power for the coming years. [Strak] There used to be governmental teams that knew precisely what they wanted but did not quite know what they did not want, and how did they end up? We all know how. One could use the following academic criterion: "Could you list 10 items that you want?" But one could also approach it from the standpoint of what should not happen. This question is very important: At the stage of transformation in which Poland has found itself currently, do we need positive schemes more, or have we reached a point where various things have already happened and we must make a selection, which means facing the question of what constitutes a permanent accomplishment and should be perfected further, and, on the other hand, what it is that we decide to give up on. Let me use the example of self-governments. After four years, we know that self-governments at the gmina level should be further developed, whereas, for the moment, we do not have to organize self-governments at the powiat [small administrative unit] level. So you see that it is equally important to have positive as well as negative visions. [Paradowska] So what are your positive and negative programs at the post you occupy? [Strak] The positive program is expressed by four draft laws that concern: the Council of Ministers, organs of territorial governmental administration, civil service, and amendments to a law on state officials. Issue number-one, as far as the system of ruling the country goes, is to lead to an order in the governmental administration. A second element is about continuing with self-governmental reforms at the gmina [smallest administrative unit] level. The negative program is about the nonintroduction of self-governmental mechanisms at the powiat level or even at the voivodship level. Because relations with the church are also included in my range of duties, it follows that my positive program is to arrange these relations in a way that would prevent friction from occurring in the church-government rapport. Issues related to information circulation are also within my field of interest, and, in that area, we must lead to the government's stable presence in the media. [Paradowska] What do you mean by "the government's stable presence in the media"? [Strak] I mean that there should be opportunities where one can read or watch how the government would like to see itself portrayed. So we want to have a permanent column in RZECZPOSPOLITA. I also think one should consider how to make use of a provision in a law on radio and television that states that public radio and television have an obligation to present the position of the supreme organs of state power. Unfortunately, how that should come about was not specified in the provision. It is like an apple that someone has put on a branch high above the ground and no one knows how to reach. So one should build a ladder of some sort. [Paradowska] In your view, what should such a ladder look like? [Strak] One must simply define it as there being a time slot in the television schedule reserved for the government to present its position, the same way it is happening now with religious programs. [Paradowska] There is the governmental "Balance" television program. [Strak] Because the government is criticized for not coming through strongly enough in the media, one can presume that "Balance" is simply not enough. It is possible that we will set up a joint commission made up of government and media circles to discuss this issue and similar ones. [Paradowska] All of your predecessors used to say that the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM] cannot be reformed, that it is unmanageable, and that it must be broken apart. You want to build new commissions around it. [Strak] Generally speaking, I break anything apart with great reluctance. I think that, if something is already in existence, it is better to try to fix it. I have never been, or will ever be, a revolutionary. But I think the main problem with the entire power structure in Poland is that vertical structures function--and quite well, too--but that there are no horizontal structures functioning at all. There is no interministry coordination. So I would like to lead to the establishment of a whole range of bodies that would function within governmental structures and that would deal with solving different problems on a horizontal level. A single ministry will not solve, for instance, the problem of border crossings. [Paradowska] So there will be separate bureaus for border crossings, plenipotentiaries for pathology, and so forth? [Strak] It is not an issue of plenipotentiaries. These issues are dealt with by specific people in the various ministries, so one does not have to set up new posts, but we must create for them an opportunity to jointly watch the same reality. Coordinating functions can be localized in different places--be it in URM or in the individual ministries. It is possible that the issue of border crossings should be assigned to URM, whereas the issue of national minorities should be assigned to the Culture Ministry. [Paradowska] What you are saying confirms the opposition's accusations about the desire to have a maximum centralization of all issues. [Strak] That is not true. It can be concluded from information that I got on the organization of the British Government that over there, they have 150 different committees functioning across the different ministries. [Paradowska] To what extent are your plans to increase the powers of voivodes [local governmental officials] linked to this coordination? And, also, what is the essence of these additional powers supposed to be about? [Strak] That is quite a different issue. I would like to empower voivodes with decisionmaking powers regarding personnel issues in special administrations. So I do not want to take the special administration away from the ministers, but I want to make chiefs of the special administrations begin to feel that a voivode is also their boss--perhaps not boss number-one but with a sufficiently strong position that his view must be considered. [Paradowska] But my understanding is that this arrangement of a "ministerial Poland" that we have suits you, and there will be no revolution in that regard, either? [Strak] A major debate is ahead of us, concerning how the entire power structure should be organized. I think the number of ministries will remain more or less the same, but their structures will change and they will stabilize. Political posts will be clearly separated from substantive ones. In connection with the work we are conducting, the Foreign Ministry has already prepared its own organizational concept. [Paradowska] So everything is in accordance with your concept of puttiang things in order, perfecting them, but not changing too much? [Strak] One cannot destroy vertical arrangements that are already in place and thanks to which the state is functioning and is not in an anarchy. But in order to improve the process of governing, horizontal coordination must be activated. Once the ministries' structures are put in order, this mechanism will be set in motion. I think that, if we have any reserves at all, it is precisely in the area of improving the efficiency of ruling. [Paradowska] So far, you have been improving the efficiency of ruling by replacing voivodes, or at least this is what you are most famous for. Because you plan to increase voivodes' powers, should one not adopt the appropriate statutory regulations first and then look for the right people? [Strak] In theory, this is exactly as it should have happened, but, in practical terms, it must have happened the way it really did. [Paradowska] You could not overcome pressure by party rank-and-file? [Strak] It was not just the issue of pressure. Even before it occurred to anyone that I would be URM's chief, I already spoke at that point on my idea of what the regional power structure should look like, and I also said that it must be adapted to the changes taking place at the top. But one must not forget that, despite all of the propaganda about it, we replaced voivodes in just 29 voivodships. [Paradowska] And you think that is not a lot? [Strak] I do not know whether it is a lot or a little. It is more or less the same as in France during the change of a team. [Paradowska] There are some differences. In France, there is a corps of highly skilled officials who must, for instance, be graduates of prestigious schools. [Strak] In Poland, neither new officials nor old ones have graduated from such schools. My point is that we have just reached the limit of about 60 percent of changes that I regard as rational, but that does not mean that there will be no further changes. [Paradowska] But the SLD has not participated in a major way in this booty sharing. [Strak] It is not an issue of sharing booty between the SLD and the PSL. There were specific agreements between the SLD and the PSL in all of the voivodships except Wloclawek. The SLD has no reason to feel it was discriminated against. Of course, on the surface it may seem like the PSL got more posts, but the fact that the SLD candidates prefer to present themselves as nonparty, that is their business and theirs alone. I will not force anybody to show their current or past party identification cards. [Paradowska] Your most recent idea is to introduce terms of office for voivodes, under which, with every change of government, there would also be a change of voivodes and their deputies. [Strak] Why do you say change? Perhaps this is about stabilization. The point is to establish clear rules of the game and to lead to a situation where a voivode knows that, as long as a particular prime minister is in power, his situation is stable, while his future--I mean a renewal of the contract by the next prime minister--will depend on whether the voivode is loyal to the political arrangement that is in power at a given time, and also on whether he will not do too many things that could endanger his relationship with the government that could gain power. Then nobody could hold it against him that, while being a voivode under Prime Minister Pawlak's government, he has good rapport with UD or with some other opposition party. In that sense, the voivode is apolitical. [Paradowska] I must admit I do not comprehend this apolitical nature completely. [Strak] Why don't you analyze the fate of those voivodes who have remained at their posts but who do not get publicity? What have they done to deserve this lack of reservations about them? Simply put, in the previous period, they acted normally vis-a-vis parties that were in the opposition; to them, there were no better and no worse political forces or better and worse Sejm deputies. They were voivodes for everybody. So they avoided conflicts with anyone and now it pays back. So, if we define the rules, we should tell voivodes outright: You are supposed to cooperate with the government properly, and it is a question of your skills to make those who come after us approve of you, as well. Voivodes, both old and new, accept that. So as to avoid destabilization in case of a change, we are establishing the post of director general of the office [presumably of URM], which will not be subject to fluctuations. That will be exactly the state civil service. So we are presenting a certain comprehensive structure whose essence is to separate whatever is political (and thus subject to change, with the voivode being a political official under this concept) from what is civil service. [Paradowska] I must admit ftaht I still cannot see what the stabilization is about. What is stable about a situation in which an entire government changes and almost, at the same time, voivodship leaderships also change? [Strak] Why do you continue to assume that everything changes? [Paradowska] Because the other parties will also have their rank-and-file members, who must be awarded posts after the victory. Unless that is so, it is your prediction that the PSL will rule forever. [Strak] My assumption is that, after the change of government, a major portion of the voivodes will remain at their posts and the new prime minister will extend contracts with them because they will have had good rapport with everybody. Of course, some change is always unavoidable. [Paradowska] What criteria did you use while looking for voivode candidates, naturally apart from the political criterion? [Strak] These criteria are somewhat different with regard to voivodes coming from SLD and PSL lists. The SLD suggested people associated with the economy or with the administration of the scientific community--for instance, former university presidents or their deputies. So, basically speaking, the arrangement of people there could be described as a scholarly-economic one. Among PSL people, there are former chief officers of groups of villages and people who served in the state administration in the past. So one cannot say they are completely without any prior experience or preparation. [passage omitted] [Paradowska] To what extent is everything that you do and proclaim--the relationship to self-governments at different levels, the new philosophy of stabilization regarding voivodes, the administration reforms--a result of decisions made within the coalition, and to what extent is this your own vision of the state? Is this Minister Strak's private business? [Strak] Being here, it is my task to articulate my party's and the coalition's points of view. The coalition will be delivered this batch of laws, and it will decide what to do next. But it is beyond any dispute that the arrangement of state power must be put in order. We will debate in different groups regarding the way that should be accomplished, in both the voivodships, during sessions by the Council of Ministers, which, after all, is composed of coalition ministers, and in the Sejm. I can assure you that party interests or my private interests will not be of primary importance in that regard. The greatest party interest that is ahead of us to be accomplished is that, after four years in power, it will turn out that this country's functioning has improved. [Paradowska] Thank you for the conversation.
