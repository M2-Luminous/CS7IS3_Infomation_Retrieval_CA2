ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has extended the temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of the insecticide fungal entomopathogen Beauvaria bassiana , Naturalis-L strain, and has broadened the tolerance to include residues in or on all raw agricultural commodities. DATES: This temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance expires January 18, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail, Phil Hutton, Product Manager (PM) 18, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 213, CM#2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703) 305&hyph;7690. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice that was published in the Federal Register of August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41473) that a temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance had been amended for residues of the insecticide fungal entomopathogen Beauvaria bassiana , Naturalis-L strain in or on the following raw agricultural commodities: cotton seed; peanuts; peanut forage; peanut hay; tomatoes; lettuce; cantaloupe; cabbage and peppers for the control of boll weevil, whiteflies and leafhoppers. This exemption from the requirement of a tolerance has been estended in response to pesticide petition (PP) 2G4157, submitted by Fermone Corporation, Incorporated, 2620 No. 37th Drive, Phoenix, AZ 85009. The company has requested an expansion to include all raw agricultural crops and a 1&hyph;year extension of the temporary tolerance to permit the continued marketing of the above raw agricultural commodities when treated in accordance with the provisions of experimental use permit 53871-EUP-1, which is being issued under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended (Pub. L. 95&hyph;396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136). The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance has been extended and expanded on the condition that the pesticides be used in accordance with approved experimental use permits and with the following provisions: 1. The total amount of the active ingredients to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by approved experimental use permits. 2. Fermone Corporation must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. This temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance expires January 18, 1995. Residues remaining in or on all the raw agricultural commodities after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticides are legally applied during the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance may be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemption from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a(j). List of Subjects Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: April 27, 1994.
