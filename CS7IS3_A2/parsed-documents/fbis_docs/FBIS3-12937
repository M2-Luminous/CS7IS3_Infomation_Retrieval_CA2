And do you prefer one means to another? [Sa'id] As military men and a military organization we plan our work, and we intend to win the battle for which we have planned by every means. We are trying to apply all available means to achieve victory. We are bound by what was mentioned in our first statement on ways of toppling the regime and by what was mentioned in the Democratic National Grouping's charter in this connection. The charter stressed the need to topple the regime by all available means, including civilian and military means. Our job, as the grouping's military arm, is the latter. In Sudan's history civilian means were used twice: once to topple the regime of Lt. Gen. Ibrahim 'Abbud (1964) and (former President Ja'far) Numayri (1985). The Army intervened after the masses' participation. That scenario will continue. The statement we addressed to the Sudanese forces inside the country as the Legitimate Command of the Sudanese Army said that we should work together to topple the regime. It means that, since we addressed individuals carrying arms, these arms should be used to topple the regime. Of course, it would be better if the aim can be achieved through peaceful means. However, individuals who are carrying arms can use these arms. We do not expect our battle with the regime to be easy. And we will use all our strength from both inside and outside the Army, and we will use the people's factions in the capital and the other cities to settle the final battle. We have our own military plans, but I cannot talk about them. However, I can say that we are about to topple the regime by all the means available to us. [Daw-al-Na'im] Are you coordinating in this connection with the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement [SPLM]? [Sa'id] We discussed this coordination in the first meeting with the movement's leader, Colonel John Garang, and his aides, which was held in November 1990. There was a point which we had to clarify, namely that we are the legitimate commanders of the Armed Forces. And as you know, the movement is in a state of war with the Armed Forces, whose commanders are supposed to be us. Here comes the contradiction, because we do not want the Armed Forces to be defeated by the movement while we are seeking to topple the regime in Khartoum. This position was clear, and the movement's leaders appreciated it. This leads us to stress that we are not betraying the Armed Forces, revealing their plans, or talking to the brothers in the SPLM about the points of weakness or strength in the Army. We only discuss with them coordination for the sake of toppling the regime, each side using its own method. And we cannot stop them from continuing the ongoing war, nor can they drag us into their war against the regime. [passage omitted] [Daw-al-Na'im] It is often said that any military attempt to restore democracy in Sudan could turn into a civil war. Is that what you want? And what guarantees are there to prevent that happening? [Sa'id] There is no possibility of civil war breaking out in the event of a confrontation with the regime's forces. Against whom is that civil war supposed to be fought. The regime arms the militias to help it survive. It is the regime which is calling for a war of that kind. But we are aware of that and do not believe that a civil war is going to break out if we confront the regime, even if this confrontation is military. [passage omitted] [Daw-al-Na'im] In your first statement you urged Sudanese Army personnel to rebel against the regime, but that did not happen.... [Sa'id] We urged officers and soldiers to support legitimacy, not to rebel. Because they did rebel when they joined President 'Umar al-Bashir, or when he deceived them. We urged them to return to legitimacy, not to rebel again. As for the scale of their response to our appeal, it cannot be measured. However, we can talk about the reaction to this appeal. This reaction was reflected in the strict surveillance measures applied by the regime against officers and soldiers. For example, it prevented them from leaving their units, tightened security control over them, even inside their barracks and homes, and prevented nonserving officers entering the barracks to finalize some matters, as used to happen before. And large-scale changes were made in the military leaderships in the capital, with these being replaced by cadres from the National Islamic Front. And officers whose loyalty was deemed suspect were moved to the war zone in the south, and a large number were dismissed. All this clarifies the scale of the response, which did not crystallize clearly because the regime, with all the capabilities at its disposal, managed to confront this move. This is why I believe that the appeal we addressed encountered a great response and can be exploited at any time. The fact that we have not seen anything tangible does not necessarily mean there is no response. [Daw-al-Na'im] The information available to the media says that no serving officers have joined you, and that all members of the organization are nonserving officers. [Sa'id] A small number of serving officers have joined us. And I cannot say that there is a large number of them. The reason for that is the extensive measures taken by the government. [Daw-al-Na'im] A special court is currently looking into the case of the bombings which the government says were part of a plan to undermine stability and overthrow the regime. What is your link with that operation? [Sa'id] We did not have any involvement in the so-called bombing case. I do not deny that we know some of the defendants in the case. And of course, the regime was bound to associate our relationship with these defendants and the case in order to prove our involvement. By virtue of my 25-year experience in the Engineer Corps I cannot plan a naive operation like that, because it is difficult to obtain explosives from outside the country and there is a lack of them inside. [passage omitted] [Daw-al-Na'im] Have you carried out any military actions against the regime over the past four years? [Sa'id] We have not carried out any action that satisfies our aspiration. We have planned actions, but they have not been carried out for one reason or another. We know that four years is a long time and causes boredom for those who would participate in actions of that kind. But the circumstances are not helpful. We are discussing the possibility of taking action with our own capabilities. International conditions and the opposition's circumstances are responsible for this situation. We have not had a base from which to act, or sufficient aid. And I believe that all these obstacles will soon disappear. And I am optimistic that the regime will be toppled by an armed action, and that all aid will arrive soon. [Daw-al-Na'im] A disagreement erupted inside your organization recently. What is the nature of the differences, and what is the scale of the split? [Sa'id] The nature of military political action requires a degree of flexibility -- which sometimes leads to the intervention of some parties, hence the disagreements. Like other political forces, we have not been spared that disease. However, thank God, our brothers in the military establishment who differed with us joined the Legitimate Command willingly, and they have offered a great deal. So the discipline exists, regardless of our differences. Military discipline exists and we respect one another. The disagreement needed to be tacked and, thank God, has been contained.
