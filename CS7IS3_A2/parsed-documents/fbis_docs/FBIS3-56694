Because of this, the Russian Foreign Ministry would like to state the following. As far as interstate relations between Russia and Belarus are concerned, they are still a priority for us with the objective of strengthening friendship and developing in-depth mutually advantageous cooperation in the military, political, trade, economic, humanitarian, and other spheres. A good foundation has already been laid for moving toward the strategic objective of bringing our two countries closer together in accordance with decisions made by the highest-ranking leaders of Russia and Belarus. There is no doubt that rapprochement of this kind would encourage a carefully prepared amalgamation of the monetary systems of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus on the basis of the intergovernmental agreement of 8 September 1993. The statement by the Russian and Belarusian heads of government dated 5 January 1994 states that the work that has been done to implement this agreement includes tasking the two countries' ministries and departments with preparing additional documents which will define the mechanism whereby the monetary system will operate once it has been amalgamated, the single mechanism for administering the budget systems of both states, and also questions connected with foreign economic, trade, and customs policy. The fastest possible coordination of these documents would suit the interests of the people of both countries. Commenting on this statement for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry Information and Press Department, said: "The process of establishing bilateral relations is multidimensional and multilayered, and Russian ministries and departments have been directly instructed by the president and the government to work intensively and dynamically in this area."
