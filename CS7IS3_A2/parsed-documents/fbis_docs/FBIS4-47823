Cape MB0305174194 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1715 GMT 3 May 94 MB0305174194 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Cape Town May 3 SAPA -- Western Cape premier-elect Hernus Kriel on Tuesday [3 May] pledged himself to reconciliation with political opponents and co-operation with the central government. At a press conference Mr Kriel, who led the National Party to its only regional victory, said he had already had cordial telephonic discussions with African National Congress Western Cape leader Allan Boesak. He was optimistic they would have a good working relationship. At a meeting on Tuesday afternoon they would discuss matters such as the composition of a 10-member provincial cabinet. The NP would have six members and the ANC four. He did not foresee problems in co-operating with the ANC-dominated central government. Its rights and powers would be respected, but those of the region would be jealously guarded. The government of the Western Cape would work together with the central government in a spirit of reconciliation and co-operation. "There is no animosity from our side whatsoever." He was aware of racial tensions as the result of the elections in the Western Cape and developing a reconciliation programme would be a priority. "We will have to work out a plan of action to tackle that problem, but it is something we have to do along with the ANC and this will be started as soon as the new cabinet meets. We must put our political fight behind us and become task-orientated in serving the community. We want to make the Western Cape the jewel province of the new South Africa." He expressed appreciation for calls by ANC leader Nelson Mandela and the Congress of South African Trade Unions for acceptance of the result. He would meet community leaders soon. "I will go out of my way to meet leaders to assure them of the good intentions of the National Party. In the final analysis we will have to prove ourselves, and we intend doing that." Other priorities were social upliftment, economic development, peace and security. He was not averse to the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme but it would have to be adapted to resouces in the Western Cape. Affordability and timeframes would be factors. Mr Kriel said he would seek support of the other parties to change the name of the area to "Cape of Good Hope", but this would not be done unilaterally.
