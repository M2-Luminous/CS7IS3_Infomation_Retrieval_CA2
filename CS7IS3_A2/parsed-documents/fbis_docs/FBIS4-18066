Now, the documentation that accuses former UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim, 75, of evil war crimes has been published -- among other things, he is accused of having participated in the execution of British prisoners of war and the deportation of Greek Jews. STERN correspondent Claus Lutterbeck interviewed the former Austrian president in Vienna. [Lutterbeck] Mr. Waldheim, did you "aid and participate" in war crimes? [Waldheim] This is an abomination that is intended to destroy the reputation of a man who has never in his life been a Nazi or committed war crimes. [Lutterbeck] The report describes your role in Army Unit E.... [Waldheim] ...just with assumptions and claims. There is not a single piece of evidence on 204 pages that I was personally involved in these events. Not a single historian in the world has proven something like that. A British Government committee in 1986 noted that I was not guilty of any crimes. Only the Office of Special Investigations in the U.S. Justice Department claims that. [Lutterbeck] The report describes your responsibility quite precisely. According to the report, you, as an assistant adjutant, were a key figure in this army unit. [Waldheim] Nonsense, I was a lieutenant -- later a first lieutenant -- without any authority to give orders and I dealt with situation reports in the army staff. [Lutterbeck] Curiosity about your case was aroused because in your official biography, you did not mention your wartime past in the Balkans.... [Waldheim] ...in the official curriculum vitae, which I presented to the Foreign Ministry in 1945, I mentioned the Balkans. Later on, I did not see any reason to constantly repeat that. [Lutterbeck] Your way of dealing with the past in Hitler's army is strange. Why does one not hear a word of repentance and shame from you? [Waldheim] I openly expressed my grief and sympathy here in parliament in 1986. [Lutterbeck] Was it not perhaps this Austrian method of always considering oneself only as one of Hitler's victims and not as a perpetrator? [Waldheim] Of course, there were Austrians who were among the biggest Nazi criminals, but there were also many victims. My family and I were at daggers drawn with the Nazis. [Lutterbeck] You are always the victim. [Waldheim] My family was persecuted by the Nazis, my father was imprisoned, and my mother spit at in the street. I am deeply aggrieved that it is intended to turn precisely a man with this fate into a super Nazi and war criminal. [Lutterbeck] However, this did not turn you into a man that opposes Nazis. [Waldheim] It is easy to say that for the generation who did not live through it. "Why did you not let yourself be beheaded for your convictions?" We were young people and wanted to survive. [Lutterbeck] President Von Weizsaecker was also an officer. Why did it hit you and not him? [Waldheim] These are two completely different cases that you cannot compare. I once had the problem of holding the highest office in the world. It was intended to hit the UN secretary general, who, during his term of office, also made decisions that some governments did not like.
