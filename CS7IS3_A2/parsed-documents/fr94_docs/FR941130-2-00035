Background TBTF compounds are registered for use in paint formulations as an antifoulant treatment for hulls, outboard motors, and lower drive units of certain types of marine vessels.

On July 7, 1994, EPA published in the Federal Register a Notice of Receipt of Request to Cancel Registrations of Atochem's three registrations of TBTF products, EPA registration numbers 5204&hyph;19, 5204&hyph;61, and 5204&hyph;64. In that Notice, EPA announced its intent to grant the request for cancellation of these products and also set forth a proposal to prohibit Atochem's sale, distribution and use of these products effective on the date of the cancellation order. Other dealers and distributors would be permitted to sell and distribute these products until supplies were exhausted. End-users would be permitted to use these products until supplies were exhausted. For further information regarding the request for voluntary cancellation and the existing stocks proposal, see the July 7, 1994 Notice (59 FR 34814).
