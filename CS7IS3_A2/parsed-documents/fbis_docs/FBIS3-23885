And although for the first time many things were spoken of without the stamp of secrecy at the press conference where the participants included the managers of all six regional districts of Gosatomnadzor Rossii [Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Security], as well as the deputy chairman of this federal department, A. M. Zhokin, all of whom came to Novosibirsk for the All-Russian Conference on Questions of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, nonetheless the secrecy was still apparent. We Didn't Stand Behind the Price Before and We Still Don't Do not believe that some people behave badly just because they like to. Most often they behave that way for very good reason, a sage has claimed. But as everyone knows, wise men do not have all the answers. For what benefit could there be, and for whom, for example, from the super secrecy with which most of the "postal boxes" of the military-industrial complex poisoned the air, water, and land? But even so that sage's claim is not far from the truth. And it is precisely this "benefit," it seems, that is the root of all the secrecy whose fruits we are reaping today. Suffice it to recall the desire, at whatever cost, to report "launching by the red-letter date" and "early fulfillment of the construction plan." In itself the desire is praiseworthy. If, of course, one does not take into account that as a rule the money and time which were in short supply here were "saved" in the nature protection complexes which were supposed to alleviate the technogenic pressure and protect nature and hence people from the harmful impact of production. Despite all that, a brave face was put on a sorry business: We were truly indignant at nuclear explosions near a distant atoll at the edge of the world, while living almost under the wing of the Semipalatinsk Test Range in complete confidence of the purity of our sky. The truth will out. There were a considerable number of rumors about PO Box 80, as many citizens out of habit still call the chemical concentrates plant. But all the same only a few of the workers even knew that their plant was one of the nuclear fuel cycle enterprises and that among other "secrets," fuel elements for atomic power plants were made there. The same ones which were supposed to replace the smoking TES's [heat and electric power plants] and other harmful energy sources almost everywhere. Out of the Frying Pan Into the Fire But it would be more accurate to speak of the ineradicable force of the custom of jumping from one extreme to the other. And while yesterday we saw the peaceful atom as a reliable source of heat and light and an aid in medical work and the medical system, now many people see those very atomic power plants as nothing but monsters which threaten mankind with disaster. The lesson of Chernobyl and Tomsk? Was a great deal of benefit derived from what happened? In the Siberian Region, on whose territory in addition to the six nuclear fuel cycle enterprises there are five nuclear reactors, two industrial reactors (in Tomsk-7 and Krasnoyarsk-26) have already been shut down. It seems that such a fate awaits two research reactors too. Three now in operation have a two-fold purpose: military and industrial. The reactor in Krasnoyarsk-26 provides all the electricity and heat to this city, while in Tomsk-7 two other reactors, in addition, provide one-quarter of the electricity and almost one-half the heat for greater Tomsk as well. I Left My Grandfather and I Left My Grandmother In accordance with a presidential edict, the federal nuclear and radiation safety oversight service represented by Gosatomnadzor is supposed to provide monitoring of both the peaceful atom and the military atom. But although the deadline for transferring military nuclear installations to the control of Gosatomnadzor has already passed, the radiation safety department has certainly not obtained access to army secrets. And all the same in accordance with existing international agreements, military reactors are supposed to be shut down in the near future. However, many of the problems with their continued use arise when they are switched to a peaceful footing. The Ministry of Fuel and Energy is already insisting on unloading present AES [nuclear electric power plant] capacities, referring to their unreliability. For example, the Balakovo AES, for which our chemical concentrates plant even supplies fuel assemblies, ended up at such an impasse. Where Are the `Tailings' Supposed To Go? Despite the existing opinion about destroying and not building, shutting down nuclear production is both a complicated and an extremely expensive pleasure. And one of the main problems both for AES's being "temporarily shut down" and for working nuclear fuel cycle enterprises which use radioactive sources and products based on them is storing the radioactive waste. This problem is an acute one for Novosibirsk too. The Chik Is Not So Black as It Is Painted Who has not heard of the horrors of the Chik "testing range," although a question about it brings a smile to the people who know the situation from other than hearsay. It seems that there is a rigorous plan for storing nuclear materials at the site where they are "registered." And each region has its own "tailings storage facility." And we do too. But it is located on the other side from the Chik. "Small stuff" is stored near the Chik, for the most part items which contain radioactive sources. The Radon Firm works on this. If one judges by the fact that scrap material with radioactive content from Omsk and Tomsk is stored here and until recently "corpses" arrived from Kazakhstan as well, the "registration permit" system of the Chik storage facility is not so very rigorously observed. As for its safety, according to the chief of the Siberian District of Gosatomnadzor, P. D. Mintyukov, the test conducted recently by a major commission found no traces of radioactive contamination, not even in the ground waters around the storage facility. Unlike the results of the study of nuclear objects of Russia, which, according to A. M. Zhokin, revealed a "multitude of negative aspects" in the handling of radioactive waste. The materials of this study are being processed, a number of normative documents have been prepared, and the Law on Radiation Safety is under study. However, bringing things up to the norm of course requires major capital investments. Given the present shortage of such things, it is not difficult to guess that the steps outlined will be postponed. Until better times. The shortage of capital investments is an "Achilles heel" in the safety of our chemical concentrates plant, although it applies for the most part to the strength of the buildings. That is to say, if suddenly an airplane falls from the sky, the plant will not survive. Such a "surprise" does not threaten similar enterprises in Europe, for example. As for the safety of our enterprise's personnel and the level of the technological processes, it turns out that specialists of Western Europe and America are working terribly hard trying to penetrate the secret of how we managed to reach a level which a similar German enterprise in Hanoi, for example, did not even dream of. You Pick It Up and It Glows Time will show whether Gosatomnadzor and its inspection offices manage to protect our life from their radioactive ward, which has convincingly demonstrated its far from peaceful disposition. But perhaps the "radioactive scoundrel" in our city played the meanest joke on the so-called pilferer of vegetables. In recent years Berezovgeologiya [Berezov Geology] specialists have identified about 200 spots with radioactive contamination in the city. Such "points" shone most often in Kalininskiy Rayon. Radioactive anomalies were registered in dacha plots, private sector gardens, and apartments whose owners got into the habit of picking up everything that was left untended. A great deal of material was poorly stored in "PO Box" 80 too. Put to work by zealous masters, it glowed in the new place as well. But it glowed in an evil way. But if the "demon beguiled" the pilferers out of ignorance, then how can one explain the cases where waste from this "closed" enterprise was used for fill on roadbeds, for fix up work in residential zones, and even on the grounds of children's institutions? By this same ignorance, the natural result of secrecy, or near-criminal carelessness? And the presence in almost half of the city's schools of items with a radioactive content--wasn't that really the same cause and effect series? We Are All Under the Same Atom The very same misfortunes are characteristic of all regions and cities of Russia. According to the estimate of the specialists of the St. Petersburg Scientific Research Institute of Radiation Hygiene of the Ministry of Health Care of Russia, each person in our country on the average receives 0.123 rems from medical radiation (X-ray examination, fluorography, and the like) and 0.293 rems from the natural background. Overall that gives an exposure over 70 years which is almost 300 times greater than the radiation from the accident at the Chernobyl AES. The primary problems linked to radioactive contamination are radiation disease and oncological diseases. The rate of the latter is higher in our city than the average for Russia, and according to an evaluation by the AGIZ-Health Group of the city sanitary-epidemiological oversight center headed by I. F. Mingazov, it is on the upswing. But benzapyrine, soot, and metals are also carcinogenic. And even the smallest dose of radiation against the background of high chemical pollution increases its danger many times over. But if the city's excessive natural radiation background because of its granite "foundation" is taken into account, they should have been more careful, as the satirist used to say, not only with radioactive contamination but with other discharges and emissions as well. Without that, no Gosatomnadzor will help us.
