The new committee will be chaired by the prime minister, with the minister of national defense as his deputy. Committee members include deputy prime ministers, the ministers of internal affairs, foreign affairs, finance, industry, and foreign economic cooperation, and the heads of the Council of Ministers Office and the Central Planning Office. According to National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk, the committee should, above all, deal with reforming the command structures to bring them closer to West European standards. [begin Kolodziejczyk recording] In brief, it will mean the departure from the existing command structures, the setting up of the post of the commander in chief of the Polish Army, and land, air, and naval forces commanders subordinated to him. The next important issue the committee should deal with is to put in order the legal foundations for the functioning of the ministry and the Army. Here I would give priority to the deep and long-ranging amendments to the law on the public defense duty, which first of all should introduce a division of powers between the civilian minister of national defense and the commander in chief, or, for the time being, the head of the General Staff of the Polish Army. It is also necessary to regulate a number of other matters, which are outdated in the present reality and are even hampering all progress. [end recording]
