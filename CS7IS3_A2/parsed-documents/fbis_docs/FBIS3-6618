FBIS3-6618 "dreas054__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-054-A Document Type:Daily Report 18 Mar 1994 ANNEX Japan Defense Agency Studies Use of Satellite Imagery OW1903131194 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 18 Mar 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1903131194 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Defense Agency [DA], which has studied ways to improve its capability of collecting military information, has begun to examine specific ways to purchase sophisticated photos taken by highly efficient satellites developed by American firms for military reconnaissance through commercial deals to use them to analyze the military situation in Japan's neighboring nations. In the United States, government organizations were provided access to the photos taken by the military reconnaissance satellites in the past, but the Clinton administration recently decided to allow civilian corporations to launch them for commercial purposes. In response to the U.S. administration's decision, the DA has begun to examine specific ways to purchase the sophisticated satellite photos. It plans to use those sophisticated satellite photos to "enhance its capability of collecting military information" as its priority task when it shapes a new guideline for the buildup of Japan's defense capabilities. Other Asian nations are also interested in using the sophisticated photos taken by those satellites to collect military information, and the use of those sophisticated photos will be noted as a new proliferation of military technology. In addition to photos obtained from the U.S. Government, the DA has been purchasing those taken by such commercial observatory satellites as "Landsat" of the United States and "Spot" of France, and using them to analyze the military situation in areas neighboring Japan. While U.S. military reconnaissance satellites are said to be capable of distinguishing an object of a radius of at least 30 centimeters on the earth, the remote-sensing satellites are only capable of distinguishing an object measuring about 10 meters. Photos taken by the remote-sensing satellites are said to help in analyzing the movements of ground troops and the deployment of airplanes. For this reason, the Defense Agency has studied how to resolve technical and legal problems involving the purchase of sophisticated satellite photos while studying the possibility of launching its own military reconnaissance satellites. In the past, the United States has kept the technology of military satellites classified. In response to Russia moving to sell satellite photos to other nations following the end of the Cold War, the U.S. Government recently changed its conventional policy and decided to allow private corporations to launch highly efficient satellites to capture the market. It is said that the U.S. Government will allow private corporations to sell only satellite photos that can distinguish an object measuring one meter. A DA official says if the DA uses those satellite photos, it can distinguish the type of aircraft on the ground. According to an official concerned, Lockheed and other American firms are informally sounding out the DA and some Asian nations about purchasing their satellite photos. There are various ways to purchase those photos, including the simple purchase of individual satellite photos and the establishment of ground receiving stations. It is said that the monopolistic use of satellite photos on specific areas and the right to ask for an orbit change of satellite are negotiable. There is a possibility that the DA's use of the sophisticated photos taken by the military reconnaissance satellites runs counter to a Diet resolution calling for a ban on using the space for military purposes. For this reason, the government has been cautious about using the photos taken by military reconnaissance satellites. The use of photos taken by multipurpose commercial satellites, however, has been interpreted as not violating the Diet resolution. The DA maintains that the photos taken by the multipurpose commercial satellites are the same as the sophisticated photos taken by the military reconnaissance satellites. The use of sophisticated photos taken by the military reconnaissance satellites may run counter to the Diet resolution depending on contract terms including the monopolistic use. The DA's use of sophisticated photos taken by military reconnaissance satellites is expected to have a subtle impact on the present military balance in Japan's neighboring nations. The DA plans to speed up the study of contract terms offered by the American firms and appropriate survey expenses in the fiscal 1995 budget, at the earliest.
