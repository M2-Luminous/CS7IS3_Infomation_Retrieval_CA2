It condemns manifestations of terrorism in all their forms and is prepared to take part in the investigation of this tragic incident in order to punish the guilty," ITAR-TASS was told today by Libyan Ambassador to Russia Muhammad 'Husni Sha'ban. The ambassador dwelt on the charges advanced against Libya the United States and Great Britain. Two Libyan citizens are known to be suspected of organising an explosion on board a Pan-American liner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988. France accuses Libyan agents of blowing up a French liner, belonging to the UTA air company, in Niger in 1989. These incident claimed the lives of 449 people. The ambassador noted that Libya had insisted on a "fair and just" investigation of the charges brought against its citizens, who should be first tried by a Libyan court. Later it had softened its stand and agreed that the investigation should be conducted by The Hague International Court. The United Nations and the Arab League could find an appropriate legal basis for this. It had also offered to conduct a joint investigation by representatives from the United States, Great Britain, Libya and several other states. According to Sha'ban, all these proposals were rejected by Washington and London. They continue to insist on the unconditional extradition of the suspects, to which Libya cannot agree, of course. The Arab League even offered to try the two Libyans by a court of Scottish judges and according to Scottish laws at The Hague International Court, but this compromise was turned down by the British side. On the whole, the Libyan leadership holds that the two Libyan citizens, whose crime has not been proved, are merely suspects, not even defendants. Hence, the demand for their extradition is legally ungrounded. "We decided to put off the case indefinitely, because we have exhausted all our arsenal of reasonable proposals and are now looking forward to constructive steps from the other side," Sha'ban said. The Arab League, the African Unity Organisation, and the Islamic Conference Organisation, accounting for the majority of the U.N. membership, have condemned the U.N. sanctions against Libya, imposed on Western insistence." Asked by ITAR-TASS to describe the current state of Libyan-Russian relations, the ambassador noted that, in his opinion, the U.N. Security Council Resolution 748 of May 31, 1989, imposing international economic sanctions on Libya, was primarily intended to cause material and moral damage to Tripoli. Moreover, it was a deliberate blow, inflicted by the masterminds of the resolution on Libyan-Soviet relations, and on relations between Libya and the USSR's successor -- Russia. "The carefully worded boycott resolution," he said, "is spearheaded against the delivery to my country of armaments and other military hardware, which mostly came from Moscow. The embargo on air traffic was also mainly directed against Russia, with which we were then conducting talks on the improvement of air carriages. At the same time, the oil, which is being used by the West, remained outside the embargo. As a result, the damage caused to Libya and Russia amounted to several billion U.S. dollars. The treaties, agreements and contracts are to expire in all the spheres they cover only in 1997, but they have already been suspended, just as payments for Russian services in the sphere of economic deliveries, personnel training, maintenance of technical facilities, including military installations. In other words, the process of cooperation between the two countries was suspended. The ambassador refused to give the exact figures of this cooperation, but, according to information received by ITAR-TASS from other sources, Tripoli's debt to Moscow totalled 21 billion U.S. dollars in the period from 1970 until today. Approximately 18 billions have already been paid. In conclusion, Sha'ban expressed regret that Russia was voting in the U.N. Security Council for further sanctions against Libya. At the same time, he expressed satisfaction with the fact that Moscow was lately trying to mediate between Tripoli and the other parties to the conflict, but so far its initiatives have not evoked any response from the West.
