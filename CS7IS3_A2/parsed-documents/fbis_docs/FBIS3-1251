The mood was tense. Some of the strikers have apparently been sent to King William's Town to monitor the arrival of the SAP [South African Police] and then to race back to give their colleagues advance warning. Earlier a spokesman for the strikers, Sgt S G Hewana, said they would "talk" to the South Africans. "The police will come and talk to us and we will tell them why we are here and they will listen to us." He said the strikers were holding 15 officers hostage including three brigadiers, two colonels and two captains. The strikers are also holding hostage the wives of several officers who they have been unable to locate. Sgt Hewana said the strikers had no grievance against Brig Gqozo but "we want our grievances to be solved." Earlier strikers released a list of demands which included pension payouts before March 28 and leave gratuities to be handed over to all Ciskei police force members not later than March 24. All officers in the force allegedly involved in corruption should be immediately suspended, they said. These officers should not be released until the Ciskei attorney general decided whether or not to prosecute them. A spokesman for the strikers said colleagues had been sent to fetch Police Commissioner Maj-Gen M Noqayi, also suspected by the strikers of corruption. The police commissioner was reportedly seeking refuge at Ciskei leader Brig Gqozo's state house. The strikers said he would be arrested when he was found.
