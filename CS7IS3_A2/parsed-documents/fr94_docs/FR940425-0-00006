FR940425-0-00006 FR940425-0-00004 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ASW&hyph;31] Alteration of Jet Route J&hyph;142 AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: This document contains a correction to the final rule published on February 18, 1994, which removed a segment of Jet Route J&hyph;142 between San Simon, AZ, and Socorro, NM. Inadvertently, the segment between Socorro, NM, to Anton Chico, NM, was removed. This action corrects Jet Route J&hyph;142, reflecting the FAA's original intent to remove only the segment from San Simon to Socorro. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., April 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Norman W. Thomas, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9250. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 18, 1994, the FAA published a final rule that removed a segment of Jet Route J&hyph;142 (59 FR 8131) between San Simon, AZ, and Socorro, NM. However, that action inadvertently removed the jet route segment from Socorro, NM, to Anton Chico, NM. This action corrects that mistake by restoring that segment of the route between Socorro, NM, and Anton Chico, NM, as part of the airspace designation for Jet␣Route␣J&hyph;142. Correction of Final Rule Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, the publication in the Federal Register on February 18, 1994 (59 FR 8131; Federal Register Document 94&hyph;3742) and the corresponding description in FAA Order 7400.9A, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1, are corrected as follows: §71.1 [Corrected] On page 8131, in the third column, the description for Jet Route J&hyph;142 is corrected to read as follows: J&hyph;142␣[Corrected] From Socorro, NM; Anton Chico, NM; to Borger, TX. Issued in Washington, DC, on April 13, 1994. Fred L. Gibbs, Acting Manager, Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division.
