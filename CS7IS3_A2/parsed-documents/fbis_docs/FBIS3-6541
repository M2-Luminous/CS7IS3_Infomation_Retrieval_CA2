"I have a feeling that the economy has already hit bottom," Toshiomi Uragami, chairman of the Life Insurance Association of Japan, told a regular monthly press conference. Some bright signs are seen in the latest macroeconomic statistics, and as for life insurers, new contracts have improved recently, he noted. But a "sharp" economic recovery is unlikely as corporate capital spending remains sluggish, he said. Against this backdrop, Japanese stock prices can be expected to "move even more firmly if clearer signs of a recovery are presented," said Uragami who heads the group which in effect combines the country's largest institutional investors. Uragami noted that stock prices are now hovering around 20,000 on the key Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, with buying led by foreign investors continuing on hopes of an economic upturn. Long-term rates are unlikely to continue rising and put a damper on the economy, Uragami said. "Seen as a long-term rate, 4 percent is not a level to worry about." The yield on the benchmark government bond rose over the past two months to briefly touch the 4 percent level for the first time since the Bank of Japan last cut its discount rate in September. Market dealers attributed the rise to hopes of an economic recovery and concerns over a market glut with the government boosting its bond issuance. The bond yield recently gained stability to move below 4 percent, but Japanese banks are to raise their long-term prime lending rates to more than 4 percent in April.
