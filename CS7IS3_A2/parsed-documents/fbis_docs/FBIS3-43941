"We are not going to accept this demand, but we are prepared to discuss with you a solution. I would like you to support this to save our country from unnecessary bloodshed. We must try and avoid that," he told a "people's forum" at the SA Broadcasting Corporation's Johannesburg head office, called to address broadcast employees' concerns. As opinion polls predicted a landslide victory by the ANC in the April 27 election, the ANC president acknowledged the ability of the ultra-rightwing to derail a future government. He said the ultra- right had significant support in the public service, army, police and sympathisers in important and strategic installations. "They can derail any democratic government in this country," he said, but added: "It does not mean that we are cowards. We will deal with that." South Africa was facing the Angolan and Mozambican scenario, where civil wars that began at independence had raged for at least 16 years, Mr Mandela told scores of SABC employees. "We are facing that situation," Mr Mandela said about the two countries where warring sides are now seeking a negotiated settlement. While signalling further concessions to the rightwing groups pressing for a separate state, the ANC leader said it was ironic their demand was surfacing on the brink of black majority rule. "All the time they were happy to rule us. Now that the challenge is from blacks, they want a separate state. We will not concede," he said. Without actually mentioned the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], Mr Mandela said blacks boycotting the elections were scared of democracy and were hankering for white minority rule. "What they are saying is that: 'We don't want liberation, we don't want to be free. We want to continue to be under the rule of the white minority,'" he said. The IFP Central Committee has announced the party will not contest the election until its demand for self- determination is granted. A national conference later this month will take a final decision. Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] leader Gen Constand Viljoen said on Wednesday "limited violence" could be used to support the demand for an Afrikaner state and King Goodwill Zwelithini said on Monday Zulus would resist threats to the Zulu nation posed by the new constitution. Reacting to questions on affirmative action in the SABC, Mr Mandela said the ANC would redress the situation where currently 75 percent of staff at the corporation were whites. "This is a situation we can't tolerate. The problem of affirmative action is one we must undertake. To fail to do so will be a betrayal to all our predecessors who have sacrificed in order to ensure that the day of liberation should come." But Mr Mandela also expressed concern about white skilled staff leaving because of the changing situation in the country. "You must remain and fight with us," he said.
