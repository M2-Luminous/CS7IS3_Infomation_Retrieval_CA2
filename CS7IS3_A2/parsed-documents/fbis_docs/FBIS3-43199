Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-19JAN94-NORTH KOREA Conservative Resistance Apparent in New Labor Regulations SUMMARY A set of labor regulations Pyongyang has recently decreed provides for the pervasive presence of North Korean bureaucrats in any special economic zones on North Korean territory, for the ostensible purpose of protecting North Korean workers from potential foreign exploitation. The new regulations seem designed more to address conservative misgivings about such zones than to attract foreign businesses and could even serve to discourage foreign investment in North Korea. END SUMMARY The regulations, decreed on 30 December and carried in full by the North Korean news agency KCNA on II January, give what amounts to supervisory powers over "foreign funded enterprises" to North Korean government organs and "trade unions." Under the regulations, foreign-funded enterprises--joint-ventures and foreign-owned establishments--which would presumably operate in the Tumen free trade zone now under construction, will be subject to the following controls: + Foreigners may be employed only with Pyongyang's approval. + North Koreans must be hired under the supervision of the local "labor administration" to assure that they are hired through local "labor service agencies" and that "primary attention" is paid to securing "safe, cultural, and hygienic" working conditions in order to "protect and promote" workers' "lives and health." In this regard, foreign enterprises are required to "organize and operate nurseries and kindergartens." They "can" also run "sanatoriums and holiday homes," sponsor "mass culture and sports" activities, and fund unspecified welfare facilities- -all in addition to providing workers with "labor protection tools, working necessities, and nutritious food." + North Korean workers may not be dismissed without a month's notice and approval by "trade unions "--over which the regime presumably exercises some control--and by the local labor service agency, and under the penalty of fines. Conservative Voice The regulations seem primarily designed to mollify conservatives whose ostensible concern about the specter of foreign exploitation of North Korean yorkers have been indirectly raised in North Korean media. Signs that some in the North Korean leadership continue to harbor misgivings about special economic zones surfaced publicly three days after the KCNA announcement of the new labor regulations. In a commentary criticizing ROK President Kim Yong-sam's economic policies, Pyongyang radio on 14 January ridiculed the South Korean economy as consisting of "the vulnerable colonial subjugated economy" capable only of "bonded processing trade with others' capital, technology, facilities, and materials"--precisely the type of arrangement that the Tumen basin project is aimed at. 1 See the Trends of 28 October 1992, pages 31-34. Implications While it is possible that those in the DPRK leadership pressing for foreign capital investment have overestimated the attractiveness of North Korea's cheap labor, it is more likely that they found that the stringently restrictive provisions were the only way to enlist the conservatives to go along with the special economic zone plan. Either way, the new labor regulations may discourage foreign enterprises from investing in North Korea even after the nuclear issue is resolved. (AUTHOR: YIM.
