FR941031-2-00023 FR941031-2-00019 Applications for Duty-Free Entry of Scientific Instruments Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;651; 80 Stat. 897; 15 CFR part 301), we invite comments on the question of whether instruments of equivalent scientific value, for the purposes for which the instruments shown below are intended to be used, are being manufactured in the United States. Comments must comply with 15 CFR 301.5(a)(3) and (4) of the regulations and be filed within 20 days with the Statutory Import Programs Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. Applications may be examined between 8:30 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. in Room 4211, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. Docket Number: 94&hyph;121. Applicant: University of Massachusetts Medical School, 55 Lake Avenue North, Worcester, MA 01655. Instrument: Electron Microscope, Model CM 120. Manufacturer: Philips, The Netherlands. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for studies of the high resolution molecular structure of muscle filaments, hemoglobin crystals, coated vesicles, and DNA-binding proteins. The experiments conducted will include cryo observations of the above molecules in the frozen-hydrated state. Electron micrographs recorded from these specimens will be subjected to computer assisted image analysis in order to extract the maximum information on each molecule. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: October 4, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;122. Applicant: Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, 4301 Jones Bridge Road, Bethesda, MD 20814-4799. Instrument: Electron Microscope with Accessories, Model CM100. Manufacturer: Philips, The Netherlands. Intended Use: The instrument will be used for studies of animal and human tissues, viruses, DNA, microorganisms, biomolecules, etc. during medical research. In addition, the instrument will be used for educational objectives to prepare investigators to use it as a research tool. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: October 5, 1994. Docket Number: 94&hyph;123. Applicant: San Diego State University, Department of Chemistry, 5300 Campanile Drive, San Diego, CA 92182. Instrument: MicroVolume Stopped-Flow Analyser, Model SX-17MV. Manufacturer: Applied Photophysics, United Kingdom. Intended Use: The instrument will be used to study the kinetic properties of a class of enzymes known as protein kinases. Rapid kinetic measurements of substrate phosphorylation by protein kinases will be obtained using fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. In addition, the instrument will be used for the education and training of graduate students interested in independent research under the advisory of a principal investigator. Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: October 11, 1994. Pamela Woods, Acting Director, Statutory Import Programs Staff.
