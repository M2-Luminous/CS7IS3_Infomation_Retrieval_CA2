The letter was handed over to Ulmanis by Russian Ambassador in Latvia Aleksandr Rannikh. A spokesman for the president's administration told Interfax that the letter says that now there is an opportunity, through a summit dialogue, to improve the relations between Latvia and Russia, to strengthen relations in the political, economic and social spheres. In the letter Yeltsin outlines his view on the present legal status of the Russian-speaking population in Latvia and assesses the recent round of the Russian-Latvian negotiations that completed in Jurmala last week. IF Note: Guntis Ulmanis planned to visit Moscow late in 1993 and postponed the visit several times. Early this year his visit did not take place either, though it was planned. The president said this took place partially owing to the incident of January 10 in Riga, when two Russian general were arrested and there were sharp statements against the Baltic countries and Latvia in particular from Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other Russian politicians.
