He claimed that "the influence of constructive forces in society now is greater than that of right- and left-wing radicals". In the speaker's opinion, it will become clear at the agreement's signing ceremony who and why does not sign the document leading to civil accord. The division of political forces into groups will be clearly seen at that time. However, if somebody does not sign the agreement, this will not split the society, since the document will be open for signing after April 28, he stressed. Asked about the influence of political forces in Russia's life, Shumeyko noted that "centrist parties have a prospect to become influential". This will take place when society will "outgrow an yearn for rallies". The speaker believes that the influence of political parties on Russia is now "purely nominal". In contrast to Moscow, many in provinces do not know what political parties mean and what their role is. People judge about them by actions of their leaders. Shumeyko claimed that the Russian president should not rely on a single party. He should be "above party movements and rely on the average derivative in order to find the only correct solution as head of state". The speaker noted that "if we are to judge about parties by factions in the lower chamber, it will be clear that the situation when communists block democrats' decisions and vice versa, persists". This leads to the centre's consolidation, Shumeyko underlined. True, he said with regret, "the centre is being formed not in favour of reforms".
