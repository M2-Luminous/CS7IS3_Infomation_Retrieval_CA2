That regime is accustomed to making such threats through its officials from time to time, which clearly reveals Iran's greed and ambitions for expansion and occupation. This tendency has always characterized its policy with the neighboring countries. Although the Iranian regime has tried several times to show moderation, flexibility, and a desire to establish relations of good neighborliness with the countries of the region, those attempts were, at best, no more than a bridge to cross, expand, and interfere in the internal affairs of those countries and to fulfill its sickening dreams and delusions to dominate the region and its affairs. Perhaps Rafsanjani's recent statements to maintain the occupation of Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa Islands and his declaration that any attempt to regain those islands will have to be through a sea of blood, truly express the Iranian regime's arrogant mentality and policy of belligerency and piracy. But the responsibility for this Iranian belligerency and piracy is born by the UAE and most of the other Gulf states for appeasing that regime and keeping silent about its interferences and terrorist acts. That unprincipled, compromising has contributed to Iranian expansionism and encouraged the Tehran regime to maintain its occupation of the three islands. By returning to the language of threats anew at a time when Tehran and other Iranian cities are witnessing protests, strikes, resistance operations, and deteriorating social, economic, and political conditions, the Iranian regime is trying to divert the Iranian people's attention from their worsening internal conditions. This is an old game which Iran also used during its aggression against Iraq. It is still playing this game in order to prolong the life of its crippled regime. By renewing its impudent threats and affirming its adherence to the tendencies of aggression and expansion and the same old dreams, the Iranian regime wants to hint that it can instill itself and its existence on the region. Yet, the reality confirms that regime's hollow claims, bankruptcy, and imminent collapse.
