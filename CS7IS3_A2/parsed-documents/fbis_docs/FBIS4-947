You. The time for casting blame is over. Now, more than ever, it is the responsibility of every person and every organisation -- including the ANC -- to ensure that we put an end to violence and get on with building a nation. Our plan for a better life for all gives hope because it puts people first. It will create jobs, give every child 10 years of free, quality education, and provide the homes and infrastructure our people and country need. The ANC wants you to feel secure in your rights. To feel free to express your views. To be secure in your homes. To be confident about the quality of education and the flourishing of your language and culture. Above all, the ANC wants every South African to know that all our children will have the opportunity to realise their God-given potential, secure in family life in a peaceful and thriving society. On April 27, use your vote to elect a government that is ready to take responsibility for the task ahead. Let our respect and concern for one another be the very thing that pulls us together, so that we can at last work together as one nation. Then we will surely realise our goal of a better life for all." A better life for all. Working together for jobs, peace and freedom.
