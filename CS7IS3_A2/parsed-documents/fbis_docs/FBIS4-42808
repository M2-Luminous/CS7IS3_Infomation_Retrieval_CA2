Yesterday, Monday, at a press conference Gehmacher said: "A negative result would be conceivable only if something important happens during the final stage" that would produce a protest against the government parties or a "profound influx of pessimism." As an example, he cited the collapse of a large company. The decisive thing is to what extent voters can be mobilized during the last days. If the turnout for the EU referendum is 85 percent, Gehmacher even expects 56 percent to vote for membership. Only if the turnout were 60 percent "would the result be very narrow." However, the sociologist thinks: "Such a low turnout is no longer very likely." According to the results obtained by Ifes, the ratio of those who are firmly determined to vote for or against EU membership is 31:31. However, among those who are still undecided, those who sympathize with EU membership are in the majority. This trend has developed over the past three weeks. The reason: The entire "establishment," from the church to the trade unions, advocates EU membership. "It has been possible to produce a climate of opinion that says one should vote for EU membership," Gehrmacher said at the press conference. Gehmacher stressed that the attitude toward the EU is primarily determined by whether or not economic trends in Austria over the next five years is seen positively. A total of 58 percent of the optimists are firmly determined to vote for membership. In contrast, 61 percent of the pessimists say that they will vote against EU membership at the referendum. According to this Ifes classification, those skeptical about the future are the largest group of the population -- 52 percent. A total of 45 percent of them are still uncertain. Mobilizing this group would result in a clear increase in yes votes, Gehmacher said.
