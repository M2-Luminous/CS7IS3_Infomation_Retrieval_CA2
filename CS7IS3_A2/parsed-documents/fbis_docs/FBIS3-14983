A nationwide poll, scheduled for 6 March, will mark the end of the dispute between the supporters of an independent Moldova and those who want it to join Romania. Hopes of a revival of the unity of the state, which for three years now has been "divorced" from two of its regions, the Dniester Region and the Gagauz south, are pinned on its results and on the results of the upcoming parliamentary elections. All the talks with these regions have ended in deadlock, foundering on the conditions that Chisinau must provide the regions with guarantees in the event of a change in Moldova's political status. [Gamova] Mr. President, we know that you do not like sudden movements. But your announcement of a nationwide poll was just such a step. Before it, unification with Romania was talked of as a reality, albeit more or less remote, but the poll and particularly your speech at the congress of citizens, "Our Home is the Republic of Moldova," rule out this possibility. Why did you decide to set out your positions so clearly? [Snegur] At the very beginning of the democratic transformations, following the 1990 elections, when I started work in the Moldovan parliament, I warned certain representatives of the People's Front that, as far as I was concerned, I would do my utmost to promote the land's prosperity, but I would not raise the question of unification with Romania. It is the first time I have said this, but that is what happened. In fact, in all the twists and turns of the state's development I have steered both partners and opponents onto a centrist path of solving problems. But recently the opposition set up a council for unification with Romania and started propagandizing this possibility and elevating it to the level of state policy. It was in order to ease the tension in society that I announced the "consultation with the people" -- our poll, which, incidentally, does not contradict the constitution. [Gamova] Does such an overt rejection of the idea of unification with Romania mean a reorientation exclusively toward the CIS? [Snegur] No. Incidentally, the "consultation with the people" includes a question relating to mutually advantageous links with all countries. We signed the agreement on the formation of an economic union and will sign all the other agreements deriving from this document. We established too many customs barriers, which disrupted links between the parts of what was once a single economic comnplex. As a result Moldova, like the other CIS countries, has suffered enormous losses. Unless all the documents ensuring the viability of the economic union are signed by the heads of state in the very near future we will be unable to escape from this situation and get back at least to the position we had attained a few years ago. Of course, we will also be seeking mutually advantageous links with Western countries. But it would be unwise to abandon the Eastern market, with which we have strong links. [Gamova] Might Moldova eventually join the ruble zone? [Snegur] There is no need for that. Calculations will certainly be made in relation to the ruble. But the Moldovan leu is doing pretty well. According to the IMF and the donor countries, Moldova is keeping pace with the Baltic countries in carrying out reforms. [Gamovas] Will the Moldovan leadership's current stance affect relations with Romania? [Snegur] A recent meeting of the two countries' interministerial commission in Bucharest summed up mutual economic relations and determined the paths of future development. The meeting took place after citizens at the "Our Common Home is the Republic of Moldova" congress in Chisinau had advocated the building of Moldova as an autonomous, independent state. There was no negative reaction on the part of the official authorities. [Gamova] But the Moldovan leadership's position and your own stance have come under heavy attack in the Romanian press.... [Snegur] But the attack was not at an official level, unless you consider the Romanian Academy of Sciences to be so. The political parties were negative by and large. But the opposition press in Moldova was even more vigorous and more abusive. Our path has been determined. And although the results of the poll have no legal force, they will provide the president with an argument for pursuing with parliament a policy supported by the people. [Gamova] But what if the People's Front, which is running under new party labels in the elections, gains a majority in parliament? The president will then lose his expected support... [Snegur] I am hoping for a reasonable majority in parliament. I think we will be able to form a viable new government too. But if things develop the way you suggest, it will be the will of the people. [Gamova] Will the new parliament be able to resolve the problem of the Dniester Region and the south of the republic? [Snegur] Yes, I think so. A draft law has been prepared on the status of the southern areas which have a high Gagauz population. It has been scrutinized at the Council of Europe and it suits the Gagauz themselves. The draft will be submitted for discussion at one of the first sittings of the new parliament. [Gamova] What can the Gagauz realistically expect? [Snegur] Autonomy within the republic -- something along the lines of an autonomous oblast with certain rights, with its own People's Assembly. The head of the entity's administration would be in the Moldovan government. As for the Dniester Region, we have a good basis for a dialogue on its future status -- the CSCE mission's report. Judging by President Yeltsin's letter, Russia also accepts these documents, as mediator in the settlement of the Dniester Region conflict. Russia's mediation mission began in July 1992, when Boris Yeltsin and I signed the ceasefire agreement. Some 18 months have now elapsed. During that time the joint peacemaking force monitoring the security zone has done a great deal to stabilize the situation. The agreement brokered by Russia and the CSCE on the legal status of the Dniester Region can then be implemented under the observation of guarantors, for example, the existing mechanism of the four -- Moldova, Russia, Ukraine, and Romania. We are prepared to distribute functions between the central and local authorities and grant maximum self-government, down to the creation of their own legislative assembly and their own emblems. The only conditions is that the region should be part of the Republic of Moldova with a common army and common constitution. [Gamova] Could Moldova have a federal structure? [Snegur] I do not think there will be any need for that. Particularly if we guarantee the region the right to self-determination in the event of a change of status by Moldova. The problem must be resolved, otherwise the deadlock will continue. [Gamova] Is agreement with the current Dniester Region leaders possible? [Snegur] It is difficult, but we will try. [Gamova] Final question: The 14th Army on the territory of Moldova. The negotiating process is under way, but there is much talk in the republic about the possibility of the creation of a Russian military base, using its facilities.... [Snegur] We insist on the continuation of negotiations on the withdrawal of the 14th Army from Moldova. I have not heard any other official view from the Russian side. It is merely a matter of the date. We are insisting on the middle of this summer. This has not been agreed so far.
