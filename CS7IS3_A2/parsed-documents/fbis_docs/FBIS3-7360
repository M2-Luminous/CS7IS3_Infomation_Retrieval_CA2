Meanwhile, the puppet Army held a "plenary meeting of staff officers" on March 26 and discussed the question of doing their utmost to maintain a posture for immediate entry into action". Such moves are unpardonable criminal acts leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of a war. All the developments cleary show that the South Korean bellicose elements do not want peace and peaceful reunification of the country but have used the North-South dialogue to gratify their sinister aim of putting the brakes on the DPRK-U.S. talks. The Kim Yong-sam group can by no means conceal the fact that it is an anti-national group blocking the dialogue between the fellow countrymen and trying to inflict the scourge of war upon the nation with the help of outside forces. The "civilian" warmaniacs must stop acting rashly, clearly mindful of what bitter results their war frenzy would bring to them.
