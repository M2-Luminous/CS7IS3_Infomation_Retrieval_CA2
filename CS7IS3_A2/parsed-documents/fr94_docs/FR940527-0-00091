DAC 91&hyph;6, Item XXXVIII The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. , applies but the magnitude of the expected impact on small entities as a result of the rule is unknown and impossible to estimate.

An amended IRFA will be submitted to reflect the latest changes in guidance as a result of the statutorily-imposed changes. D. Paperwork Reduction Act DAC 91&hyph;6, Items I, VIII, X&hyph;XIV, XVI, XVII, XIX&hyph;XXIII, XXV, XXVI, XXVIII, XXIX, XXXI&hyph;XXXV, XXXVII, XXXIX, XLI, XLII, L The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the revisions in this rulemaking notice do not contain and/or affect information collection requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. DAC 91&hyph;6, Item XV The Paperwork Reduction Act applies. OMB approved the paperwork collection requirement in section 219.71, Pilot Mentor-Protege Program, under clearance number 0704&hyph;0332, through January 31, 1995. OMB also approved the paperwork collection requirement in appendix I, Policy and Procedures for the DoD Pilot Mentor-Protege Program, under clearance number 0704&hyph;0338, through February 28, 1995. DAC 91&hyph;6, Item XXXVI The Paperwork Reduction Act applies. OMB has approved the information collection request for Item XXXVI under clearance 0704&hyph;0246, through December 13, 1996. Claudia L. Naugle, Deputy Director, Defense Acquisition Regulations Council. Defense Acquisition Circular (DAC) 91&hyph;6 amends the Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) 1991 edition, prescribes procedures to be followed, and provides informational interest items. The amendments, procedures, and information are summarized as follows: Item I_Distribution of Contracts This final rule amends DFARS section 204.201 to ensure that contract distribution is consistent with security regulations. Item II_Uniform Suspension and Debarment Procedures DFARS section 209.402 and appendix H are added to provide uniform suspension and debarment procedures that are to be followed by all DoD debarring and suspending officials. Item III_Made in America Labels This item revises and converts the interim rule published as Item VIII of DAC 91&hyph;5 to a final rule. The interim rule added DFARS sections 209.406&hyph;2 and 209.406&hyph;4 to require debarment consideration for anyone convicted of fraudulently affixing ``Made in America'' labels and to specify the period of debarment. This final rule deletes section 209.406&hyph;4, which specified the period of debarment because the statutory mandate to specify the period of debarment was not continued in the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act. Item IV_Elimination of Ozone-Depleting Substances. This finalizes the interim rule issued by Departmental Letter 93&hyph;005 on May 21, 1993. The interim rule added DFARS sections 207.105(b)(15) and 210.002&hyph;71 to implement section 326 of the Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Authorization Act. Section 326 places restrictions on the award and modification of contracts that require the use of ozone-depleting substances. The interim rule is converted to a final rule without change. Item V_Bills of Materials DFARS sections 210.001 and 210.011&hyph;70 are revised, and sections 210.070 and 252.210&hyph;7005 are deleted to remove unnecessary direction on contracting for bills of materials. In addition, DD Forms 346 and 347 are removed from part 253. Guidance on bills of materials can be found in DoDI section 4210.8, Department of Defense Bills of Materials, and MIL&hyph;STD&hyph;295, Preparation of Bills of Materials. Item VI_SBIR Rights in Data Alternate II of the clause at section 252.227&hyph;7013, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software, is revised at paragraphs (b) and (c) to clarify the allocation of rights in technical data and computer software acquired under the Small Business Innovation Research Program. Item VII_Adequate Price Competition DFARS section 215.804&hyph;3 is revised to clarify guidance on adequate price competition in dual source acquisitions.
