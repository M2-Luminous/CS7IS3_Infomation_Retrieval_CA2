Mr. Yakunin and Mr. Ponomarev Still Have a Grudge Against Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gaydar"] [Text] A meeting of the heads of regional branches of the "Democratic Russia" movement was held on 21 and 22 May. Taking part in it were 100 delegates representing 40 regional "Democratic Russia" organization. Leaders of the "Democratic Russia" regional branches who voiced the intention to join "Russia's Choice" were not invited to the meeting. Those present held a discussion on the political situation in Russia and the situation in the democratic movement. They also discussed questions pertaining to forming, on the basis of the "Democratic Russia" movement, a party of the same name. After long debates, some 30 heads of regional branches thought it necessary to sign a manifesto, "Our Principles," thus automatically becoming members of the organizing committee of a Federal Party of "Democratic Russia" (FPDR). Its founding conference is not scheduled until this fall. "Democratic Russia" leader Lev Ponomarev, who became chairman of the new party's organizing committee, thought it necessary to point out that the democratic movement is going through a crisis, while "the reforms have backfired, the president's will is absent, the president has become fenced off from democratic structures." In Mr. Ponomarev's opinion, the current problems experienced by the democratic movement have been caused by actions of the organizing committee of the emerging "Russia's Choice" party, in Lev Ponomarev's phrase, on the bones of the eponymous election bloc. Gleb Yakunin, Mr. Ponomarev's colleague and long-standing comrade-in-arms, accused the "Russia's Choice" leaders of having dealt a formidable blow at Russia's democratic movement. At the same time Mr. Yakunin predicted a swift downfall for "Gaydar's party," pointing to the fact that regional branches are leaving "Russia's Choice" while many leaders of the parliamentary faction are displeased with Yegor Gaydar's actions and "are contemplating possibly leaving the bloc." Besides, the cochairman of "Democratic Russia" leveled sharp criticism at President Yeltsin. "Shame on Boris Nikolayevich that he did not even give `Democratic Russia' any premises through these years, as neither did Sergey Filatov. This is the style of ingratitude," Mr. Yakunin complained. However, Mr. Ponomarev pointed out that he still continues to pin hopes on Boris Yeltsin alone. At the same time, yet another "Democratic Russia" chairman, Galina Starovoytova, who also spoke at the conference, thought it necessary to state: "With all respect for Boris Yeltsin, and despite his tremendous merits and a great historic contribution to the cause of the country's democratic development, is still politically on the way out."
