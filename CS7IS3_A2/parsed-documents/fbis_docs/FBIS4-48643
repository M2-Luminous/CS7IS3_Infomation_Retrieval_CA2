Addressing the PWV provincial legislature at Nasrec, near Soweto, she said all senior officers were white males but this would be rectified as soon as possible. Improving the image of the police, which she said had been the frontline of the National Party for the past 40 years, would require suggestions from the public. It would never be said again that policemen had searched a house without a warrant, sworn at the public or failed to respond to complaints. An advocate was investigating allegations police had tortured detainees in the Vaal Triangle. Police stations would be equipped to deal with women who had been sexually abused.
