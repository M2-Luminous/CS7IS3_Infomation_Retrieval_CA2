Vargas, a member of the government commission that signed the peace accords, reportedly said yesterday there are FMLN groups that have yet to be demobilized. "Vargas is misinformed," Ocampo said, adding "he (Vargas) was a witness" of the FMLN's total demobilization, which the United Nations has also affirmed. He recalled that the FMLN's structure was dismantled in August 1993 and that FMLN leaders rejected any responsibility for weapons found in the future. Ocampo said "everyone is protected by the law" now, and sanctions will be enforced against those who violate it. Referring to human rights supervision in El Salvador, he said "this is the most supervised country in the world as far as human rights are concerned," adding there are three operations underway: a permanent operation by the Onusal Human Rights Division, an independent observer, and one operation by the Human Rights Commission, which has its headquarters in Geneva. He said the human rights situation "has achieved extraordinary progress." Ocampo made those statements after signing as a witness the 12th gentlemen's pact signed by representatives of the political parties that participate in the electoral process.
