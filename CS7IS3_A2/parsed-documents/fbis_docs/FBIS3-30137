Ilagan] [Text] The right wing Young Officers Union (YOU) accused the government yesterday of insincerity and unpreparedness in the ongoing talks with the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa (RAM) [Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance], resulting in a deadlock in the peace negotiations. In a statement signed by Captain Magtanggol Santos, YOU spokesman, the group accused the government of resorting to propaganda tactics in discrediting the rebel movement. "Some people tend to believe or, in fact, delude themselves into believing, that we have agreed to participate in the peace process because, according to them, we are already a spent force, weak, marginalized, irrelevant, and needing only a graceful exit to save our face," Santos said. "This is self-serving government propaganda line. The fact is, we are now ahead and right at the center of our people's hearts and minds," he said. Since the signing of the preliminary cease fire agreement by the representatives of the government led by Defense Secretary Renato S. De Villa and the RAM last 23 December, the peace negotiations between the two parties "have not even reached a substantive portion of our talks because of the unpreparedness of the government to set up the grievance mechanism and seriously discuss the issues," he said. Government representatives in the peace talks with right wing rebels have called on the RAM-YOU leadership to return to the negotiating table for the resumption of the talks. In their message for the 8th anniversary celebration of the EDSA [Epifanio de los Santos Avenue] Revolution the YOU called on the leaders of the government and the civilian sector to reflect since the country is still suffering from economic and social difficulties. They also criticized the national leadership for its alleged failure to curb graft and corruption and lavish government expenditure. The YOU faction of the right wing group is believed to be composed of junior officers who took part in the failed December 1989 coup.
