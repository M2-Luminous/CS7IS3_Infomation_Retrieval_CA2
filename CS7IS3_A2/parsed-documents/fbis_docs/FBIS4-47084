An Open Letter to the Head of State of the Republic of Georgia"] [Text] The extremely harsh and hostile policy that has been conducted toward commercial structures lately compels us to write this open letter to you as the Head of State of the Republic of Georgia. At a time when the republic is experiencing an economic crisis, declining production, inflation, and a declining standard of living, there are certain state bodies which, through their unthinking actions, are further aggravating the situation. They are making decisions whose aim is to restrict the activity of commercial structures. This can hardly fail to cause concern among entrepreneurs, most of whom are trying to help the country improve the economic situation. Article 10 of the 25 July 1991 Republic of Georgia Law "On the Principles of Business Activity" states specifically that the entrepreneur shall be independent in his activity. State intervention in the entrepreneur's activity is not permitted except in cases stipulated by laws of the Republic of Georgia. The state is the guarantor of protection of the rights and lawful interests of entrepreneurs in Georgia. Unfortunately, things happen differently in practice. The entrepreneur is unfairly restricted in his commercial activity, but the state does not protect him. In particular, not only has the state failed to create the necessary elementary conditions for the normal existence and development of business activity, conditions such as communications, swift and reliable banking transactions, supplies of electricity, functioning transportation, protection against criminal elements, and so on, but in fact has, through frequent unlawful intervention by its official agencies, actually harmed entrepreneurs. On 26 March 1993, the National Bank of the Republic of Georgia made a decision which prohibits the sale of cash currency via cashless transaction. The Caucasian Stock Exchange, as a law-abiding organization, complied with the requirements of this document, but it appealed to the Republic of Georgia Parliament, Cabinet of Ministers, Procuracy, and other bodies to act to overturn the above-mentioned unlawful decision of the National Bank, because that decision only served the narrow interests of the National Bank and the personal interests of some of its official. Given the rate of hyperinflation, if the National Bank cannot guarantee swift cashless transactions and they take several banking days, sales and purchases of currency via cashless transaction make no sense at all. Add to this the fact that the National Bank prohibits the removal, for business needs, of any currency that winds up in a currency account via cashless transactions (it is permitted only for travel), and it is clear why entrepreneurs benefit from purchasing currency via cashless transactions while the National Bank benefits from prohibiting them. Again, add to this the fact that the volume of these transactions on the Caucasian Stock Exchange ran as high as several tens of millions of rubles and several tens of thousands of dollars as a result of legal trading, and it is clear that, after it was banned, the state budget and the Caucasian Stock Exchange lost the chance to earn considerable income. Unfortunately, the state has taken a year now to react to the considerable damage inflicted on itself and on business structures, damage which has been caused by the unlawful decision (No. 2/4, 26 March 1993) of the Board of the National Bank of the Republic of Georgia. Let us note that according to the Republic of Georgia General Procurator's 17 May 1993 Representation (No. 7-8 g-1993) on eliminating violations of laws regulating and licensing currency transactions, the aforementioned decision by the Board of the National Bank was ruled unlawful and was to be brought into compliance with the law within one month, but in vain. Batono Eduard! We appeal to you in the hope that measures will be taken and competent bodies will be ordered to study the issue in greater depth and resolve it on legal principles reflecting the republic's interests. We are confident that your intervention will produce positive results.
