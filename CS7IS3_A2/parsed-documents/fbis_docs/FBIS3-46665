The press statement by Comrade Pak Song-chol, member of the WPK Central Committee Political Bureau and vice president of the DPRK says: Our people--who embrace the historic New Year's address made by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song, the great sun of the nation and the lodestar of the fatherland's reunification, ringing in the hopeful New Year, 1994, with boundless gratitude and excitement--are filled with firm resolve and confidence to effect a new revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction and expedite the cause for reunifying the fatherland independently under the party's wise leadership in this year. In his New Year's address, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, summing up last year, noted that the officers and men of our heroic People's Army and all the people, in hearty response to the party's militant call, stood up as one man in the struggle to brilliantly adorn last year's Third Seven-Year Plan and to defend the country's sovereignty and revolutionary achievements with an unshakable confidence in victory and in soaring spirits, foiled the enemy's challenge and aggressive scheme and honorably safeguarded the dignity and security of their socialist fatherland. The great leader, in this year in which socialist construction enters a new stage of development, expounded the glorious tasks of consolidating and developing the achievements already made in the revolution and construction and achieving new and greater (?achievements) so as to further add luster to the popular masses-centered socialism of our own style. In particular, touching on our party and the Republic government's sincere efforts made in the last year to open a way for the fatherland's reunification with the nation's united strength, the great leader clarified our party's principled position as regards to the fatherland's reunification. Convinced that our party's principled position regarding the fatherland's reunification elucidated in the great leader's historic New Year's address is a programmatic guideline for breaking the deadlock lying in the way of the reunification and triumphantly accomplishing the cause for reunifying the fatherland with the nation's self-reliant force, I fervently support and welcome this. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: We must accomplish the cause of national reunification as soon as possible, so as to meet the unanimous, ardent desire of the entire nation and hand down the reunified country to our posterity. Our nation was not only forced to experience the tragedy of separation by outside forces but also could not fulfill our nation's ardent aspiration to reunify the fatherland up until now due to the outside forces' stubborn maneuvers aimed at obstruction. This shows that our country's reunification issue can only be resolved through our nation's own strength, rejecting the interference of outside forces, and that holding fast to the nation's principle of independence is a fundamental issue for the fatherland's reunification. Proceeding from this, we put forward a 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the fatherland last year and made all-out efforts to pave the road for reunification by means of unified strength and our nation's own strength. The 10-point program set forth by the great leader is an immortal banner of the national unity to transcend differences in ideology, ideals, and systems, and a great charter for the reunification of the fatherland, which embodies the noble desire of our 70 million compatriots to realize the reunification and prosperity of our nation with a long history of 5,000 years. We hoped the South Korean authorities would take the road of reconciliation and cooperation in response to our 10-point program of great national unity and, out of aspiration for national unity and reunification, we also took important steps for an exchange of top-level special envoys between the two sides. However, the South Korean authorities have clung to dependence on foreign forces, not national independence, and committed anti-national acts of further aggravating confrontation between the North and South, not national unity, by ignoring our magnanimous proposal and the desire of the entire nation for reunification. They have staged successive large-scale military exercises against our Republic frequently in collusion with foreign forces and have committed anti-republic maneuvers more viciously than their predecessors by clamoring for military countermeasures and an international cooperation system based on the pretext of our nonexistent nuclear issue. Worse still, they suspended the North-South dialogues and exchanges, which had been pushed ahead even by the Fifth and Sixth Republics, and brutally suspended the patriotic forces for reunification. Last year, the new rulers of South Korea came out with a so-called step-by-step reunification [tangyejok tongil], which already had been at the nation's center of criticism, made the North-South relations retreat, and darkened the prospect for the reunification of the fatherland. The current South Korean rulers, through their acts, clearly disclosed that the so-called civilian regime is only a disguise; in fact it does not differ from the successive military dictatorial regimes. Even though the current South Korean ruler loudly advertised civilian politics and reform policies, the National Security Law, the evil anti-communist fascist laws, and the Agency for National Security Planning and the Defense of Security command, which are suppressive agencies, still remain intact in South Korea. Due to the fascist politics dominated by public security, none of the desires of the South Korean people for independence, democracy, and national reunification has been fulfilled. It is very natural that the South Korean people and figures in various classes and strata are waging an antigovernment struggle today, saying there is no need to further watch the current regime, and expect nothing from it. Regarding our nuclear issue that the United States and its followers are talking about, the great leader taught in his New Year's address that the issue is a product of the antisocialist, anti-republic maneuver that the United States pursues persistently. As the respected and beloved leader taught, it was the United States that raised the suspicion of nonexistent nuclear development of the North, and it is also the United States that threatens us after actually drawing nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. Accordingly, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula should be resolved peacefully through negotiations between the offender, who poses the nuclear threat, and its victim, in other words, between our Republic and the United States. Any pressure or threat will not work on us. To adhere to such a method cannot resolve the issue, but will only bring the grave result of driving the situation into a catastrophe [paguk]. The United States should take a good look at all the facts and act discreetly. Under the condition that the DPRK-U.S. joint declaration has been signed, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula will be resolved fairly if both sides abide by and implement the principles agreed upon. In his New Year's address, the great leader stressed that our Republic's principle and line for the fatherland's reunification never changes, and made it clear that we will make every effort to achieve the reunification of the country in a way of a confederal system based on one nation, one country, two systems, and two governments, according to the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification, and the great national unity. This principled position clarified by the great leader clearly expresses the firm will of our party and the government of the Republic to hasten the independent and peaceful reunification of the country in accordance with all the people's desire and intent, no matter how the situation develops. As the great leader elucidated in his New Year's address, the principled position of our party and the government of the Republic regarding the fatherland's reunification, a brilliant road has indeed opened for us to vigorously accelerate the cause of the fatherland's reunification by overcoming difficulties in the course of reunification. Our party and the government of the Republic will make every effort to realize the cause of fatherland's reunification in the nineties under the banner of the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the fatherland presented by the great leader. It is the destiny of the fatherland, the nation, and all our people at home and abroad. I fervently appeal to the 70 million compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas, who love the country and the nation, to launch vigorously into the nationwide struggle to realize the fatherland's reunification based on the confederal system, firmly united as one under the banner of the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the fatherland and upholding the policy on the fatherland's reunification that the great leader elucidated in his New Year's address. I also expect the progressive people of the world, who value justice and peace, to completely support and encourage the Korean people's struggle for the country's reunification.
