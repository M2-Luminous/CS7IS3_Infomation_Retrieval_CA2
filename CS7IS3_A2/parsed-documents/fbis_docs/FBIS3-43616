To begin with, the Foreign Affairs Ministry will seek to increase even further its diplomatic work in Africa and other parts of the world and indications are that there are good prospects for success. [Begin Moura recording] Within that context, many meetings are planned for Africa and other parts of the world. It is worth noting that the OAU has some scheduled meetings, beginning with one in February. There are also some planned visits by foreign affairs ministers expected to visit us this year. We have the summit of the heads of state of the Lusophone African, PALOP, countries, preceded by a meeting of PALOP foreign ministers. We have a meeting of our ambassadors, at which I am sure we will be discussing issues pertaining to management, competence, and the commitment of all to their diplomatic duties, which they must discharge in an increasingly responsible manner. The peace process must be defended, as must be the interests and the property of the Angolan State. Abroad, we must seek to project a dignified image of Angola. All those will be issues to be discussed at that meeting, which is scheduled to take place this year. We believe that this year is decisive for us to show greater commitment on all fronts and a greater dedication to the national cause so that peace can become our principal objective as early as possible this year. [end recording] The People's Television of Angolan also asked Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura to comment on a problem that has prompted a protest by the Angolan Embassy in Lisbon. The Angolan foreign minister noted that there is the need for great understanding for the benefit of relations between the two countries. [Begin Moura recording] It is not the first time that this happens. We have been receiving reports and we have been using the most appropriate channels to urge the Portuguese authorities to behave in a manner compatible with this kind of situation, considering that we share historic and privileged relations and that there are norms to be followed in relations between two sovereign states, notably with regard to reciprocity and mutual advantages. We have tried to attend to Portuguese citizens whose presence in Angola is often irregular, so we would not like our compatriots and, in particular, Angolan citizens who are senior government officials and their families to be expelled or humiliated because of the poor understanding -- I think it has to do with poor understanding -- and sometimes even the subjective approach of some functionaries in the Portuguese Immigration and Border Services Department. Those people enjoy immunities and privileges. Our consulate has also made some contacts in a bid to request greater understanding on the part of the Portuguese authorities and to ask for measures to be taken to prevent similar situations arising again. Should our requests not be heeded, obviously we shall have to start considering the implementation of one of the principles listed in the Geneva Convention and which have to do with reciprocity.
