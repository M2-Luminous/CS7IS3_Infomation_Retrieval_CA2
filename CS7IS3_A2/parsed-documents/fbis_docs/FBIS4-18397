He was very concerned about North Korea's continuing refusal to meet its obligations under the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Kinkel told the daily newspaper DIE WELT (Tuesday [5 April] edition). Any state's violation of the treaty was a serious danger to world peace. As a state which had renounced the production of ABC [atomic, biological, chemical] weapons under international law, Germany supported the nonproliferation of all weapons of mass destruction. In this connection, Kinkel referred to his suggestion of a worldwide cooperative policy of nonproliferation of 15 December 1993. Kinkel said that he strongly supported the unlimited extension of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which was due for renewal in 1995.
