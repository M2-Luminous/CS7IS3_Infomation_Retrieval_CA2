Directly after the withdrawal of weapons from around Sarajevo became a fact and the threat of bloodshed receded, a pleasant scuffle began round the victory cake in various capitals. The United States was still only just waking up when the mass media were broadcasting the news of exultation in Moscow over the "victory of Russian diplomacy." A little later a report arrived from Prague, where, according to agency reports, Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev said that he sees no direct link between "our actions and the NATO ultimatum," and television repeatedly showed special envoy V. Churkin asserting that it was President Yeltsin's personal participation that was the key to the fact that the withdrawal of Serbian artillery passed off peacefully. The United States had Monday off. It was Presidents Day, George Washington's Birthday. In view of the national holiday Clinton's team allowed itself a very small indulgence: to assemble a little later than usual at the White House -- 0900 hours rather than 0730. After the meeting with his staffers B. Clinton held a press conference. He was far from making any hints at revenge. On the contrary, he thanked his European allies, who, he said, unlike the United States, have many servicemen stationed in the combat zones of Yugoslavia, whose lives are under constant threat. The U.S. President confidently rejected the idea of Russia's decisive contribution to the bloodless withdrawal of artillery from around Sarajevo. He again stressed that the desired result had been achieved thanks to NATO's decisiveness. One of the most important points in the President's press conference was that, during the tense days and hours when the ultimatum deadline was moving closer and the threat of air strikes becoming increasingly real, the mechanism of consultations with Russia operated smoothly -- both at the presidential level, and between the leading officials of either country: foreign and defense ministers and UN representatives. However, the victory rhetoric, fully justified as it is in the context of the complex internal political situation in the United States, and especially in Russia, has its own inertia. Beyond certain limits it could grow into a danger for the still fragile cooperation between the countries which has no deep traditions. Hence the United States has deemed it necessary urgently to invite Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev for consultations in Washington. He is expected to arrive on Saturday [26 February].
