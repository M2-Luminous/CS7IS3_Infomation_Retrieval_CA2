Hideaki Kumano, vice minister at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), was referring to an accord on industrial cooperation between the two countries for increased foreign access to the Japanese semiconductor market. The agreement was reached during a two-day regular meeting in Hawaii that ended Wednesday. Japan agreed to a U.S. request for Tokyo's efforts to help expand use of U.S.-made microchips by Japan's automobile, telecommunications and game equipment sectors. The Japanese Government is prepared to encourage these industrial sectors to step up purchases of U.S. semiconductors, Kumano told a press conference. But he added that does not represent "any government guarantee" that the foreign share of Japan's market will stay above the benchmark 20 percent. Kumano noted that the government does not ensure any results on ongoing voluntary efforts within the auto industry to expand purchases of U.S.-made auto parts and automobiles. "It is impossible for the government to ensure results regarding private-sector matters," he said. On Japan's restraints on car exports to the U.S., Kumano said MITI has yet to decide if it will extend the practice for fiscal 1994 starting in April. U.S. officials have said there is no need for Japan to continue the restraints.
