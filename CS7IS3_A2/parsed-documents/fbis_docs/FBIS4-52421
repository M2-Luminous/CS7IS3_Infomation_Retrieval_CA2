Addressing the party, Secretary of the C.C., the WPK Hwang Chang-yop highly appreciated the Communist Party of India (Marxist) that is positively striving for the freedom and emancipation of the Indian people, the peace and security of Asia and the rest of the world and the cause of socialism, and expressed firm solidarity for it. "The current situation makes it incumbent upon the communist and workers' parties to strengthen the bonds of international solidarity and collectively confront the anti-socialist offensives of the imperialists," he said, adding "the Workers' Party of Korea will, in the future, too, direct positive efforts to strengthening and developing the bonds of friendship and solidarity with the Communist Party of India (Marxist)". Head of the delegation Jyoti Basu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and prime minister of the West Bengal State, spoke at the party. Noting Korea, a bulwalk of socialism, is the beacon of the world working class, he highly estimated the remarkable success achieved by the Korean people in the socialist construction under the guidance of respected Comrade Kim Il-song, the leader of the world communist movement, and the Workers' Party of Korea. Pointing out that the Korean people are advancing under the uplifted banner of the chuche idea, he said: Under the leadership of respected Comrade Kim Il-song and dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, the Korean people are thoroughly applying the principle of independence in politics, self-supporting in economy and self-reliance in defence. Friendly and fraternal relations are existing between the Workers' Party of Korea and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the party members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) are in high spirit over the socialism of Korea that is making a stride forward. The spearhead of aggression of imperialism is now directed to socialism, he said, noting any moves of the U.S. imperialists can not bring the valiant revolutionaries of Korea to their knees. He denounced the U.S. imperialists' unjustifiable pressure upon the Korean people with the fabrication of the "nuclear issue" and expressed solidarity for the Korean people's struggle, stressing that no one can check the advancement of people towards socialism.
