The first point on the agenda was the appointment of the Debate Commission--which later presided over the first plenary session--headed by Deputy Walter Rene Araujo, of the progovernment Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA, rightist). Former guerrilla Commander Ana Guadalupe Martinez, of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), and labor leader Rosa Melida Villatoro, a deputy of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), were appointed commission secretaries. Ana Guadalupe Martinez, who with 20 other FMLN representatives form the second largest legislative force, read the roster of 84 deputies who make up the parliament. Following this ceremony, Walter Araujo announced a one-hour recess so that the Debate Commission can receive the credentials of deputies and vote later to elect the board of directors.
