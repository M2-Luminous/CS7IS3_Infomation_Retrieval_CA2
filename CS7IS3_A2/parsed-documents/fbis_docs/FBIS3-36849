This will enable geological prospecting and mining enterprises to retain tens of millions of rubles that they can use to revive the local minerals industry and to help alleviate social difficulties for the work forces of the Solnechnyy mining and enrichment combine, the Uralskoye mine administration, and a number of prospecting cooperatives. The Amur gold mining cooperative has already, with the consent of the tax inspectorate, put funds into stabilizing the financial position of the Ayano-Mayskiy mining and geology enterprise. Reductions in funding from the federal budget have halted all prospecting work and all growth in exploitation of known natural resources in the kray. Extra funds promised by the Russian Federation Government to stabilize the industry have not been allocated this year.
