Anhui deputation head Meng Fulin introduced Qiao Shi to other responsible persons of the deputation as well as worker, peasant, and intellectual deputies. Qiao Shi cordially shook their hands, nodding to and smiling at them in greeting. Cameras never stopped clicking in the well-illuminated conference room, capturing this memorable moment on film. The deputies vied with one another to brief Qiao Shi on the various work achievements in Anhui last year. Meng Fulin said: Last year saw the Anhui economy growing at the fastest pace and in the best manner since reform and opening up to the outside world. Qiao Shi asked with concern: How large was the share of village and town enterprises? Fu Xishou answered: They accounted for one third of the province's gross national product, turning out a total output of 36 billion yuan in 1991, 58 billion yuan in 1992, and 110 billion yuan in 1993. Comrade Qiao Shi has all along concerned himself with Anhui's development. In 1990 and 1991, he inspected Anhui several times and gave work directions. Some deputies still have fresh memory of these. Deputy (Fang Yiben), mayor of Huaibei, said: The chairman called on the vast number of workers and staff members at the Huaibei Yanggang Coal Mine in 1991, giving them much inspiration. At that time the mine was still running at a loss. However, since coal prices were decontrolled in 1993, it has returned to the black. On hearing this, Qiao Shi repeatedly said: "Good!" He added: I talked with model and advanced workers at the mine. I still remember this. While Meng Fulin was briefing Qiao Shi on Anhui's strategy of "one line, two points" for opening up to the outside world, a deputy from Wuhu chimed in, saying: Chairman, do you still remember the Wuhu Economic and Technological Development Zone? Qiao Shi laughed and said: I won't forget, I won't forget! His remarks provoked a hearty burst of laughter in the room. As the clock ticked away the time, Qiao Shi finally stood up and said goodbye to the deputies. A woman deputy requested the chairman pose for a group photograph with all women deputies present. Qiao Shi gladly granted their wish. Soon afterwards he went to the lobby on the ground floor to pose for a group photo with all members of the Anhui deputation as well as hotel workers.
