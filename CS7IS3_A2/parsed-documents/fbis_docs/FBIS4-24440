Addressing the gathering for the first publication of the book "Wan Li's talks on city construction", Li, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said faults are likely to emerge with the fast growth of the economy and the speeding up of city construction. The book, made up of 48 talks on city construction by China's former Minister of Construction Wan Li, was praised by Li as a "summary of lessons and experiences of China's 40 years of city construction." Li cited the publication of the book as "a great event", saying that all leaders in charge of city construction should read it in earnest. He said that there are some leaders who know little about city construction and never listen to other's criticisms with an open mind. He pointed out that in some cities, many high buildings are arranged inappropriately, too much outside decoration is used on high buildings, the colors of some buildings are not in harmony, and the green areas are scrappy and scattered. "Some faults in city construction can not be redressed until long after the fact, if ever," Li warned. He called on city leaders and managers summing up historical experience and prudently handling various issues in city construction. China had more than 570 cities by 1993, with 32 extra-large cities each with a population of over one million, 36 big cities each with a population of 500,000 to one million, 161 middle-sized cities with 200,000 to 500,000 people, and 341 small cities with a population of no more than 200,000.
