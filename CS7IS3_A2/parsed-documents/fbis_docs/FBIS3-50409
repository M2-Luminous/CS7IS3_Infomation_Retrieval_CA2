The letter consists of five points, and its authors address the letter's addressees as "Esteemed Mr., Esteemed Mrs.," from which it is easy to infer that each gentleman and each lady of this respected institution will find his own copy on his or her desk. If only our respected Ministry of Foreign Affairs acted as promptly! "Representatives of the Slovak Republic (who is meant by that?--R.K.) and the Slovak Parliament pledged to develop and implement their policy vis-a-vis minorities in accordance with CE Recommendation Number 1,201," the signatories of the letter state, and deplore that this has not happened. Messrs. Duray and Bugar announce with "deep regret" that in December 1993 the Slovak Parliament "approved Resolution Number 309, thereby abolishing its Resolution Number 225 of June 1993, in which it pledged to proceed in its policy toward the minorities from the principles of CE Recommendation Number 1,201." Thanks be to God that this happened because, as each citizen of the Slovak Republic who is at least a bit conversant with the matter knows, the notorious Recommendation Number 1,201 was only a working draft that has meanwhile been "withdrawn from circulation." The letter from Coexistence and the MKDH rejects the National Council of the Slovak Republic law on the use of Christian names and surnames, which supposedly "orders the declension of female surnames according to the Slovak grammar," protests against the division of the "compact Hungarian community in southern Slovakia" according to the territorial and administrative setup now under preparation, demands that "Hungarian towns be given their historical names" (that is, names Magyarized by force in the years of the most brutal oppression of Slovaks--R.K.), and protests against the possibility of "alternative education" at schools with Hungarian as the language of instruction "at the order of a few parents" (!). On the other hand, the letter observes that "90 percent of Hungarians speak fluent Slovak," which raises the question why and through whose endeavor we come across the words "nem irtem," [Hungarian for "I do not understand"), spoken with a smile on the face, daily in shops and other institutions in southern Slovakia. The authors of the letter refer to the Komarno protest of 8 January 1994, which, along with the five points raised, supposedly testifies to the unacceptability of Slovak Government policy "for the minorities (Messrs. Duray and Bugar suddenly speak in the name of all minorities?--R.K.), which consider this to be a restriction of their right to self-determination." This single sentence reveals it all! The right to self-determination, which is a collective right, belongs to nations and not to ethnic minorities--that is, not even to the one, about which the writers of the letter to the CE are concerned. They, too, know this very well. Still, they keep writing.... Let them write. It seems that Europe, including its Council, has at long last begun to see who seeks coexistence and who is after confrontation and destabilization in Central Europe.
