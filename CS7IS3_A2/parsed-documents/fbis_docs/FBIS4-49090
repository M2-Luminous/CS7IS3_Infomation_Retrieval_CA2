The following is a report filed by station reporter (Yao Shukun) from the meeting place yesterday. [Begin recording] [Yao] Concentrated population, congested buildings, heavy traffic, limited land, and environmental pollution are problems that have become more and more conspicuous in urban modernization construction. What will we do with an international, large city like Shanghai, where the highest population density has exceeded 160,000 people per sq km, with a mere 2 sq-meter per capita road space, which is one-fourteenth and one-fifth of that of London and Tokyo? Lt. Gen. Gu Hui said going underground would be an effective way out. [Gu] In light of the development of China's urban modernization construction, developing and utilizing underground space also has become an inevitable trend. Based on the principle of dual use for peace and war time, upgrading and constructing people's air defense works and shifting certain ground facilities underground are important features in developing and utilizing underground space. [Yao] It has been learned that people's air defense projects that have been developed by and put into use in Shanghai -- including warehouses, workshops, markets, hospitals, hotels, activity rooms, and cultural and entertainment centers -- have saved the use of city land, activated the market economy, facilitated the people's work and lives, and initially demonstrated the fine prospects of opening up underground space. Lt. Gen. Gu Hui pointed out that the construction of people's air defense should be enhanced to a new level. [Gu] Time has proved that investment in the people's air defense construction is not an unworthy consumption; the efficiencies and benefits it generates and the wealth it created for the state have far exceeded its input. Hence, we, the leadership at various levels, including comrades engaged in people's air defense work, should fully understand its value and strengthen propaganda education for all sectors of society to seek all-level consensus -- a bid to create a fine social opinion and environment to guarantee continuance of the people's air defense construction for a long time.
