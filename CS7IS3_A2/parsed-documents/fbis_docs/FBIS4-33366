Ruiz Massieu reiterated that Attorney General's Office (PGR) officials who do not work will be fired and that, in the event that their links to drug traffickers are proved, action will be taken against them. Ruiz Massieu told members of the Nuevo Leon Lawyers Association (CANL) that since Jorge Carpizo joined the PGR and later became Government Secretary, he has encouraged citizens to view the institution "with trust and not with terror." He said that regardless of the established inertia and faults, there is confidence that the PGR can become the institution that all Mexicans want. Ruiz Massieu asked lawyers and citizens to criticize and point out faults and deficiencies so that all PGR officials and agents do their duty, if not by conviction, then at least out of fear of being exposed. After meeting with CANL members, the federal official reiterated in an interview that the call made a few days ago to PGR delegates and deputies, as well as to Federal Judicial Police commanders, was not an ultimatum; "they were simply told that they must know who the most important drug traffickers are in the states where they work because their work is to investigate and they should know all these networks." Therefore, he added, they should yield results, and these should begin to be seen in about four weeks. If by then no results are seen, he reiterated, "we will analyze whether or not this is due to incompetence or negligence, or because they are covering up and are accomplices; this is what I said and what I am repeating." He added that officials who manage to arrest drug traffickers will receive a reward, but the PGR does not have the capacity or means to equal or surpass what the criminals may offer. He said the desire to earn a reward and the commitment to work and serve society as citizens and human beings must be combined. Afterward, in a meeting with local business members of the Nuevo Leon Civic Council Institutions and Civilian Association, Ruiz Massieu received a request by Gerardo Gomez Valdez, legal director for the Monterrey National Chamber of Commerce, for the PGR to unfreeze 200 million new pesos seized from three currency exchange houses (Monterrey, Colon, and Mercado de Cambios) in this city, which were charged with laundering money. This freeze not only affected the business owners, but over 200 businessmen who had nothing to do with the legal procedure.
