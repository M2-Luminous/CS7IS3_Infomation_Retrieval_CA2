SUMMARY: This document contains corrections to the final rule [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14677] on emergency locator transmitters that was published on June 21, 1994 (59 FR 32050). A portion of the rule language that affects the installation of replacement transmitters was inadvertently omitted. This document corrects that omission. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Phil Akers, Aircraft Engineering Division (AIR&hyph;120), Aircraft Certification Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone (202) 267&hyph;9571. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 21, 1994, the FAA published a final rule amending the regulations for emergency locator transmitters (ELT's) (59 FR 32050). As discussed in the preamble to that final rule, the FAA intended to include in the language of §91.207 a date after which ELT's that meet Technical Standard Order (TSO) C91 could no longer be installed in aircraft. That language was inadvertently omitted from the amendment to Section 91.207. This document presents only the omitted rule language for paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of §91.207. Correction of Publication Accordingly, the publication on June 21, 1994 of the final rule that was the subject of FR Doc. 94&hyph;14677 is corrected as follows: §91.207 [Corrected] 1. On page 32057, in the second column, in §91.207, in paragraph (a)(1), in the last line, add the words ``, except that after June 21, 1995, an emergency locator transmitter that meets the requirements of TSO&hyph;C91 may not be used for new installations'' immediately after the word ``operations''. 2. On page 32057, in the second column, in §91.207, in paragraph (a)(2), in the last line, add the words ``, except that after June 21, 1995, an emergency locator transmitter that meets the requirements of TSO&hyph;C91 may not be used for new installations'' immediately after the word ``condition''.
