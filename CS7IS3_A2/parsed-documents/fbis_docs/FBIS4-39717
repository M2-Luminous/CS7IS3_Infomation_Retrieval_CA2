A group of Indian businessmen, who are accompanying the minister, finalized their priorities in cooperation with their Kirghiz counterparts. The Indians are interested in the possibility of setting up joint enterprises to produce medicine, process agricultural produce, dress leather, manufacture paper, extract minerals and create infra-structure and telecommunications networks.

According to the minister, India intends to review the agreement's clauses about making investments in Kirghizia and crediting specific branches of its economy. This is being done to find a compromise and satisfy both parties, he said.
