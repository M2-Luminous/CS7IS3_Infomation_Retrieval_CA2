FR941103-0-00078 FR941103-0-00010 D. Contingency Plan The level of VOC and NO X emissions in the nonattainment areas will largely determine its ability to stay in compliance with the O 3 NAAQS in the future. Despite the Commonwealth's best efforts to demonstrate continued compliance with the NAAQS, the ambient air pollutant concentrations may exceed or violate the NAAQS. Therefore, the Commonwealth of Kentucky has provided contingency measures with a schedule for implementation in the event of a future O 3 air quality problem. The plan contains a contingency to implement RACT on existing major sources in the area where the violation occurred within ninety (90) days. RACT was not required for these nonattainment areas because they were designated marginal nonattainment pursuant to the CAA. A complete description of this contingency measure and its trigger can be found in the TSD. EPA finds that the contingency measures provided in the Commonwealth of Kentucky's submittal meet the requirements of section 175A(d) of the CAA. E. Subsequent Maintenance Plan Revisions In accordance with section 175A(b) of the CAA, the Commonwealth of Kentucky has agreed to submit a revised maintenance SIP eight years after the marginal nonattainment areas redesignate to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an additional ten years. Final Action In this final action, EPA is approving the nonattainment areas' O 3 maintenance plan because it meets the requirements of section 175A. The EPA is redesignating the Owensboro and Edmonson County nonattainment areas to attainment for O 3 because the Commonwealth of Kentucky has demonstrated compliance with the requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation. In addition EPA is approving the 1990 base year emission inventories for the Owensboro and Edmonson County nonattainment areas. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. The O 3 SIP is designed to satisfy the requirements of part D of the CAA and to provide for attainment and maintenance of the O 3 NAAQS. This final redesignation should not be interpreted as authorizing the Commonwealth of Kentucky to delete, alter, or rescind any of the VOC or NO X emission limitations and restrictions contained in the approved O 3 SIP. Changes to O 3 SIP VOC regulations rendering them less stringent than those contained in the EPA approved plan cannot be made unless a revised plan for attainment and maintenance is submitted to and approved by EPA. Unauthorized relaxations, deletions, and changes could result in both a finding of nonimplementation (section 173(b) of the CAA) and in a SIP deficiency call made pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the CAA. The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this Federal Register publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will be effective January 3, 1995 unless, by December 5, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received. If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective January 3, 1995. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by January 3, 1995. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).) This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Tables 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. Redesignation of an area to attainment under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the CAA does not impose any new requirements on small entities. Redesignation is an action that affects the status of a geographical area and does not impose any regulatory requirements on sources. The Administrator certifies that the approval of the redesignation request will not affect a substantial number of small entities.
