FBIS4-30501 "dreas124_m_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-124 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 Thailand Extension Sought Extension Sought BK2806085594 Bangkok THE NATION in English 28 Jun 94 p A2 BK2806085594 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] Thailand has proposed that the repatriation of Laotian refugees be integrated into the comprehensive Geneva plan for Indochinese refugees to allow a one-year extension of the process under the present agreement which expires at the end of this year, a reliable source said. The proposal, which has received the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR's) blessing, also called for the setting up of a reception center in Laos which would provide the returnees with job training before they are integrated into Laotian communities, according to the source who attended a meeting on the subject yesterday. At the tripartite meeting, Thailand and the UNHCR tried to convince Laos to accept the proposal, which they believe would be acceptable to the Geneva-based office, the source said. Under a 1991 tripartite agreement, the remaining Laotian refugees in Thailand must be sent back by the end of this year. However, the agreement was not included in the UNHCR's comprehensive plan of action, which stipulated that all Indochinese refugees must return by the end of 1995. Participants in the two-day technical meeting discussed the problems and obstacles in the repatriation process and explored ways to speed up the repatriation of approximately 12,000 mainly-highlander Laotians remaining in Thailand's last holding camp in Ban Na Pho, Nakhon Phanom province. The National Security Council (NSC) announced earlier this year that it would close Ban Na Pho at the end of this year. Of those remaining, only about 2,000 have expressed willingness to repatriate. The rest, mostly Hmong hilltribe people, have reportedly refused to return, wanting instead to resettle in a third country. Don Somvolachit, director of Laos' Department of Europe and America, who headed the Laotian delegation, said Laos fears the reception center would swell into a permanent resettlement site. He said Laos prefers long-term rural development projects in which both the returnees and current residents would benefit. He said the projects could be agriculture-oriented and equipped with public amenities. "There must be land and housing ready, international funding and they must resettle in areas provided for them and according to the tripartite plans," Don said. He said Vientiane is willing to take back all the remaining refugees but it would be impossible without funding. He said even if all 12,000 wanted to return, it "would not be easy. It would require a large investment of money and time to accommodate all of them." He emphasized that Vientiane would only accept voluntary returnees. "We want to help them return safely and with integrity but they must also help themselves." He categorized the potential refugees into three groups: individual returnees, small groups of five to 10 families, and groups of more than 10 families. He said the individuals would readjust easily into society because most have families in Laos. The small groups also would integrate well into existing communities but they need the UNHCR to provide basic facilities such as schools, hospitals, and roads to counteract possible rejection from the local population. The large groups would be more difficult to handle because special sites must be provided for them as rural development projects. Don said a major problem is that most returnees want to live in or near Vientiane or, in the case of the Hmong, in the mountainous north. Asked whether there should be legal guarantees for the safety of the returnees, Don said the tripartite agreement already provided for their protection and that the early returnees could counsel those who have not yet returned about the new life back home.
