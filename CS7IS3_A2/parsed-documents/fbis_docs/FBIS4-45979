The news analyst says: Japan's measure does not mean abandoning the plutonium utility program but postponing the construction of a new plutonium production facility. Japan's abrupt decision to postpone the program is a crafty ruse to convince the world public of its non-nuclear will, avoid international criticism and isolation and create a favorable climate for holding a permanent membership in the U.N. Security Council. The decision came in the wake of Japan's calculation that the postponement of the construction of a new plutonium production facility will do no harm to its nuclear arms development. Japan's efforts to convert itself into a military power and arm itself with nuclear weapons are based on revanchism. The Japanese ruling quarters obsessed with the ambition to lord it over in the international arena as a military and political power regard nuclear armament as an inevitable means to carry into practice their ambition. With no trick can the Japanese authorities conceal their ambition for nuclear armament. Japan must give up nuclear armament, mindful that this will lead to its own destruction.
