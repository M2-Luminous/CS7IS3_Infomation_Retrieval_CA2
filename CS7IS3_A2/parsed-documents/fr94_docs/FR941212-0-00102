FR941212-0-00102 FR941212-0-00019 (F) On full-time duty at nonappropriated fund activities. (G) Of the USAR and ARNG on active duty under Title 10. (ii) Members of Reserve Units (other than members of the ARNG under subpart F) during periods of inactive duty training and active duty training, including ROTC cadets who are reservists while they are at summer camp. (iii) Members of the ARNG while engaged in training or duty under Title 32 U.S.C. section 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 for claims arising on or after 29 December 1981. (2) Civilian officials and employees of both the DOD and DA (there is no practical significance to the distinction between the terms ``official'' and ``employee'') including but not limited to_ (i) Civil Service and other full-time employees of both the DOD and DA paid from appropriated funds. (ii) Contract surgeons (10 U.S.C. 1091 4022; AR 40&hyph;1, paragraph 4&hyph;2) and consultants (10 U.S.C. 1091; AR 40&hyph;1, paragraph 4&hyph;3; CPR A&hyph;9; FPM chapter 304) where ``control'' is exercised over physician's day to day practice. (iii) Employees of nonappropriated funds if the particular fund is an instrumentality of the United States and thus a Federal agency. In determining whether or not a particular fund is a ``Federal agency,'' consider whether the fund is an integral part of the Army charged with an essential DA operational function and the degree of control and supervision exercised by DA personnel. Members or users, as distinguished from employees of nonappropriated funds, are not considered Government employees; the same is true of family child care providers. However, claims arising out of the use of certain nonappropriated fund property, or the acts or omissions of family child care providers, may be payable from such funds under subpart L as a matter of policy, even when the user is not within the scope of employment and the claim is not otherwise cognizable under any of the other authorizations in this regulation. (iv) Prisoners of war and interned enemy aliens. (v) Civilian employees of the District of Columbia National Guard, including those paid under ``service contracts'' from District of Columbia funds. (vi) Civilians serving as ROTC instructors paid from Federal funds. (vii) National Guard technicians employed under 32 U.S.C. 709(a) for claims accruing on or after 1 January 1969 (Pub. L. 90&hyph;486, 13 Aug. 1968; 82 Stat. 755). (3) Persons acting in an official capacity for the DOD or DA whether temporarily or permanently in the service of the United States with or without compensation including but not limited to_ (i) ``Dollar a year'' personnel. (ii) Members of advisory committees, commissions, boards, or the like. (iii) Volunteer workers in an official capacity acting in furtherance of the business of the United States. The general rule with respect to volunteers is set forth in 31 U.S.C. 665(b), which provides that, ``No officer or employee of the United States shall accept voluntary service for the United States or employ personal service in excess of that authorized by law, except in cases of emergency involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.'' Title 5, U.S.C., section 3111(c) specifically provides that student volunteers employed thereunder will be considered Federal employees for purposes of the FTCA. The same classification is applied by 10 U.S.C. 1588 to museum and family support program volunteers. The Army is permitted to accept and use certain volunteer services in Army family support programs as authorized by Pub. L. 98&hyph;94, September 24, 1983. Red Cross volunteers meeting the criteria set forth in AR 40&hyph;3, paragraph 2&hyph;42, are also considered to be employees of the United States for claims purposes. (iv) Loaned servants. Employees who are permitted to serve another employer may be considered ``loaned servants,'' provided the borrowing employer has the power to discharge the employee, control and direct the employee, and decide how he or she will perform the tasks. Whoever has retained those powers is liable for the employee's torts under the principle of respondent superior. Where those elements of direction and control have been found, the United States has been liable; for example, for the torts of Government employees loaned for medical training and emergency assistance and county and state employees discharging Federal programs. (c) ``Scope of employment'' means acting in ``line of [military] duty'' (28 U.S.C. 2671) and is determined in accordance with principles of respondent superior under the law of the jurisdiction in which that act or omission occurred. Determination as to whether a person is within a category listed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section will usually be made together with the scope determination. Local law should always be researched, but the novel aspects of the military relationship should be kept in mind in making a scope determination. (d) ``Line of duty'' determinations under AR 600&hyph;8&hyph;1 are not determinative of scope of employment. ``Joint venture'' situations are likely to be frequent where the Federal employee is performing federally assigned duties but is under actual direction and control of a non-Federal entity; for example, a Federal employee in training at a non-Federal entity or ROTC instructors at civilian institutions. This could also occur where the employee is working for another Federal agency. Furthermore, dual purpose situations are commonplace where benefits to the Government and the member or employee may or may not be concurrent; for example, use of privately owned vehicles at or away from assigned duty station, or permanent change of station with delay en route. (See subpart E for the handling of certain claims arising out of nonscope activities of members of the Army.) §536.72 Law applicable. The whole law of the place where the act or omission occurred, including choice of law rules, will be applied in the determining liability and quantum. Where there is a conflict between the local law and an express provision of the FTCA, the latter governs. §536.73 Subrogation. Claims involving subrogation will be processed as prescribed in §536.20(b) except where that section is inconsistent with the provisions of this subpart or the Attorney General's regulations. §536.74 Indemnity or contribution. (a) Sought by the United States. It is the policy of the Department of Justice that, if the claim arises under circumstances in which the Government is entitled to contribution or indemnity under a contract of insurance or the applicable law governing joint tortfeasors, the third party will be notified of the claim and will be requested to honor its obligation to the United States or to accept its share of joint liability. (See §§536.28 and 536.29.) If the issue of indemnity or contribution is not satisfactorily adjusted, the claim will be compromised or settled only after consultation with the Department of Justice as provided in §536.75(s). (b) Claims for indemnity or contribution. Claims for indemnity or contribution from the United States will be compromised or settled under this subpart, if liability exists under the applicable law, provided the incident giving rise to such claim is otherwise cognizable under this subpart. As to such claims where the exclusivity provisions of the FECA may be applicable, see §536.75(s). (c) ARNG vehicular claims. (1) When a vehicle used by the ARNG, or a POV operated by a member or employee of the ARNG, is involved in an incident under circumstances that make this subpart applicable to the disposition of administrative claims against the United States and results in personal injury, death, or property damage, and a remedy against the State, or its insurer is indicated, the responsible area claims authority will monitor the action against the State or its insurer and encourage direct settlement between the claimant and the State or its insurer. (2) Where the State is insured, direct contact with State or ARNG officials rather than the insurer is desirable. Regular procedures will be established and followed wherever possible. Such procedures should be agreed on by both local authorities and the appropriate claims authorities subject to concurrence by Commander, USARCS. Such procedures will be designed to ensure that local authorities and U.S. authorities do not issue conflicting instructions for processing claims and, whenever possible and in accordance with governing local and Federal law, a mutual arrangement for disposition of such claims as in paragraph (d) of this section is worked out. (3) Amounts recovered or recoverable by claimant from any insurer (other than claimant's insurer who has obtained no subrogated interest against the United States) will be deducted from the amount otherwise payable. (d) Claims arising out of training activities of NG personnel. Contribution may be sought from the State involved where it has waived sovereign immunity or has private insurance that would cover the incident giving rise to the particular claim. Where the State involved rejects the request for contribution, the file will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS. The Commander, USARCS, is authorized to enter into an agreement with a State, territory, or commonwealth to share settlement costs of claims generated by the ARNG personnel or activities of that political entity.
