I am happy to say that you still enjoy the confidence of the people. [Meshkov] Does that surprise you? [Moroz] I am simply asserting a fact. After all, we all know that following an election, as soon as a person begins work and gets down to real business, disillusionment sets in. Some people do not like one aspect, others another... [Meshkov] This is natural. You have to be ready for this, but all the same you do not want to lose too much too quickly. Still, the situation is a great deal worse than is apparent from a distance. I am referring to the state of the economy, the state of law enforcement organs... Everything is so neglected... [Moroz] It has already been reported repeatedly in the press that you have abandoned a number of promises you made in the preelection period, the most important of these being reunification of Crimea with Russia. Do you agree with these reports and the accompanying reproach? [Meshkov] No, I do not. My preelection program did not refer to the reunification of Crimea with Russia. It referred to the restoration of a single economic space, cultural space, information space. All the rest will follow automatically. [Moroz] Will a survey take place on the state status of Crimea? [Meshkov] Yes, on 27 March. [Moroz] But Kravchuk rescinded your decision to conduct it. [Meshkov] Nonetheless, there will be a survey. [Moroz] What will the consequences be? [Meshkov] Crimea will take it into consideration. But what the consequences will be for Ukraine--is difficult to predict. Although according to sociological survey data, quite a definite situation is taking shape there with respect to candidates for the office of president of Ukraine. [Moroz] But what question will be asked on the survey? The question--"Are you in favor of an independent Republic of Crimea in a union with other CIS states?" that was proposed? (this sounds somewhat tautological) [Meshkov] Several other questions will be presented, more specific and more definite questions. They concern the preservation of mutual relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine, citizenship of the Republic of Crimea, and the right to dual citizenship--those provisions that were determined by the Constitution adopted 6 May 1992. These same provisions were amended 25 September of the same year in the grossest violations of legislation. [Moroz] Do you expect any measures of confrontation on the part of Kiev other than the threatening warnings which constantly resound? How do you view the recent warning of Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhalchenko, who stated that it would be better to repulse "Crimean separatism" now than find themselves up against the need to resort to military force later? [Meshkov] As we know, the toughest traffic policemen are the sergeants. The higher the rank, the more lenient they are. It is just about the same way in the state apparatus. What confrontation measures do we expect? In my opinion they have already been taken... [Moroz] Well, what will you do if, for example, Kiev decides to introduce a state of emergency? [Meshkov] (Laughing) In politics it is difficult to predict all the alternatives when you use the conditional mood--"if..." That is the first thing. Secondly, there are no premises for introduction of a state of emergency. Everything is proceeding normally, everything is being done within the framework of the law, including within the framework of Ukrainian law. I can only express my sympathy to the esteemed president of Ukraine for the fact that his legal advisers did not very thoroughly work through the legal documents concerning the survey. [Moroz] Did you speak to him about this after he prohibited the survey? [Meshkov] (Laughing) As you know, it is the senior who has the right to address the junior, and not vice versa. [Moroz] Are you not afraid that Crimea will find itself in the situation of Karabakh, the Dniester, Abkhazia, or even Yugoslavia? Some people believe that such a development of events is entirely likely. [Meshkov] I can only express astonishment at such an opinion. [Moroz] Why? Prior to the outbreak of the war in Yugoslavia, practically no one believed it would happen. [Meshkov] You cannot equate two entirely different situations. What is applicable in Yugoslavia has nothing whatever to do with Crimea. We have no interreligious or interethnic tension here... Here no nationalists at all are taking root or acquiring influence. People who live here are individualists to a greater extent than anywhere else in the territory of the former Soviet Union. [Moroz] Perhaps you do not see the analogy with Yugoslavia, but the analogy with Abkhazia is more directly apparent. The "Georgia-Abkhazia"--"Ukraine-Crimea" similarity is fairly great. And Russia is involved in both... [Meshkov] No, I see no analogy here either. Both before 1954 and after, we were a part of the people of Russia. And we remain so today. [Moroz] What political forces in Ukraine do you consider to be your main enemies? And which ones--your allies? [Meshkov] My enemies are nationalists of every shade. My allies--those who stand up for normal mutual relations, for a normal economy. [Moroz] And what are the forces in Russia with whom you support good relations? [Meshkov] With everyone. [Moroz] You do not see any differences between them? [Meshkov] The differences are quite significant. But even in view of all the differences, all factions of the State Duma, for example, are interested in the processes that are underway in the Republic of Crimea and around it. We are trying to use this interest. [Moroz] Some people believe you have a very good relationship with Zhirinovskiy. [Meshkov] (Laughing) I do not know what facts such conclusions are based on. I have stated before and will state again that my relationship with Vladimir Volfovich is primarily that of a schoolmate--we both completed studies at the law faculty of Moscow University. Above that, he is without a doubt a talented individual. As for the rest... In my opinion, journalists do not penetrate deeply enough into the reality that Vladimir Volfovich represents. It seems to me they are guilty of onesidedness and evaluate him exclusively according to his manner of communicating. In actuality, Zhirinovskiy is far more serious than the way he is presented in the mass media. [Moroz] What is your attitude towards Zhirinovskiy's political views? [Meshkov] I do not really fell like talking about this, but since you ask... He is without a doubt, I say again, a talented individual. Beyond this, every politician, as we know, contains within himself the qualities of the snake, the tiger, and the monkey, but people often perceive only the qualities of the latter of the living creatures I have enumerated, not noticing the qualities of the other two. The outward behavior, statements, and gestures of Mr. Zhirinovskiy conceal his human essence, I believe. In actuality, this is a powerful intellect who is presented on the level of a side-show barker. He is the only individual of all those now in the State Duma who correctly determined the feelings, aspirations, and hopes of a mighty people. Not everyone can see this. [Moroz] You state that Zhirinovskiy divined the aspirations of the people. But just imagine that two years of your presidency have gone by, you have encountered heavy interference over this entire period in your attempts to improve the economic situation, the people continue to suffer as before, and now this "powerful intellect" springs up who "divines" the feelings of the people. He points to you and says: "He is guilty of everything! Down with him!" In actuality, of course, no such great intellect is needed for your local Crimean Zhirinovskiy to emerge and, on a wave of discontent with Meshkov who "failed to vindicate himself," get 25 percent of the votes... [Meshkov] If I encounter heavy interference, I will attempt to put up heavy resistance. That is the first thing. Secondly, we are not talking about finding the most scathing slogans. This is well within the power of the provincial journalist who devises a garish headline. We are talking about far more serious things, with respect to which entire scientific research centers have been engaged in analysis. And then we see the result that was obtained by these centers upon their analysis of the situation in Russia on the eve of the 12 December elections as not coinciding with reality--in catastrophic fashion. [Moroz] It seems to me you are gravely mistaken in your evaluation of Zhirinovskiy. Which I greatly regret. [Meshkov] Is he more dangerous, or less intelligent? [Moroz] In my opinion--both. [Meshkov] As far as the former is concerned, perhaps I could agree with you. With respect to the latter--no. [Moroz] But think about this. There is no "powerful intellect" there. There just cannot be. Zhirinovskiy does not even have an ordinary sound intellect. As far as my regret of your evaluation of this figure is concerned... I hope you are not indifferent to the sympathies of sound-thinking Russian society--the Russian intelligentsia, in particular. (My utterance of these last words for some reason caused my partner in conversation to become extremely agitated. He rose from his chair and began to speak heatedly and emotionally--O.M.). [Meshkov] There is no use in talking about this! There is no sense in it! Of course I value the favor of the intelligentsia. But an inaccurate evaluation leads to inaccurate conclusions. Instead of analyzing the causes, you analyze the consequences. This is the dangerous part! You will recall how people once related to the corporal. How they laughed, how they caricatured him. Superficial treatment overall. This is what I am talking about. [Moroz] Well, there are still other compliments you have made regarding this figure. [Meshkov] I do not agree that this is a compliment. It is an orientation on reality. And it is precisely what should compel us to treat Zhirinovskiy quite seriously. We must not depict him through caricatures. That is too superficial. But my attitude towards Zhirinovskiy is not complimentary. God forbid! [Moroz] What do you expect from the elections in Ukraine? Will the situation there become more favorable for you? Will there not be increased pressure from Kiev on the Republic of Crimea? [Meshkov] Realistic preconditions are presently in place for a change in the situation in Ukraine--the former nomenklatura personalities, who managed to become nationalists, will depart the political arena. They will be replaced by practical people, pragmatists who will decide all matters first and foremost in the interests of the economy, not nationalism. [Moroz] Are you satisfied with your "team"? How do you select your people? [Meshkov] According to the principle of professionalism and ability to function in an extreme environment. [Moroz] But does not your enlistment of Saburov, an individual "from outside," someone from another country no less--does this not imply that you are experiencing a severe personnel shortage? [Meshkov] No, it does not. Saburov is not "from outside." He is 100 percent Crimean, born in Yalta. But I am not even referring to that. I am not talking about the space defined by the borders of Crimea, but rather the space defined by the borders of Russia. We do not perceive borders as a norm or as a natural condition. Everything not in conformance with objective economic laws, everything that contradicts common sense--is nonviable. On the contrary, we could follow Hegel: Everything rational is real. Everything is standardized and fit into a norm. As far as a shortage of personnel is concerned, the Ukrainian Government might well wish it could boast of specialists in the class, on the level and with the qualifications of Mr. Saburov. [Moroz] Some people see a certain external resemblance between the two of you... [Meshkov] (Laughing) In any case, it was not based on any resemblance to me that I invited him to assume the post of deputy prime minister. That is a fact. [Moroz] What are the main tasks you have set for him? [Meshkov] To do everything that can be done at this time and in this place to improve the economic situation. [Moroz] How do you assess this situation? [Meshkov] It is a catastrophe. A catastrophe colored yellow and blue. [Moroz] (A small illustration of the president's words with respect to the catastrophic situation in the economy. A cleaning lady in a Simferopol hotel, at which a "CIS-er" [Commonwealth of Independent States] is fleeced to the tune of R40,000 per day for an average room, receives less than R9,000 a month. A civil aviation pilot who retires gets R18,000 in pension. The Crimean president himself, I was told by one of his aides, receives a salary of 1,900,000 karbovantsy. Despite the large number of zeros, this comes to just R82,610 as of the moment of my departure from Crimea last Saturday. Today it is reduced still more, since the coupon/ruble rate keeps falling and falling...--O.M.) You have stated that you intend to return Crimea to the ruble zone. [Meshkov] I intend to. For us the ruble is a more acceptable means of payment, since our main flow of tourists--people who spend money in Crimea--are citizens of Russia. To provide them normal services, if you will, is one of the most important tasks of our oblast economy. And we will accomplish this task. [Moroz] But there is no border between Crimea and Ukraine. It would be practically impossible to introduce a currency here different from that used in Ukraine... [Meshkov] What is going on right now is impossible. Our reality of today is impossible. We are striving to return to a normal condition. [Moroz] The way I understand it, to do this you would have to violate the laws of Ukraine? [Meshkov] The laws of Ukraine constitute one of the factors leading to the current economic situation. The results are before you, as they say. [Moroz] What do you see as the primary cause of the catastrophic situation that has arisen in Ukraine and rushed towards you in a wave? [Meshkov] The situation is even more desperate than you think. But the primary cause is encroachment, the way they perceive it, upon the sense of national dignity of some nationalists of Western Ukraine, which has led to a general economic collapse of the gigantic European state Ukraine comprises. This is the price that was paid for the realization of nationalist slogans. And it was effected with the full composure, indifference, and silent encouragement of Europe and the United States. The United States became alarmed only when the nationalists put their finger on the nuclear button. While it was clear from the very beginning that this would happen. But now they are saying a Russian nationalist has come to power in Crimea. Where does such delusion come from? The dignified magazine ECONOMIST (Paris) publishes an article entitled "The Second Crimean War." [Moroz] A month and a half has elapsed now since you were elected president. What has this time brought you as leader of the Republic of Crimea? Have there been any unexpected revelations? [Meshkov] Yes. First of all--the attitude of previous state officials. This is open sabotage. It is nothing obscure or secretive, but rather open and defiant. [Moroz] You were hoping for something different? [Meshkov] No, I was not hoping for their assistance, but neither did I expect defiance. I did not expect that it would be so aggressive, clearly anti-people, irrational... And criminal, in the final analysis. That is one thing I did not expect. A second thing was the revelation as to what extent our law enforcement organs are infected with the disease called corruption. [Moroz] Incidentally, you were forced to leave your position as procuracy investigator for attempting to bring charges against members of the party and administration nomenklatura caught in embezzlement. Do you still have this motivating drive to fight for justice? [Meshkov] I still have the drive, and my capacities have grown immeasurably. [Moroz] How do you intend to fight crime? Do you have a specific, precisely defined program? [Meshkov] Implementation of the program to fight crime runs headlong into a personnel problem, unfortunately. There are insufficient personnel capable of carrying on this fight. [Moroz] During your time in office have you managed to establish any personal contacts with the leaders of Ukraine and Russia? [Meshkov] With the leaders of Ukraine--no. Only on the official level. The situation with respect to Russia is directly the reverse. [Moroz] What do you consider yourself--a Russian or a Ukrainian (your father being Russian and your mother Ukrainian)? [Meshkov] (Laughing) I consider myself a Don Cossack. [Moroz] Do you know Ukrainian? [Meshkov] Yes, I understand it. [Moroz] Do you read with a dictionary? [Meshkov] No, I do not need a dictionary. My reading is fluent. But my speaking... I am not about to assert that I speak correct literary language. I speak on the everyday, colloquial level. [Moroz] What place in your plans of presidential activity is occupied by facilitating resolution of the Black Sea Fleet problem? We know that Russia and Ukraine are resolving it. They are trying to resolve it. However, except for the seamen themselves, it is Crimeans who suffer more than anyone else from a failure to resolve this issue. [Meshkov] This problem is essentially resolved. The only question is to what extent conditions of the agreement will be conscientiously observed. A readiness to do so is manifest on Russia's part, as far as I am aware. This is not true with respect to Ukraine. The Black Sea Fleet is a Russian fleet. This is natural. It is economically feasible. All the rest will depend on the rational or irrational actions of the other side. For us the presence of the Black Sea Fleet is a benefit that would be a sin not to take advantage of. [Moroz] How is your intention to take Ukrainian armed formations out of Crimea being executed? [Meshkov] I requested the Ukrainian leadership to remove first of all those troops that were introduced in violation of agreement and the existing order (troops may be introduced only with the consent of the Supreme Council of Crimea). The presence of these forces does not contribute toward normalization of relations between Crimea and Ukraine. In addition, they are occupying a fairly large amount of territory which could be used for economic purposes. Finally, they represent a certain threat to the ecology. [Moroz] What is the numerical strength of these troops? [Meshkov] They are fairly large units, unfortunately. [Moroz] KRASNAYA ZVEZDA reported about 60,000. [Meshkov] KRASNAYA ZVEZDA rarely errs in these matters. They have reliable sources. [Moroz] It is apparent that Crimean Tatars followed the appeals of their leaders and voted against you. Many of them do not recognize you as president. Do you hope to be able to shatter their negative attitude towards you? [Meshkov] It is incorrect to assert that the Crimean Tatars do not recognize the president. It would be more accurate to state that the leadership of one wing of the national movement of Crimean Tatars entered into alliance with my political opponent and supported him. And when he lost, they declared they did not agree with the one who won. This is not politics. This is not on the political level. It is on the mundane level. It is simply undignified to resolve political problems on the mundane level. As far as support from ordinary citizens of the Republic of Crimea is concerned, a million or more of their votes is more than sufficient to be able to calmly sit down in this chair. And among that million are a great many citizens of Crimean Tatar nationality. [Moroz] Do you intend to repeal the quota of 14 seats for Crimean Tatars in the parliament, as you promised? [Meshkov] I did not say I intended to repeal the quota. I said that I do not accept the principle of endowment of political rights according to nationality. I opposed this as a deputy and as candidate for president. And I now oppose it as president. It is a flagrant violation of international law and universal standards. But I have no intention of repealing what has already come about. [Moroz] Do you sense any action on the part of the special services? Are they watching you? [Meshkov] (Laughing) Well, beginning from a certain time and at a certain level of political and state activity, this is inevitable. [Moroz] How do you evaluate Khrushchev's unforgettable decision to transfer Crimea to Ukraine? [Meshkov] One in a series of delirious inventions and decisions. It has nothing to do with common sense or with man's treatment of his fellow man. But from the legal and judicial point of view, the issue is decided. The acts of 1954 were declared invalid as of the moment of their adoption. Thus, everything is normal in this aspect. The only thing that remains is to return to common sense and universal concepts.
