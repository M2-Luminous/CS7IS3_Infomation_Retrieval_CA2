FR940414-2-00121 FR940414-2-00078 Finally, by order dated July 12, 1991 (HCAR No. 25346), Enerop was authorized to purchase 17,000 additional shares of the Class A Preferred for $68,000 ($4 per share). Following the acquisition, Enerop owned 9.4% of Metscan's common stock and 9.8% of the Class A Preferred, or about 8.2% of the actual and potential equity investment in Metscan. Enerop's total investment in Metscan then totaled $1,226,000. On December 29, 1993, Enerop changed its name to Leidy Hub, Inc. Leidy now proposes to acquire 29,167 shares of Metscan Class B Preferred Stock, $.01 par value, (``Class B Preferred''), out of a total number of 2,736,667 shares to be sold, for $35,000 ($1.20 per share). Once the proposed transaction has been consummated, Leidy will own 7.31% of Metscan's common stock, 9.83% of the Class A Preferred and 1.07% of the Class B Preferred, or about 5.52% of the actual and potential equity investment in Metscan. Leidy will, however, divest itself of all interest in Metscan within ten years of the acquisition of the Class B Preferred. Entergy Corporation (70&hyph;8149) Entergy Corporation (``Entergy''), 225 Baronne Street, New Orleans, Louisiana 70113, a registered holding company, has filed a declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 32, and 33 of the Act and Rules 53 and 54 thereunder. The Commission issued a notice of the declaration on April 9, 1993 (HCAR No. 25789). Since then, Entergy has filed an amendment which requires the Commission to issue a second notice of the transaction. Entergy proposes to enter into arrangements with one or more banks to effect borrowings and reborrowings by Entergy from time to time for a period not to exceed three years, of not more than $300 million by issuing to participating banks (``Banks'') its unsecured promissory notes (``Notes'') payable no later than three years from the date of their issuance. The proposed borrowing arrangements will be contained in a credit agreement among Entergy and the Banks. Each borrowing by Entergy could either be made pro rata among the Banks, or be allocated among one or more of the Banks in such proportions as the Banks and Entergy shall agree. Each payment by Entergy with respect to a borrowing would be made pro rata among the Banks according to their respective ratable portions of the such borrowings. Under the proposed arrangements, each borrowing would bear interest from the date thereof on the unpaid principal amount thereof at a rate per annum selected by Entergy from a number of rate options. These rate options include: (1) The higher of (a) the prime commercial rate of a specified bank (or an average of such rates of some or all of the Banks) from time to time in effect and (b) a specified margin (not in excess of 1%) above rates on overnight Federal funds transactions on a given day (or the average of such rates for a specified period) (``Prime Rate''); (2) the sum of (c) specified offered rates for certificates of deposit of a specified Bank (or an average of such rates of some of all of the Banks) for the amounts equivalent to such borrowing and for selected interest periods, appropriately adjusted for the cost of reserves and F.D.I.C. insurance and (d) a margin not in excess of 1.5% per annum (``CD Rate''); (3) the sum of (e) specified rates offered for U.S. dollar deposits by or to a specified Bank (or an average of such rates of some or all of the Banks) in the interbank Eurodollar market for amounts equivalent to such borrowing and for selected interest periods, appropriately adjusted for the cost of reserves and (f) a margin not in excess of 1.25% per annum (``LIBOR Rate''); or (4) a rate negotiated at the time of borrowing with one or more Banks, which would not in any event exceed a maximum rate of the Prime Rate plus 2% per annum, appropriately adjusted for the cost of bidding or negotiation (``Competitive Advance Rate''). Entergy states that generally interest on Prime Rate borrowings would be payable quarterly, and interest on CD Rate and LIBOR Rate borrowings would be payable at the end of selected interest periods for such borrowings, or, depending upon the length of such selected interest periods, at specified intervals within such periods and at the end thereof. Interest on Competitive Advance Rate borrowings would be payable on such dates as are agreed to by Entergy and Banks funding such borrowings.
