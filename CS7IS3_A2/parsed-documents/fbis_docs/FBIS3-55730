Such a step may look quite symbolic. In fact, Russia's Choice had previously been accused of being inconsistent: It had promised "never to shake hands with Zhirinovskiyites," and then went on and sat down with them at the same table as if thereby sanctioning the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia as a component part of the political establishment. In the given case, however, Russia's Choice expressed a concrete protest against the attempts by the remaining three parties to bring coordinated pressure to bear on it while distributing the positions of Duma committee chairmen. Zhirinovskiy, who had been refused entry to a number of countries, is modestly soliciting the position of chairman of the international affairs committee, while the Communists, in league with the "bearers of the sickle" -- the Agrarians -- are seeking the positions of heads of the defense and security committees. As if this were not enough, Yabloko went and demanded for itself leadership of the budget committee, which Russia's Choice would have paid any price to reserve for itself. So it is no accident that Russia's Choice should decide to make such a tough move. In the meantime, despite the clear desire of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord leader, the factions have in fact managed to agree on an exceptionally "narrow circle" of contenders for State Duma speaker. Observers believe that having the two hot bets down the home stretch are: A. Adamishin, former first deputy foreign minister; and A. Fedulova, the former "first Young Pioneer" of the land of Soviets. According to our lights, A. Adamishin confirmed the other day the seriousness of his parliamentary intentions, having tendered his resignation from his Foreign Ministry position. Unlike his boss, Kozyrev, he cannot simultaneously have his seat in parliament and keep his ministerial seat. (Incidentally, Adamishin's aides have resolutely declined any comment about his intentions). I. Ivanov, Russia's ex-ambassador to Spain, has already become Kozyrev's new first deputy. Mrs. Fedulova, however, seems to have some moral edge on the career diplomat. The election of a woman to the position of speaker would send good vibrations around this country and the world in addition to cutting the ground from under the nascent feminist movement in Russia.
