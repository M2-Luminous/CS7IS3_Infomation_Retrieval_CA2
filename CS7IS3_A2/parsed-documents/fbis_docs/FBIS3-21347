Dr. Muhammad Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Mu'ammar is a member of the Shura [Consultative] Council, a well-known economic expert, and a professor in the King Fahd Oil and Minerals University. He previously responded to two questions, confirming the strength of the economic situation in the Kingdom. He stressed the excellence of the actions taken by the government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, to support the Saudi riyal and to balance expenditure of income. Those actions are concerned with doubling production revenues and diversifying sources of income. Increased Role for Private Sector ['UKAZ] How does the Saudi budget appear to you in terms of support for the strength and firmness of the Saudi economy? [Al-Mu'ammar] Issuing the general state budget for 1993/94 represents our government's commitment to strengthening the course of economic and social growth for our beloved country. Despite the fact that exports of crude oil still represent 86 percent of total Saudi exports, i.e., 75 percent of total governmental income, we see a gradual, tangible increase in the total of our nonpetroleum exports. They include materials with added value, such as refined petroleum products, petrochemicals, and fertilizers; derivatives of the petrochemical industry, like plastics, synthetic fibers and polyester; agricultural products such as grain, vegetables, flowers, etc. Moreover, we should note that the private sector has in fact begun to make very large capital investments in industrial parks in major cities like Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam, in addition to the two industrial cities of al-Jubayl and Yanbu. One must not forget the important role played by the public sector, represented by the efforts of the Ministry of Industry and Electricity, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Finance and National Economy in supporting and encouraging the private sector to play the desired role in the growth of the national economy. This was done through offering various means of support, such as subsidies, loans, and reduced customs fees on Saudi exports. Despite intense world competition, faced by our products abroad, Saudi Arabia's joining the international General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as GATT, will reduce the pressure of customs barriers that our exports encounter in international markets. It will also overcome the obstacles that the private sector faces in the field of foreign investments and exports, since these two areas support private sector opportunities, so that it may play its hoped-for role alongside the governmental sector. It is anticipated that sales of Saudi national products, through the Saudi Industrial Exports Company, will have reached 750 million riyals [R] at the end of 1993. [.sup]1[/] The strength and firmness of the Saudi economy stems from this. We should note that the growth rate of the private sector's gross domestic product [GDP] is not less than 5 percent for the current fiscal year, according to statistics cited in the state budget for this year. It is expected that the actual GDP will grow at a 7-percent rate, compared with 9 percent for 1991.[.sup]2[/] The GDP for the same period is estimated at R381 billion, according to Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency statistics. This rate is one of the highest growth rates in the developing world, following directly after the rapidly developing Asian nations, like South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, etc. We should also not fail to mention the important fact that inflation rates in our country are still reasonable, compared with many developing nations. The state has participated in stabilizing consumer goods through guiding public expenditures and organizing imports, as well as various means of support offered to local merchants. Causes of Income Reduction ['UKAZ] How can the Kingdom maintain its strong economic position and continue spending on construction, growth, development, and modernization, despite the burdens that have resulted from the Gulf war disaster and despite the falling oil prices? [Al-Mu'ammar] You mentioned two important matters in your question: the falling oil prices of the past 10 years, specifically 1983-1993, and the consequences stemming from the Gulf war. Both of these are problems that the Kingdom cannot deal with alone. On the contrary, international efforts through the organization of oil exporting nations known as OPEC, of which there are 12 permanent member states today, including the Kingdom, are being made to draw up production and pricing policies for the member states. However, in the middle eighties, we noted the difficulty OPEC had managing production and pricing policies by itself. This was because of many important factors including: 1. Increased oil production by countries outside of OPEC. Britain increased its oil production to 700,000 barrels per day [bpd] during 1993. Russia's production also increased to 1.6 million barrels during the same year, i.e., an increase estimated at 20 percent over the previous year, in view of its need for hard currency to support its economy. 2. Energy strategies followed in countries belonging to the International Energy Agency, which has made Paris its headquarters. Perhaps the most important of these strategies is the increase of strategic oil storage by industrial states, estimated at 4.5 billion barrels in the early nineties. World production of oil did drop slightly to 59.6 million bpd in 1993, as a result of reduced demand for refined products in those countries. 3. World economic stagnation in major industrial nations, such as Japan and Europe, and its ramifications on the world's demand for oil. Economic growth rates were relatively low; they are increasing only 1 to 1.5 percent annually in the best of conditions. 4. Divisions within OPEC nations themselves, either because of political conflicts like the Iraq-Iran War in the eighties; the Gulf war in 1990, resulting in the liberation of Kuwait from the Iraqi invasion, which some world critics have called the first petroleum war; or other economic reasons that are strongly connected to general budgets and the balance of payments deficits of many member states. All of this has induced these countries to exceed set production quotas and the official prices set in accordance with OPEC ministerial decisions, out of a desire to increase their income from oil exports. Resolute Treatment of the Problem We are also all aware that since 1985, like the rest of the OPEC nations and many other countries of the world, including the major industrialized countries, Saudi Arabia has faced the consequences of these conditions. However, the Kingdom has faced them with strength and by following these means: 1. Issuing treasury bonds by the Ministry of Finance and National Economy, and selling them to borrow money for a fixed period of time. This represents a guaranteed investment for purchasers, most of whom are national banks. The value of governmental bonds held by Saudi banks is less than $15 billion, according to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance and National Economy.[.sup]3[/] It is well known that the disparity in the general budget for 1993 totalled R27.8 billion, compared with R30 billion for 1992. This difference between income and expenditures was covered by borrowing. 2. Full receipt of customs fees pertaining to the state in various sectors. This includes services for telephone, electricity, and water; customs duties on imports in airports and harbors; and, security sectors, such as traffic, passports, etc. These fees represent important income for the state of not less than R5 billion. 3. Continuing to guide the state's general expenditures through a reduction in spending in various state organizations. Total expenditures allocated in this year's budget amounted to R160 billion, compared with R197 billion for the last fiscal year. 4. Continuing to support OPEC efforts to stabilize oil prices under a specific production ceiling that will serve the economic development plans of the OPEC nations. Practical Solutions for the Crisis It is well known that the current OPEC ceiling is 24.5 million barrels, or some 40 percent of world oil production, while the actual production capacity of OPEC nations is 28 million bpd. The average sale price of a barrel of Arab light (34 degree) oil is $11, while Saudi Arabia's production of crude oil reached 8 million bpd at the end of 1993. The fluctuation of prices could be dealt with through reducing OPEC production by 1.5 to 2 million bpd, but the recent OPEC ministerial conference regarded this idea as unlikely, in view of the possibility of non-OPEC producers' increasing their oil production at the expense of the OPEC nations. 5. Stabilizing the Saudi riyal's current exchange rate vis-a-vis hard foreign currencies through supporting it with Saudi foreign monetary reserves which, in the first part of the last decade, totalled $130 billion, according to IMF estimates. The minister of finance and national economy, Shaykh Muhammad Aba-al-Khayl, has pointed out that the Saudi currency was fully covered by a special reserve of hard currency of more than $20 billion.[.sup]4[/] It is clear that the percentage of governmental domestic borrowing is about 94 percent of the total, while the country's foreign borrowing from international banks is only 6 percent, i.e., an estimated amount of $4.5 billion. This undoubtedly means that the Kingdom's foreign obligation is very limited, and could be repaid within a short time, inasmuch as the greatest percentage of borrowing is local and not foreign. With regard to the percentage of budget deficit to gross national product, we found it to be 52 percent of this product. To a considerable extent, this is the same as rates found in advanced industrial nations, such as the United States and France.[.sup]5[/] If we take into consideration the completion of the infrastructure for most of the physical and human development projects, and the large trade surplus in its favor in the balance of foreign trade payments, which is estimated at R81 billion for 1991[.sup]6[/], we find that Saudi Arabia is proceeding ahead surefootedly to support its national economy. - Dr. Muhammad Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Mu'ammar - Born in al-Ta'if in 1955 - Received his secondary education in al-Ta'if - Went to the United States in 1975 for university study.
