Addressing the national construction work meeting today, Construction Minister Hou Jie summarized achievements in nationwide construction undertakings last year: -- Engineering construction achieved notable results with building industry steadily developing. A host of key projects, including Shanghai's Yangpu Bridge, Guangdong's Dayawan Nuclear Power Station, second-phase Dalian-Qinhuangdao electric railway project, and Jinan-Qindao Expressway, have successively completed and commenced operations. The introduction of an engineering construction supervision system has brought high speed, quality, and efficiency. -- Adaption to the new situation has brought new progress in urban planning. To meet demands of a new reform situation and the establishment of a socialist market economic system, various localities embarked on revising the overall urban planning last year by speeding up formulation of detailed rules designed to better control and guide development of new zones, reconstruction of old areas, and construction of various development sites in urban areas. The revised overall urban planning for both Beijing and Changsha have been approved by the State Council, while initial examinations of that of Nanjing, Xian, Hangzhou, and Shenyang have completed. The formulation of transcentury overall urban planning has begun. -- New successes secured in urban construction included an additional water supply capacity of 6 million tons per day, gas supply capacity of 1.6 million cubic meters, waste water treatment capacity of 800,000 tons, and completed highways totaling 30 million square meters. Urban public transportation, particularly car- renting, has been developing rapidly. The construction of overpasses one over the other has become the feature of urban communications. -- Another new record was set in urban and rural housing construction last year with the completion of more than 900,000 square meters throughout the country. The special housing policy adopted by the Construction Ministry designed to solve housing problems has not only relieved housing shortage and replaced dilapidated houses, but also has boosted nationwide housing construction. -- The construction of villages and towns has entered a new phase. The development of rural economy and the relatively concentrated development of village and town enterprises have accelerated the development pace of small towns, which in turn have brought overall development to adjacent small villages. Hou Jie pointed out: While witnessing the strong development in construction undertakings, we should also pay attention to the solution of contradictions and problems. The ongoing large-scale construction has brought new challenges to urban planning and management, with certain localities placing preference of construction over urban planning. In particular, certain localities, being too eager to attract foreign funds for quick success and instant benefit, have blindly leased out lands without planning and incurred losses. For problems like serious fund shortage for both urban and rural construction, poor infrastructure, work quality, and frequent accidents, their solution needs unremitting efforts.
