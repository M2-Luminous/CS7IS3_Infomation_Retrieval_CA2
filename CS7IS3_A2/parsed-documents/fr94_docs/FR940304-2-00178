SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed highway project in Lafayette and Ray Counties, Missouri. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Donald Neumann, Program Review Engineer, Federal Highway Administration, Division Office, P.O. Box 1787, Jefferson City, MO 65102 Telephone: (314) 636&hyph;7104; or Bob Sfreddo, Division Engineer, Design Division, Missouri Highway and Transportation Department, P.O. Box 270, Jefferson City, MO 65102 Telephone: (314) 751&hyph;2876. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA in cooperation with the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on a proposal to improve State Route 13 in Lafayette and Ray Counties, Missouri. The proposed improvement would involve the reconstruction of Route 13 between the towns of Lexington and Richmond for a distance of approximately 13 miles. Improvements to the corridor are considered necessary to provide for the existing and projected traffic demand. Also, included in this proposal is the replacement of an existing deficient bridge across the Missouri River and the construction of a new interchange with U.S. Route 24. Alternatives under consideration include (1) taking no action; (2) using alternate travel modes; (3) improvement of the existing two-lane roadway to four lanes; (4) constructing a four-lane limited access highway on new location, and (5) constructing a four-lane fully access controlled highway on new location. Incorporated into and studied with the various build alternatives will be design variations of grade and alignment. A scoping process has been initiated that is involving all appropriate Federal, State and local agencies and private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have interest in this proposal. A series of public meetings are being held to obtain comments from the local and regional community. The first meeting was held in Lexington in early January and was followed by a second meeting in early February, 1994. In addition, a public hearing will be held. Public notice will be given of the time and place of the meetings and hearing. The draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearing. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments, and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or MHTD at the addresses provided above. Issued: February 18, 1994. Donald L. Neumann, Program Engineer, Jefferson City, Missouri. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4976 Filed 3&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;22&hyph;M
