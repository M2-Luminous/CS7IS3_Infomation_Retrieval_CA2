FBIS3-39872 "drweu036aa_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-094 Document Type:Daily Report 23 February 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS DPRK Denies Yongbyon Inspection; IAEA Extends Deadline AU2302121094 Paris AFP in English 1156 GMT 23 Feb 94 AU2302121094 Paris AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Vienna, Feb 23 (AFP) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] will probably give North Korea a few more days to issue visas to nuclear inspectors before sending the dispute to the UN Security Council, diplomatic sources said here Wednesday [23 February]. The sources were commenting before the IAEA's board of governors met to discuss the row over North Korea's year-long refusal to allow IAEA inspectors to check sites suspected of containing evidence of a nuclear bomb building program. If there has been no "favourable progress" by early March on an exact date for inspections to resume, IAEA general director Hans Blix should convene another meeting of the board of governors, which would send the issue to the Security Council to impose international sanctions on Pyongyang, the sources said. The standoff between Pyongyang and the international community appeared to be over last week, when North Korea said it would allow inspections to resume, but there has since been a delay in issuing visas for the inspectors. Seeking not to provoke Pyongyang, the sources here Wednesday avoided using the term "ultimatum." They said the new delay was because of bilateral U.S.-North Korean talks underway in New York. A U.S. official said Tuesday in New York that problems remained between the two sides, but that the question of issuing visas to international nuclear inspectors was not a major problem. Meanwhile North Korean Embassy counsellor Ho Jin Yun confirmed here Wednesday that his country was seeking a public announcement that military maneuvers between the United States and South Korea were being cancelled as one of its conditions for issuing the visas. He said the other conditions were: A simultaneous announcement in New York of the exact date for inspections, as well as the date for a third round of formal negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang, and a date for resuming talks betweeen the two Koreas. The official repeated however that a "special inspection" of two sites at Yongbyon, 95 kilometers (60 miles) north of Pyongyang, where the IAEA suspects liquid and solid nuclear waste -- evidence of a military nuclear program -- is stored, was "out of the question." Inspections would be limited to seven nuclear sites which North Kora has declared under an inspection agreement within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, he said.
