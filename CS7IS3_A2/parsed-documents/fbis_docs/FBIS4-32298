The article deals with the controversy over the unveiling of a plaque for Count Janos Esterhazy, an ethnic Hungarian politician who was sentenced to death for "high treason" in 1947, organized by the local organization of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) at Senec, western Slovakia. According to the article, the ceremony was to take place on 19 June at Senec, a town in which ethnic Hungarians make up 27 percent of the population, and was to be addressed by MKDH Deputy Pal Csaky and Esterhazy's daughter Alice. However, the preparations triggered protests from the local organization of the Slovak Heritage Foundation. According to Ferko, Slovak Heritage Foundation members from Senec were pointing out that, "by his political activity, Count Esterhazy contributed to the occupation of southern Slovakia (including Senec) by Horthy's fascist army and to the subsequent seizure of this territory by Hungary. After the war, he was proved guilty of antistate espionage for Budapest and sentenced for high treason." The protests of the local branch of the Slovak Heritage Foundation reportedly received backing from the Slovak Heritage Foundation leadership, which issued a statement saying that, "after the founding of the first Slovak Republic (in 1939), Esterhazy was pushing for the concept of renewing Greater Hungary." Before deciding on the matter, the article continues, J. Elsik, the mayor of Senec, asked the Bratislava City Court for its assessment of the case. In a written statement, the City Court reportedly stated that the verdict of 1947 (which was subsequently changed to a life sentence; Esterhazy finally died in prison in 1957) remains valid and that Count Esterhazy is therefore to be considered a "traitor." The article goes on to say: "On Thursday, 16 June, a meeting of the Senec City Council was convened with only one item on the agenda: to permit or not to permit the plaque. After a `complicated debate' (as is stated in the minutes of the meeting) and in the presence of Pal Csaky, deputy of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, the City Council finally decided not to allow the erection of the plaque." In conclusion, Ferko expresses the conviction that "those Senec residents of Hungarian nationality who regard Slovakia as their homeland--and I suppose this applies to the overwhelming majority of them--will receive the decision of the municipal deputies with understanding. And they will surely also realize that, once again, someone wanted to turn them into extras for his dubious political game. Our southern Slovakia really needs to refresh its historical memory--in a different direction, however: by renewing the destroyed monuments to Czechoslovak legionnaires who died while defending this territory against a Hungarian invasion in 1919." Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 18 June on page 2, in the "Single Question" column, carries a 150-word reply by MKDH Deputy Pal Csaky to a SLOVENSKY DENNIK reporter's question about the decision of the Senec City Council. Csaky says: "I was present at the meeting of the City Council on Thursday. Following a stormy discussion, we decided not to unveil the plaque, on which the inscription reads: `Let Us Act Together in Love and Understanding.' It is not the right time to commemorate someone when national passions are running high, especially if the whole situation is incompatible with this motto."
