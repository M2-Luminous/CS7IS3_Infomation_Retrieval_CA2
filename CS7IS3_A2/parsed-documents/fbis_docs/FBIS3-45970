Balladur warmly welcomed Qian and said: "We are very glad to see that the Sino-French relationship has entered a new era. The relationship is based on mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit and full confidence. "We should strengthen our consultations on major international issues, cooperation in economic trade and exchanges in culture and education, so as to further enhance Sino-French relations," he added. Qian conveyed Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng's sincere greetings and respect to Balladur and said Li is looking forward to Balladur's visit to China in the near future. Qian added that Balladur's visit, a major event in Sino-French relations, will promote the improvement and development of mutual beneficial trade relations between the two countries. "We hope to see that French enterprises will enhance competitive ability and take their proper share of China's market," he added. Qian noted that this year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic relations. In 1964, the two countries set up diplomatic ties under the personal guidance of the then French President General Charles de Gaulle, Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai. "Under the current international circumstances, as states assuming important responsibilities in international affairs, China and France should maintain good relations as a factor to retain balance and stability in the world," Qian said. Qian spoke highly about Balladur's efforts to improve Sino-French relations. He stressed that China has been consistently treasuring its relationship with France and agrees to fully improve and enhance the traditional and friendly cooperative relations between the two countries. "It is beneficial to both of us and the world," he added. "As long as the both sides are farsighted, Sino-French ties will surely move forward steadily for a long time," he said. During the meeting, Balladur said that on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-French ties, the French Government decided to dispatch a major delegation to visit China with two aims -- to join the celebration activities and to make preparations for Balladur's visit to China. "We hope that both sides will make common efforts to push forward Sino-French relations and contribute to peace, stability and development of the world," he added. After the meeting, Balladur asked Qian to convey his sincere greetings and best wishes to Prime Minister Li Peng.
