Dmitriy Bednyakov, 42 years old. A lawyer. Candidate of Juridical Sciences. In 1991, the session of deputies of the Nizhniy Novgorod City Soviet did not approve his candidacy for the post of head of the city administration. He was appointed acting head of administration by an edict of President of the Russian Federation B. Yeltsin. A year later, in February 1993, after an account about his activity, he received the absolute support of the deputies of the city soviet (105 votes out of 138 who voted). [Begin boxed item] From the program of Dmitriy Ivanovich Bednyakov, candidate for the post of head of local self-government of the city of Nizhniy Novgorod --social support of every Nizhniy Novgorod family, especially those with many children, and assistance to invalids and to the aged; --support of programs for the development of education and health services; --fight against crime; --support of Nizhniy Novgorod enterprises and entrepreneurs; --limiting local taxes and allocating tax benefits; --reduction of the bureaucratic apparatus and cuts in expenditures on administration. [End boxed item] [Kozlov] Dmitriy Ivanovich, in your opinion, what brought on the need for elections of the head of local self-government of Nizhniy Novgorod? [Bednyakov] Strange as it may seem, it is most of all associated with the adoption of the new Constitution. It provides for the rather independent existence of local self-government. Article 12 states explicitly that local self-government is not part of the system of organs of state authority. And this is the main reason for today's and future disputes that arise between organs of state authority of components of the Federation and local self-government. I would express the gist of the dispute in this way: Will there be or will there not be local self-government? Today, many governors and managers of executive authority of the Federation conduct themselves with respect to local self-government in approximately the same way that the center conducted itself two or three years ago with respect to the components of the Federation. Having received authority, they, with passionate force, do not want to part with it, although the Constitution does proclaim the independence of local self-government. But in fact, the governors do not need this independence, and they are resisting it as much as they can. They want the heads of local administrations to be appointed and not to be elected. Unfortunately, the president's administration often shares this point of view, although it also does not hinder elections where they are already designated. [Kozlov] That is, the issue is not to let local self-government break away from organs of state authority of the components of the Federation? [Bednyakov] Let us imagine, for example, two pillars: legislative authority and executive authority. If vacillations began at a high level, they were passed on down these pillars to the lowest level, to the rural soviets. Local self-government today seems to support the pedestal of both pillars. At the level of local self-government, legislative and executive, and I think in the near future the judicial functions as well, will merge and unite--we will also come to Justices of the Peace. In my opinion, the matter stands like this: The "pedestal"--local self-government--will get stronger, and stability and order will become firmly established. Vacillations at the upper level will stop influencing the life of every citizen in the country. Today, unfortunately, many managers of the components of the Federation do not understand this, and they simply do not want to share authority. [Kozlov] Probably, not so much executive as much as budgetary and financial authority? [Bednyakov] We analyzed the budgetary relations of the city. Interesting details were ascertained: In fact, the oblast budget was almost always equal to the consolidated budget of the city. But in the three last years, a trend in the sharp growth of the oblast budget and a reduction in the city budget have been noted. We are collecting more than 50 percent of the taxes that make up the budget of the oblast. Less than 20 percent remains with us. Virtually all financial resources are concentrated at the level of components of the Federation, but local self-government depends fully on representatives of executive authority. It is necessary to go and ask on every occasion. This is by no means a Nizhniy Novgorod dispute, but, if you like, an all-Russian dispute. [Kozlov] This means not only "to fight or not to fight," but also "to be or not to be" for local self-government in Russia? [Bednyakov] In order "to be," it is necessary, first, that both the representative organ and the head of local self-government absolutely be elected by the people. Second, it is necessary to set up an appropriate legislative base. Only in such a case will an elected person receive a vote of confidence from the people and depend less on who appointed him, even if it is the president himself. [Kozlov] Under what circumstances did you become mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod? Over the course of two years, what did you think was fundamental in your work? And what did you succeed in doing? [Bednyakov] I did not plan to become mayor. I collaborated as an expert and a consultant with the Supreme Soviet for two years--in committees on legislation, and on questions of legality, economic reforms, and property. I took part in the development of laws on privatization, foreign investments, enterprises, stock market funds, and many others. I became acquainted with Boris Nemtsov there. When the question on his appointment as governor was decided, he suggested that I become mayor. I refused for a long time, because I was planning to engage in science in an earnest way. I had published more than 40 publications, I was a candidate of juridical sciences and a docent, and a monograph appeared in the publication YURIDICHESKAYA LITERATURA. I planned in March 1992 to defend my doctoral dissertation, but Mr. Governor persuaded me. As of this date, we have departed substantially from totalitarian economics, and from a totalitarian state. Since we are talking about the economy, then it is already mixed in Nizhniy Novgorod, and in some sectors--trade and public catering--with a predominance of private capital. It is also possible to talk about elements of a democratic, civic society. What did we succeed in doing? First, to form a city administration team that worked on the resolution of city problems "not for the sake of personal profit." It was possible to achieve a certain stability in the work of the city economy and transport. Nizhniy Novgorod has one of the lowest rates of decline in production in Russia. Our entrepreneurship is fairly well developed. Finally, we succeeded in establishing a rather effectively acting mechanism of social protection of the poor. Although we are only at the beginning of the road. I do not like such words as the "Nizhniy Novgorod experiment," the "training ground," and so forth. We have always acted independently and in the interests of the residents of our city. But the main result of my "mayoralty" is that a definite reserve of stability for the future has been established. [Kozlov] Both you and Boris Nemtsov are known in Russia, and even beyond its boundaries, as staunch reformers and organizers of the famous Nizhniy Novgorod "economic miracle." An article appeared in the press recently that indicates that differences have arisen between you. What is the gist of these differences? Are they associated with the forthcoming elections for mayor in Nizhniy Novgorod? [Bednyakov] This is not an easy question for me. We do not have any fundamental differences regarding how to reform the economy. But it turned out that on the threshold of the elections, Governor Boris Nemtsov is not supporting me, but another person. I thought for a long time about the reasons for this behavior of the governor, and I came to the conclusion that there are two reasons. First: I told the governor too often about the mistakes he made and is making. Let us put it this way--he got sick of this. Although as a physicist, he should know that you can only be supported by that which offers resistance. It is impossible to lean on anything that does not offer resistance. The second reason, apparently, is that I consistently defended the interests of the city. Moreover, it is not so much a question of the redistribution of power as it is very simple things. If I am charged with appropriate functions and duties, this means I should receive the necessary amount of authorities and resources in order to fulfill them. There are laws on the status of judges, on the militia, and on the protection of the rights of servicemen. It is written there that I am obliged in the course of six months to give an apartment, install a telephone, set up their children in kindergartens, and so forth. When I say: Give me the money for this, they reply: You will get by! And I am left one on one with infuriated people.... I will never resign myself to such an understanding of authority--on the one hand, to control everything and, on the other hand, not to be responsible for anything. We seem to be dealing here with an inverted triangle. With its point, that is, with a real capability to resolve society's social problems, it is aimed downward. At the same time, from the standpoint of control and the capability to distribute financial and various resources of these sides, it is aimed endlessly upward. There is this concept of "city-forming enterprises." Previously, they were financed from the budget. Of the allocated resources, 20-30 percent went for the development of the city infrastructure. All of this ended in 1990. According to our calculations, Nizhniy Novgorod city enterprises received R900 billion less than was due. And, meanwhile, city infrastructures are becoming dilapidated. We are not being given any money. People come to us because of housing, the roof is leaking, the heating system does not work.... The most difficult for me is when I have to refuse. I am told: Lie, promise more. I cannot. [Kozlov] In what way does your preelection program differ from the program of the other candidate? [Bednyakov] Sociologists claim that 80 percent of a preelection campaign should be built on lies and promises. Thus, Mr. Krestyaninov--my rival--claims that the problem of dilapidated housing can be resolved in two years. There are 7,000 dilapidated homes in the city. Can this problem really be solved in two years? This is how our programs differ. My program is a critical analysis of what has been done and a specific direction for the city's development in the future. His program is hare-brained schemes and promises. I am for a Nizhniy Novgorod self-government charter, in which individual rights would be strengthened. Krestyaninov is opposed. He wants from the beginning to adopt a charter for Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast in which city "freedoms" would be limited appreciably and subordinated to oblast executive authority. I am for a strong city. Then there will also be a strong oblast. He wants to reduce the significance of the city. [Kozlov] In your opinion, is the situation at the Gorkiy Automobile Plant changing for the better or for the worse? How was the dispute resolved between Boris Nemtsov and Vidyayev, director of the automobile plant, in which both the president and the chairman of the government took part? [Bednyakov] There is a rather severe, and I would say unprecedented, directive of the government, signed by Chernomyrdin. Nemtsov has two claims against the automobile plant. First: He says that there was a blunder in foreign investments. So, a new director will come--Pugin--and then.... I think this is an illusion. Foreigners will not invest in the Russian automobile plant. They do not need competitors. Indeed, they are not in much of a hurry with investments in general. The second claim is that Vidyayev is managing the plant poorly. Pugin will manage better. However, the plant not only has not come to a stop, but it is even increasing the volume of production. By comparison with 1992, the increase in passenger cars totaled 26 percent! The automobile plant is kept under strict executive discipline. If you now begin to reform it drastically, introduce new methods of management, and so on, it could fall apart and come to a halt. But the Gorkiy Automobile Plant is the heart of the city and the oblast. I am afraid that, with the arrival there of a new person who is not burdened by any kind of obligations to the plant collective, the entire plant social sphere will be instantly sloughed off on the city budget. And this is 30-40 percent of all of the housing! The plant now independently maintains its own social infrastructure. In the meantime, preparations are under way to collect stockholders. Incidentally, the situation with vouchers, which the managers of the plant allegedly accumulated for money allocated from the budget, is not really that simple. They claim that they bought the vouchers for resources earned owing to the additional output of passenger cars. The results of the check auction have not been canceled. An annual balance will be conducted at the end of March, and everything will become clear then. [Kozlov] The city charter, in whose development you participated directly, will be submitted in a referendum simultaneously with the election to mayor. What will the charter give to the people of Nizhniy Novgorod? [Bednyakov] The charter is the springboard around which the policy of the city authorities will be formed--it is the legislative base. The charter describes who can do what, what cannot be done by someone, and what rights citizens have. For example, it states there: "Citizens have the right to collective petitions and appeals. Citizens have the right to attend any meetings of the organs of local self-government. Citizens have the right to be heard out by any official." This is a charter that restricts the arbitrariness of officials and protects the rights of ordinary citizens. We want to print it for wide circulation, so that it would be in every apartment, and so that people not only know, but also would be able to defend their own rights. [Kozlov] Dmitriy Ivanovich, in your opinion, what is now determining the political and economic situation in the country? Which way is Russia moving--toward confrontation or stabilization? [Bednyakov] I think that a repetition of the events of October of last year is not likely. The people are tired of politics and will hardly actively support any one of the disputing parties. There are fewer and fewer reasons today for upheavals in society. People's expectations are associated not so much with the possible actions of the authorities as with specific matters--theirs and those close to them. And this is the beginning of stabilization. People are beginning to realize that their fate is in their own hands and that they are able to improve their life. And if life is changing for the better, no one needs any upheavals.
