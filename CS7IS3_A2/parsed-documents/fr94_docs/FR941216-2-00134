FR941216-2-00134 FR941216-2-00080 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,133] Tunnelton Mining Co,; Uniontown, PA; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration By an application dated November 2, 1994, District # 5 of the United Mine Workers of America (UMW) requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance, TAA. The denial notice was issued on October 13, 1994 and published in the Federal Register on November 1, 1994 (59 FR 54631). Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances: (1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous; (2) if it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously considered; or (3) of the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration of the decision. Investigation findings show that the workers produce steam coal for electric power customers. Investigation findings show that imports of coal were negligible in 1993. Other findings show that the Department's survey of the Tunnelton's sole customer shows that the customer did not import steam coal or fuel oil in the relevant period. Other investigation findings show that the mine closed because the contract with the sole customer expired. Conclusion After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly, the application is denied. Signed at Washington, DC, this 7th day of December 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30906 Filed 12&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
