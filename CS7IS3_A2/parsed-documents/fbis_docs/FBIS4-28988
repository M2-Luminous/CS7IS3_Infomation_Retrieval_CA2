A six-monthly trade analysis by the Department of Foreign Affairs also showed a 17.5 percent rise in exports of elaborately transformed manufactures (ETMs) to the world, dominated by a 30 percent increase to Asia. Japan remained Australia's largest export market, accounting for almost a quarter of total merchandise exports worth 15.6 billion dollars. At the same time, Australia imported 11.8 billion dollars worth of goods from Japan, resulting in a trade surplus of 3.8 billion dollars. Australia's total merchandise trade rose by 10 percent in current dollar terms to 125 billion dollars, with eight percent export growth and a 12 percent increase in imports, the report said. Coal remained the biggest commodity export, representing 12.3 percent of Australia's total merchandise exports. "While merchandise trade recorded another surplus -- 454 million in 1993 -- the relative strength of imports has reduced it substantially from the high of four billion dollars in 1991 and the 1992 level of nearly three billion dollars," the report said. It attributed the fall in the surplus to a decline in the terms of trade, associated with continued weakness in world commodity prices, increased demand for imports flowing from the relatively strong@rate of domestic recovery and subdued economic activity in a number of key export markets. Exports to the United States dropped in 1993 by about one percent, while US imports grew by seven percent, increasing the trade surplus in favour of the United States to 8.1 billion dollars. During the same period exports to European Union countries also fell by three percent while imports from the EU grew by eight percent, the trade imbalance worsening for Australia to 6.4 billion dollars. A statement released by Trade Minister Bob McMullan's office said the figures clearly indicated the government's closer integration with Asia was paying dividends in the form of increased export earnings. Exports to the East Asia region, including Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand -- increased by eight percent to 37 billion dollars.
