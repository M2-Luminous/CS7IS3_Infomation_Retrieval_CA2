Strike readiness has been reported by 18 regions and branches of the trade union. Similar action in [Upper] Silesia and in the energy-fuel industry is to be expected after 1 March. Strikes of railroads workers, most probably between 0500 [0400 GMT] and 0700 [0600 GMT], will be coordinated by the Protest Action Headquarters. "The railroads workers have their own demands; however, this is also the protest of the entire trade union due to the fact that the government has not responded to our demands," said "Solidarity" Spokesman Piotr Zak. "The Presidium of the National Committee [KK] has given the government until 1 March to guarantee the implementation of the demands. Following this date, escalation of strikes should be expected," said Zak. On Tuesday [22 February], after many hours of discussions, the KK Presidium decided not to reveal the strike scenario. Zak merely said that preparations are under way for a major action. "I will not call this a nationwide strike; however, the readiness to stage a strike very quickly has been reported by seven branches and 11 regions," revealed the union's spokesman. KK Secretary Stanislaw Alot believes that the problem is not whether to strike, but when to strike. "Our protest is supposed to force a change in the 1994 budget bill," recalls Alot. Other demands of the union are: curbing the energy price increase, giving property to citizens, passing a law on collective agreements by the Sejm, respecting the principle of representativeness of the organizations of employees and employers, changing the fiscal policy to a policy favoring families, abandoning the concept of "a different tax on excessive wage increases" [popiwek]. "Solidarity" also demands that all the negotiated decisions in the "Pact on Enterprise" be implemented. "The statements of some representatives of the government coalition suggest that the Sejm may adopt the budget of the state before 7 March. If this should happen, we will organize firm action earlier," stated Alot. Despite earlier statements, "Solidarity" authorities did not set the date of the strike in Silesia and in the fuel-energy industry. The representatives of the latter reported strike readiness on 7 March. Relevant decisions will have been made by the end of February. Observers emphasize that the 24 February strikes of the railroads workers will be a test for rank-and-file unionists and only after the strikes will the "Solidarity" authorities be able to evaluate the force that they can count on. According to unofficial sources, in recent days "Solidarity" has received several informal offers of talks with high-ranking representatives of the Belveder.
