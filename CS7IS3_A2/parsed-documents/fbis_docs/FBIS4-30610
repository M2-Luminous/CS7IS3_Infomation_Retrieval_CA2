Many leaders pinpointed yet another political crisis triggered by the resignation of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Saturday as a factor which drove the yen above the 100-to-the dollar level in Monday dealings in Tokyo. They expressed hopes that the political tempest will be calmed and the yen stabilized, while calling for boosted joint intervention by major economic powers. Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the yen's surge is "a regrettable matter both for the Japanese and global economy." Other leaders said the yen's renewed strength would rid the Japanese economy of the little vitality it has to recover. Even officials in the electric power and retail sectors, which can benefit from a stronger yen, are worried that high-yen drawbacks will outweigh merits. In the long term, the leaders also said, the high yen will accelerate the hollowing out of Japanese industry, encouraging further shifts to overseas production and boosting unemployment. To bring the yen under control, the business community urged an end to the political turmoil and more powerful actions by financial authorities in major countries. Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations, noted the United States could take measures to stop the dollar's fall, such as reducing the budget deficit and a raising interest rates. Itochu Corp. President Minoru Murofushi also suggested the Bank of Japan lower the official discount rate to discourage yen-buyers.
