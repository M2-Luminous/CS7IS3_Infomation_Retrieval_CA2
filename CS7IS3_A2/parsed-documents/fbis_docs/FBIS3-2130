A vice-director of the local XINHUA (the New China News Agency), Zhang Junsheng, challenged Sir Hamish's forecast in Wednesday's Budget that reserves of more than $141 billion and a Land Fund of $125 billion could be available to the SAR by March 1998. "If they are able to write it down, then we welcome it and hope they do what they say. The more reserves the better," Mr. Zhang said yesterday. "But I do not know whether this is only a blank cheque." Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang offered a more mild response when asked about the possibility of such huge reserves being left by the British. "China hopes that it (the Budget) will not leave a huge financial burden to Hong Kong people and the future SAR government," Mr. Shen said. Xu Yongfu, senior economist at the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China, said the surplus could have been bigger had there been no plans for overspending. "For example, the proportion of expenditure on social welfare is too big," he said. "What we are worried about is that Hong Kong, whose success lies very much on a spirit of diligence, will be turned into a welfare society." Britain guaranteed under the Memorandum of Understanding with China on the vast airport projects that $25 billion would be passed on. Sir Hamish responded that his "forecast" of the reserves growing to $269 billion, with the SAR's Land Fund added, was already in "black and white". "It's there in black and white at the back of the Budget speech," he said on radio. However, he rejected the suggestion that any extra written undertaking should be made. "I'm quite confident about those forecasts -- but they are forecasts -- they're based on assumptions," he said. "If things change radically then of course we change our policies accordingly, but they're secure, sensible and best-effect type forecasts." He said he was confident that his present forecasts could cope with a normal down-side scenario of the economy. "I can say I am confident that the reserves are sufficient to cater for at least one or two years of what you might call normal downside scenario. We are not looking at horrendous downside scenarios because they are not likely," Sir Hamish said. "The reserves partly exist to let you ride out any temporary difficulty for a year or two, so you can avoid a stop-go policy on expenditure." He also disagreed that his financial forecast was too optimistic. "I think it's probably better to say that we've been a little over-conservative in the past," he said. "We've revised the forecast upwards, it's true, in the light not just of last year but of the past three years. "I would say it's still a fairly conservative forecast. "It certainly does not assume that land sales, land prices and stock market turn-over continue at the present very-high rate." Sir Hamish said he was cautious in his forecasts for land-related income such as premiums and property stamp duty as the Treasury did not anticipate the same level of return in the 1994/95 year as the revised estimates for the current year. Secretary for the Treasury Donald Tsang Yam-kuen said that the property stamp duties to be collected in the current year would be $12 billion and the estimate for next year would be slightly more than $9 billion. Sir Hamish said that in forecasting land revenue, particularly on projections going beyond next year, the Government took a fairly cautious view. "We certainly don't project the existing level [of income] for we take a more cautious view than that."
