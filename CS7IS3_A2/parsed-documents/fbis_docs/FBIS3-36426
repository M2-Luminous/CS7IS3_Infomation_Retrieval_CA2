The referendum is to take place on March 6. Voters will be required to answer a single question: "Do you support that the Republic of Moldova develop as an independent and integral state within the borders recognized by the UN, pursue the policy of neutrality and maintain mutually beneficial economic relations with any state and that equal human rights be guaranteed to all citizens in accordance with principles of international law?" The Central Election Commission on parliamentary elections rejected the president's proposal that the referendum be held together with the parliamentary elections on February 27. However, the president acted in conformity with the current legislature and assumed the responsibility for holding of the sociological poll. According to observers in Kishinev, the Moldovan president's decision on the referendum was aimed at discouraging those who support the idea of unification between Moldova and Romania.
