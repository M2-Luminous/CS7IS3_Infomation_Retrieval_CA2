Speaking after a rally at the University of the Western Cape, he said Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel had apparently snubbed a Transkei Military Council offer for a joint public relations exercise to persuade Transkeians to allow NP canvassing in the territory. In a telephone conversation, Mr Kriel had wanted guarantees for the safety of NP offices and party workers in Transkei, Gen Holomisa said. However, Transkeians were under the impression that the South Africans were "hell-bent on our killing our people". For this fear to be dispelled, the two countries had to meet and work out a security plan, but Mr Kriel seemed to have neglected taking up his advice, Gen Holomisa said. "I cannot see how I can let him deploy his people (in Transkei) because of the security risk." Without a security agreement on political activities "the NP will have to take Casspirs; we do not have armoured vehicles". If agreement had not been reached within a week, the matter of NP canvassing in Transkei could be referred to the Independent Electoral Commission.
