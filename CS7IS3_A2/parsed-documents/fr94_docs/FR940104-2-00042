FR940104-2-00042 FR940104-2-00029 III. Regulatory Impact Statement A. Executive Order 12291 Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish a regulatory impact analysis for any notice that meets one of the E.O. 12291 criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to result in_ •An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; •A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or •Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. We propose to revise our national policy and to withdraw Medicare program coverage for NPT testing in the sleep disorder clinic. Because we do not have a national policy regarding NPT testing in other settings, we propose to exclude coverage, rather than withdraw coverage, for NPT testing by plethysmography and other monitoring devices in all other settings. In calendar year 1992, Medicare payment for NPT testing totaled approximately $840,000 for 13,000 allowed services. This is an increase of approximately 26 percent in expenditures and a 3 percent increase in the number of services over the previous year. We anticipate that future costs or savings as a result of this notice would be negligible. This notice would not meet the $100 million criterion nor would it meet the other E.O. 12291 criteria. Therefore, this notice is not a major rule under E.O. 12291, and an initial regulatory impact analysis is not required. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a notice would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all physicians, sleep disorder clinics, and manufacturers of devices for performing the NPT test are considered to be small entities. In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a notice may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.
