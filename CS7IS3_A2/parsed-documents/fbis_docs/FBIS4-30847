We recently talked about this openly in Brussels," we were told by National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk, who along with Aleksander Luczak, deputy prime minister and national education minister, signed at the National Education Ministry [MEN] yesterday an agreement on interministerial cooperation. According to Kolodziejczyk, military integration with Western Europe must take place simultaneously with economic integration, and it should be even more rapid. The minister said that he is determined to force this stand and be as consistent as "a raindrop that is persistently eroding a hole in a rock." The Atlantic Cooperation Council should give some thought to the most recent proposals by Russian Defense Minister Grachev concerning the extension of CSCE activities; however, work on such concepts should not be a mechanism blocking the processes of integration of some countries with proven systems in the West European security. National Defense Committee [KOK] Secretary Jerzy Milewski, who took part in the meeting in MEN, said yesterday that most probably next week KOK would hold a session, which was announced at the last meeting of the government. One of the issues to be discussed at the session is, among other topics, the controversial issue of the position of the head of the General Staff. The national defense minister is of the opinion that even in a short transition period -- for a year or two -- the issue should be regulated, before it is finally decided in the Constitution. This view is shared by Milewski. "Today the situation is still unsteady; everything depends on the current opinion of the president or the members of the government," he claims. According to the first deputy minister of national defense, on the basis of the Small Constitution it is not possible to take any radical steps aimed at clearing any doubts concerning the issue of subordinating the General Staff head. Therefore, a compensatory balance will be unavoidable. "The minister bears constitutional responsibility for the ministry that he is in charge of, including the Army, and these prerogatives cannot be changed for the time being. Political agreement between the Belveder and the coalition concerning the inviolability of the Small Constitution is in force," says Milewski. "The president is also responsible for the Armed Forces because he is the commander in chief. The fact that the president appoints the General Staff head after consulting the minister -- not at his request -- leads us to conclude that the legislator wanted to guarantee the president `direct transmission' [as published] to the Armed Forces, not merely as general supervision through the minister." Milewski believes that during a calm, rational debate, after the "issue is positioned" properly, it will be possible to reconcile all the stands, and satisfy the needs of both the Belvedere and the government. Political conclusions might be included, for example, in an interim law on the office of the minister of national defense and the office of the head of the General Staff.
