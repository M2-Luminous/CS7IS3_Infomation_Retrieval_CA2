Speaking on his arrival in Tunis for the OAU summit meeting, Mr. Mandela said South Africa's capabilities for meeting requests from other African countries were limited. He pointed out that the new government was still finding its feet. Mr. Mandela's remarks coincided with reports that he is expected to play a key role in attempts to end the slaughter in Rwanda. The three-day summit meeting is expected to be dominated by the Rwandan question. Other issues expected to be discussed by the leaders of the 53 member states are Africa's enormous debt, ethnic conflict, religious tension, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, and the failure of economic institutions in some regions. President Mandela held talks with King Hassan of Morocco on his way to Tunis. He first visited Tunisia in 1962 to ask for MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] soldiers to be trained. Earlier the OAU ministers conference decided to ask the UN to lift the sanctions imposed on Libya because of the Locherbie bomb blast. South Africa's foreign minister, Alfred Nzo, attended the meeting for the first time.
