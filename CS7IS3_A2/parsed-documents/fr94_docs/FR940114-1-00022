FR940114-1-00022 FR940114-1-00008 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Federal Highway Administration 23 CFR Part 1204 [NHTSA Docket No. 93&hyph;21; Notice 1] RIN 2127&hyph;AE90 Amendments to Highway Safety Program Guidelines AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Request for comments. SUMMARY: Section 2002 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), Highway Safety Programs, requires that the uniform guidelines for State Highway Safety Programs include six critical programs. The existing 18 Highway Safety Program Guidelines currently address four of the six programs identified in ISTEA, but do not specifically address Speed Control or Occupant Protection. The agencies therefore propose to amend the regulations by adopting guidelines for these two programs. The agencies also propose to issue a guideline on Roadway Safety, corresponding to the Roadway Safety Priority Program Area. In addition to three new guidelines, the agencies propose to revise six of the existing 18 guidelines to reflect new issues and to emphasize program methodology and approaches which have proven to be especially successful in these program areas. The guidelines the agencies propose to revise are as follows: Guideline No. 3␣Motorcycle Safety Guideline No. 8␣Alcohol in Relation to Highway Safety Guideline No. 10␣Traffic Records Guideline No. 11␣Emergency Medical Services Guideline No. 14␣Pedestrian Safety Guideline No. 15␣Police Traffic Services The agencies believe that the proposed revisions will provide more detailed guidance to the States.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 402 of the Highway Safety Act of 1966 directed the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate uniform standards for State highway safety programs, specified the subjects of several standards, and required States to conform to these uniform standards or risk losing portions of their Federal-aid highway funds. Between 1967 and 1972, the Secretary promulgated 18 Uniform Standards for State Highway Safety Programs (published at 23 CFR part 1204). Until 1976, the section 402 program was principally directed at achieving State and local conformance with the 18 Highway Safety Program Standards, which were considered mandatory requirements with financial sanctions available for non-compliance. In 1976, Congress provided for a more flexible implementation of the program so that the Secretary would not have to require State compliance with every uniform standard or with each element of every uniform standard. As a result, the standards became guidelines for use by the States. Management of the program shifted from one focused upon enforcing program standards to one focused upon problem identification, countermeasure development and evaluation, with the standards to be used as a framework for the State programs. Few changes have been made in the guidelines since that time.
