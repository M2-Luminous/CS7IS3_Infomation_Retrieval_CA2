FBIS4-13252 "drnes075_m_94017" FBIS-NES-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 JORDAN Weekly Views Sharp Deterioration in Ties With Iraq Weekly Views Sharp Deterioration in Ties With Iraq JN1904115494 Amman AL-MAJD in Arabic 18 Apr 94 pp 1, 11 JN1904115494 Amman AL-MAJD Arabic BFN [Text] The Jordanian-Iraqi relations have sharply deteriorated recently, particularly after the assassination of a prominent Iraqi opposition figure, Shaykh Talib al-Suhayl, by Iraqi diplomats in Beirut. His majesty's cable of condolences to the family of the deceased carried clear denunciation of the assassination. His majesty said that he "received the news with indignation and disgust," and that "it was perpetrated by vicious hands which derive their ability to commit evil from sick hearts that have been so blinded by hatred that they are accustomed to shedding innocent blood, forgetting that nothing will save them from the wrath of man and God." The killing of Shaykh al-Suhayl, who carried the Jordanian and Saudi nationalities and who is known for his friendship with his majesty the king and the Hashemites in Iraq, has put an end to the Jordanian-Iraqi attempts over the past two weeks to revive the Baghdad-Amman ties after a long period of stagnation and after Saudi Arabia insisted on its position and closed all doors of reconciliation with Jordan, which exerted tremendous efforts to mend fences. Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, the Jordanian deputy prime minister, went to Iraq last week on a visit that was not officially announced, carrying a special message from the king to Saddam Husayn. The message stressed Jordan's concern to restrengthen the Iraqi-Jordanian relations and face the U.S. pressures directed against Jordan through the continuation of the unjust blockade of al-'Aqabah port. President Saddam Husayn sent a reply which was brought to Amman by the Iraqi Information Minister Hamid Hammadi a few days ago. The Iraqi president welcomed the king's proposals and voiced Iraq's readiness to resume joint cooperation in the political and economic domains. However, the Iraqi information minister's visit to Jordan started a crisis with Jordan instead of effecting channels of contacts between the two countries. This is because of the way the Jordanian media reported the visit, describing the Iraqi official as envoy of the Iraqi leadership in contrast with the Iraqi media description of him as President Saddam Husayn's envoy. In order to ascertain if this allusion to the minister was an intentional move by the Jordanian decisionmakers or a media contrivance, the Iraqi side made contacts on all levels and was convinced that this was done by the Jordanian decisionmakers who wanted to officially ignore Iraqi President Saddam Husayn and depict Jordan as dealing with an Iraqi leadership and an Iraqi people. This crisis could have been contained if al-Suhayl had not been assassinated on the same day the Iraqi president's envoy arrived in Amman. Accusations were leveled at the Iraqi leadership based on the fact the he was a prominent Iraqi opposition figure. Al-Suhayl left Baghdad in 1958 following the 14 July revolution. He held Jordanian and Saudi nationalities and his name was recently mentioned as the mastermind behind the assassination attempt against President Saddam Husayn revealed by the U.S. press recently.
