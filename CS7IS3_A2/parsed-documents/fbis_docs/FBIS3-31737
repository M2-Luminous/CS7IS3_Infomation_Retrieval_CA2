After answering in detail all the issues raised in the letter, the declaration emphasizes that the PDSR has no other choice but take note of the fact that the PRM decided to suspend negotiations with the government party, a decision that was made by the PRM leadership, and therefore the responsibility for this act, as well as its consequences, lies exclusively with the nine members of the PRM Steering Committee. The declaration then says, quote, as a matter of fact, given the tone of the PRM leadership's letter, it is unlikely that we should find a basis for further dialogue, unquote. The declaration concludes by expressing the hope that the members of the PRM will understand the stance of the PDSR as, in the past, PDSR and PRM deputies and senators had identical or similar positions regarding a number of draft bills. The declaration reassures those parliamentarians, as well as the other members of the PRM that the PDSR remains open to dialogue, but solely if the leaders of the PRM will show proof of their responsibility, of the fact that they are prepared to adopt sensible stances, and that they are really preoccupied by the real problems of the country in the current transition period.
