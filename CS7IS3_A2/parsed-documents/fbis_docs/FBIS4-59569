The interim Friday prayers leader of Tehran referred to Britain's record in espionage activities and said: This recent espionage activity in London against the Islamic Republic of Iran demonstrates the continuation of plots hatched by arrogant countries against the Islamic revolution; but such conspiracies are, as ever, doomed to fail, thanks to the vigilance and alertness of the Muslim people of Iran. On the great hajj congregation, he said: The gathering of a cross-section of one billion world Muslims at pilgrimage is a suitable opportunity to review various political, social, and economic problems of the world of Islam and their solutions so that, upon their return to their countries, Muslims could implement those solutions. He said the designation of a day for the support of Bosnian Muslims by the eminent leader's representative office was a correct use of the hajj to draw the attention of Muslims to problems of the world of Islam. Ayatollah Emami-Kashani praised the people for participating in the international book exhibition and said: That matter shows that the people of Iran care about cultural issues.
