FR941205-1-00022 FR941205-1-00007 The Proposal On December 17, 1993, the FAA proposed to revise the Class E airspace at Hondo, TX (58 FR 65948). That action proposed to revise the 700 feet AGL Class E airspace to provide adequate controlled airspace for aircraft executing the recently established VOR SIAP to RWY 17. The comment period for that action ended February 19, 1994. Since the issuance of that Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), the FAA has discovered that the legal description contained in that proposal did not include the airspace required from the airport to 16 miles south of RBN. Therefore, this SNPRM proposes a correction to that legal description. Since this change expands the scope of the originally proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to reopen the comment period to provide an additional opportunity for public comment. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designated Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposed Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1.
