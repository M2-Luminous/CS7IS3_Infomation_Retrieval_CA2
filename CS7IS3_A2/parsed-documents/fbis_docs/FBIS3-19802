As far as risk-sharing is concerned, Germany can no longer claim a special role in Europe, Naumann said at the WELT AM SONNTAG-sponsored Bundeswehr-Forum in Berlin on Tuesday [22 March]. The Bundeswehr must be able to assume all the tasks that are asked of it within the framework of NATO, the Western European Union, and UN missions. In practice there cannot be a clear dividing line between humanitarian, peacekeeping, or peace-making operations. Anyone who withdraws his troops because one of these tasks cannot be clearly carried out is making a "clown of international politics" out of himself. He is no longer able to make people understand why, given Albania's permission, a German warship is unable for constitutional reasons to enter Albanian territorial waters to identify a foreign ship while implementing the embargo against the rump Yugoslavia. On 19 April, the Federal Constitutional Court will discuss these controversial foreign missions. Naumann sharply rejected the de facto equal treatment of military service and alternative civilian service, particularly since the Constitutional Court emphasized the precedence of military service. Only 5-10 percent of those doing alternative service were doing really hard work in social institutions, while the rest were rather enjoying privileges compared with doing military service, Naumann said. The inspector general then gave assurances that he was intending to implement consistently the recently presented report on cost restrictions regarding the operations of the Armed Forces.
