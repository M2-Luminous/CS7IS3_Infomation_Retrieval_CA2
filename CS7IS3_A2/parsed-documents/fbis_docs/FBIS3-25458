He told a press conference in Brazzaville that the government and the Israeli company, which he declined to identify, had signed an accord for the training. Mberri said the Israeli experts were already in Congo. He said the Israeli experts, who are already in the central African country, will "help the Congolese public force adapt to the new demands of democracy." The Israeli press recently reported that the Brazzaville government had signed an agreement with an Israeli firm, "Levdan," specializing in the sale of arms. The Israeli Defence Ministry, it said, gave its approval for the conclusion of the 50 million-dollar contract which also includes the training of senior officers in the Congolese Army. In a statement issued on Sunday in Brazzaville, the Congolese opposition described the accord as "criminal" and a waste of money. The 30 billion CFA contract sum as given by Israeli sources, the opposition said, was two years pay for 8,000 workers that the government is about to lay off. It said the accord also "conflicts with the dynamics of peace initiated in Congo". The opposition warned the government against the "consequences on the foreign community, especially whites, because of the confusion which would be generated by a popular resistance against repression." However, Mberri defended the accord saying the government took "a special credit" for the programme. "The agreement is normal. It will allow the public force to have new aptitudes and promptly respond to the new forms of contest," Mberri said, stressing that the Armed Forces and police have not succeeded in ending recent ethnic clashes. Mberri revealed that other countries, like France, had agreed to train and assist the Congolese Army, Gendarmerie and police. He said that the government was planning "to revitalise the ageing Army and police cadres." On the deployment of a buffer force in the quarters of south-west Brazzaville which have been the areas of factional fighting, the minister said it would be deployed on Sunday, after delays due to technical, logistic and financial problems.
