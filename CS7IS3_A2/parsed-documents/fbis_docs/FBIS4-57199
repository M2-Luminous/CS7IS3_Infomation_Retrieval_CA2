Until a specific Law on the subject is dictated, any petition concerning the Habeas Data Constitutional Guarantee mentioned in Clause No. 3 of Article No. 200 of the Constitution may be heard, at the plaintiff's choice, by a lower civil court of either the venue where the plaintiff resides; or of where the mechanical, automatic [telematicos], magnetic, informatic, or similar records are located; or of the venue corresponding to the address of the defendant, irrespective of whether the defendant is an individual or a corporation, a public or private company. If the violation of rights stems from court records, be they of a jurisdictional, functional, or administrative nature, no matter where and how they are stored, the case will be heard by the respective Civil Chamber of the Superior Court of Justice, which will appoint a lower court judge to handle the procedure. The lower court will then hand down the first ruling in this case. This same precept will apply to functional or administrative archives of the Attorney General's Office. Article 2. The court ruling will merely order the publication of the rectification requested by the plaintiff, who must have attached the wording of it to his original petition. If he fails to do so, the court will offhandedly dismiss the petition. The rectification--which must be reasonable and proportionate to the offending article--will be published free of charge within three days after the ruling has become final. Failure to do so will result in violation of the law. Any disagreement regarding the rectification, its proportionality, and its content will be decided on by the corresponding judge or civil chamber of the Superior Court, after hearing the defendant within three days. The judge must correct or restrict the requested rectification whenever it entails a rebuttal or viewpoint that surpasses the limits of a mere rectification. Although the aggrieved party may appeal, the ruling will stand until it is reversed by a higher court. Article 3. Provisions applicable to Laws No. 23506, 25011, 25315, 25398, and Decree Law No. 25433, and everything referring to the right of Amparo, with the exception of the provisions of Article No. 11 of Law No. 23506, will be applicable to the Habeas Data Constitutional Guarantee in case of procedural loopholes. Article 4. The provisions contained in the above articles will also be applicable to the constitutional guarantee known as Action of Compliance that is mentioned in Clause 6 of Article 200 of the Constitution until the appropriate implementing law is promulgated. In this case, the provisions contained in Article 11 of Law 23506 will be applied when necessary. Article 5. In addition to what is provided for in Article 27 of Law 23506 and supplementary instruments, a petition for a Compliance Action Constitutional Guarantee will require the following prior steps: A. In the case of a habeas data petition based on Clauses 5 and 6 of Article 2 of the Constitution, the request should first be made through a notary public no less than 15 calendar days in advance, with the exceptions provided for in the Constitution and in the laws. B. In the case of a Habeas Data petition based on Clause 7 of Article 2 of the Constitution, the request should first be made through a notary public no less than five calendar days in advance of the publication of the corresponding rectification; and C. In the case of an Action of Compliance, the request will be made through a notary public to the pertinent authority asking him to discharge what is considered to be his duty under the law, or the fulfillment of the appropriate administrative action or undertaking no less than 15 days in advance. Honoring this request will not exempt the official from his responsibilities under the law. Article 6. A request concerning the Habeas Data Constitutional Guarantee will be directed against the legal representative of the respective institution or corporation, except when the action is directed against an individual. In the latter case, the individual will be summoned directly without this having any bearing on the provisions of Article 12 of Law 25398. To this end, legally constituted media organizations, irrespective of the type of communication used--whether oral, written, radio, press, or television--can name a Special Judicial Representative, through a notarial deed, who will have the full right, on the merit of his naming, to the powers outlined in Articles 74 and 75 of the Civil Code, and no pact to the contrary could be used to interfere with these powers. He will be empowered to act in the name the media that has been summoned or in the name of its editors, officials, journalists, or employees in general even if they have been summoned as individuals. The individual that is summoned by name will be held legally accountable for his action. The appointment of the special judicial representative need not be registered in the public rosters, and his actions will be fully valid, even though his naming has been previously revoked, until the appropriate court or chamber has been informed of this fact. The authorization to empower a judicial representative will also be extended to the actions pertaining to crimes against honor (defamation, insult, or slander) when the crime is attributed to a media organization. Article 7. The Constitutional guarantee of the Action of Compliance will be directly attended to by the official or agency in charge of the required action. If the agency or official could not be identified, or if there is no certainty as to who should attend to it, the action will be directed to a more senior superior without prejudice to what has been established in Article 12 of Law No. 25398. Temporary Provision A. Habeas Data petitions filed before the present law becomes effective, on which no ruling has yet been handed down by a judicial authority having a different specialty from the one described under Article 1 of the present law, will be officially and under liability turned over to the civil first instance judge who was on duty on the date the request was filed; B. Habeas Data petitions that had been filed before the present law becomes effective, and rejected by a final judicial ruling, will have full effect. Those petitions on which no final ruling has been passed will be turned over to the judicial authority hearing those cases pursuant to what has been stipulated in the above paragraph; C. Habeas Data petitions approved by a final judicial ruling issued by a judicial authority other than the one indicated under Article 1 before the present law becomes effective will continue with its procedure before the said authority. These petitions will be dealt with and settled pursuant to the rules of procedure set forth for a writ of Amparo and the present law pursuant to the provisions of Article 2 of this law. FINAL PROVISION The present law will come into force on the day subsequent to its publication in the EL PERUANO DIARIO OFICIAL. Let it be known to the President of the Republic for its publication. In Lima, 18 April 1994. Jaime Yoshiyama President of the Democratic Constituent Congress TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC Hence: I order it to be published and enforced.
