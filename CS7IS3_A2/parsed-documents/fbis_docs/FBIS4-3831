After hearing a briefing on efforts to extinguish the forest fire, Minister Xu Youfang relayed the following four directives by the State Council: 1. Efforts should be made to adopt practical and effective measures for the operation and to make use of topographical advantages to create a separation gap and to pay attention to watching the fire situation. 2. We should be determined to concentrate strong forces on waging a battle and make good arrangements for ensuring support services for the safety of personnel. 3. We should maintain close contact with the meteorological departments and be aware of weather changes at all times. 4. We should report the disaster situation to the State Council at all times. Minister Xu Youfang said: The pine trees of Zhangzi species are rare and the forest zones of such trees are the state wealth. The State Council attaches great importance on the seed forest base of Zhangzi-species pine trees in the Honghuaerqu forestry administration bureau. Thus, the struggle against the forest fire is important and greatly significant. The organizational and commanding work undertaken by the headquarters to extinguish the fire should be keyed up and carried out in a orderly manner. Responsibilities for the operation should be clearly defined, in addition, the policies and orders should be carried out in a unified manner. Meanwhile, efforts should be made to ensure support services to avoid missing opportunities to fight the fire.
