FR940825-0-00123 FR940825-0-00020 The provisions for the initial applications for gillnet endorsements, contained in §642.4(m)(4), are temporary. Therefore, that paragraph is effective only through October 31, 1994. The provisions of new §642.28(b)(2), which depend on the presence or absence of a gillnet endorsement on a vessel permit, and the related prohibitions at §642.7(t), (u), and (v), are not effective until November 1, 1994. This will allow sufficient time for fishermen to submit requests for gillnet endorsements and for NMFS to process and issue them. Classification The Regional Director determined that Amendment 7 is necessary for the conservation and management of the fishery for coastal migratory pelagic resources and that it is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. The Councils prepared an IRFA as part of Amendment 7, which concluded that this rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In response to a comment from the SBA, NMFS prepared an FRFA that provides additional analysis of the effects of management alternatives on small businesses; the FRFA supports the same conclusions regarding significant economic impacts as were reached by the IRFA. A copy of the FRFA is available from the Councils (or NMFS) (see ADDRESSES ). This final rule contains a collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act_ specifically, applications for gillnet endorsements on vessel permits. This collection of information has been approved by OMB under OMB control number 0648&hyph;0205. The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 30 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collections of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of the collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Edward E. Burgess, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive, St. Petersburg, FL 33702 and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Washington, DC 20503 (Attention: NOAA Desk Officer).
