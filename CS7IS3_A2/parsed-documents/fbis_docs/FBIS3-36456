Gerashchenko declared that the outstanding debts of the state to some sectors of the economy, and farmers, in particular, would be paid, although not simultaneously. Gerashchenko said that the total debt amounts to almost eight trillions roubles. Chairman of Russia's Central Bank pointed out that the question of outstanding debts was discussed at a session of the Russian Government on Thursday, adding that the matter would be finalized during next week and afterwards, positively resolved. Russian lawmakers found it a paradox to hear Gerashchenko say that currently, the system of mutual payments has been working better than before, including with former Soviet republics. Gerashchenko pointed out that there is an active balance of payments between Russia and CIS countries. "We are pursuing a policy of restricting credits issued to CIS countries from the state budget," Gerashchenko said. Asked where Russia will find money to grant a credit to Georgia, Gerashchenko replied that "our leaders can prove to the State Duma that such a credit is necessary." Commenting on the current financial situation in Russia, Gerashchenko said that "we have been going up the spiral of inflation all the time." He admitted that the Central Bank spent over a million dollars in January alone to stabilise the rouble exchange rate. Gerashchenko pointed out that according to estimates made by the Central Bank, last year, the budget deficit was within 10.5 per cent of the gross national product. But in his opinion, "no tragedy has occurred." Gerashchenko declared that currently, "we have been constantly experimenting which might trigger inflation to a certain degree and perhaps, we shall not attain the reduction of the budget deficit by 5 per cent of the size of the gross national product as we would like to do."
