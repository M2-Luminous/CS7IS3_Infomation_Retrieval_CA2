It is known that Germany wants a permanent seat in the highest decisionmaking body of the United Nations -- this has been repeatedly pointed out by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel -- and the Federal Government "is in close contact with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on this issue," a short statement stressed. It was apparently considered embarrassing that, first, the criticism came from New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon, and, second, that McKinnon made his statement on Wednesday evening [27 April] as acting president of the Security Council. He described Japan as a "logical candidate" and expressed reservations vis-a-vis Germany, pointing out that there would be "too many white faces" if the Germans joined the UN Security Council. The implementation of Germany's claim, which results from the changed world political map, will be difficult and only possible on a long-term basis because a decision must be made by the General Assembly -- after the presentation of the structural reform that does not yet exist. The secretary general is not entitled to vote. The 15-nation body has had five permanent members since 1945: The United States, Russia, China, France, and Great Britain. These five states also enjoy the right of veto in all decisions.
