Police searched the office of the "Taihi-kai" in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, after the arrests of its members Kuniyasu Uchiyama, 41, and Toshikazu Furusawa, 29. Uchiyama and Furusawa were arrested Friday evening after holding Kei Aragaki, 57, an executive in charge of the paper's public relations department, and Mikinori Yoshida, 51, the head of the secretarial department, for nearly six hours in an executive reception room on the 15th floor. The two men were armed with a handgun, a sword and carried four sticks of dynamite, police said. The rightists surrendered and released the two hostages unharmed after police and the group's chairman, Kazuo Nakadai, urged them to abandon their mission, police said. Aragaki told reporters at the headquarters Saturday morning that the two men repeatedly demanded during the hostage drama that newspapers and television networks report their point of view. He said he rejected their demands. As the pair broke into the building, they passed out pamphlets describing the country's mass media as a "Class A war criminal" and called on the ASAHI SHIMBUN to "amend the tone of its news coverage." The pamphlets also criticized Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for refusing to retract a statement apologizing for Japan's wartime activities in Asia which he termed a "war of aggression." "(It) was an unusual situation but I did not feel any fear because it didn't seem like they would hurt us," Aragaki said. Aragaki said he told the two men as he was being released that "(Japan) is a democratic society, so why don't we debate?" He said Uchiyama replied, "we were reluctant to act like this but it was our choice of life." On October 20 last year, Shusuke Nomura, 58, then leader of the group, entered the building and shot himself dead during a meeting with the company's executives in protest over the use of a cartoon parodying his group in a weekly magazine affiliated with the ASAHI SHIMBUN.
