Commission President Delors will make a declaration on Thursday afternoon [17 February] saying in so many words that the move is not in the spirit of the Union treaty. Diplomats say that the unilateral move by Athens is not conducive to the European Union's [EU] "cohesion." Greece currently holds the EU presidency. "The Union must stick together as a union," a spokesman said. "The Greek move does not contribute to this." Resentful reactions to Athens' move had already been seen at political talks between top civil servants from the member states on Tuesday evening. It is usual for a member state taking measures outside the Union to first contact the council. However, the Greek representative appeared to be clearly embarrassed by his government. The argument that a Greek harbor was concerned did not sound very convincing to those present, according to a diplomat. The question will probably come up in the sidelines of the talks to be held in Athens on Thursday and Friday by the ministerial EU troika. This troika consists of Greece, Belgium and Germany, the present, past, and future EU presidents. A spokesman said it was not usual for the troika to publicly put a member state in the pillory without prior consultation with the Union member states. [passage omitted]
