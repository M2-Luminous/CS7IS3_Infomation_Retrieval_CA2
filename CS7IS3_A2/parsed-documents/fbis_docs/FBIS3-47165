At Friday's meeting of working-level officials on price stabilization, the participants decided to resort to old methods based on "administrative guidance" to control the prices of some commodities and services which have recently shown signs of increasing. Among major steps decided in the meeting were to increase the number of commodities and services to be subject for special price control from the previous 20 to 30, including rice, sugar and underwear, the prices of which will be curbed within 5 percent. The government's antitrust watchdog and tax authorities will conduct investigations into businesses which raise prices. Some businesses, apparently threatened with the government's adamant anti-inflationary stance, backed away from their planned price hikes. Domestic auto makers, which had announced plans to raise the prices of some models by up to 400,000 won ($500), have changed their minds. Makers of coffee and soft drinks who have recently increased their prices will likely soon follow the example of auto companies, industry sources said yesterday. The price spiral has been triggered by the recent remarks of Chong Chae-sok, new deputy prime minister and minister of economic planning. The government's top economic official, as soon as he was inaugurated, made it clear that the government will allow some public service charges which had long been forced down to go up, reflecting cost-push factors. Chong's remarks were followed by actual raise in transportation fares and cigarette prices, giving a much-anticipated excuse for private industries to follow the government's example. Chong, faced with mounting concerns in various sectors of society about the resurging specter of inflation, later retreated from his initial position, which he said was aimed at respecting market forces and giving a freer hand to the private sector to strengthen competitiveness. Thanks to the swift return to old inflation-combating methods, the brief but turbulent social turmoil rooted in deep fears about price pressure will likely subside, at least for the moment. Damaged amid this uproar will once again be the administrative credibility, analysts said. Also, price stabilization will likely re-emerge as the most contentious issue in Korean society this year, when and if the government appears to let up its tight inflationary control, they said. The price controversy which hit the domestic economy from the start of 1994, however, should in no way affect the new economic team's much-heralded policy switch to give priority to market force and the private sector, the analysts said.
