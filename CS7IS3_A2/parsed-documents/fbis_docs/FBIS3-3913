The Modern Culture Society of China, which held its founding meeting within earshot of students parading for change in May 1989, will turn its attention to ancient Chinese culture, say founding members at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (Cass) in Beijing. The renamed Chinese Cultural Society will stress "the traditional virtues of the Chinese people", one founding member said. "We will no longer pay attention to modern problems. It's no good doing that now." The society has been under strict supervision by the State Council, which runs Cass, since its brief flirtation with free expression in 1989, members said. "The society was established during a high-point of discussion about Chinese culture and society. We could hear the students chanting on Changan Avenue during the founding meeting," one member said. The original 50 members came mainly from the history and literature departments of leading Beijing universities. "The permitted scope of the society has faced many restrictions. Not all the territory has been opened for discussion," said one member at the People's University. The move into an area more palatable to the senior leadership will be supported by the central government, which will approve a national charitable society to support the new group's academic endeavours, the founding member said. Wealthy foreign and domestic businessmen will be sought as benefactors of the Chinese Cultural Research Fund, which the central bank was expected to grant tax-free status as a charity this year. The society has been suffering from money shortages since its inauspicious founding and had difficulty scraping together funds for its fifth anniversary celebration this year. About 60 mainland scholars attended the society's seminars in Beijing in 1991 and in Hainan province last year. The society was criticised by Beijing leaders after a resolution was passed at the Hainan seminar calling for "a new culture to fit the new era". "This was at odds with the party's stress on the construction of a civilised society based on traditional Chinese morals and values," said one member who attended the Hainan seminar, entitled "Trends in modern Chinese culture". Months of internal bickering among members about how to resolve the society's financial and intellectual crises finally ended earlier this month when a decision was made to "follow the trend and concentrate on ancient things", one member said. Some dissenting members have resigned from the society in protest. "They have effectively ended the whole idea of the society," said one ex-member. "In five years of activities they never managed to achieve a breakthrough."
