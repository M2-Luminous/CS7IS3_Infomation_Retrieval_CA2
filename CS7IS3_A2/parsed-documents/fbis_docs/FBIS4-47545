The difficulty of species identification with the help of available DNA probes because the vct genes are present in the genomes of far from all Vibrio cholerae strains and have a high homology with the Escherichia coli toxin genes necessitated the development of a species-specific probe and formulation of a new V. cholerae identification method on the basis of DNA molecular hybridization. The findings demonstrate that not only the intact 1.74 kD HindIII fragments but their component segments are absolutely specific and have a sensitivity of 10[.sup]6[/] microbial cells or 60 �g of purified total chromosomal DNA. The development of the species-specific probe makes it possible reliably and quickly to identify a large number of freshly separated V. cholerae strains and determine their epidemic hazard. This approach precludes an incorrect diagnosis for infections caused by pathogenic E. coli strains containing elt genes in their genome. Figures 1; tables 1; references 28: 13 Russian, 15 Western.
