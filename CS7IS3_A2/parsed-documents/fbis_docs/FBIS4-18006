The head of state paid considerable attention to goods manufactured by Ukrainian enterprises participating in the exhibitions and noted that they were making significant efforts to represent Ukraine worthily worldwide. Journalists asked the head of state to comment on some aspects of political life in Ukraine. He was asked, in particular, to make more specific his stance on the upcoming presidential election, which is known, as well as to state what the president would do if the new parliament disagreed with his arguments. Kravchuk said the following: [Begin Kravchuk recording] First, you do not know my whole position. I always emphasize the following: No matter what our assessment of the situation in Ukraine is at present--either mild or strong--there is constitutional chaos and constitutional crisis, which is a fact because Ukraine is perhaps the only former Soviet Union state that has not adopted its constitution or formed new real bodies of judicial power in four years--i.e., let us say, any branches of power. Even Belarus, it seems, has already finished recently and has adopted a Constitution. Belarus is holding elections after this, with the structure of power, branches of power, and system of power having been determined expressly and clearly at the constitutional level. We, unfortunately, have not gotten this far. We have been busy all the time but have never gone all the way. We did not finalize the issue of a local executive power at a specific time in the past. We formed presidential structures but also began granting executive powers to representative bodies. Thus, instead of, let us say, softer, gradual transition from diarchy to the centralization of, shall we say, executive power, we have constantly been causing diarchy to worsen. Now, if you are carefully following speeches, you can hear the accents and voices: Power must be in one pair of hands. This is so. Let me raise the question, however: Where exactly in one pair of hands? If it is Kiev, one can assume, for instance, that executive power is transferred to one pair of hands, either to the president or to the Cabinet of Ministers. To do this, however, changes to the Constitution should be made. Power in one pair of hands in Kiev, however, does not at all mean that it is in one pair of hands in Ukraine, because what is being proposed now--forming power at the regional level--in villages, towns, cities, rayons, and oblasts--is on no account taken care of by the argument or the formula of power in one pair of hands. Power will be in a hundred pairs of hands. Whereas power would be in one pair of hands in Kiev, there once again would be no vertical structure of power locally, and once again there would not be what we have wanted to achieve. So, the interesting thing is this: If the president has the whole of power, (?himself being in Kiev) as some propose, this now sounds more like a presidential republic. But where? At the center. What kind of power is there locally? It is representative, soviet. Once again, the diarchy would be laid, which is exactly what all of us are saying. That is why this is exactly what I am talking about: To begin with, one should make a decision with regard to these problems, make a decision at the constitutional level. When I am talking about elections and when I am saying that I will ask the new parliament to make a decision, it is not that I would like to shift responsibility to someone else. I would only like the new parliament to confirm whether it agrees with what we have done over the past four years. I have in mind the Supreme Council, and not only the Supreme Council but the executive structures as well. I do not remove the responsibility from anyone, for it dots the i's and crosses the t's and says that we have to begin, to get down to the final solution of this issue by means of the election, having formed all the institutions at the constitutional level or at the level of some law on power. We have to begin the adoption of laws because the following situation may arise, which I have spoken about more than once: The president is elected according to this law, and he is the head of state and the head of the executive power, and the power structures are not determined. Everything will begin all over again. Well, look at our Constitution. Take Article 97 of the Constitution and Article 114--two articles only, to say nothing about the other articles--and you will see nothing there but contradictions and discrepancies. That is a fact. Therefore, I appeal to the new Supreme Council with a proposal to consider all this. It will be its right, its power. I am not encroaching on anyone's powers--this is clear--to make its final decision and have its say, because the 12th Supreme Council has already passed on the responsibility, and this Supreme Council is assuming it. This is how it should do this. Such is my stand. I hope that this is a normal stand, that it complies with all the norms of legislation and the creation of a law-governed state. If the Supreme Council fails to confirm or, for example, confirms the decision of the old Supreme Council, it will thus again initiate this chaos. In that chaos, it will be necessary to make decisions concerning both the presidential election and the election to the local bodies of power. I will also have to make a decision. Before the Supreme Council holds its session, I am following the road of law, legitimacy, and observance of the Constitution. If this is absent, I also have the right as the president now to make a decision concerning the election. That is to say, I have not yet made a decision before the Supreme Council session. I will make a decision after the Supreme Council session. [end recording]
