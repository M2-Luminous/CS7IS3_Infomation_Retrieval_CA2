FBIS3-47551 "dreas010__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-010-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 January 1994 ANNEX January Potential Cabinet Reshuffle Discussed OW1401135094 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 13 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1401135094 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] Now that political reform-related bills are expected to pass the current Diet session, the idea of reshuffling the cabinet as early as immediately after the enactment of the bills in late January has suddenly cropped up within the government and ruling parties. This was revealed by senior members of the ruling parties on 12 January. The idea is based on the belief that, after the passage of political reform bills, the government needs to portray its image as a full-fledged administration which is capable of dealing with domestic and diplomatic political tasks, including economic pump-priming measures, a new emergency task, and at the same time, it needs to create conditions for tackling the regrouping of political parties while maintaining the current framework of the ruling coalition parties. It is expected that the cabinet reshuffle will occur on a small scale. For example, State Minister for Political Reform Sadao Yamahana is expected to leave the office, and some cabinet members in charge of the economy are also expected to be replaced. There is a plan to transfer Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura (representative of Sakigake [Harbinger]) -- who has taken an opposing stance with Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], over handling of the reorganization of the political world -- to another post. However, the situation is fluid due to such factors as pressing time for compilation of the fiscal 1994 draft budget. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa discussed a plan to reshuffle the cabinet with Ichiro Ozawa at the end of last year, and he is considering the timing and scale of the plan. So far, it has been reported that the most probable plan under consideration within the government and ruling parties was to reshuffle the cabinet immediately after the passage of a draft budget for the next fiscal year through the upcoming ordinary Diet session. And, the prime minister had reportedly agreed on the plan basically. However, now that political reform bills are expected to be enacted and the government needs to speed up efforts to create conditions for tackling the political situation after the passage of the bills, the idea of reshuffling the cabinet as early as at the end of the current Diet session has cropped up. There will be no change in posts which party leaders are now holding. The main points of the reshuffle will be: 1) to appoint an economic expert to be chief of the Economic Planning Agency; and 2) to strengthen chief cabinet secretary's functions of coordination among cabinet members, as well as between the government and the ruling parties. Mr. Takemura and Mr. Ozawa have different views on the handling of political reform bills. While Mr. Takemura had moved to compromise with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], Mr. Ozawa has taken a hard-line stance vis-a-vis the LDP. There was also a confrontation between Mr. Takemura and some members of the government and ruling parties over the timing of compiling a draft budget for the next fiscal year. For this reason especially, both Shinseito and Komeito have demanded that Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura be replaced with a person who will devote single-heartedly to a coordinating role. Faced with such circumstances, there is speculation that Mr. Takemura will be transferred to another cabinet post. However, he and members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], who have different views from Mr. Ozawa on a strategy for regrouping the political parties, will inevitably oppose the plan. Although the prime minister is reportedly reluctant to dismiss Mr. Takemura as the chief cabinet secretary, some people think if Mr. Takemura is relieved at the same time as changes of some economic ministers and political reform minister, this will soften the cushion that the prime minister "dismisses Mr. Takemura" as the chief cabinet secretary. Moreover, Mr. Yamahana himself has indicated an intention to resign as political reform minister if political reform bills are enacted, since he resigned as SDPJ chairman in September last year. Therefore, if the cabinet is reshuffled, there is the possibility that political reform minister will be changed, or, the post will be abolished. In this case, it is expected that the prime minister will ask SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to join the cabinet in order to establish a cooperative relationship among all the ruling parties. However, there are views that it is inappropriate to change economic ministers immediately before the budget compilation and that the issue of how to deal with Mr. Takemura's post may cause a crack in the foundation for the Hosokawa administration. For this reason, the prime minister intends to be cautious in making the final decision.
