On the same day, the Monju fast- breeder reactor, which produces plutonium, reached "criticality." Under this situation, the government made the aforementioned decision while taking into consideration the possibility that the "concern over Japan becoming a nuclear power," which lingers in connection with the suspicions over the DPRK's (North Korea) nuclear weapons development program, may crop up again. In concrete terms, the government intends to make its appeals concerning Japan's position as the "only nation in the world that has suffered atomic bombings" through various opportunities such as summit meetings and the public relations activities of embassies and legations abroad. Last year, Japan's delayed decision to support the indefinite extension of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) created speculation among European nations and the United States that Japan "might intend to possess nuclear arms." This was the origin of the prevailing view that Japan "will be armed with nuclear weapons." Moreover, in connection with North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development, Britain's SUNDAY TIMES newspaper reported in January, "The British Ministry of Defense has completed a secret report that says there is a possibility that Japan will abandon its nonnuclear principles." In the United States, Defense Secretary (then Deputy Secretary) William Perry testified at a public hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee in February, "If North Korea succeeds in producing nuclear weapons, the possibility that Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea will seek to possess nuclear arms will increase greatly." In this way, there have been statements pointing out the fear that Japan will arm itself with nuclear weapons.
