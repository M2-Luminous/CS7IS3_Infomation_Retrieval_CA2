Artillery and missile attacks continued on the residential quarters in the approaches to Aden. A number of aircraft attempted to strike Aden refinery but our air defenses intercepted them. The air raid of the hostile forces failed to achieve their objective. All this is taking place in spite of the so-called new initiative put forward by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih through his representative at the United Nations in which he claimed his wish for a cease-fire. This indicates that the ruling military regime in Sanaa is continuing its political and media game to deceive the Arab and international public opinion while at the same time it is continuing its desperate attempts to storm Aden. This is a dream in the mind of that regime under its head who is arrogant and blood-thirsty. This objective is impossible to achieve. The Armed Forces of the DRY supported by thousands of our people who have enlisted in their ranks have taken the responsibility of defending the DRY and its sovereignty, and will never allow the new invading aggressors to continue inflicting their folly and recklessness against the lives and possessions of our people. Defeat is awaiting the aggressors and victory is near, God willing.
