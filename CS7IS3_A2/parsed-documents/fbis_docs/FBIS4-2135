Tong has been out of contact since Monday afternoon, when police searched Wei's office here and took away many documents following the detention of the 43-year-old veteran dissident for interrogation about "suspected" new crimes since being released from prison in September. "I'm worried she's been detained because I've heard nothing from here since the police came to Wei's office," Wei's sister, Wei Ling, said by phone, adding Tong usually went to the office daily. Hong Kong radio quoted a public security official as saying that Tong had been taken in for questioning. Beijing public security bureau officials Wednesday denied any knowledge of the reported detention. Tong has maintained contact with foreign journalists since Wei's nearly 30-hour detention in early March following a controversial meeting with U.S. Undersecretary of State for Humanitarian Affairs John Shattuck. The dissident subsequently left the capital for a four-week "vacation" in northeast China and was picked up by police again as he tried to return to Beijing Friday. The Beijing Public Security Department said Tuesday Wei had "violated the law on many occasions and is suspected of having committed new crimes when he was deprived of his political rights and on parole." Wei was released on parole in September, six months short of a 15-year prison term for his "counter-revolutionary" role in the 1978-1979 Democracy Wall movement. Since his release, he has met frequently with foreign journalists and remained outspoken in his advocation of democracy.
