[Constantinescu] By participating in the `Partnership for Peace' program and trying to get completely involved, Romania is pursuing its integration into NATO structures. It views this program just as an initial stage, bearing in mind that there are difficulties, both logistical and over the incompatibility of our military systems. The application of this accord needs time and problems will probably surface as we go along; nor do its initiators have a clear image of what it should include. Romania was particularly interested in this initiative for its comprehensive nature, because it does not draw a new demarcation line in Europe. We were the first country to sign this document. Now we are at the stage of preparing a document to consist of two parts: one linked to the political aspect -- the continuation of the economic and democratic reform process, observance of the CSCE norms, the transparency of the military doctrines -- and another linked to the military aspect, namely to offers in the military area. Linked to this aspect, by the end of the year a first elite battalion, including volunteers, will be made available for peacekeeping actions. Its training will be complex and will include English-language lessons. The individual 16 plus 1 Partnership Program is being worked out in Brussels; it will represent the foundation of cooperation among NATO's partner states. Joint exercises will also take place. Romania also wants to capitalize on the advantages in the political area that participation in this accord offers, such as settling the differences of opinion that mark relations with Hungary. One of the conditions is to solve the disputes that still exist; it being viewed as a "historic reconciliation." True, no guarantees for security are offered like those offered by NATO, but a mechanism is established for consultations should problems of that kind emerge; the given state has the possibility of approaching the Alliance. We should not forget that Partnership for Peace has an economic aspect, namely partnership for development, offering access to NATO programs in such areas as: the conversion of the defense and weapons industry for peaceful purposes, research in the military area, and assistance in the case of nuclear accidents or calamities. Now all states are in the same position; after this program is launched, however, changes will occur, particularly because the resources of the participating states are different. Partnership means substantial expenses for ensuring the compatibility between our own army and NATO's army; this will require special financial efforts, especially since we have the lowest military budget per capita. Consequently, the economic aspect is very important and probably certain facilities will be granted in the future; in any case, the military budget has to be transparent.
