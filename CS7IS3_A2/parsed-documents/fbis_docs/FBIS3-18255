The United States, Russia, and France are drafting the big moves of conflict settlement without Germany, and they are gaining influence and securing their positions for the future. The election campaign in Germany and its uncertain outcome contribute to that. If a changeover of power should take place in October, two possible developments are likely: A growing unworldly introversion of German policies and a strong French leadership in the mediating diplomacy between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance. In the runup to the NATO ultimatum, a remarkable rapprochement between the United States and France took place. Relations between the two countries seemed to have reached a critical stage weeks ago that lasted until after the NATO summit in January. When the ultimatum expired, Russian diplomacy succeeded in claiming the change in Sarajevo as its achievement. It was possible for the withdrawing Serbs to pretend that they were following Moscow's advice and not giving in to NATO pressure. Politically, the situation of the Serbs has improved at the expense of the Bosnians and the Croats. Nobody will question their territorial conquests. Paris, London, Moscow, and finally also Washington are seeking a solution on the basis of the current military status. In fact, it will take a great deal of time to achieve that but the Slovenes and the Croatians already know at this point that their hopes for further support from Germany -- beyond efforts to ensure their recognition -- will not be fulfilled. The truth is that the power at the center has been pushed to the margin.
