According to the KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, Kim Il-song made the statement at a banquet to welcome King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia and Queen Norodom Mouique Sihanouk, who began an official visit to dprk on April 4. At the same time King Sihanouk said that the DPRK is not responsible for the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula. He added that the DPRK is entitled to defend itself if any foreign forces launch an invasion. A row has blown up recently between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the DPRK over the inspection of the latter's nuclear sites. The Vienna-based IAEA claimed that Pyongyang rejected full inspection while the DPRK said that it had met the IAEA's demands. Last Thursday [31 March] the United Nations Security Council requested, in a presidential statement, that the DPRK allow the IAEA to complete its inspection of the nuclear facilities by mid-May. On Monday, South Korea decided to postpone the planned joint military exercise between its armed forces and those of the United States until mid-May in the hope that the DPRK would respond positively to the U.N. Security Council's request.
