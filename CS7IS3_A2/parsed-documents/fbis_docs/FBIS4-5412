"We reaffirmed that we shouldn't prolong this period of political vacuum," Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a news conference. "We thus agreed to strive to hold a meeting of parties' leaders at 10 A.M. tomorrow," said the chief of the largest coalition contingent. Other leaders who joined Monday's session include Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who heads new party Sakigake (Harbinger) and Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). Eiichi Nakamura of the Democratic Reform Party, a small parliamentary group in the House of Councillors, also attended. The gathering of the four coalition figures came shortly after top officials of the ruling parties agreed to continue mulling the choice of a replacement for Hosokawa at their caucus for the time being, not at a meeting of ruling parties' heads. Murayama said he will call on Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), Management and Coordination Agency Chief Koshiro Ishida of Komeito and Hosokawa of the Japan New Party (JNP), to attend the planned session on Tuesday. "I will tell them to compare notes at a meeting of parties' heads to minimize the political vacuum and work together to fulfill our duties to the public," he added. Shinseito, Komeito and the JNP had flatly refused to hold a summit of coalition parties' leaders on Monday. The SDPJ chief denied the four leaders discussed during Monday's meeting a possible change in the current framework of the coalition government, which was formed last August. There is a growing rift among the ruling parties on the selection of a candidate for premier and the shape of the new government. Hosokawa, 56, announced his resignation Friday to take responsibility for a gridlock in the Diet budget debate spawned by allegations of financial impropriety. Hosokawa will remain in office as caretaker until his replacement is chosen. Hata is tipped as the most likely candidate for the premiership. But some coalition members say Murayama and Takemura are also on a list of candidates. Also, the Shinseito-Komeito bloc is considering fielding former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party as a candidate to succeed Hosokawa in a move to split the once-dominant party.
