FR941206-1-00089 FR941206-1-00007 A verbatim transcript of the hearing and written statements will be available for public inspection and copying during normal working hours at the EPA's Air Docket Section in Washington, DC (see ADDRESSES section of this preamble). B. Docket The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to or otherwise considered by the EPA in the development of this proposed rulemaking. The principal purposes of the docket are: 1. To allow interested parties to identify and locate documents readily so that they can participate intelligently and effectively in the rulemaking process; and 2. To serve as the record in case of judicial review (except for interagency review material [section 307(d)(7)(a) of the Clean Air Act]). C. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 [58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)], the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 1. Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 2. Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 3. Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or 4. Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order 12866, the EPA has determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action.'' Therefore, the EPA has determined that it will not be sent to OMB for review. D. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by the EPA (ICR No. 1716.01), and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M Street, SW. (2136), Washington, DC 20460, or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. The public burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 187 hours per respondent annually for recordkeeping and reporting. This includes time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, conducting performance tests, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch, 2136, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for the EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal. E. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires the EPA to consider potential impacts of proposed regulations on small entities. It is currently the EPA policy to perform a regulatory flexibility analysis of the potential impacts of proposed regulations on small entities whenever it is anticipated that any small entities may be adversely impacted. Because it was anticipated that some small wood furniture manufacturers could be adversely impacted from implementation of the proposed standards, a regulatory flexibility analysis was performed. A copy of the Economic Impact Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is included in the docket.
