Chien said Thursday [26 May] that Taiwan is sincere in negotiating with the United States in trying to settle a debt it has owed since World War II. "However, we will not pay the debt without prudent consideration," Chien said while responding to a legislative query by Democratic Progressive Party legislator Yu Ling-ya. Chien said the United States granted about US$1 billion in loans to the Republic of China [ROC] during the war, but that the ROC Government made huge expenditures for US troops stationed in Mainland China. Therefore, he said, to simply say the ROC owes the US the money would be unreasonable. Taipei and Washington have since 1960 held several rounds of talks on the debt issue, but because of the difficulty in finding documents related to the debt, no conclusions have resulted. Chien, however, said that Taiwan is still willing to discuss the issue with the United States in an effort to find a solution. "As long as the US wants us to talk, then we will talk," Chien said. Several lawmakers have urged the government to reject US requests to pay the debt because the United States no longer recognizes the Republic of China. Instead, they say, the United States should turn to Mainland China to claim the debt.
