In an interview with Egyptian television screened last night, al-Sahhaf said it is the right of the Iraqi people and government, in line with international law, to take measures that keep them alive and ensures their future if pressure on the Security Council persists in order to prevent the lifting of the embargo. He said lifting the Iraq embargo is necessary and is stipulated by Resolution 687, Paragraph 22, and that any talk to the contrary is obvious manipulation of the resolutions and their contents. Regarding the allegations of the Kuwaiti regime about missing persons, the foreign minister said Iraq had cooperated with three envoys sent by the Arab League, the Security Council, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, and that Iraq holds no Kuwaiti people at all.
