Over the past five years, the university has named over 190 professors and associate professors from among the young and middle-aged staff. From 1992 to 1993, the university appointed 55 professors and 47 associate professors, the youngest professor being only 28 years old. To improve teaching and research conditions for young and middle-aged professors and associate professors, the university adopted eight measures. They included giving academic allowances, Ph.D. degree allowances, a scientific research foundation for young experts, a publishing foundation, and an academic holiday system. Recently, the university invested 2 million yuan in the salary fund to ensure the adoption of a new higher salary standard system formulated by the government. It has used the money to set up "Jun'an -- Beijing University Scientist Prize" for the academicians of the Chinese Academy of Natural Sciences, and tutors for graduates pursuing a Ph.D. course. The university has built six apartment buildings for the people engaged in post-doctoral researches. The improvement of the teaching and living conditions has attracted some returned graduates from abroad. So far this university has 60 professors who returned from abroad after they completed their Ph.D. degree.
