Volskiy's preliminary remarks have thus added weight to the professor's private assessments. Yevgeniy Yasin pointed to two extreme views of the two-year experience of economic reform. The first, set forth in the well-known report drawn up by academicians, is that Gaydar's policy was a failure. The second, monetarist one, is that there is a natural process under way, but the government lacks sufficient stick-to-itiveness in pursuing a tight monetary policy; that the state should learn to live within its means without covering budget gaps by creating extra money. In Yasin's view, there has been no failure of the reform policy. The critics, Yasin said, do however fail to see important achievements, such as the stabilization of the ruble, which was achieved without any administrative intervention, the Central Bank's positive refinancing rate, and the partial redressing of price imbalances as a result of price liberalization. The crisis cannot be overcome only by skills in tinkering with macroeconomic indicators, he continued. The main problem of 1994 is the reduction in inflation rates. "The struggle against inflation is a necessary measure for any responsible government," Yevgeniy Yasin said. Attempts to manage the inflationary process with a monthly inflation rate standing at 20 percent will be doomed to failure. Among priority measures to adjust economic reform Yasin mentioned the tightening of taxation discipline and the government's efforts to boost private investment in the production sector. "We need to carry our a strategic maneuver, something Zhukov did in the battle of Moscow -- not to squander money to patch up holes, but to create reserves for a decisive offensive," was how Yasin summed up his address. When asked by a director whom he sees as suited for the role of Zhukov, he said without hesitation: "Viktor Chernomyrdin is quite capable of lifting the economy out of the crisis."
