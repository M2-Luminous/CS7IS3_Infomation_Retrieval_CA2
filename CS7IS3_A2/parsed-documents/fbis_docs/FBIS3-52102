Musa expressed the hope that an agreement will eventually be reached. Musa said his meeting this evening with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, was part of the consultations that Egypt is holding. Meanwhile, Dr. Nabil Sha'th said: We are working together to solve the problems and overcome the obstacles preventing an agreement so that we can return to the negotiating table in Taba. He added: The Israelis have raised an uncalled for and groundless furor about an agreement reached and on which the Palestinians have backed down. He said: As a matter of fact, no agreement had been reached. All that happened was that a working paper had been written and submitted to President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin so that the points of agreement and disagreement could be marked on this paper to facilitate the work of the negotiators in Taba. Sha'th stressed that the Palestinians are prepared to return to the talks but the Israeli side is still resorting to an escalation. Mr. 'Amr Musa and the Egyptian side are trying to resolve this problem so that we can return to the negotiations and accomplish what we have agreed to accomplish. Asked whether the Palestinians have received a reply from Israel, Sha'th said: We have received a lengthy reply containing the Israeli stand vis-a-vis our stand. This is a normal matter.
