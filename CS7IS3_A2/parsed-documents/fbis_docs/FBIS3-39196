[Kooijmans] Good evening. [Van Zijl] Last Monday [7 February], after the meeting of the European Ministers, you were about the only one to speak of a "ultimatum," although no decision had been made yet. But there is actually a ultimatum now that NATO has made a U-turn. Does that please you? [Kooijmans] No, it does not [as heard], but I am satisfied that the international community has actually started to do something and has imposed a credible deadline within which certain things will have to be done. [Van Zijl] Still, dangerous times may lie ahead. What is your assessment of the danger for the Dutch soldiers? [Kooijmans] It is very difficult to say. Certain security measures have already been taken for the ground troops, i.e. if attacks are directed against UN troops, the representative of the [UN] Secretary General in Yugoslavia, Mr. Akashi, can ask for air support. That is already a certain guarantee. And it is well possible that now that the international community has finally used some credible language, this will also benefit the situation of the ground troops. [Van Zijl] And then there are also our Dutch planes -- the F16s -- stationed in Villafranca.... [Kooijmans] Yes, indeed, together with the French, the U.S., the British and the Turkish planes. [Van Zijl] Now, a few words on politics: The Russians are being obstructive and are calling for an emergency meeting of the [UN] Security Council. Does this make sense? [Kooijmans] Well, yes they have the right to do so... But resolution 836 gives the final authority to the [UN] Secretary General and that resolution would have to be revoked, which in my opinion is not very likely. [Van Zijl] Finally Mr. Kooijmans, what is your personal feeling at this time? Have we finally reached some point or is this just a stop on the way to a fatal outcome? [Kooijmans] Well, we have achieved something, we have reached a point where we have stated that some things are not tolerated. We are ready, if need be, to intervene with an iron hand, but I hope that this will not be necessary; a real peace agreement can only be achieved by the waring parties themselves. [Van Zijl] Many thanks for your comments, Mr. Minister.
