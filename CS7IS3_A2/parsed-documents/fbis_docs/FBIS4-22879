I. Puzikov, I. V. Taratynov, Giprouglemash; UDC 621.651:622.232.8] [Abstract] Giprouglemash and the Bryansk Machine Building Company are designing pumping units and stations for mechanized supports, water removal systems, water injection units used in coal beds, and high-pressure irrigation systems. The series of pumping stations features pressures from 20-63 MPa, and a delivery rate of 30-400 l/min. The series has 22, 37, 55, and 110 kW models. Gravitational extraction is used in the filtering system. These pumping stations consume less power than their predecessors and are half the weight. Their most vulnerable parts (for example, the plungers) are reinforced for a longer lifetime. Figures 2.
