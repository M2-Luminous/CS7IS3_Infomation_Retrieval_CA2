The meeting of the political ad hoc group began on 2 May, and that of the economic ad hoc group will follow two days later. Lu Ping, vice chairman and secretary of the PWC; PWC Vice Chairman Zhou Nan, and the mainland members of the two ad hoc groups will attend the group meetings to join other businessmen members from Hong Kong in discussing a series of important items on the agenda. During the meetings, PWC members will hear Hong Kong compatriots' opinions on Hong Kong's smooth transition and on successfully carrying out the work of the PWC. At the 2 May meeting of the political ad hoc group, the participants discussed issues on organs to be set up on the mainland by the SAR government. Some members strongly criticized the report on Sino-UK relations issued by the UK Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, pointing out that the report is trying to play the international card. It negates the articles of the Basic Law and supports Chris Patten's program. This shows that Britain is determined to continue its policy of confrontation with China on the Hong Kong issue. Meanwhile, various newspapers published in Hong Kong on 2 May carried news of the holding of the PWC group meetings in Hong Kong, and some of the newspapers published editorials welcoming the PWC's meeting in Hong Kong.
