The level of monthly income is insufficient to buy the necessary food in the minimal amounts. One kilogram of butter, 1kg of sugar, 1kg of cheese, meat, and at least 5kg of potatoes, to say nothing of the expenses (?and) public utilities transportation, and which is most important today, kerosene and wood for heat. According to the experts at the center the coming indexation of wages will lead to greater forestalling increase in prices on the market which will only make things worse. [sentence as heard] The state of the Armenian economy nowadays is such that a sweeping indexation of wages for all budget enterprises without a differentiation by the level of income will result in further decrease in living standards the growth of inflation and the fall of the dram rate. In such a situation it would be more advisable to redistribute the money reserved for indexation and spend it on guaranteed rationing of basic foodstuffs in minimal amounts at least for that part of the urban population whose income is not higher than 100 drams per family member. The introduction of food cards for low income families proposed by the analysts of the center will not affect the other groups of population (?so it) would not promote the further growth of prices and hyperinflation. On the contrary, it will to some extent soften the disastrous situation we are facing this winter.
