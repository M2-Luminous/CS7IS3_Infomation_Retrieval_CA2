The Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) system engineering model (EM) development test was conducted from May to August 1993 at Tsukuba Space Center. The system EM was put in the radio anechoic chamber in the Radio Test Building, where the bus equipment performance and function and the interfaces with the mission equipment were verified. The model was also tested in the electromagnetic environments produced by the satellite communication equipment. The tests verified that the satellite operation and the observation data transmission were satisfactory. Data acquired during the test were evaluated by the observation sensor development organizations to verify good interfaces with the satellite. The results of the development test will be used for establishing the protoflight test procedures as well as reflected into the protoflight model design. A compatibility test between ADEOS, the Engineering Test Satellite-VI (ETS-VI), and the experiment ground system was conducted, following the system engineering model development test. The purpose of the test was to verify the interface between the above three systems by connecting them on the ground to obtain data for the experiment base line for NASDA's first intersatellite communication experiment between ADEOS, ETS-VI, and the experiment ground system. Good communication was verified, but some problems were discovered in the interfaces. These were reflected into the design of ADEOS protoflight model and the experiment ground system. A series of environmental tests, including acoustic, vibration, and shock tests, was conducted on the structural and thermal model (STM) since April 1993 at the Spacecraft Integration and Test Building of Tsukuba Space Center. The tests were completed, and the model was published to the press on September 17, 1993. STM has undergone thermal vacuum tests since late November 1993.
