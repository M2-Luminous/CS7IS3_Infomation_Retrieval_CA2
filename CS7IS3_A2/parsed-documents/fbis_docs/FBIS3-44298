A review of the international situation over the past year reveals an Asia-Pacific fever. Some call 1993 the "Year of the Asia-Pacific Region." Its hallmark is the Seattle meeting in November. What are the political and economic factors behind this Asia-Pacific fever? Please discuss them with our viewers. [Qian] The emergence of Asia-Pacific fever is not accidental. Economic factors have become the most prominent issue following the end of the Cold War. Economic factors are playing an increasing role in the relations of various countries. The Asia-Pacific region currently enjoys excellent economic development while the rest of the world is in a general economic recession. The Asia-Pacific region can now be described as the most economically vibrant part of the world. Politically, the region now enjoys relative stability and relatively good interstate relations, possessing a dwindling number of hot spots at a time when some countries are politically unstable, engulfed by an endless stream of regional conflicts. Therefore, politically speaking the emergence of Asia-Pacific fever is only natural, as is the way developments in the Asia-Pacific region have become the focus of widespread attention. [announcer-read passage on the Asia-Pacific region's growing importance in international diplomacy omitted] [Correspondent] The Chinese and U.S. leaders held an official meeting in Seattle. The event was the focus of international attention. Would you please tell us what impact the official meeting between the Chinese and U.S. leaders will have on future Sino-U.S. relations? [Qian] Presidents Jiang Zemin and Clinton held an official meeting in Seattle for the first time in five years. In my opinion, the meeting between the Chinese and U.S. leaders carried vital significance. To be sure, the meeting of the top leaders was not an occasion for specific discussions; it was an occasion for exchanging views on major issues. The development of Sino-U.S. relations was discussed from a long-term perspective and within a broader context. China and the United States have many common interests. At the same time, differences exist. Both sides are aware it is necessary to carry out exchanges and cooperation in accordance with the principle of common interests. At the same time, both sides also know it is necessary to carry out frank [tan cheng] dialogue to deal with these differences. This formula will lead us to the correct path for solving and developing Sino-U.S. relations and for eliminating obstacles. [announcer-read passage on Western political crises in 1993 omitted] [Correspondent] In sharp contrast to the Asia-Pacific fever, this year Western countries have generally experienced political crises which have led to changes in regimes and role reversals for governing and opposition parties. People have demonstrated a mentality of change. Would you please discuss the main reasons for the political crises in the West? [Qian] Public opinion in the West terms the current phenomena as post-Cold War syndrome. A very important reason for the occurrence of this phenomena is people in various countries have begun to turn their attention inward following the end of the Cold War because they have grown more concerned about domestic affairs. Domestic economic, social, and political contradictions; scandals; and other issues have become matters of great concern to people in those countries. This has led to changes in the original political structure. Economically, the entire Western world has been mired in an economic recession since the beginning of the nineties; the economies of some countries have become stagnant, whereas the economies of others have grown at a very slow pace or posted zero and negative growth. Unemployment rates in the West are high. This has caused social unrest and spawned a post-Cold War syndrome. [announcer-read passage on Russia's political and economic problems omitted] The problem with Russia seems to be that the difficulties it encountered following the change in political power and in economic restructuring are far greater than previously anticipated. Russia is our largest neighbor. Because it is our neighbor, we of course hope the situation there will stabilize as soon as possible and its economy will develop gradually. [announcer-read passage on the world's political and economic situation following the end of the Cold War omitted] [Correspondent] The international situation has undergone major changes following the end of the Cold War. What kind of impact do you think the new international situation will have on China's future development? [Qian] The situation arising in the wake of the Cold War has posed new challenges to all countries. However, the successful maintenance of world peace is the most important thing. During these past two years -- 1992 and 1993 -- our country's economy began the course of rapid and healthy development. This precisely demonstrates the importance of the maintenance of world peace; this situation is very conducive to China's development. [Correspondent] What diplomatic achievements do you think China has achieved this year? [Qian] Diplomacy is the extension of domestic affairs. Because our country's domestic situation is very good, the situation on our diplomatic front is likewise very good. More than 30 foreign heads of states and government leaders, as well as over 50 vice presidents, vice premiers, and foreign ministers, have visited China this year. Our diplomatic activities are relatively active; a total of 158 countries have established diplomatic relations with us. The emphasis of our diplomacy is to strengthen relations with our neighbors and establish good-neighborly relations with them; to strengthen unity and cooperation with developing countries; and at the same time to establish economic and trade relations with countries throughout the world. Two major events of great importance took place last November. One was German Chancellor Kohl's visit to China, and the other was the meeting between Presidents Jiang and Clinton. These two events signified that Western powers have begun to show interest in developing constructive relationships with China. In other words, both Western public opinion and Western business communities have a sanguine view of China's economic development; everyone wants to do business with China. Under these circumstances, politicians in the West feel it is necessary to establish constructive relationships with China. I believe that in the new year, we may have diplomatic breakthroughs in this respect. [Correspondent] What will be the emphasis of our diplomatic activities in 1994? [Qian] The emphasis of our diplomatic activities next year remain the creation of a favorable and peaceful international environment. This can be divided into two parts. On the one hand, we will strengthen good-neighborly relations with our neighbors. On the other, we will develop broad economic and trade relations with all countries. What is especially important is what I have just said. After the Seattle meeting, we hope Sino-U.S. relations as well as relations between China and Europe will develop further. We hope a breakthrough will be made in this respect. [Correspondent] Thank you.
