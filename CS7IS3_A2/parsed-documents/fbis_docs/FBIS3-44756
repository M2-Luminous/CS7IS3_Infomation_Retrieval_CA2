Meanwhile, in foreign-funded or privately-owned enterprises, the state will advocate a system of setting wage levels through collective negotiation or consultation. In an interview with XINHUA, a high-ranking official with the state's Ministry of Labor said that the reform will focus on readjusting staff income structures in large and medium-sized enterprises with state ownership. The reform will channel numerous employee subsidies and allowances, including housing subsidies, into their salaries. And the enterprises will be granted full decision-making powers in setting or increasing wages for their employees on the prerequisite that their wage increase rates do not exceed a rate representing economic efficiency. According to the official, the enterprises chosen for trial wage reform will determine for themselves the number of employees needed, and managerial personnel in the enterprises will be salaried yearly under the system. Along with the wage reform measures, the state will regulate and guide social distribution by setting minimum wage levels or issuing guidelines on wage increases. The official noted that the present wage reform will also take into consideration the wage readjustment being conducted in government organizations or institutions. He said that wage increases in the enterprises should be made in light of economic efficiency and the cost of living index. Meanwhile, the reform will also try to smooth out wage relations between enterprises and government institutions and between in- service staff and retired personnel.
