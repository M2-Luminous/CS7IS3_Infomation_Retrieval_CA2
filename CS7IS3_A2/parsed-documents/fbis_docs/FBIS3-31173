Meciar had stated that all the opposition politicians were connected with crucial Slovak companies. "I am economically clean, I do not conduct any business, having no interest in the key 21 Slovak enterprises. I make my living from a poor deputy's wages. As a result, Meciar's accusation is unfounded," said Knazko, a member of Meciar's cabinet as foreign minister until last March. Knazko pointed to the fact that Meciar, who was involved in the drafting of the current Slovak Constitution, was striving today for the changes in it, for "new relations" between parliament and government, the government and the Castle (Presidential Office), attempting to create new centers of power.
