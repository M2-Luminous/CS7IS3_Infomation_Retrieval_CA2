There are two scenarios that are most likely. The first is a freeze on the post and a transfer of the functions to one of the deputy directors, the "old boy" Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, or the new arrival, Vincenzo Desario. This would involve asking the Bank's high council, the body that decides in such matters, for a sort of leave. This already happened once in 1919 with Bonaldo Stringher, who was appointed to the Treasury Ministry. Nevertheless, there are those at the Bank who point to the anomaly of this kind of choice, because the governor, holding a dialogue with Minister Dini, would have to make do with one of his subordinates, even if he is "in the freezer." The second scenario, which is considered more likely, has it that the appointment of the new director general will come from outside, as, in fact, happened with Dini himself, who was called to Rome by the International Monetary Fund, where he served as director for Italy. Thus, by analogy, there are those who feel that Massimo Russo, the IMF official for Europe, will be put forward as a candidate. However, the name of Rainer Masera, the director general of IMI [Italian Institute for Financing Personal and Real Property], is also making the rounds, while two possible candidates -- Cesare Geronzi, director general of the Bank of Rome, and Mario Draghi, director general of the Treasury -- have let it be known that there is no question of them being involved. Lastly, it is felt that an internal succession is highly unlikely, as this would mean advancing careers within the directorate by inserting a new functionary. Or, Padoa Schioppa could be promoted and some 10 new general officials would make their way into the control room. Officially, the choice is up to the high council, which has to be convened by the governor. However, the budget minister has a certain amount of influence in the complex appointment procedure. To put it technically: There are 13 members on the council plus the governor. The deliberations begin with the favorable vote of two-thirds of those present, provided that two-thirds of the members are present. A date for the convocation has not yet been set, but there is no doubt that the councillors will be in Rome on 31 May for the Bank's meeting. [passage omitted]
