The Russian Defence Ministry will also train specialists to operate and maintain Russian military equipment in Kuwait, Grachev said at a meeting with visiting Kuwaiti parliament chairman Ahmad al-Sa'dun in Moscow on Monday. Kuwait is the first Persian Gulf country to have signed a military cooperation agreement with Russia. "Russia strictly and consistently observes the spirit of the agreement signed by the defence ministers of the two countries on November 29, 1993 in Moscow," Grachev said. He used as an example the joint Russian-Kuwaiti military exercises which Russia is ready to repeat and military and technical cooperation between the two countries. The Russian minister pointed to the similarity of positions of the Russian and Kuwaiti leaders on regional and global security, including Middle East settlement and the resolution of the crisis in Yemen. Grachev welcomed the visit of the Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation to Russia as an important event in the development of bilateral cooperation, including in the military sphere. Ahmad al-Sa'dun told journalists after the meeting that the aim of his visit is to convey the warmest wishes and gratefulness of the people of Kuwait for Russia's firm position on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. He also pointed to the closeness of his views on Russian-Kuwaiti military cooperation with Grachev's and said that the Kuwaiti parliament fully supported and ratified the agreement on military cooperation between the two countries. He expressed the confidence that the Russian lawmakers will follow suit.
