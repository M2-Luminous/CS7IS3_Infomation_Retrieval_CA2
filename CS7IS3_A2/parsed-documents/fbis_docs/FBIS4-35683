During a National Assembly session here today, he expressed Iraq's readiness to develop this position to put the Arab house in order in the interest of the Arab and Islamic nations. The National Assembly speaker reviewed the situation in the Arab and international arenas, as well as developments in light of the U.S. statements on the continuation of the embargo and the postponement of lifting it in violation of the desire of the international community, particularly the UN Security Council itself. He said that the increasing world calls for lifting the embargo indicate all countries' desire to restore relations with Iraq to their previous level and to establish economic and trade relations in a way that will achieve their interests in this important region of the world. Sa'di Mahdi Salih praised the international efforts to this effect, and said that the calls by France, Russia, China, Brazil, Spain, Pakistan, Nigeria, and other states constitute a positive stand toward the Iraqi people. He expressed the hope that these efforts will bear fruit in the interest of our people and nation.
