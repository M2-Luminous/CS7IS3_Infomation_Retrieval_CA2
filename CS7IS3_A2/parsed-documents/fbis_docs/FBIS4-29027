A knowledgeable source said Wednesday that if Carter is greeted by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong at Panmunjom, it might be a North Korean tactic to turn his visit into a political negotiation between Washington and Pyongyang. The source pointed out that "We have to watch with concern how the high-ranking official greets him at Panmunjom." He said, "North Korea has made it a rule to greet former heads of state through the chairman or staff of the Committee for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries." He speculated that having a Foreign Ministry official meet Carter at Panmunjom would signal political negotiation rather than a cordial reception. As to reports that Chinese President Jiang Zemin refused to discuss the North Korean nuclear problem with President Clinton over the phone, he explained, "China seems discontent that Pyongyang has not consulted beforehand with it on the announcement to quit the International Atomic Energy Agency."
