"The Panamanian people must remember this campaign has been totally different from past campaigns; it is up to the people to ensure the example of this election will be repeated in every future election," Endara told LA PRENSA. The president suggested that under no circumstances should the Panamanian people allow anyone to deprive them of the right to vote freely as citizens of a democratic government. Endara said he is pleased to preside over the first popular election in freedom and democracy. Endara took office on 20 December 1989, when U.S. troops invaded the country and toppled the military regime of Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is serving a 40-year prison sentence in the United States on drug-trafficking charges. "I cannot decide Panama's future. That is exclusively up to the Panamanian people, and I am therefore asking them to go to the polls and vote for the best candidate," the president said. Endara reiterated he is pleased with his accomplishments as president and will surrender power to whomever wins the 8 May elections. "It will be my duty to surrender power on 1 September to whomever wins the elections. Moreover, for the first time, immediately after the winner is named, I will offer him my support and an orderly transition period so that when he takes office he will be aware of all public affairs," the president added. Approximately 1.5 million Panamanians will elect the new government that will replace Endara's on 8 May.
