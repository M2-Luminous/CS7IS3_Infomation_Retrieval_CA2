Speaking after a session of the ODS Executive Council, she said: "We are afraid that our deputies' group will be one of the few to be asserting the system because it is not advantageous for small parties." Local elections are to take place in November. Petrova said that the working principles of the ODS election program had been drafted. The party will turn to the independent candidates who are famous personalities in particular communities because independents' participation in politics was "beneficial," she added. "Presently we are selecting an agency for local elections because good candidates having a good program must be sold well," Petrova said. The ODS is the strongest parliamentary party with 66 out of a total of 200 seats. Its chairman is Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
