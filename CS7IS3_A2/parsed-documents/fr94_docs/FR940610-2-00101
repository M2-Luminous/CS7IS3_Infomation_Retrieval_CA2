SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Service developed and analyzed five alternatives for the management of wildlife, habitat, and public use of Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge. The purpose of this FEIS is to recommend a course of action that would best guide the management of the Refuge's resources. The FEIS analyzes five alternative approaches to resolving the Refuge's core problems, which are: (1) Unnaturally high densities of shrubs and junipers throughout Refuge uplands, and lack of periodic fire in these habitats; (2) eroded stream channels and deficiency of riparain vegetation along a majority or Refuge streams; and (3) insufficient resources and inadequate facilities to manage the increasing number of Refuge visitors. These problems are the underlying factors currently preventing Refuge goals from being achieved, and thus provide a focal point for the proposed comprehensive management plan. The five alternatives being considered are: (1) Baseline Management, which continues emphasis on a livestock grazing program as the primary means of managing Refuge vegetation; (2) Featured Species Management, which combines the uses of livestock grazing, prescribed burning and herbicides to manage vegetation; (3) Habitat Restoration Alternative, which would emphasize restoration of Refuge habitats, although not to the extent proposed by the Ecosystem Management Alternative; (4) Native Community Restoration (Preferred Alternative), which proposes an ecosystems management approach to restoration of Refuge habitats and natural processes; and (5) Custodial Maintenance, which emphasizes the total exclusion of human intervention. The Preferred Alternative, if implemented, would (1) reduce shrub and juniper cover on 22,000 to 40,000 acres within 15 years following implementation of the comprehensive management plan, primarily through prescribed burning; (2) allow riparian areas to restore passively, except in limited areas where prescribed burning, willow plantings, and check dams would be used; (3) discontinue the use of livestock on Refuge lands during the next 15 years; (4) redesign one of the existing campgrounds and close the other; (5) create three additional camping areas as mitigation; (6) maintain 162 miles of roads open to the public; (7) continue limited quality hunts for pronghorn, mule deer, and bighorn sheep; and (8) recommend 80,541 acres for further study for potential wilderness designation, and 11,276 acres for further study for potential Research Natural Areas designation.
