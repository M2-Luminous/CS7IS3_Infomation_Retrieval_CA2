They devoted primary attention to geophysical studies this week, which were carried out with the help of a multizonal MKF-6MA camera and videospectrometric equipment, installed on the "Kvant-2" module. Today, the cosmonauts are to make a regular series of photographs of the earth's surface. They will also carry out several experiments to determine the spectral characteristics of major oceanic currents and to further study the ionosphere and the earth's magnetosphere. Astrophysical studies were carried out regularly in recent days with the use of the international "roentgen" orbital observatory. The telescopes were trained on the centre of our galaxy, at the roentgen pulsar, the power of whose radiation grew approximately 10-fold at the beginning of May. Medical examinations show that the cosmonauts are in good health. The flight is proceeding normally.
