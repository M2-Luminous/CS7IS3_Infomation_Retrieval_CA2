In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM published today, the Lebanese foreign minister said that a number of people have been arrested for the church bombing. These people revealed that they had connections to Israeli officers and had obtained instructions, funds, and equipment that enabled them to assemble the explosive device, Buwayz added. Buwayz maintained that it is not possible to terminate the resistance before obtaining assurances that south Lebanon will return to Lebanon because the resistance is not the reason for the Israeli occupation but a result of it.
