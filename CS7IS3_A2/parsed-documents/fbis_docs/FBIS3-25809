Although the national figure is not available, the Bank of China's Beijing branch had recalled more than 127 million yuan in FECs as of January 27. The central bank announced on December 29 that the dual-rate exchange system would be unified on January 1 and that it will stop issuing FECs. Although the Central Bank said existing FECs can still be used temporarily, some people misunderstood and thought FECs would be devalued or even become worthless So they rushed to banks to exchange FECs for U.S. dollars, creating long queues in the two days following the central bank's decision. The Beijing branch's daily withdrawal peaked at 15 million yuan in FECs, said an official with the branch. The rush eased later when the central bank reiterated that FECs can be exchanged at the previous official rate of 5.8 yuan per dollar. In order to withdraw the FECs as quickly as possible, the bank has simplified the exchange procedures. Foreigners, overseas Chinese, and people from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan can exchange FECs for dollars by showing their passports and identification certificates. In the past, they were allowed to return only 50 percent of the amount specified on the exchange memos they were given when converting foreign currency into FECs. China introduced FECs in 1980 as a convertible version of the renminbi. The Bank of China issued nearly 2 billion yuan ($230 million) worth of FECs. Although FECs are supposedly equal in value to the renminbi yuan, they actually are worth about 30 percent more in the market. The price of FECs has also fluctuated dramatically in the black market. In the first three days after the central bank's announcement, the price of 1 yuan FEC equaled only 1.05 renminbi yuan. But now speculators must pay 130 or even 140 yuan ($15 or $16) for 100 FECs. Despite the rising price, black market dealers are still enthusiastic about buying FECs since they can make money from the margin between the previous official rate and the current rate. They can use ruses to exchange FECs for dollars at the previous official rate of 5.8 yuan. Then they can sell the dollars at the current rate of 8.7 yuan. For example, if a speculator uses 14,000 renminbi yuan to buy 10,000 yuan of FECs, he can get more than $1,724. Selling the dollars at the rate of 8.7 yuan, he can get 14,998 yuan. This leaves him with a profit of nearly 1,000 yuan.
