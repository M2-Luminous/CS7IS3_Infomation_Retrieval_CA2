The president of the Republic announces that he was obliged to take the measure since the political parties, he says, have not come to an agreement, and the country is slowly plunging into insecurity. How will the decision, which must have been motivated by the extent of the demonstrations which followed the assassination of the secretary general of the Social Democratic Party, the late Felicien Gatabazi, be viewed by the parties concerned. To get an answer, we must wait for their reaction, in particular that of the prime minister designate to lead the transition, Faustin Twagiramungu. The head of state declared that he was waiting for a visit from the Rwandan prime minister-designate to discuss the program for the setting up of the institutions tomorrow.
