Judit Laszlo supplies the details. [Laszlo] The MDF welcomes the policy of Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik because his government is willing to hold a dialogue, Gyorgy Csoti, the party's foreign affairs spokesman, said when analyzing Hungarian-Slovak relations. In connection with the southern Slav crisis, Gyorgy Csoti said that the slowdown in negotiations is alarming. In his view, Russia and the West ought to coordinate their activity more closely to resolve the crisis. The foreign affairs spokesman called attention to the dangerous phenomena of Hungarian party politics, particularly in connection with a statement made by Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. Gyula Horn met with Romanian Senate President Oliviu Gherman yesterday and then told journalists that in the view of the MSZP an agreement is possible concerning the issue of a Hungarian-Romanian basic treaty. According to Gyorgy Csoti, this suggests that it is the fault of the current Hungarian Government that a basic treaty has not so far been signed and that an agreement would be possible if the MSZP came to power. For this reason, the MDF, having drawn the general conclusions, is of the view that the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the MSZP -- presumably in a coordinated manner -- are subordinating basic foreign political interests to party goals in the election campaign. This conduct seriously harms the country's security; it weakens our negotiating positions with Slovakia, Romania, and Serbia, and it makes a historical reconciliation with our neighbors impossible, the MDF statement points out.
