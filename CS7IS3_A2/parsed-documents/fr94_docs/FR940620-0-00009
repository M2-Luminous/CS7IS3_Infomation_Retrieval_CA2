FR940620-0-00009 FR940620-0-00003 There are approximately 11 Model 737&hyph;300 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 2 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 280 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be provided by Pemco Aeroplex at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $30,800, or $15,400 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. However, the FAA has been advised that all affected U.S.-registered airplanes have been modified previously in accordance with the requirements of this AD. Therefore, there is no cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
