They are striking for economic reasons and because of the extremely difficult situation created years ago by the construction of the Fierze Hydroelectric Power Station. As a result of the continuation of the strike, the strikers' health is deteriorating. So far two have been taken to the city hospital, while four others are receiving medical treatment in the hall where the strike is being staged. Jahir Trota, strike committee chairman, told television the following: [Trota] "Our demands are for annual rent for the land on which the Fierze Hydroelectric Power Station stands; financial compensation for the flooded areas rather than securities; compensation for the value of the houses, which has been denied us; money for the fruit trees and other real estate property created with our labor; the organized evacuation of part of the population, which is at a subsistence level; assistance with long-term credits facilitating conditions for new buildings; the purchase of buildings; and the development of private enterprise." Deputy Chairman Hakik Sopi had this to say: [Sopi] ``The Fierze lake has taken away our land. Under conditions of a market economy, we have no land today. Land is the most sacred thing for every citizen and nation. We are forced to see people in a miserable economic situation with no bread when they all used to work for state enterprises, which have now been privatized. We were an agricultural enterprise. The agricultural cooperatives took the land that we had before, so we are left without. Worst hit are the villages of Gosil, Kenete, Rahac, Kukes, and Drinas. The land that has remained does not even have any olive trees. In the forest, you cannot even keep one cow. The land has been open for agriculture. ``We ask that during these days and without delay, the government should meet and decide on the fate of 30,000 inhabitants, how they are to survive, as well as issue a government decision to consider the views of our representatives, our association leaders, who are present there.'' We also interviewed Faik Kastrati, representative of Has district: [Kastrati] "Our vital problem is economic, because under current conditions there is no way for us to live. In general, the Kukes and Has areas are isolated in several respects, but mainly economically, and we are suffering every day and our wishes are impossible to realize. We have persistently been putting forward these points, which are now publicly known, and ask that they be satisfied in every respect. Otherwise, we are at a very critical stage of survival." [Unidentified striker] "We ask that the government helps us. We are 20 families who are now living in Kamez, in Tirana. I have 10 children. I am living in a hut in Kamez, with no water, no electricity, nothing. No one knows how our days have passed and will pass. That is why I am asking the government and all the state bodies to solve these problems of the strikers, regarding the life of the children, as our children are in such difficult conditions that they cannot live." For the hunger strike to end, the strikers want the government to make some decisions, accept their demands, and release three representatives of the association that represents the interests of the inhabitants of these areas.
