Boasting miniatures of over 100 scences from 40 countries, the park has already been visited by nearly three million tourists since it opened to the public last October. Accompanied by Chen Xitong, secretary of CPC's Beijing municipal committee, and Mayor Li Qiyan as well as other central and local government officials, Jiang said, "it's a great park as it can help enrich people's knowledge of the world, its geography and history." Some Chinese and foreign tourists pressed forward to greet the Chinese president. A small boy of six or seven years old squeezed through the crowd to greet "Grandpa Jiang." His mother said the boy came to Beijing "with a wish to see party and state leaders, and this is really a pleasant surprise." Jiang greeted a 76-year-old Canadian tourist, saying "wish you good health and a long life." The tourist's grandson invited Jiang to visit his Canadian home someday.
