According to the Ministry of Trade, in the multisectoral economy, state commerce remains a key distributor of a number of essential items such as tin, cement, and petrol. This has helped balance supply and demand. In the period under review, Vietnam's export turnover was 1.6 billion U.S. dollar, an increase of 27 percent against the same period last year, of which the turnover of rubber increased by 28 percent, coffee 29 percent, tea 21 percent, and coal 24 percent. Meanwhile, Vietnam's import turnover in the last six months was recorded at 1.7 billion U.S. dollar. The main imports were those in service of production development and daily life such as petrol and pesticide. Thanks to the production development, Vietnam has exported many items to foreign markets, including garment, crude oil, rice, maritime products, and tea. By now, Vietnam's Ministry of Trade has completed all necessary procedures to become an observer of GATT. It has signed trade agreements with Laos, Cambodia, and China and worked out plans for commercial promotion inside and outside of Vietnam.
