Here is Chadian Prime Minister Kassire Koumakoye on the labor unions' demands. [Begin Koumakoye recording] The labor unions demanded 35 percent. However, I should tell you that under the current budget adopted by our parliament, in view of the devaluation, we unblocked salaries so that there was a 20-percent increase. Nonetheless, I believe the trade unions are right because the devaluation was a disaster for our countries and people's purchasing power was reduced by half. But, I also believe that being nationalistic is being realistic, since they know our country's problems. We have initiated negotiations to reach an agreement. As we have said, nothing is impossible to Chadians. We will succeed in making our national problems understood. I am still convinced that together with the trade unions we will be able to work out a national compromise. [end recording]
