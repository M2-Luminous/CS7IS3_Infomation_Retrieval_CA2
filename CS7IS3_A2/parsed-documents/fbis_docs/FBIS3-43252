December 31 marked more than the end of just another year. It also marked the end of an era, he said. Next year South Africa would, for the first time, have a multiparty government that would be truly representative of all its people. "For the first time we will have a system where the constitution and the bill of rights -- and not politicians in Parliament -- will have the final say," Mr de Klerk said. For the first time South Africa would have a constitutional system containing effective checks and balances against the misuse of power. Important among these would be independent courts, including an independent constitutional court with wide-ranging powers. Equally important would be the establishment of strong and autonomous provinces, with important powers and functions effectively entrenched. Mr de Klerk said South Africa faced three challenges in the new year, the first being to let democracy succeed. "The second challenge...will be to make our economy work to the benefit of all our people. Success in the economic field will be as important as success in the constitutional field." Democracy and elections would not by themselves bring all the things that people needed, said the president. "We will not be able to create jobs and build all of the houses, schools and clinics that we need, unless there is money to pay for them. And the only way that we can get this money is to ensure that our economy grows as quickly and as strongly as possible." This would require hard work, new investments and expanding exports. "To achieve this, the new government of national unity will have to follow the right policies -- policies that have succeeded throughout the world." "The third great challenge that we will face will be to build a new South African nation; to break out of the conflicts of the past; to break through to reconciliation," said Mr de Klerk.
