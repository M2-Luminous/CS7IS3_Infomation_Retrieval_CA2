The chain of events took place as follows. Yi, hurrying home from a visit to the United States on Monday, gravely suggested that a national council be formed to cope with the current crisis arising from the resignation of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang. The suggestion, of course, was meant for President Kim Yong-sam, who ignored it completely. Yi then followed up by saying that a cabinet supported by the entire nation could be formed. In less than a few hours, however, the remarks by the leader of the country's No. 1 opposition party were brushed aside by his own party's supreme council. "The suggestion was worth studying," DP Spokesman Pak Chi-won told reporters, "but it was not appropriate timing-wise. "At this juncture, therefore, we have decided not to discuss the proposal any further." When Pak's remarks are analyzed carefully, it is possible to get the drift of what exactly is going on within the party. What Pak said indicates that most, if not all, members of the supreme council might have shared this opinion with their leader when he suggested setting up a pan-national cabinet. In fact, this was not the first time Chairman Yi had suggested formation of a broad-based cabinet. He made similar proposals twice before -- at his new year's day press conference and at another press conference marking the first anniversary of his chairmanship. In making such suggestions, Yi Ki-taek's point was that President Kim has lost his ability to govern the nation after trying to impose "a new authoritarianism" and "one-man rule." In order to overcome the national crisis resulting from President Kim's inability to rule, Yi reasoned, a pan-national cabinet, drawing capable manpower from all sectors including the political opposition, should be formed. The supreme council agreed with Yi's diagnosis of the current political situation, but said the timing was inappropriate. According to the council's thinking, the DP ought to keep pressing its offensive against the ruling party and the Kim administration by demanding investigations of the Sangmudae scandal and the resignation of Yi Hoe-chang. Now is not the time, in other words, for the opposition party to come forward and offer help to President Kim by saying "let's form a coalition force to overcome the 'crisis,' or whatever it may be." Proposing to form a pan-national cabinet is "a card" overused by past opposition parties. Many supreme council members believe that Yi Ki-taek has obviously misjudged the current situation. The supreme council, in effect, ignored its own chairman's suggestion. In order to help Yi save face, however, it had Spokesman Pak officially announce that "it would not be discussed any further."
