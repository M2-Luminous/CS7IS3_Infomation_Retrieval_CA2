Issa Kostoyev, chairman of the council committee on constitutional legislation, explained at the discussion of this proposal that the chamber is to receive representations from the Russian president on the resignation of the former prosecutor-general and the appointment of the new one in order to debate this issue. "We cannot examine this issue without such representations," he noted. The chairman called legislators' attention to the fact that the Federation Council regulations contain no article on how such issues should be examined. The agenda of today's session contains such an item on the procedure of debating by the chamber issues relegated by the constitution to its competence. Deputies decided that the item should be examined to be ready to discuss the president's representations. There were also proposals to consider the situation with Aleksey Kazannik's resignation, since the new constitution envisages that the prosecutor-general's appointments and resignations are to be approved by the Federation Council. As a result, this item on the agenda reads as follows: "On prosecutor-general". Lawmakers also decided to hear a report by the Russian premier on non-payments and the government's programme on how to do away with them. The crisis of non-payments was discussed at parliamentary hearings on Monday where legislators recognised them as a very serious problem affecting the entire financial and budgetary system of the country. Parliamentarians also decided to hear information from the Russian Foreign Ministry (in the section "Miscellaneous") on treaties which were concluded but not ratified. The proposal was prompted by a question of whether the Russian-Georgian treaty which has not been ratified by the lower chamber for the time being, operates or not. Legislators continue discussing the agenda.
