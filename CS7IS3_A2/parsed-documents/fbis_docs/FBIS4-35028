This accounts for the fact that, for example, the vice president of the Republic is an Aymara and that in the trade union field, the peasants have proposed that the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) try to bring itself into line with the national reality. Prior to the 10th Congress of the COB, to be opened at the end of May, the secretary general of that organization, Juan de la Cruz Willka, as representative of the CSUTCB, was invited to "Friday Dialogue" to describe the expectations in that area and to provide a general view of the peasant movement. Willka (48 years old) was born in the community of Chachacumani, Pantaleon Dalente de Oruro Province, although he points out that he was really born in Ayllu Thaya Kira. He has had a very active political and trade union career and is considered one of the leading representatives of those who want the COB to make a qualitative leap forward and include among its principles the struggle of the indigenous nations. [PRESENCIA] One subject under discussion is how representative the different sectors of the COB are. What is the position of the peasants in that regard? [Willka] In two previous congresses of the COB, we maintained that the organic structure of the COB and of the Executive Committee should express the national reality. That is to say, diversity, the class struggle and the struggle of the indigenous nations. At the moment, they are expressions only of the class struggle and not of the struggle of the indigenous nations. That is why it is a classist structure. We have made some progress, they have already given us the General Secretariat. In the Congress of Chuquisaca, the CSUTCB proposed this as the political thesis of the COB, but the salaried workers ratified their political thesis and a classist structure, as a guarantee, they said, of the revolution. Our thesis proposes instead that the class struggle and the struggle of the indigenous nations are based on the same thing. [PRESENCIA] To what do you attribute the resistance against accepting the peasants' thesis? [Willka] To an ideological conception. They describe us peasants as petit bourgeoisie because we own a piece of land. They say that all property owners, according to their analysis, are not to be trusted, and therefore we are petit bourgeoisie. We reject that assertion. We are not a part of the petit bourgeoisie because we own a piece of land. There is an ideological background here that is very deeply rooted, and that I want to explain. In both ideological beliefs, that of the socialist states of the former Soviet Union and that of capitalism, land is considered an economic asset that must be exploited to obtain economic benefits. Therefore, anyone who possesses land--one or several hectares--possesses wealth and can improve his standard of living. Based on our Andean ideological conception, land is not an economic asset; the land is part of mankind. If land did not exist, we believe that man could not live, because where could we produce rice, yucca, potatoes, bananas; where could we graze our livestock? Therefore, for us land is part of the life of mankind and of humanity, and it must be cared for, just like human life, so that it serves humanity and not, as in other proposals, that the land must be squeezed dry, as socialism and capitalism have always done. From that starting point, we reject those philosophies that say that any proprietor is a bourgeois. Furthermore, in Bolivian practice, if we compare a peasant and a salaried worker, which one is better off economically? A worker might have his radio, his television, he has his tea, he dresses well, etc., and a peasant from north Potosi is dressed in rags and can barely feed himself. Therefore, it is impossible to believe that we are petit bourgeoisie, and we think that they are wrong to analyze only on the basis of a philosophy that Marx brought to us, which is valid, but in a different situation, and Europe is a different situation that is very far away. We should take these errors into account and direct ourselves, based on our cultural roots, toward a structure and ideology of the COB. [PRESENCIA] How should the COB be structured, according to that position? [Willka] By taking into account its societal base. The societal expression of this country comes primarily from the indigenous nations: Aymaras, Quechuas, Guaranies, and other nations. They should have a real representation inside the COB. The other sectors also have their social expressions: the salaried workers, among them, as always, the miners, factory workers, etc.; the trade unions and other sectors that must be represented. In reality, neither peasants nor factory workers nor miners should be privileged. Nobody. The privileged should be some distinguished leader who has been proven in the struggle, in his honesty, in his preparation; this kind of person should be our leadership in the COB. If they are miners, good for the miners; if they are from other sectors, the same goes for them. This is what we believe. [PRESENCIA] At present, the executive secretary is elected by a workers' vanguard, in this case, the miners.... [Willka] Who constitutes the vanguard is a subject that is under discussion. Why were the miners the vanguard? Because of their struggle, more than anything else, since the beginning of the trade union movement, which aimed at the defeat of the mining oligarchy and afterward continued the struggle. This is what gave it the label of vanguard. In those days there was class consciousness because the miners were not employees of a state enterprise; they were employees of private enterprise and, being private enterprise, class consciousness at that time was stronger than attachment to a job. They left their jobs and fought for change. I believe this is what made them strong. However, now it seems that workers do not have sufficient class consciousness. Let us see which worker would decide to leave his job for the struggle. None. They prefer to keep their jobs, even with a miserable salary, and not give up their jobs and embark on the struggle. This shows that class consciousness has decreased and that one is just another worker. I believe that this is what is happening now. [PRESENCIA] On the other hand, are the peasant leaders ready, in a trade union sense, to lead the COB? [Willka] I think that...some time ago, I said that I did not know how we could qualify, whether we would all have to take an examination. It is always that way, it is also ideological: "The peasants are not ready yet." We have not been ready for 500 years, but when will we be? I believe that this is the question. I believe that no one has ever taken on a responsibility, already knowing everything. It is a matter of initiative, of a person's decision to assume responsibility. [PRESENCIA] Getting back to the sectors, which ones have received the proposal most favorably? [Willka] The miners agreed to discuss it, to think it over. Those who do not want to hear of it are the Troskyites, who accuse us of being back in the Middle Ages. The teachers agree. But let us be clear: It will not be the miners or the factory workers or the teachers who decide not to go along, but the professional politicians, such as the Trotskyites. But I do not believe that they represent all of the teachers. We would be wrong, then, to say that they do not accept us. [PRESENCIA] In your view what is the outlook for the 10th Congress of the COB? [Willka] There are going to be problems along the lines indicated by this discussion, and everyone will want to speak his mind. But I believe that there is maturity at the sector level. I believe that in spite of these problems, the COB is going to go forward, as it has always done. We will form the Executive Committee, whoever might be on it, because there is no way to calculate that. The workers say "so many of us have died," and we wish we were able to count how many of us have died; we have millions of dead, not only during this period but since the arrival of the Spaniards. [PRESENCIA] You no longer believe in vanguards? [Willka] Not any more. The vanguard should include all the workers, from the smallest to the biggest, without preferences. [PRESENCIA] How long will the CSUTCB last if they do not listen to you? [Willka] We have realized that, having the secretary general, having the executive, has resolved nothing. We have to think about making a political move; leaving the trade union struggle to move on to a political struggle. The union movement is a form of struggle, but it is others who wield power, and all our lives we have been fools and nothing more. That is why I say that if they do not give us, let us say, the executive, with a factory worker executive, with a miner executive, or with whomever, the peasants are going to continue offering up their lives, as in this latest conflict. Let the peasants win the executive, we are the ones who weep and die. That is the problem. Therefore, we will continue on that road. [PRESENCIA] What will be the principal disagreements at the 10th Congress of the COB? [Willka] In reality, they will be between the official position and those who do not share the official position, but not so much a function of party but of concept, of the thinking in each sector. I say that their proposal is bad because they want to destroy the communities. By means of municipalization, the indigenous communities--we have been independent, so far--are now going to be dependents of popular participation. I do not agree with that because it really means we will all be the same. The new configuration of municipalities is going to break up entire communities of ours. I do not agree with that policy, and the official position is going to be one of agreement. The fight, then, will be along those lines. They will tell us that we are going to collect rural land taxes through the municipalities, and some will say yes, we will say no. Therefore, there are two different opinions. [PRESENCIA] Will the other conflict be between the classist concept and that of a nation? [Willka] I believe...we will see. I am calculating that no one will be opposed to it; I believe that everyone will sign on--even earlier they recognized the struggle of the nationalities in some manner. I do not believe anyone is going to deny that. I do not believe that this feeling exists in this Congress. During the Congress on Bolivian Education, which was held by the official sector, the COB, and the church, we all agreed that to educate the children is to construct a state that is multicultural, multinational, and socialist. (The socialist did not please many, but we explained that this was intended in a communitarian sense because, in the end, there cannot be a pretty little multicultural state which is also capitalist, and because what we are aiming for is that there should be equity.) [PRESENCIA] Organically, also? [Willka] There it will be different. I think it will be difficult. There are going to be arguments, walk-outs, that kind of thing.... I at least am coming to the realization that it will still be a very serious problem. [Box, p 2] The Difficult Relationship Between Leadership and Peasant Grass Roots [PRESENCIA] The CSUTCB has entered and is still suffering from a very severe crisis due to ideological conflict and corruption. Why are there so many problems and what is being done to resolve them? [Willka] The crisis is due more than anything to the political positions of the peasant leaders. I would say that there are three positions. One, racist, which says that the only solution is finishing off the Creoles [q'aras]. Another, very clever, is the social democratic position which, starting out from peasant initiatives, has taken root, not directly as social democracy, but as a proposal vindicating the rights of the peasants. The third current position proposes neither racism nor classism. We say that it is not possible for the class struggle and the struggle of the indigenous nations to be separated or even allied, but they must be a single thing, without it disturbing anyone, and that is what is happening, to a certain extent. These factions have confronted one another to take over the leadership of the trade union movement, but I think that the conflict is a thing of the past. The last conflict was due to the fact that the social democrats of the MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] wanted complete domination over the CSUTCB, so that it would serve as the political cushion of the current government; its leaders wanted to hang on and there we fought it out, we made a problem out of it. At last, there is unity now through communitarian trade union democracy, which means that he who won has won, and nothing more. This is where the political maturity of the comrade delegates who attended the congress was demonstrated. They had to elect a comrade peasant who expresses both ideas, Comrade Felix Santos, who is a genuine peasant. Evidently, they are not happy about this, they keep complaining, there are many loud complaints from many sides, but in any case, the crisis we were suffering has been resolved at the leadership level, but only partly at the grass roots. The leadership has influence, but the grass roots are a different story. [PRESENCIA] What is going on at the peasant grass roots? [Willka] The grass roots are structured differently. There are trade unions, indigenous authorities, cooperatives, and associations, there are many forms of organization. The principal authorities in the communities are the trade unions and the indigenous authorities, and the others (cooperatives, associations) are the economic branches of those authorities. We lack sufficient communication with the grass roots to keep them well-informed. It is very hard to reach everywhere. In that regard, the best organized are the miners, the workers. They work together, at the blow of a whistle they have a meeting, while with us.... [PRESENCIA] How would you describe the different positions in the peasant movement? [Willka] It depends on the problems of each community, each sector, and each region. Those most affected by neoliberal policies and foreign political interference recently have been the coca leaf growers. They have had very serious problems. A coca grower is constantly afraid that the UMOPAR [Mobile Rural Patrol Unit) will seize his house, ransack it, and leave a kilo of cocaine, and say afterward that they found it there; it is really serious. In addition, the eradication of the coca plantations has hurt. It is as if a comrade on the altiplano had his crops destroyed by someone. Anyone would get angry. This is why the coca growers have really radicalized their struggle. It is the same on the altiplano: everyone has become radicalized over the tax on rural property and against commercialization of the land, which is a very sore subject for the peasants. These problems come up and the comrades become radicalized, they fight. With regard to extreme poverty, there are many approaches. Many comrades believe that the government is going to save them when they experience hardship and that is why they tend, let us say, to suffer hunger. That happens because they think that the government might help them to improve their situation, and they allow themselves to be used. This is a problem that we have been unable to remedy so far. This is why there are questions: although everyone is united in the struggle of the indigenous nations over land, taxes, etc., no one is united when it comes to elections. Instead, everyone casts his vote for a political choice contrary to his interests, believing that the government is going to take care of his problem. [Box, p 2] If the COB's Business Was Conducted in Aymara! Willka's ideas about the need for change in the COB are not new. He proposed them some six years ago, together with other peasant leaders. Nevertheless, there are problems of communication. "Even I have a problem," he admits. "It is not possible for an urban teacher, let us say, to grasp it because my language is different from his. I was born speaking Aymara, and I learned Castilian at age 12. This is why our way of expressing ourselves and of interpreting things holds us peasants back." He explains that as Castilian is the language in which the COB's business is conducted "we sometimes do not make ourselves understood, but if discussions in the 10th Congress of the COB are going to be in Aymara, Quechua, then the other sectors will have interpreters, but they will not be able to explain to us with perfect clarity what they are thinking. This, in fact, is our problem, and it is present in all of the meetings." And it has consequences: "There are some concepts that sometimes I really have to go to the dictionary to look up, and the following day it dawns on me. Oh hell, that is what was said, and all this time I did not understand!" Hard To Change In addition, Willka says that there is a deeply rooted working class ideology in the cities that is hard to change and that can be seen, "for example, in May Day parades, which are completely working class. The peasants in the department of La Paz customarily march on that day. There were more than 5,000 comrade peasants in the last parade. What newspaper coverage did they receive? None. Not even a tiny photograph. There were some 50-100 miners with their little picks, and they came out in a front page photo. It seems that the press is also working class. That is all right. These things happen. They still do not want to understand, it is like passing from one set of customs to another, from one way of life to another; it is hard." This situation is reflected in the COB. Willka says that "if a peasant was the executive of the COB, I do not know whether the workers would maintain their affiliation, they might decide to disaffiliate because the roots are very strong, the class struggle is very deeply rooted." [Box, p 2] Politics and Peasants The peasant movement has experienced many changes of fortune. It had gained much strength by 1952 but gradually lost it later until, with the creation of the CSUTCB, an equivocal period of crisis began. Willka explains this phenomenon, recognizing that "our thinking was different before 1952. We did not even understand the problem of the land. The MNR [National Revolutionary Movement] said that it was going to give us land, as though they had brought the land with them; we did not know that the land was ours, that our history was hidden in darkness. Now, all of the peasants are obliged to think things through." He believes that with the foundation of the CSUTCB in 1979, "matters are becoming much clearer, the current leaders are more open." "But we have still not been able to escape or deal with the political manipulation that exists in the country. They have manipulated us very easily, for example: The `Goni' [typical member of an indigenous nation] has become aware of the political accumulation of the past 500 years. On 12 October 1992 we were feeling very strong and right away an Aymara comes along--Victor Hugo Cardenas--to be co-opted, and in the end he ruined us politically. In other words, the indigenous nations were a real answer for many people, but when they saw an Aymara make common cause with the Creoles, they no longer trusted the Aymaras." This is why he is convinced that Cardenas's decision was a severe blow. "We want to go forward with our own leaders. The people have been trusting, there have been the 500 years of Aymaras, Quechuas, and with their mobilization, we felt united, we could do things, our grass roots believed that now we were strong and people believed that `these leaders are raising us up.' We even used to say that the workers, that this or that sector, had betrayed us, when someone of our own blood sold himself out to the neoliberal political leadership." "What do the people at the grass roots think? That their leaders always betray them, there is the Aymara who sold out. I think that Victor Hugo lent himself to that game. If he had not, he would certainly not be in the government, but perhaps he would have had a position of such prestige as to be able to lead, just like Mandela in South Africa, who showed us that this kind of thing is possible." "Imperialism has very cleverly created a problem for us. Before, it killed us to keep us quiet, now it co-opts us and makes us distrust our own leaders. Who is going to believe me now? I travel among the indigenous nations, I talk, but people are thinking `this one is just using us to get ahead. Tomorrow or the next day he will surely sell out, just like Victor Hugo.' This is what has happened, and it is very serious." Nevertheless, asked whether the influence of the political parties in the peasant movement is harmful, Willka says no. "It was harmful before, but lately it is not very important, because who are they influencing? On the one hand, there is the official sector (MNR, MRTKL [Tupac Katari Revolutionary Movement], UCS [Solidarity Civic Union], MBL [Free Bolivian Movement]); on the other, the groups represented in the union leadership, the ASD [Social Democratic Alliance] and the Pachakuti axis," but he says that it was decided to leave aside party labels and enter the struggle of class and nation. "That is, first I am a peasant, and I am expressing myself this way. This is at the trade union level. Second, I myself feel that I must perform a political task for the liberation of the people. It would seem that these are very exaggerated arguments that the political parties are using. I do not feel manipulated nor am I a manipulator, because I am part of the political leadership." "I do not believe that there is anyone in the COB.... Who could politically impose a given leader? I do not think that way. There must be very little of that now. That is how it was before. It was said that, politically, this one must be a leader, and everyone had to support him, but no longer." [Box, p 2] Production, Culture and Consciousness, Origins of the Peasant Crisis The ever more important presence of peasants in the various social and political movements is explained by Willka as due to economic, cultural, and political factors, starting with the struggle of the indigenous nations. In his view, "the struggle is not always in the street. The struggle can be carried out in different ways, and the struggle of the indigenous nations has been one of resistance. They have resisted by retaining their cultural roots, their language, their laws, their form of organization, and even their territories." This is why, he explains, the peasants produce 70 percent of the country's foodstuffs, while there is not even a single farm operator who produces quinua, lamb, kidney beans, broad beans, onions, cacao, lettuce, peaches, or corn. The only products the farm operators produce are sugarcane, soy beans, cotton, and beef. The peasants grow the coca. There are no farm operators who grow coca." Cultural roots are another factor. Willka refers to the peasants' own organizations, structured "on the basis of the philosophy of the land." In this field, the fact that the land, under the Agrarian Reform Law, cannot be seized or divided, "means that no one can take our land from us, and it does not frighten us when they threaten us, saying `since you have been obstructing us, now you are going to lose your land.'" The final factor Willka mentions is that the peasants have become aware that they have been exploited, excluded, and oppressed for the past 500 years, and they have never been able to have their own government. With respect to the first, the peasant leader says that the peasants are participants in two forms of struggle: the class struggle, because they are exploited, "but we are also oppressed and excluded as nation and culture. This, then, is a factor that allows us to raise our consciousness." Finally, he says that "governments have always been Creole or mestizo, never an Aymara nor any other indigenous nationality. This an awareness that is taking root in the communities and that is beginning to raise the question: when are we going to manage our own affairs?"
