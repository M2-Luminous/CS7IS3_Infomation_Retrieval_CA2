Our Brussels correspondent Nikolaos Belos has the following dispatch. [Begin Belos recording] The EU Commission will not take Greece to the European Court for its measures against Skopje before the conclusion of mediation efforts by Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek. This decision was made after a long debate at today's meeting of the EU Commission, during which political issues prevailed over legal and trade issues. According to a statement by the spokesman of Commission President Jacques Delors, all aspects of the issue--political, legal, and trade--were discussed during the debate. The spokesman said: It was decided to continue the mediation efforts of Van Den Broek, who will discuss the issue with Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias tomorrow in Israel. Responding to a question, the spokesman also stressed that Van Den Broek does not plan any meetings with the Skopjeans for the time being. In conclusion, the spokesman emphasized that until Wednesday, when the issue will be discussed again at a Commission meeting, the commissioners authorized Commission President Jacques Delors and Van Den Broek to make the necessary decision on how to handle the issue. The debate on the legal and trade aspects of the Greek measures was conducted on the basis of an opinion by the Commission's Legal Department given to the commissioners. According to reports, the Legal Department reported that it can justify a court case against Greece. In his intervention during the discussion, Greek Commissioner Ioannis Palaiokrassas referred to the historic aspects of the issue and to continuous Skopjean provocations against Greece. Finally, it has been learned that Greece's measures against Skopje will be discussed in Brussels on Monday during the EU foreign ministers meeting. [end recording]
