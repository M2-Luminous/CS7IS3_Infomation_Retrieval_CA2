Alain Juppe spoke to Farida Ayari a few minutes ago, as soon as he arrived in South Africa: [Begin recording] [Juppe, in progress] ...my outrage at this odious killing. We immediately took the necessary steps with the Algerian authorities. Our ambassador has been received by Prime Minister Redha Malek. As you know, we had taken significant security measures, but of course, because the French community in Algeria is so scattered, no security system is 50 percent efficient, or even 40 percent, as I said earlier. Unfortunately, this was proven true the hard way. [Ayari] Will you be taking other steps? [Juppe] Of course. In particular we are going to try to find out how we can reduce the number of staff at our official facilities, so that civil servants are exposed as little as possible. [end recording] Asked whether France would close its consulate in Algeria, Alain Juppe answered, I quote, we have not reached that stage yet.
