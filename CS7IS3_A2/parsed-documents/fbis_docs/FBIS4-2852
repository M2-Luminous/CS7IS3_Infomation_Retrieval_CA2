A single tax was tried by the Ming Dynasty in the 16th century, but it failed to save it from tax revolts and eventual collapse. Frustrated by its inability to cap the proliferation of arbitrary charges and fees imposed on farmers, which have led to violent uprisings among the 800-million-strong rural population, policy analysts in the Ministry of Agriculture have proposed a unitary tax geared to household income, sources in Beijing said. The proposal was put to national leaders for the first time at a national agriculture work meeting last month. The ministry is pushing for the new tax to be implemented as early as next year in order to guard against tax revolts like those last year in Sichuan and Anhui. It would replace the existing 3 per cent state agricultural tax and provincial and local levies. The single tax idea has already won strong support from farmers, the sources said. A survey by the ministry and the State Council's Development Research Centre early last month revealed growing friction between local cadres and farmers over the actual amount of every fee levied last year, a survey team member said. "The peasants were also surprised when the cadres mentioned the newspaper and entertainment fees. They said they had never seen a movie in their lives!" According to the official, a unified tax was seen by Beijing as the main way to calm the peasants and bring political stability. "Those in the survey were willing to accept rates of 7 or 8 per cent of their income, as long as it was fixed from year to year." A State Council decree of last April limited fees to 5 per cent of peasant income, but evidence gathered so far suggests that this has hardly dented the rapacity of local officials. A report in the FARMERS' DAILY [NONGMIN RIBAO] last December showed 47 per cent of households did not know about the national directive limiting charges to 5 per cent of incomes. The recent survey, which covered four counties in Sichuan and Hunan, found that taxes consumed an average of 8.4 per cent of peasant incomes in 1992, a figure which the official said was "almost certainly much higher" in 1993. However, the single tax proposal was likely to run into strong opposition from local officials, fearful the central government would take most of the revenue, leaving them with little. "In fact much of the problem of excessive taxes comes from the upper level governments, who demand money for large scale irrigation and distribution projects," the official said. "The local governments we have talked to say there would be nothing left over for their provision of basic services." The official said resolving the split of the tax between government levels would be the biggest hurdle to overcome. In 1579, Ming dynasty rulers implemented a so called "single whip" tax system, meant to check the power of local authorities to impose arbitrary charges, requisitions and services from the peasantry. But the "single whip" tax is seen by scholars as a failure because it came down harder on poor areas than on rich ones. Local opposition to the tax contributed to the deterioration of imperial finances control in the last few decades before the dynasty was overthrown in 1644. Under the Communists, the imposition of charges to pay for local services has multiplied since agricultural reforms giving peasants control over their own production began in the 1980s. The burgeoning tax burdens of China's peasants were singled out by scholars at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in their 1994 Outlook as an important factor causing a "trend towards instability" in the Chinese countryside. It said that reducing the tax burden on peasants would be difficult this year and it would "very likely exceed the 1993 levels". The ministry issued a further warning last week to local governments about exaggerating local incomes in order to justify higher taxes. "Each household knows its own income, and maybe its neighbours', but they can't see what the cadres report to the central government," the official said. Despite changes in the countryside, mainland social analysts say peasants remain vulnerable to being systematically oppressed by the state. "Their unorganised nature makes them vulnerable and an easy target of exploitation," said one analyst.
