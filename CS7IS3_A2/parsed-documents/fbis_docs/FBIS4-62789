Soiree for Yesterday's DEN or Today's ZAVTRA"] [Text] The soiree for the spiritual opposition newspaper ZAVTRA in the weight-lifting room at the Izmaylovo sports complex, which was filled to bursting, resembled least of all a quiet celebration of yesterday's DEN; it was more like the rally by the supporters of resolute action to restore Soviet power that began 9 May, involving virtually the same people, the same demands, and the same confidence in the future. The soiree's leaders ascended the weight-lifting podium with confident stride: At the head came Aleksandr Rutskoy, like a standard bearer, with everyone else behind. Rutskoy was the first to speak after the soiree's master of ceremonies, Aleksandr Prokhanov. The former vice president's speech was not very reminiscent of his first meeting with a national-patriotic audience, in the Rossiya movie theater -- the former pilot did not have his usual sheet of paper, and there were none of the usual prompters to tell him the correct pronunciation of the names of Russian philosophical theoreticians. To quote the state's former number two, the first thing that troubled Aleksandr Rutskoy was the reason for the gathering. Forgetting that he was just the first act in a preplanned spectacle, the general asked his audience and comrades in arms: "What brings us together?" Lust for power or the desire to live a worthy life? However, Aleksandr Rutskoy soon made it clear that he was only reiterating ideas voiced 9 May and that the purpose of the gathering was to prepare everything to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the victory in time for 9 May 1995 and the personal victory over "Yeltsin's and Kozyrev's mongrel policy." Then came Ilya Konstantinov's recollections of his impressions after reading a book by Victor Hugo; Aleksandr Prokhanov's repeated assurances that all the people gathered here were free agents (the soiree did indeed begin at 1830 hours and, judging by the mood of the audience, no one was in a hurry to go home). Aleksandr Prokhanov, who usually complains about the dominance of the democratic press, suddenly bragged that the opposition has around 100 newspapers countrywide and said that he still remembers a dark corridor at "Ostankino," two candles, and then the office of General Achalov, who told all the "mass media" forthwith: "We want peace, but let them return their plunder." And he also asked for the Soviet armed forces' reputation to be restored. The undoubted highlight of the evening was Nevzorov, who described the "charming agrarians" now in the Duma who "wear the same suit throughout their working life," and how Burbulis behaves when he sits next to him at meetings, and finally made the optimistic promise that "everything will be restored" shortly. The most touching moment of the evening was when Aleksandr Nevzorov was given some flowers: A boy sent by some adult ran up onto the weight-lifting podium and over to the soiree presidium rostrum and spent a long time wondering to whom to give the bouquet. "Whose boy is this?" Aleksandr Prokhanov asked over the microphone and affectionately beckoned the boy over. The kid took a long time to leave the stage, amid the friendly laughter of the free agents in the room. Albert Makashov went up to the microphone right after the boy and was introduced by Aleksandr Prokhanov with a riddle: "Who ran through the White House on foot in a black beret like a wolf from the first to the 13th floor?" Gen. Makashov angrily asked God to clear the country of prostitutes and the mafia, or else he and his comrades would do it themselves "if you do not have the time, God"; he also promised to hand over his shoulder boards to anyone who would unite them [sentence as published]. It was probably for the special benefit of those people gathered at Izmaylovo that evening who thought about uniting all the readers of Prokhanov's newspaper in the future and obtaining Gen. Makashov's shoulder boards that the following books were sold in the foyer: "Mein Kampf," Zyuganov's memoirs, and a political biography of Rutskoy, alongside cassettes of ponderous German Army marches. "All Russia is in the mire" -- that was the beginning of a poem by General Titov, the most peaceable of all the generals at the soiree. "I must live in peace and harmony," Mikhail Georgiyevich continued, and gave the following reason: "I belong to the heroic generation that stopped fascism." And he asked the free agents to consider Prokhanov the people's editor of what is indeed a people's newspaper and Boris Yeltsin as Russia's first and last president, stipulating however for the press that he personally favors the peaceful way of resolving the problem. A soiree that should have demonstrated the unity of the whole opposition nonetheless left observers with plenty of questions: General Sterligov, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Viktor Aksyuchits's Christian Democrats, Vasilyev's "Pamyat," Astafyev's Christian Democrats, and many others did not want to subscribe to Russia's unity. And Aleksandr Rutskoy himself, as a representative of his party courteously told your IZVESTIYA correspondent, was the only official delegate from the Free Russia People's Party. So Gen. Makashov can rest easy over his shoulder boards.
