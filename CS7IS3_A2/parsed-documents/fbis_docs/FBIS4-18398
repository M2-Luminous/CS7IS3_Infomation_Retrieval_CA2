In a letter to his Turkish counterpart, Hikmet Cetin, published in Bonn today, Kinkel wrote that Cetin should see to it that the relevant agreement of June 1992 was complied with. The German foreign minister referred to the fact that politicians and the media kept claiming that weapons supplied by Germany were being used inside Turkey in the fight against the banned Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) contrary to the terms of the agreement. The Turkish Government knew "that this problem has considerable influence on the shaping of bilateral relations," Kinkel said.
