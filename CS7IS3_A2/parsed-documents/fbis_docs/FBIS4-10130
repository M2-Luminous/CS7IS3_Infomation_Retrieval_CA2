"They will be regulations the government will support because they will come from an autonomous branch," said Fujimori, who also noted the openness of the official bloc in gathering suggestions presented by other political groups and unions. He pointed out that debates and disagreements are always good because they lead to conclusions. This is why he believes the debate on the electoral system is not tangled up in discussions. Fujimori refrained from commenting on the request by some congressmen and politicians that he leave the presidency six months before next year's general elections if he decides to run for reelection. "Excuse me, I am abstaining from commenting on the electoral issue for the time being," said Fujimori in answer to a reporter. Regarding other issues, Fujimori announced that as of April all public servants will get a salary increase and that the increase will be higher for those working in health and education. He did not give a percentage because "it is still being evaluated by the Economy and Finance Ministry." The president made the announcement after admitting that government salaries are very low. He said: "There should not be any doubt that there is a desire to increase the salaries not only of teachers but of all public servants." After dedicating seven new educational centers in northern Lima, Fujimori confirmed his confidence in Peruvian Ambassador to Ecuador Eduardo Ponce. Fujimori said: "Peruvian relations with Ecuador are at the best possible level, although there are some situations that can be misinterpreted but which do not take away the merit of the high level of trust between the two countries." He added that relations are fluid because there is direct communication between the two countries' foreign ministries. He indicated that the friendship between the two peoples is above any circumstantial situation. He noted that the ambassadors are representatives of the Peruvian Government and that "as long as they act in support of those relations, I am sure there is no need for the government to question their performance." Fujimori then confirmed his confidence in Ambassador Eduardo Ponce and disregarded reports that he would be called back to our country. He said: "I am sure Ecuadoran officials will have a spirit of understanding in this situation." Fujimori also expressed his disagreement with the idea that part of the resources received from the privatization of public companies be used to pay the foreign debt. He said: "We don't want the resources from privatization to be used for paying the foreign debt because we have much infrastructure to be improved and medium- and long-term projects to carry out." He said it is essential that those resources be used in social projects. Fujimori reiterated that it is expected that about $3 billion will be received this year from the sale of public companies and it will be essential for social investments.
