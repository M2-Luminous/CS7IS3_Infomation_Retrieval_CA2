Australian Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe said Li had made clear to him that Beijing's "knowledge was incomplete," emphasising the point that "the IAEA might assist by providing China with more information that it could use to make a firmer judgement." China, which has consistently opposed imposing sanctions on North Korea, has also expressed its willingness to play a "constructive" role to resolve the crisis, sparked by North Korea's refusal to allow International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to its nuclear facilities. However, Beijing also emphasised that its influence over its neighbour and its knowledge of North Korea's nuclear programme -- suspected by the United States to be developing a nuclear bomb -- is limited. "Certainly I didn't get much hint of support for sanctions, but I did get a sense that China was prepared to play a role that was constructive," said Howe, in China on an eight-day visit. "There was implied there recognition that China needed to be brought into the game more and trusted to play that role ... that China needed to be trusted with a bit more confidence to use that influence" that it is assumed to have over North Korea, Howe told journalists. As support grows for U.S. calls for sanctions against North Korea, the stance of China -- which has a veto as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council -- is critical. China abstained Friday in an IAEA vote to suspend technical assistance to North Korea.
