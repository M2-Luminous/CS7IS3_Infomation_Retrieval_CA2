The three rivers flow over an area of 78,000 sq [square] km in southern Shandong Province and northern Jiangsu Province, a region which is a major supplier of grain and coal in east China. Government sources said the completion of the project will raise the canal's flood-discharge capacity to 5,500 cu m [cubic meters] per second. The project, part of the national program to control flooding on the Huaihe River, will cost more than one billion yuan, which will be financed by Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces, said the sources. Meanwhile, another flood control project was also started in Guoyang County, Anhui Province, on the Baohuihe River, another tributary of the Huaihe River with a drainage area of 2,930 sq km. The project will involve the dredging of the river channel and the building of locks, bridges and pumping stations on the river, which, local sources said, will enable the area to resist severe floods. The project is supported by a national agricultural development fund.
