ACTION: Public Land Order. SUMMARY: This order partially revokes an Executive order insofar as it affects 640 acres of National Forest System land withdrawn for the Bureau of Land Management's Coal Reserve Montana No. 1. The land is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was withdrawn. The revocation is needed to finalize the Forest Service exchange provided for in Public Law 103&hyph;91, which mandated that the exchange be completed and clear title issued. This action will open the land to surface entry and mining. The land has been and will remain open to mineral leasing. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 4, 1994.
