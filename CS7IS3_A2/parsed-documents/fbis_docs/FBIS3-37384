It has already paid out 46 per cent of debts, Colonel-General Vassiliy Vorobyev, head of the chief administration of the military budget and financing, said at a news conference at the Defence Ministry on Wednesday. Asked by ITAR-TASS about reasons for payment delays, Vorobyev said that the military budget for the last year was approved at 8,300 billion roubles. However, the Finance Ministry transferred only 6,500 billion to the Defence Ministry. The ministry's minimum needs are over 10,000 billion. The Finance Ministry satisfied only 65 per cent of the needs. This is the explanation for debts and delays with payment of money allowances and wages. The colonel-general did not say anything about the ministry's solvency this year. Vorobyev noted that everything would depend on the federal budget which will be examined by parliament in the near future. Provision is made for some increase in appropriations for purchasing weapons and combat materiel as well as for research and development. According to Vorovyev's forecast, the practice of saving on all the spheres of army and naval activities will be continued this year.
