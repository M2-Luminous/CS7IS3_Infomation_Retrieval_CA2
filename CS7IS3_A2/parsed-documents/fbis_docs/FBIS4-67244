The federal justice institution noted that updating the expert study of chemical reagents used to identify cocaine, marijuana, and other drugs is another purpose of the course, to be held in Mexico City's Independence Auditorium. The official spokesman for the Attorney General's Office, Fernando Aguilar, remarked that the meeting would be opened by the assistant prosecutor for preliminary investigations, Rene Gonzalez de la Vega. It will be organized by that institution's General Directorate of Expert Services as well. He indicated that, during the sessions, both national and foreign experts will relate their experiences with the use of reagents and high technology procedures as aids in the investigations conducted by the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office. The aim is to achieve a better and more expeditious prosecution and administration of justice. He explained that, at the first session, on 25 April, the specialists will discuss topics relating to the organization of narcotics laboratories in France and Mexico, and the program for regionalizing such laboratories, as well as the national dating of drugs in France. They will also deal with problems involving the international legislation on chemical precursors. There will be subsequent discussions on the identification of marijuana based on its botanical characteristics, color reactions, and chromatography techniques, as well as the identification of its origin. Also to be covered are hallucinogenic mushrooms and their active principles; cocaine and its botanical characteristics, origin, and identification with various chemical reagents; and precursors and analogous drug substances. Other topics dealt with will be the identification of Papaveracea [the poppy family]; opium and its derivatives; and the analysis of its principal adulterants, derivatives, intermediate products, and precursors. Before the forum concludes, speakers will discuss the classification of psychotropics, pharmacological activity and the General Health Law, and the identification of amphetamines and their derivatives, barbiturates, and hypnotic substances.
