FR940628-0-00006 FR940628-0-00004 21 CFR Parts 510, 520, 524, and 558 New Animal Drugs; Technical Amendment AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule; technical amendment. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect the correct drug labeler code for Hess & Clark, Inc. The agency codified an incorrect drug labeler code. This action corrects that error. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Judy M. O'Haro, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;238), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1737. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In a document published in the Federal Register of February 3, 1981 (46 FR 10462), the animal drug regulations were amended to reflect a change of sponsor for certain NADA's from Hess & Clark, Division of Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., to Hess & Clark, Inc. This sponsor change necessitated a new entry in 21 CFR 510.600 for Hess & Clark, Inc. However, the February 3, 1981, final rule codified an incorrect drug labeler code for the firm. This document corrects that error.
