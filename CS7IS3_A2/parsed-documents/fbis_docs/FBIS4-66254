Meanwhile, we have also achieved conditional RMB convertibility for everyday transactions, which is a major step in making the RMB a convertible currency. In addition, China has also lowered again the import tariffs on some products, publishing management regulations on machinery and electronic imports and on ordinary commodity import quotas. While lifting the obligation of foreign trade enterprises to turn foreign exchange over to the state, we have also instituted a uniform value-added and income tax system, abolishing directive foreign trade planning, which has further deregulated foreign trade operations, and strengthened foreign trade coordination mechanisms. The successive implementation of these foreign trade reform measures, in contrast to past reform steps, has been a great breakthrough in areas, such as policy consolidation, operating deregulation, liability for profits and losses, and equal competition. It will solve well certain deeper problems that have long troubled our foreign trade growth, as well as bringing China's foreign trade system closer to international standards, and further opening up China's huge markets to the outside world. The major substance of this round of foreign trade reform is mainly as follows: I. We Have Established a Market-Based, Single, and Managed Floating Exchange Rate System, Achieving Conditional RMB Convertibility for Everyday Transactions. Since 1 January 1994, the RMB exchange rate mechanism has become marketized, consolidating the official and market exchange rates, with the recent exchange rate essentially maintained at about 8.7 RMB to the dollar. The complete marketization [commercialization] of our exchange rate mechanism will help to eliminate existing market distortions, paving the way for deeper participation by China in the international division of labor and exchanges based on the comparative advantage principle. 1) As to China's foreign trade enterprises, the exchange rate merger and foreign trade reform have rationalized the distribution relations between the state and enterprises, by abolishing the obligation of foreign trade enterprises to turn over foreign exchange to the state either with or without compensation, and changing to payment of income taxes according to a uniform enterprise income tax system, which has helped to consolidate policy, creating a climate of equal competition for all foreign trade enterprises, giving them genuine liabiliy for profits and losses and deregulated operation. 2) The full marketization of our exchange rate mechanism conforms to GATT and IMF arrangements on not practicing dual exchange rates, bringing China's foreign trade system closer to international standards. 3) Our exchange rate mechanism reform will also help to prevent sharp, unchecked RMB exchange rate volatility through manipulation of speculative and psychological-expectation factors, thus bringing trade convenience to both China and our trading partners. II. We Have Abolished Foreign Exchange Retention, Changing Our Wholesale Foreign Exchange System to One of Bank Settlement and Sale of Foreign Exchange. While merging our exchange rates, we correspondingly reformed our foreign exchange management system, changing our past foreign exchange retention and wholesale foreign exchange systems to bank settlement and sale of foreign exchange, and achieving conditional RMB convertibility for everyday transactions. While our foreign exchange retention system was a key step in our foreign trade reform of devolving authority to lower administrative levels, playing a key role in stimulating the initiative of all to export more, it was also an objective factor in the formation of departmental, regional, and enterprise [foreign exchange] ownership, strengthening local foreign trade protectionism, sharpening market divisions, and having many negative effects, with the duplicate development of export manufacturing industries, the too similar export commodity mix, and the regional divisions in our foreign exchange conversion market all being involved to a certain extent. Since we went to the system of bank settlement and sale of foreign exchange, enterprises can buy foreign exchange from banks for imports within the limits allowed by national laws and decrees with valid documents, such as contracts and payment notices. This has formed a nationally uniform and standardized foreign exchange market, thus thoroughly breaking local and enterprise foreign exchange ownership, and helping to eradicate the impact of local protectionism. III. We Have Abolished Directive Planning, Improving Our Macroeconomic Regulation and Control of Foreign Exchange. In order to eliminate the conflict of foreign trade enterprises having to be liable for their own profits and losses while fulfilling directive foreign trade plans, in coordination with our overall plans for foreign trade market reform, the state conducted a major reform of our foreign trade planning system, deciding to abolish foreign trade directive planning, and to draw up guidance plans for overall foreign trade volume, export earnings, and import exchange use, with the state using economic and legal means to guide enterprises to achieve predetermined targets. To ensure a balance of foreign trade and international payments, the state will use the methods in current international practice, such as adjusting macroeconomic policy and taking other GATT-permitted steps, to achieve balance. Our foreign trade macroeconomic regulation and control will change from the former regulation and control that was relatively independent of the national economy to a basically uniform state. IV. We Have Better Promoted Deregulated Operation, Breaking With Monopoly, and Bringing Market Competition Forces Into Full Play. We have speeded up the examination and approval of foreign trade operating rights for all types of production enterprises, as well as clarifying that along with the establishment of a modern enterprise system, the clarification of property rights, and the perfection of our legal system, the state will no longer in the future practice a system of examination and approval of foreign trade operating rights, with enterprises automatically having foreign trade operating rights according to law. We will further deregulate foreign trade merchandise operations with, except for a very few staple resource-product imports and exports that will be jointly and uniformly operated according to international practice, all other commodities being freed up to deregulated operation, so that full market competition will form a new and rational operating order. V. We Have Instituted a Modern Enterprise System, Speeding Up the Conversion of Operating Forces, So That Foreign Trade Enterprise Operations Can Get On Track With International Practice as Quickly as Possible. This related reform of our foreign exchange and tax system has created the prerequisites for rationalization of the financial relations between foreign trade enterprises and the state, making it possible for foreign trade enterprises to genuinely practice standardized operations in which they are liable for their own profits and losses. Meanwhile, the widespread practice of a modern enterprise system, with foreign trade enterprises being upgraded to corporations, will help to establish the enterprise operating forces suited to current market economy norms of distinct property rights, clear rights and obligations, separation of government administration from business management, and scientific management. VI. We Have Maintained a Uniform Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Policy, Making It More Transparent. China has instituted a clearer and more nationally uniform foreign trade and economic cooperation system and policy, to promote a sound and improved nationally uniform market, as well as to meet the needs of international trade standards. In the interests of transparency, China will in the future apply only officially promulgated laws, regulations, and policies, which are uniformly announced to the outside world by MOFTEC. While foreign trade reform since 1988 has always been in the forefront of all national reforms, creating positive terms for expanded opening and faster foreign trade growth, the lack of reform synchronization has also caused a series of conflicts. The lack of market reforms in other fields has put severe limitations on foreign trade growth, leaving foreign trade falling between the cracks of international and domestic markets in a particularly difficult situation. The greatest difference between this 1994 foreign trade reform and past ones is that this is a part of overall economic reform, being conducted as a related reform along with others in areas such as tax revenue, banking, investment, and business. It is precisely due to these externally related terms that this reform is so unprecedented in dynamics and depth, so that the reform can basically establish market operating forces that are on track with international practice, unlike past reforms that all were flavored by compromise and transition. This will help to bring market forces into full play in the foreign trade field, while making the government's indirect macroeconomic regulation and control more standardized and effective, thus ensuring positive and sound foreign trade growth. While it will be impossible to completely avoid certain new conflicts and frictions, the general assessment is that the foreign trade operating-system climate will be much better, which will undoubtedly contribute to foreign trade growth. In particular, certain conflicts that affected our 1993 foreign trade, particularly our export growth, such as problems of jacked-up-price panic buying and cut-price competition touched off by unequal competition due to nonuniform policy, foreign trade enterprises being squeezed at both ends by exchange rate instability, local protectionism driven by interests such as foreign exchange, and the conflict between directive export-plan obligations and economic efficiency, can all be essentially resolved. The existing problem is mainly how foreign trade enterprises will adapt to the new operating forces, by speeding up their own reform and development, raising their management level, and improving their service. In this area, the crucial factors according to modern enterprise needs are speeding up the pace of state-owned foreign trade enterprise reform, and accelerating the conversion of their operating forces. As to government, how to speed up the establishment of an indirect regulation and control system suited to market economy needs, improve macroeconomic regulation and control, and standardize government functions, are major issues affecting foreign trade growth prospects, as well as a problem for foreign trade reform and expansion. How to escape the past customary form and fixed mode of thinking of direct control, to achieve indirect control in line with new needs is a challenge to government at all levels. As long as we make certain progress in these areas, we can predict that China's foreign trade will grow more in 1994 than it did in 1993, with prospects that exports will do better than their poor growth of 1993, thus achieving our aim of rapid and stable foreign trade growth, paving the way for long-range, sustained, and rapid foreign trade growth, and providing more trade opportunities for all countries throughout the world.
