In view of the defective Gabcikovo sluice chambers, the Hungarian Government has called on countries which insist on the principle of free navigation on the Danube, which conduct shipping traffic on the river, and which signed the 1948 Belgrade Convention on the Order of Navigation, to warn the Slovak Government to immediately stop the law-breaking action and ensure free passage, Herman said. He drew attention to the Slovak Government's responsibility for the cessation of shipping on the Danube due to a technical and professional error. After the first sluice chamber accident, the Hungarian Government warned the Slovak Government of the possibility of the second chamber going wrong, and asked it to do its best to make the given river section navigable. There was no Slovak response to this request, Herman said. Answering a question, the spokesman said that the building of version "C," and thus the recent accident, was to be blamed on former Slovak Governments, while Hungary would welcome possible negotiations with the new Slovak cabinet on boosting bilateral links. Herman reported fair progress in preparations for a "supervisory" conference of the 1992 Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to be held in Budapest's Convention Center from October 10 to December 2, and subsequent summit meetings from December 5-6. He finally announced the March 24 visit to Hungary of Peter Tarnoff, deputy undersecretary of state in charge of East European affairs at the U.S. State Department, who will study the region's situation and discuss NATO's Partnership for Peace.
