FR941020-1-00034 FR941020-1-00008 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [OH49&hyph;1&hyph;6072B; FRL&hyph;5082&hyph;6] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Ohio AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: USEPA is partially approving and partially disapproving, through ``direct final'' procedure, Ohio's State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision for implementation of the Stage II vapor recovery program. Section 182(b)(3) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires all States that have ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or above to implement a Stage II vapor recovery program. The Stage II vapor recovery program requires owners and operators of gasoline dispensing facilities that dispense greater than 10,000 gallons of fuel per month (50,000 gallon per month in the case of an independent small business marketer) to install and operate gasoline vehicle refueling vapor recovery systems. Vapor recovery systems control the release of volatile organic compounds (VOC), benzene, and toxics emitted during the refueling process. The USEPA is partially approving Ohio's Stage II rule package, and disapproving of Paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(DDD)(5), which grants the Director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) the discretion to suspend the Stage II vapor recovery program without prior approval of USEPA. The USEPA is partially approving the rules since, with the exception of Paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(DDD)(5), the program satisfies the criteria for approval of Stage II vapor recovery programs. The USEPA is disapproving Paragraph 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(DDD)(5) since it fails to satisfy the requirements of Part D of Title I of the CAA by providing the Director of OEPA the discretion to suspend the Stage II program without first obtaining Federal approval. Partial approval of the State of Ohio's Stage II submittal will incorporate the provisions of the program that satisfy USEPA's approval criteria into the State's Federally approved SIP. In the final rules section of the Federal Register , the USEPA is partially approving and partially disapproving this SIP revision request as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views the action as noncontroversial and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse public comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this action must be received by November 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be mailed to: William L. MacDowell, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Enforcement Branch (AE&hyph;17J), USEPA, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois 60604. Copies of the State submittal for this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following address: (It is recommended that you telephone John Paskevicz at (312) 886&hyph;6084 before visiting the Region 5 office.)
