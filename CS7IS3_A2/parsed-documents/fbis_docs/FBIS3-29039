In principle, the more companies, the more the people benefit because they will have more choices. Chaloemphon said: "The business' present image is not very good because certain companies still exploit clients. Liberalization will trigger competition and prevent maltreatment of clients." The deputy minister, however, reaffirmed that if it is decided that more insurance companies will be allowed to operate, application screening will be carried out in accordance with regulations. He said: "I can assure you that issuing permits must be done in a fair manner to all. If not, I will be the first to defend the interests of the people." He noted that although liberalization of the insurance business to open the door for foreign firms is necessary, existing Thai insurance companies need time to improve so they will be able to compete with foreign companies. He said: "I believe that Thai companies are not yet ready for competition and the government is taking necessary actions to defend their business as long as possible. They must make efforts to improve and should not only think of relying on government assistance."
