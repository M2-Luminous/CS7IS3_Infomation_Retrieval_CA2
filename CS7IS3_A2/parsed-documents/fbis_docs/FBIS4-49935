To safeguard the interests of the state and consumers, the staff members and workers of the commodity inspection departments throughout the country have made efforts to carry out reforms and keep forging ahead and promoted the rapid development of the commodity inspection cause. The reporters learned of the fact from the national meeting of commodity inspection bureau directors held on 5 May that positively responding to the strategy for "winning victory in foreign export trade through quality," commodity inspection departments have strictly conducted inspections and guarded the pass. The import and export commodities inspected last year were valued at $75.18 billion. Of this, 11,065 batches of export commodities were found unqualified, valuing at $301 million. The goods owners were instructed to sort out or change their goods. Thus, the reputation of the state has been safeguarded. Simultaneously, 12,814 batches of import commodities were found unqualified, valuing at $1.53 billion. Commodity inspection certificates were timely issued to the departments concerned for claiming damages from foreign countries. Some $186 million of compensation funds were paid. According to the "regulations on banning unlawful transit of textile products" promulgated by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, the General Customs Office, and the State Commodity Inspection Bureau, the commodity inspection departments of all localities inspected the marks of export textile products and prevented more than 300 batches of export textile products from exports. To solve the problems of fake and poor-quality products exported through the border trade which has rapidly developed over the past years, the commodity inspection department and the departments concerned especially investigated and studied these problems on several occasions and reflected the situations to the State Council in a timely manner. The commodity inspection department, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, and the General Customs Office jointly issued the "Circular on Strictly Banning the Exports of Fake and Poor-Quality Commodities," and revised and made public the "methods for inspecting the commodities exported and imported through the border trade." Simultaneously, the establishment of commodity inspection organs at border trade ports was accelerated. Methods for linking on-the-spot inspections with pursuing for a permanent control were adopted to manage the commodity inspections. Strict measures, including expanding the scale of sample surveys and turning over goods for inspections, were adopted to especially inspect the commodities relating to the people's safety and public health, the ordinary commodities, and the commodities easily mixed with fake commodities. The commodity inspection department also worked in coordination with the departments concerned to strictly handle a number of enterprises and businessmen that manufactured and sold fake and poor-quality export commodities. Thus, the trend that fake and poor-quality commodities were wantonly exported through border trade channels has effectively been brought under control. The commodity inspection organs at various levels have positively conducted self-reform. Some commodity inspection bureaus changed their laboratories with conditions into relatively independent inspection entities which could join the market competition. A small number of inspection and appraisal entities were changed into independent corporations. Market intermediate organizations, including quality attestation and property appraisal organizations, were growing up. On the basis of this, some commodity inspection bureaus begin to appropriately separate administrative management functions from specific inspection functions. To suit the demands for expanding the scale of opening the coastal and border areas and the areas along the rivers to the outside world, last year, 31 new commodity inspection organizations were established, 26 preparatory organizations were approved, and six Sino-foreign jointly invested inspection and appraisal organizations were set up.
