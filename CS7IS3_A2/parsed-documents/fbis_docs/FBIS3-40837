Narasimha Rao, today warned against attempts to deny certain technologies to India even in the post-GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) period marked by liberalisation of trade in goods and services. "It is a kind of protectionism built into liberalisation... An attempt will be there to withhold a technology from a country like India due to apprehensions that it would become powerful and progressive," Mr Rao said inaugurating the 81st session of the Indian Science Congress. Expressing confidence that the country would come out of such a situation, he foresaw a rapid expansion in the research and development field. He appealed to science and technology personnel to help the country in exploiting the vast export opportunities offered by the post-GATT period. The Prime Minister said India, with its vast reservoir of science and technology personnel and comparatively lower manpower costs, was fully capable of meeting the export challenges thrown open in the post--GATT liberalised environment. GATT ensured further opening up of national economies and Indian science and technology personnel and industry leaders would have an enlarged arena to play their part in this new situation, he said. Allaying fears expressed by some scientists and certain sectors of trade that indigenous research and development might be jeopardised by the recently concluded GATT negotiations, Mr Rao said India could, in fact, clearly delineate areas of significant opportunities in textiles and clothing, agriculture, trade related intellectual property rights, and services. Science and technology and research and development would be of paramount importance in the post-GATT liberalised environment, he said. In the new scenario, there was a large scope for cross-border investments and the spread of research and development across the national boundaries, he said. India must be prepared to profit from this situation as research and development costs in India vary greatly from the costs abroad, he noted. The Prime Minister said India could launch joint research and development projects with other countries. It could do so because of high science and technology calibre in a wide spectrum of fields, substantial research and development infrastructure, extensive test facilities of world standard, language skills and worldwide presence of Indian scientists, he added. Earlier, the Prime Minister presented the Asutosh Mukherjee Memorial Award for 1993 to Dr A.S. Paintal, C.V. Raman Birth Centenary Award to Dr M.S. Narasimha, Srinivasa Ramanujan Birth Centenary Award to Prof. B.P. Bambah, M.N. Saha Birth Centenary Award to Dr Hari Narain, P.V. Mahanalobis Birth Centenary Award to Prof. P.V. Sukhatme, J.C. Bose Memorial Award to Prof. A.K. Sharma, P.C. Ray Memorial Award to Prof. C.N.R. Rao and Prof. Hira Lal Chakaravarty Award to Dr K.C. Bansal and Dr S.L. Kothari. Rajasthan Governor Bali Ram Bhagat released a souvenir and Chief Minister Bhairon Singh Shekhawat released a book titled `Indian Science-A Selected Bibliography' on the occasion.
