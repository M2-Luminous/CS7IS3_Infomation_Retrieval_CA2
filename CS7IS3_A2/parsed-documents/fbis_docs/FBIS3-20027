FBIS3-20027 "drweu058_k_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-058 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Mar 1994 PORTUGAL _o_ Movement of Presidential Candidates 94P20540A 94P20540A Article Type:CSO [Editorial report] An article in the 4 March Lisbon weekly TAL & QUAL reports that Socialist Party (PS) official Mario Sottomayor Cardia, a former deputy and former minister of education who recently announced his candidacy for the presidency of the Republic, "disregarded the rule that a candidate should not reveal his intentions until the last minute to avoid attracting premature partisan support that may later be withheld, or spare himself the ridicule of a quick preelectoral defeat." According to the article, he is now beginning a "long, lone road without the protective embrace" of the party he helped found and lacking the benefit of President Mario Soares' blessing. While a "polemical and disturbing" Sottomayor Cardia may never become president, by announcing his candidacy the PS official is compelling parties and politicians to "question themselves" and prove that "individual initiative is not dead in Portugal." According to an article by Isabel Oliveira in the 25 February Lisbon weekly O INDEPENDENTE, friends of former President Ramalho Eanes "have convinced him that he meets all the conditions to be a presidential candidate again." The former president even received the conditional support of PSD [Social Democratic Party] luminary Alberto Joao Jardim, Madeira regional president, and Center Social Democratic (CDS) party official Nuno Abecasis, a former mayor of Lisbon, Oliveira notes. Additionally, "awareness-raising dinners" are held around the country to bring together Ramalho Eanes's old partisans and define strategies. Oliveira also affirms that the former president has met alone with Cavaco Silva. While she cites sources close to the prime minister as saying that the subject of presidential elections was not raised during the meeting, Oliveira comments that Cavaco Silva, now certain that Ramalho Eanes will run, was especially pleased when his interlocutor "confided" to him that his first step will be a strong attack against Mario Soares, a strategy Cavaco Silva indeed "appreciates," she concludes. Writing in the 1 March Lisbon weekly O DIABO, Nuno Rogeiro reviews the possible presidential candidacy of Lisbon mayor and PS luminary Jorge Sampaio. The mayor is the first to "cross the Rubicon" of the presidential elections by "tactfully" implying in an interview in the Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO that "if [Prime Minister] Cavaco Silva is a man, let him face me for Belem [presidential palace]." According to Nuno Rogeiro, it must be acknowledged that Sampaio is presently the sole candidate "able to attract [votes] and indeed to increase [them]." Sampaio can attract because he possesses "impeccable" antifascist references, because he was "never tempted to give in to `Cavacoism,'" and because he is an efficient counterweight to a renewed majority of the PSD. Similarly, Sampaio can increase votes because he can point to his accomplishments in Lisbon, "possesses the puritan stance appreciated by Portuguese conservatism," and can discuss "practical and palpable" subjects, Nuno Rogeiro continues. However, Sampaio can only prove a winning candidate if, on the left, there are no other strong and divisive candidacies such as Eanes's, and if there is a "logic of bipolarization" with the right through a possible Cavaco Silva candidacy. However, bipolarization can fail if the prime minister consolidates his power in the legislative elections, a victory that may obviate his "presidential appetite," Nuno Rogeiro concludes. The results of a presidential preference countrywide computer-assisted telephone interview poll conducted by Euroteste-VISAO on 23-25 February among 1,427 individuals appeared in the 3 March Lisbon weekly VISAO. Respondents were asked to name their choice for president. Prime Minister Cavaco Silva headed the list with 29.7 percent of the vote, followed by Ramalho Eanes with 17 percent, Jorge Sampaio with 15.7 percent, Porto Mayor Fernando Gomes with 7.5 percent, and former Prime Minister Francisco Pinto Balsemao with 3 percent. Coimbra University Rector Rui Alarcao and PSD luminary Eurico de Melo received 1.5 percent and 1.2 percent respectively. Some 6.2 percent chose none of the candidates, 1.5 percent would not vote, 12.7 percent did not know, and 4 percent did not answer. Despite Cavaco Silva's success, however, the Portuguese would prefer him to remain prime minister. In fact, 51.6 percent of the respondents would not want him to be a candidate for the presidency whether he wins or loses the legislative elections, while only 15.2 percent would like him to run. The importance of the 1995 presidential elections is rather small, and is derived from the legislative elections, themselves of an "alarming simplicity," writes Jose Pacheco Pereira in the 5 March Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO. The PSD either wins an absolute majority and Cavaco Silva remains as prime minister, or it loses the majority and a melee ensues. The issue of the candidates is equally simple, he adds. If the PSD holds an absolute majority, it can govern with any president, it being "irrelevant" if the Left captures the presidency. All leftist parties would then be "convulsed," mainly the PS, "where heads would roll," Pacheco Pereira argues. On the PSD side, the party has no interest in choosing a candidate "who would create more problems for the PSD than he could solve," as Ramalho Eanes would. In fact, the former president would cause deep internal divisions in the PSD even with the "direct or disguised" support of Cavaco Silva, a support that Pacheco Pereira, however, thinks is highly unlikely. In contrast, were the PSD to lose its absolute majority and become the opposition, the presidential issue would be so different that long-term predictions are of little help at this time, he observes.
