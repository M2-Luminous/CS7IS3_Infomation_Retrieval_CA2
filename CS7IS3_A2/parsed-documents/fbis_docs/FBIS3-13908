[passage omitted] The House then discussed several issues that were not on the agenda, in particular a proposal presented by 20 deputies regarding acts by the U.S. Navy that include obstructing al-'Aqabah-bound ships and conducting unjustified inspections of these ships. Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali commented on this by saying: [Begin al-Majali recording] I met with the U.S. ambassador before I came here this morning. I reiterated to him all that was in your speech [not further identified] in a very clear way. A few weeks ago, we sent a legal memorandum to the Security Council to prove this is wrong and illegal. The government is following up on this issue. The assistant U.S. secretary of state will come [to Jordan] this evening and this issue will clearly be on the agenda. During his visit to the United States, his majesty the king raised this issue with President Clinton, the secretary of defense, and others. In my capacity as the prime minister, I went to the committee [not further identified] itself and addressed it on this issue with all the strength and courage we have. I hope the esteemed House will know that since the beginning of this issue the Government of Jordan has taken the initiative to deal with it, and even this morning we discussed this issue. Thank you.
