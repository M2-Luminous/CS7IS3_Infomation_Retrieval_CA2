As a Russian officer reported to Interfax, the rear of the 12th outpost of Moscow's Border Unit came under fire from mortars, recoilless guns, and rocket installations. A Russian border outpost on Turg mountain and Parvar and Arvar villages were also attacked. The servicemen suffered no casualties. Counter strikes were delivered on the militants' positions. The officer also reported an attempt by a gang of militants to break through a border section guarded by the 3rd outpost of the Pyanj Border Unit. After a clash with guards, the gang retreated back into Afghanistan. Stepped-up militant activity is linked to better weather conditions on the Tajik-Afghan border.
