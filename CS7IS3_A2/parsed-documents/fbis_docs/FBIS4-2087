The remarks were made by Peter Tapsell, speaker of the New Zealand [NZ] Parliament, in an exclusive interview with XINHUA before leaving here for Xian today. During his three-day stay in Beijing, the speaker met with Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, and Vice-President Rong Yiren. His delegation also held talks with Chinese officials. "Any appreciation of the future development in the Pacific, either politically, economically and in terms of security, China would be an important force," Tapsell said. New Zealand hopes that China maintains its responsible role in the region, which would benefit New Zealand, he added. There would be "excellent opportunities" for trade and economic cooperation between New Zealand and China, he said. China has been and will continue to be a huge market for NZ's exports, mainly wool and timber. China is NZ's biggest wool buyer, importing more than one quarter of its wool exports. For New Zealand, Tapsell said it would import more Chinese machinery, tools, clothing and other light industrial products. New Zealand is shifting its trade focus from the traditional European market toward Asia, China in particular, Tapsell said. China has been one of NZ's top ten trading partners. Although New Zealanders are mainly decendants of European immigrants, the younger generations no long have strong ties with Europe, rather, they are closer to Asia. Objectively speaking, the establishment of the European Common Market has shut New Zealand out, he noted. To enable China to trade with the rest of the world on an equal base, New Zealand supports China to resume its status in the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. Moreover, NZ and China share views on many international issues. China has also well preserved its culture including the ancient historical sites and sites featuring many minority ethnics. Tapsell is a Maori, NZ's indigenous people. He is also NZ's first speaker from the Maori and the first speaker from the opposition party. The visit so far has been quite a success, he said, adding that he hopes to know more about China in his visit to Xian and Shanghai.
