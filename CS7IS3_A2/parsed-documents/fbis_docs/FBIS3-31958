The incidents reached peak intensity in Quito. Since early in the morning, the areas surrounding public schools and universities turned into the sites of bitter clashes between demonstrators and the police who tried to keep the riots from spreading to the city's downtown area. The situation was also tense in other Ecuadoran cities in spite of the government's announcement that it "will not permit any break of the peace." The United Workers Front, the Federation of Secondary School Students, and the National Union of Teachers called for "mass protests" against the announced economic adjustment. Reportedly, the adjustment will be limited to severe fuel price increases of up to 70 percent. The liberal government of President Sixto Duran-Ballen has described the measure as "absolutely inevitable" because of the collapse of the international price of oil, which is the country's main source of income. The price drop is keeping the country from receiving $1 million daily. In November, the government proposed increasing taxes to compensate for the budget deficit but the plan was rejected by Congress, which is controlled by the opposition. The fuel price increase reportedly will include the imposition of a new domestic marketing structure for oil by-products, with the private sector competing with the state enterprise -- currently a monopoly -- in the framework of prices freely set by the supply and demand mechanism. All the parties, of both the right and the left, have spoken out against the planned adjustment and are prepared to stop them in Congress. Meanwhile, the United Workers Front announced its decision to call for a "combative and indefinite" general strike.
