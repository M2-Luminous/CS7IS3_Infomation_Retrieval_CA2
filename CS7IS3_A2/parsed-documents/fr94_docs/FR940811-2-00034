ACTION: Notice of proposed settlement agreement; request for public comment. SUMMARY: In accordance with Section 113(g) of the Clean Air Act (``Act''), notice is hereby given of a proposed settlement agreement concerning litigation instituted against the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') by Delaware Valley Citizen's Council for Clean Air, Natural Resources Defense Council, New Jersey Public Interest Research Group and Pennsylvania Public Interest Group (collectively ``Citizen's Council'') regarding a finding dated February 28, 1994, by EPA under section 110(k) of the Clean Air Act that the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (``PADER'') has submitted a complete State Implementation Plan (``SIP'') governing the application of reasonably available control technology (``RACT'') for major stationary sources of nitrogen oxides (``NO X ''). The proposed settlement agreement provides, based on a separate settlement agreement entered into by PADER and the Citizen's Council regarding specified dates by which PADER will develop and finalize requirements for NO X RACT for certain sources in Pennsylvania that are subject to PADER's RACT regulations, that EPA will file, along with Citizen's Council, a joint motion to stay all proceedings in the Petition for Review filed by the Citizen's Council in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The proposed settlement agreement also provides that, in the event PADER violates the terms of its agreement with the Citizen's Council, the Citizen's Council will be entitled to file a motion to lift the stay of the Petition for Review, as well as to require that EPA undertake and complete a reconsideration of its February 28, 1994 completeness finding. For a period of thirty (30) days following the date of publication of this notice, the Agency will receive written comments relating to the settlement. EPA or the Department of Justice may withhold or withdraw consent to the proposed settlement agreement if the comments disclose facts or circumstances that indicate that such consent is inappropriate, improper, inadequate, or inconsistent with the requirements of the Act. Copies of the settlement agreement are available from Phyllis Cochran, Air and Radiation Division (2344), Office of General Counsel, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 260&hyph;7606.
