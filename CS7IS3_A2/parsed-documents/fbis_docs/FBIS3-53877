Jibril, who was speaking to AFP, continued: The objective that Washington sought to achieve through the Geneva summit was to neutralize the Syrian position so it could impose the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. However, the strength and firmness of the President al-Asad's position has foiled this objective. President al-Asad stood in defense of the Arab nation's causes and refuted all allegations. In Geneva, President al-Asad was as we have always known him -- an Arab knight faithful to the Arab nation's rights.
