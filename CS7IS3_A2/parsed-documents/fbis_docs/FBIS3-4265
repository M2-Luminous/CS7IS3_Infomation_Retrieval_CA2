In explaining why such efforts were necessary, Peng Yu, vice-director of the National Family Planning Committee, said by the end of last year China's population was more than 1.18 billion. The number of women at reproductive age was more than 324 million or 27 percent of the population. But China's arable land was only 7 percent of the world's total, it had to support 22 percent of the world's people, Peng said. China's population had to live within the country, she went on. Unlike the situation which had prevailed in Europe during its industrial revolution, China could not ease its population pressure by diverting large populations to other continents. Rapid population growth had led to sharp reductions of arable land and over-exploitation of resources and aggravated environmental pollution, she continued. As its basic national policy since the late 1970s China adopted family planning to control population quantity and improve its quality in terms of health and education. The aim was to accelerate socio-economic development. Peng summarized the main points of China's current family planning policy: to promote late marriage and later, fewer births; to advocate the practice of "one couple, one child," to persuade rural couples who wished for second children to have proper spacing; and to let the governments of autonomous regions or provinces inhabited by national minorities decide their family planning needs according to local conditions.
