Ya. Kondratyev; UDC 528.7:629.78:551.5] [Abstract] Conceptual aspects of the Global Climate Observing System, approved by the Eleventh Congress of the World Meteorological Organization, are analyzed. Opinions are expressed on the need for better substantiation of priorities in reserach on global climate change. The author quarrels with the subjects assigned to the working groups, as they do not reflect top prioirty problems and questions which should be addressed. The author believes that conventional and space observation facilities have not been combined in a way that achieves optimum effectiveness. It is pointed out that the list of existing satellite systems for environmental research is incomplete. Top priority studies of the atmosphere are described. Existing facilities and programs to study the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and land surface are discussed. The author charges that there has been insufficient consideration of the types of data and data series needed to study global climate change. Areas where more studies are needed, i.e., the global radiation balance, vegetation cover dynamics, interaction of atmosphere and ocean, etc., are described. References 32: 15 Russian, 17 Western.
