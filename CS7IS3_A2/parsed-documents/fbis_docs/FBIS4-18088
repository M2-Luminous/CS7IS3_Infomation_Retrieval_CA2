[Fiore] The children, in both cases, because it was nice to meet them and very nasty to have to leave them, regretting a good job that we were unable to finish. (And Fiore embraces Muraja, a Somali child who has been turned over to a Bergamo couple.) [Simone] I see some Somalis leaving the plane. How many are there? [Fiore] Nineteen collaborators, to protect them from possible retaliation. They are mostly Abgal. Included, too, is Mrs. Murta, Ali Mahdi's wife, who will be in Italy for 10 days. [Simone] Are you still convinced, after having seen the pictures of [RAI journalists] Ilaria Alpi and Miran Hrovatin, that our colleagues were killed by Muslim fundamentalists? [Fiore] Yes, but not because of what the pictures showed. We had known for some days that they were planning to kill a Westerner and we warned all journalists, because they are the weak link in our presence in Somalia. However, our troops have a reputation of impenetrability. [Simone] Are there any of our troops left in Somalia? [Fiore] There are still 16 guards at the Embassy, which is now located in the UN Command Building. [Simone] Why did we give up the old embassy building with its mascot tortoises? [Fiore] Because to defend it would have required 200 people and 5 billion lire a month. The Scire department was transferred to Merca Hospital. [Simone] Are the policemen whom we trained and armed and who were left at the old embassy still efficient? [Fiore] ... (silence) [Simone] How many Italian soldiers passed through Somalia in those 15 months? [Fiore] Including my battalion, 5,000, including the Lightning Battalion 8,000. [Simone] Italy lost 12 men, soldiers of peace, charity, and information. How many losses did we inflict upon the Somalis as of 6 February 1993, when paratroopers and marines shot two bandits? [Fiore] About 100, during my stay. Those were street bandits. As regards the Lightning and San Marco Battalions, I do not know. [Simone] According to Aidid, the Lightning Battalion has killed 56 of his men alone. So, can we speak of several hundred? [Fiore] I think so. [Simone] Is it true that Balad, where our command and logistical center was located, is a den of bandits? [Fiore] At least 40 of the bandits that we killed, not only in Balad, but also in Giohar and Itala, which is far away, were from there. [Simone] And did we install our command and logistical center especially there, because there were bandits? [Fiore] No, it was to use the barracks and because the Uebi checkpoint controls the road going north to Moga. [Simone] When will the other Italian troops arrive? [Fiore] The command paratroopers, including my deputy commander, Colonel Cantoni, will arrive tonight in Pisa with the C-130 that with us departed from Mombasa. Four hundred more Army infantrymen, 120 marines of the San Marco Battalion, and 20 marine raiders will arrive by ship before 6 April. The Navy has done an excellent job. I am very proud of them because for the very first time the Navy has been put under the command of an Army general. On board the Garibaldi they handed me an embossed plate as a present, inscribed: "To the General-Admiral." [Simone] Goodbye Somalia, or see you later Somalia? [Fiore] Goodbye for us, see you later for Italy: Somalia is a country that definitely needs help.
