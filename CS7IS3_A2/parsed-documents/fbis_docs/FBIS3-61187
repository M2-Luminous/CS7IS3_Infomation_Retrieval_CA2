After Nalchik Everything Is Back to the Way It Was"] [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has kept his promise: An edict was published concerning organizing the return of Ingush refugees to four villages of Prigorodnyy Rayon of North Ossetia. But observers are noting with alarm that this has not brought the long-awaited peace to the Northern Caucasus. As we know, the edict was adopted while developing the agreements reached on 7 September in Nalchik when a declaration was signed which envisions Ingushetia's abandoning its territorial claims to North Ossetia, removing the thesis about the impossibility of Ossetians and Ingush living together, disbanding illegal armed formations, returning refugees to densely populated places, and "sealing off" the border between Russia and Chechnya. But as early as the next day the parliament of North Ossetia, under pressure from a rally of many thousands in the central square of Vladikavkaz, adopted a decree that actually disavows the results of the meeting in Nalchik. Justifying himself to the deputies, the head of the Supreme Soviet of North Ossetia, Akhsarbek Galazov, admitted that he had agreed to a partial return of the Ingush refugees under pressure from Boris Yeltsin. He himself, as before, considers this measure to be an illegal act that creates an impasse situation. In turn, the president of Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev, never tires of saying that he signed no documents in Nalchik, that the land from which the Ingush--citizens of North Ossetia--were deported has been Ingush territory for centuries, and that their return to Ingushetia is just a matter of time. One statement after the other, the discussion among the leaders of the two republics has returned to its former tracks, assuming its previous tonality. For example, a couple of days ago Ruslan Aushev again accused the Ossetians of murdering the head of the temporary administration of the emergency region, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Viktor Polyanichko. According to information from the president of Ingushetia, on 1 August Viktor Polyanichko went to the village of Tarskoye for negotiations with the commander of the Ossetian home guard, Bibo Dzutsev, in order to discuss with him the details of returning to the Russians the weapons of the Russian special forces that were seized by the Ingush in the Dzheyrakhskoye Ravine. Polyanichko was to have reached an agreement with Dzutsev not to intervene in the transfer of the weapons. This partially explains why Polyanichko did not have the proper guard--Bibo Dzutsev is in practically complete control of the actions of the fighting men in the region and enjoys respect in North Ossetia. Dzutsev, incidentally, turned up at the scene of the tragedy 10 minutes after the murder of Polyanichko and Koretskiy. Aushev thinks that the terrorists were urged on by the fact that on 2 August Polyanichko was to have been working on determining four population points of Prigorodnyy Rayon to which the Ingush would be returned. According to a different version, Viktor Polyanichko was going to negotiations with the Ingush field commanders who had seized the weapons from the Russian special forces. A day before this Ruslan Aushev had told Polyanichko that the weapons would be returned but it would be necessary to pay 40 million rubles for them. Aushev asserts that he was prepared to forward this money himself and Polyanichko would then return this sum after the weapons had been turned over. On the morning of the murder Aushev again spoke with General Anatoliy Koretskiy and again offered his services for immediately buying the weapons. But the temporary administration thought that the price of the purchase could be considerably reduced and therefore Polyanichko went to the village of Tarskoye to negotiate the price of the purchase with the Ingush field commanders and the head of the Dzheyrakhskiy rural soviet, Tsurov. In addition to this one there are several other versions of the murder of Viktor Polyanichko and General Anatoliy Koretskiy. The Russian investigatory group, in spite of the optimistic statements of certain of its members and the sworn promises of Sergey Shakhray, has still made no progress in investigating the terrorist act against the deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation. The situation in South Ossetia has also unexpectedly become much worse. Not far from Tskhinval a Niva truck was blown up by a mine and another light vehicle following it was fired upon with an automatic weapon. In the vehicle were Georgian peasants from villages of the Tamarashenskiy corridor: Two were killed on the spot and four more, according to Georgian information, are missing. The next day this report was confirmed by the press center of the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs, which also announced that in Gori there was a meeting of representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia and the Ministry of Defense of South Ossetia at which they discussed the extremely dangerous aggravation of the situation in the region. Observers think that the attack on the Georgian vehicles near Tskhinval was organized in response to the murder of the four Ossetians several days earlier. Recently in a number of Georgian villages of South Ossetia, especially Tamarashen, Kekhvi, Achabeti, Nikozi, Ergneti, and Eredvi, there has been tension, and active military preparations have been underway. The Ossetians are expressing concern not only about the mobilization activity of Georgia but also the inaction of the peacekeeping forces and military command. The Ossetians have been forced to "fill out" their own defense in spite of the fact that recently, as a result of internal feuds and disagreements, the political situation in South Ossetia has been considerably weakened.
