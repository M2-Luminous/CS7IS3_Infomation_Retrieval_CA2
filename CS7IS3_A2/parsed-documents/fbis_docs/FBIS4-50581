The growth rate still seemed to be too high but, because of the low proportion of agriculture and the high proportion of industry in the first quarter, the figure could be turned into an annual growth rate of 9 to 10 percent. That is to say, the economic operation moved into the target scope of macrocontrol. The comprehensive assessment of the economic operation by the State Statistical Bureau was changed from somewhere between the "red light" and the "yellow light" to the current condition between the "yellow light" and "green light." As far as the internal economic structure was concerned, the growth rates of production, construction, and sales, which were too fast, declined somewhat and the economy as a whole maintained an appropriate growth rate. From the somewhat overheated condition of the economy in the first half of last year to the basically normal condition in the first quarter of this year, an arduous and great change was effected. An authoritative economist stated at a recent symposium with deep feelings that, if the central authorities did not make a timely decision on macroeconomic regulation and control, it is certain that major problems will occur in our economy and we might not be able to sit here quietly to discuss things. A few months ago, people in some localities and departments still held various different opinions on macrocontrol but people now see things clearly and have agreed that macrocontrol is necessary. In general, however, we still cannot say that a decisive success has been scored in macrocontrol; what we can say is that results in the initial stage of macrocontrol have been achieved. This is because, at present, our economy is still facing prominent difficulties and problems and the task of carrying out further macrocontrol remains rather arduous. According the main economic indicators in the first quarter, the current macrocontrol is at a key stage: The economic growth rate has basically fallen to the target scope of macrocontrol and the value of the economic boom is also at an appropriate level, so no major fluctuations should be caused; on the other hand, the price increase rate at the present stage is still far from the macrocontrol target, so price control should still be intensified. Therefore, macrocontrol should still curb price increases while preventing major fluctuations of the economic growth rates. However, the complexity of the issue lies in the fact that price increases and economic growth are two interrelated indicators. In the 15 years of reform and opening, high economic growth rates have always gone with high inflation. We can also say that, to a certain degree, we are in a dilemma trying to curb the price increases at the same time as mitigating the difficulties in enterprise operation. If our measures for curbing price increase are too serious, economic growth can be upset and the state-owned enterprises which are operating in difficult conditions may encounter even greater difficulties; if we relax control over such major factors of economic growth as investments and loans, prices may continue to increase. As there is a synchronistic relationship between economic growth and price increases, then our macrocontrol guideline should, in general, seek the most favorable conjunction of the economic growth rate and the price increase rate. That is, to keep the economic growth rate between 9 and 10 percent and to keep the price increase rate below 10 percent. In the course of pursuing this guideline, we should try to restrain the disadvantageous and boost the advantageous by curbing the rate of price increases and striving for the highest possible rate of economic growth. We may first see the possibility of curbing the excessive price increases. At present, price increases are mainly caused by the following factors: First, owing to the fast economic growth, investment-led demand becomes strong and this drives up the prices of producer goods and then affects the prices of consumer goods; second, in the price reform, the changes in the price-forming mechanisms inevitably cause a certain degree of price increases; third, in the tax reform, enterprises may shift part of their additional tax burdens onto others by raising the prices of their products, and some even take advantage of this opportunity to reap additional profits by turning some in-price taxes [jia nei shui 0116 0355 4451] into out-of-price taxes [jia wai shui 0116 1120 4451]; fourth, since price decontrol, the new price management mechanisms have not been established and some merchants irregularly raise prices when people generally expect price increases; and fifth, the unification of the exchange rate system has also caused certain price increases. As long as we take the right measures to offset the effects of these factors, we will be able to bring the upward tendency in prices completely under control. First, it is necessary to control the general valve. This year, the size of investment in fixed assets is not very large and some new projects will soon be started because the size of the ongoing construction projects is already too large. Therefore, there will be great pressure for the expansion of investment. So, it is necessary to strictly control new project starts, to control the overall amount of investment, and to prevent the further widening of the gap in the working funds. This is the key to whether or not this year's macroeconomic adjustment and control will score further successes. Second, grasp the opportune moment for the adoption of the price reform measures, and prevent the excessive intensiveness of such measures which can cause substantial price fluctuations. Third, strive to mitigate the impact of the tax reform on prices. It is necessary to properly explain the new tax systems to the enterprises, help them understand the details and the new calculation methods in order to prevent misunderstandings and operation errors which can push prices upward. At the same time, we must adopt corresponding measures to stabilize prices when the new tax system is adopted and help the enterprises offset the impact of the additional tax burdens. Fourth, adopt rigorous legal and administrative means to resolutely ban the practice of irregularly raising prices in order to seek illicit profits and to punish shops and merchants involved in such activities. This is a pressing current task. Some merchants wantonly charge exorbitant prices without following any rules when fixing prices and their behavior cause the general public to panic. If such disorder is not removed in good time, it can seriously affect the market stability. At present, people in the economic circles generally hope that the State Council will adopt the "Antiprofiterring Law" and the "Price Law" and rigorously supervise their enforcement. We can also see another key point in the macroeconomic policies, that is, how to maintain appropriate high-speed economic growth while curbing price increases. This cannot be controlled as easily as the price issue, nor is it easy to work out an effective and pertinent remedy. Generally speaking, it is necessary to keep the basic balance between gross supply and gross demand and to prevent the excessive intensiveness of the measures for controlling demand. The investment in fixed assets should be restrained and should also be preserved. On the basis of optimizing the investment structure and raising the investment efficiency, we should ensure an appropriate increase in investment and should also guarantee the key construction projects and meet the needs of the basic industries and the infrastructural projects. When providing working funds for enterprises bogged down in a predicament, we should pay attention to the orientation of the fund flow. It is inadvisable to taking only stopgap measures without thoroughly solving problems. A set of comprehensive measures should be worked out as soon as possible in order to solve the problem whereby state-owned enterprises are short of dynamism in their operation. Consideration should be given to this issue when the comprehensive plan for establishing a modern enterprise system is being formulated this year.
