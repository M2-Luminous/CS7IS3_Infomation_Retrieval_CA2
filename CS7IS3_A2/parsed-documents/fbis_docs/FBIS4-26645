The meeting stressed the necessity to expand the dynamics of punishment and to concentrate energy on investigating and handling a number of major and appalling cases. Since the second plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission held last year, Beijing Municipality has expanded the dynamics of investigating and handling major and appalling cases, forcefully attacked unlawful and undisciplined activities, and made appropriate achievements. Thus, the people have strengthened the confidence in opposing corruption. In 1993, the discipline inspection and supervisory organs across the municipality investigated and handled 1,044 undisciplined cases of various categories and handled 593 party members. Of this, 518 or 49.6 percent were cases involving violation of economic discipline. Of the cases investigated and handled, 183 or 17.5 percent were major and appalling cases. In the first five months of this year, the discipline inspection and supervisory organs across the municipality investigated and handled 659 undisciplined cases of various categories, an increase of 48.1 percent over the same period of last year when 445 cases were investigated and handled. Of this, 61 were major and appalling cases. Li Yongan, standing committee member of the municipal party committee and secretary of the municipal discipline inspection commission, made a speech at the meeting. He said: The discipline inspection and supervisory organs at various levels across the municipality should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the national telephone conference of discipline inspection and supervisory departments held on 9 June, as well as the guidelines of the "circular on paying attention to investigating and handling major and appalling economic cases in the course of waging the struggle against corruption as issued by the offices of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council," and should expand the dynamics of investigating and handling major and appalling cases. In the next few months, the discipline inspection and supervisory organs across the municipality should concentrate time and energy on investigating and concluding a number of major and appalling cases; pay particular attention to conscientiously investigating and handling a number of major and appalling cases of engaging in corruption, giving and accepting bribes, getting money by fraud, indulging in smuggling, and seriously violating financial and economic discipline; and make noticeable achievements. We should continuously focus our efforts on investigating party and government leading organs, judicial departments, administrative and law enforcement departments, and economic management departments; and emphatically investigate and handle the major economic criminal cases relating to the leading cadres at or above the county (section) level. We should openly handle and expose the cases with influential power in order to build up momentum and produce an impact. He stressed: The leaders at various levels, particularly party and government top leaders, should further upgrade understanding, pay high attention to investigating and handling major and appalling cases, and support discipline inspection and supervisory departments to strictly and rapidly investigate and handle a number of cases of violating economic laws and economic discipline. We should ensure the supply of funds for handling cases for the discipline inspection and supervisory departments and provide necessary material conditions for investigating and handling major and appalling cases. Leaders of the discipline inspection and supervisory organs at various levels should personally go to the forefront to handle cases. It is necessary to strictly carry out the system of responsibility for handling cases among each level. We should further strengthen the coordination and cooperation of law and discipline enforcement departments and the departments for supervision over the enforcement of administrative laws, and have them closely cooperate with one another, and form cohesive power. Discipline inspection and supervisory departments should resolutely withstand the obstacles created by the practice of interceding for somebody. We should grasp the typical cases of refusing to report and handle cases, creating obstacles for handling cases, offering false evidence, and refusing to offer evidence; and openly and strictly investigate and affix the responsibility for these cases.
