With a view to the turmoil of war in the former Yugoslavia, Gligorov says that a Balkanization of other European regions is imminent if the "Balkans are not Europeanized." The two presidents were invited to the Rhine by the "European Dialogue Bonn," an association of leading politicians and journalists, to discuss the topic "The Road to Europe -- Too Many Conflicts?". In separate talks they explained later to FRG President Richard von Weizsaecker what they had elaborated on with Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth as the discussion leader. Their basic substance was: "The present picture of the Balkans is tragic and grotesque. It is also a consequence of insufficient preparations and the inability to permit, under crossfire from different interests, the victory of the finding that in the closely intertwined relations of the modern world there is no longer room for local wars and that the aggressor's first step is checked." This formulation was used by Slovene President Kucan. Like him, Macedonian Gligorov also made it quite clear that the Serbs are responsible for the war. Both explicitly rejected a new division into spheres of interest as it might become possible by Russia's increasing activities in ex-Yugoslavia. Gligorov appealed all the more urgently to his Greek neighbors to put, for their part, an end to the completely superfluous controversy with Macedonia, to lift the unjustified embargo, and to achieve a peaceful dialogue. "The problem of Macedonian-Greek relations is basically an irrational problem of an emotional nature. We depend on cooperation. We do not have territorial claims. We are immediately prepared to continue the negotiations on all questions without exception," the Macedonian president affirmed. Both politicians claim for their countries a place with equal rights in the future joint Europe.
