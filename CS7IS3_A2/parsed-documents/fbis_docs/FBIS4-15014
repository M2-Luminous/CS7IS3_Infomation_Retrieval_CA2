Vladimir Novikov followed suit of Vladimir Borzyuk protesting against the "populist policy" of Zhirinovskiy. However, deputy chairman of the party Aleksandr Vengerovskiy played down the event saying there is nothing dramatic about it. "There were a lot of fellow-travellers among LDPR members", he told TASS. "The LPDR was, is and will be the decisive political factor in Russia" in the coming two years and even longer, he added. "Some party members used to scare us that a coup would take place at the LDPR congress and that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy would quit the party. But this did not happen", Vengerovskiy said adding that people are "free to unite in any groups".
