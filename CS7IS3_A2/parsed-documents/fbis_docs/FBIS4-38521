Speaking on the phone with a RIA correspondent he claimed that the Ukrainian parliament traces every move taken by their Crimean counterparts. Once the Crimean Supreme Soviet has put today's plenary session on Constitution off from 9 A.M. to 2 P.M., the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet fired back and postponed its session with a similar agenda from Tuesday to Wednesday. Despite this wait-and-see policy adopted by Ukraine, says the presidential advisor, there are good reasons to hope that the working group of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet will arrive in the Crimea at long last next Thursday. Only then will it be possible to bring a definite solution to the long-running dispute. In his words, the people in the Crimea keep a watchful eye on the developments in anticipation of new moves by Kiev. The fact that deputy heads of Ukrainian power ministries are still based in the Crimea only increases psychological tension on the local population, insists Mr. Chernyatevich.
