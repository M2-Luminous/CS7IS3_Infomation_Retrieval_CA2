The report seems more like a memorandum to Athens, which recently adopted a hostile approach to Turkey and moved to place Cyprus within the Greek defense zone. It has been submitted to the pertinent departments affiliated with the prime minister's office. HURRIYET has been able to acquire the report. It says in part: "The question of to which country the Aegean islands, which do not have a military status, belong will be placed on the agenda if Greece continues to arm them." That is a very strong warning. The report outlines the following: 1. The non-military status of the Aegean islands has been established by international agreements, which are still valid. That state of affairs concerns Turkey's security. 2. However, Greece's effort to weaken the status of the islands will place the question of to which country they belong on the agenda. That is due to the fact that the status of the islands and the question of to which country they belong have been jointly established by those agreements. 3. The islands in the Aegean Sea do not have a military status. Any move to overlook that fact will automatically raise the question of which country they belong to. The report notes that Samothraki, Limnos, Khios, Samos, Ikaria, Astipalaia, Rhodes, Kalki, Lipsoi, Kos, and Kastellorizon have been turned into arms depots and that this state of affairs has recently created a very significant disadvantage for Turkey's security. It says that the islands have been armed since 1964, contrary to the Lausanne and Paris Agreements. But that activity gained momentum when the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] Government came to power in Greece. The report makes the following assessment: "Greece has stepped up its efforts to undermine the status of the Aegean islands through faits accompli. Naturally, that state of affairs will place the question of to which country they belong on the agenda." In a statement to HURRIYET on the matter, a diplomat has said: "The meaning of that is quite clear. Turkey will move to claim rights on those islands if Greece maintains its present approach."
