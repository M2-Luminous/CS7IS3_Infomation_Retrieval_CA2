FR941102-0-00088 FR941102-0-00025 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 102894A] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Apportionment of reserve. SUMMARY: NMFS is apportioning reserve to certain target species in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to allow for ongoing harvest and account for previous harvest of the total allowable catch (TAC). EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), October 28, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the U.S. BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the initial TACs specified for Pacific ocean perch in the Bering Sea subarea (BS), and for yellowfin sole and arrowtooth flounder in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area, need to be supplemented from the nonspecific reserve in order to continue operations and account for prior harvest. Therefore, in accordance with ยง675.20(b), NMFS is apportioning from the reserve to TACs for the following species: (1) For the BS-286 metric tons (mt) to Pacific ocean perch; (2) for the BSAI-22,549 mt to yellowfin sole and 1,500 mt to arrowtooth flounder. These apportionments are consistent with ยง675.20(a)(2)(i) and do not result in overfishing of a target species or the ``other species'' category, because the revised TACs are equal to or less than specifications of acceptable biological catch. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.20 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined, under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act and 50 CFR 675.20(b)(2), that good cause exists for waiving the opportunity for public comment and the 30-day delayed effectiveness period for this action. Fisheries are currently taking place that will be supplemented by this apportionment. Delaying the implementation of this action would be disruptive and costly to these ongoing operations. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801, et seq . Dated: October 28, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
