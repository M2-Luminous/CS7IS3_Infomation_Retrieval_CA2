"The inspections are going smoothly so far," said a Foreign Ministry official. "IAEA activities are expected to conclude around March 14 or 15." The IAEA inspectors who arrived in Pyongyang on March 3 have just about finished checking five of the seven declared facilities, the official said. However, the remaining two installations -- a 5- megawatt nuclear reactor and a radiochemical laboratory used for reprocessing -- are critical in determining whether North Korea diverted any nuclear material for non-peaceful uses. The vernacular daily TONG-A ILBO reported that North Korea was restricting IAEA access to these two facilities. The story came out on the same day South and North Korea were to meet at the truce village of Panmunjom to arrange an exchange of presidential envoys.
