The four countries have begun studying the idea with the Japanese Foreign Ministry playing a leading role. They are expected to hold the first working-level meeting as early as mid-1994. It is likely that the proposed conference will be in the form of an unrestricted, loose consultative organization to study issues such as quadrilateral cooperation on economic policies and what the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference ought to be like. The idea is based on a report worked out in 1992 by the Japan-Mexico Committee Toward the 21st Century--which was established by the governments and private sectors of the two countries. Concrete details of the idea will be discussed from now on. The idea has been formulated with the enforcement of the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] taken into consideration. Moreover, there are concerns about the U.S. attitude of giving priority to bilateral talks other than multilateral talks when trying to solve trade issues. The Japanese Government intends to make the quadrilateral conference a "stage for multilateral dialogue and consultations to enhance economic cooperation and study ways of dealing with trade disputes." However, the government has no intention of producing a free trade zone like NAFTA that could be discriminatory against nonmember nations. As the first summit meeting of the APEC was held in November 1993, cooperative relations within the Asia-Pacific region have strengthened. However, Japan and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have expressed concern that NAFTA will lead to a bloc economy. Although Malaysia has proposed the idea of establishing the East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC), the United States and other countries, which are excluded from the idea, have opposed it. In this way, discord still remains within APEC. Because it is certain that Japan will play a leading role if the economic conference is established, the idea is likely to arouse the interest of neighboring countries.
