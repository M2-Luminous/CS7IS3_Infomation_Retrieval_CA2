FR940830-0-00106 FR940830-0-00014 Three comments asked whether paragraph (m), the definition of ``file'' or ``filed,'' was intended to allow notices of location or certificates of location to be subject to the postmark rule. The answer is yes, and the paragraph has been further amended in the final rule to make it clear that, in addition, location notices and certificates of location also will be accepted if postmarked by the end of the 90-day filing period. In response to a comment, the paragraph now refers to the filing of a maintenance fee waiver certification statement rather than the filing of a maintenance fee waiver: the former is a more accurate term. One comment asked whether paragraph (m) was intended to allow $100 fee and waiver filings to be accepted if postmarked by August 31 and received in the proper BLM office within 15 days of that date. The answer is yes. Two comments said that new location notices should not be subject to the postmark rule pursuant to paragraph (m). All other filings are similarly subject to the postmark rule. The comments give no reason for location notices to be treated differently. One comment questioned whether BLM has the authority to extend the postmark rule to filings under the Act of August 10, 1993, since the Act specifically states that annual fee filings must be made by each August 31. The best precedent for this is the longstanding administrative practice for annual filings under Section 314(a) of FLPMA. Section 314(a) states that annual filings shall be made prior to December 31 yearly. However, the postmark rule has been applied to these filings for years by regulation as a practical way of treating such filings received through the postal system, and it has been upheld by the Interior Board of Land Appeals. The same practical consideration applies here. One comment asked whether paragraph (m) is in conflict with §1821.2&hyph;2(f), which does not recognize the postmark rule except in certain instances. Section 1821.2&hyph;2(f) applies to the filing of applications only, and paragraph (m) applies to filing notices of locations and payment of fees. No conflict exists between the two sections. One comment stated that paragraph (m) meant that if a claimant's maintenance fee filing was postmarked on August 16 or before that the claims would be forfeited. This is not true. The filing can be postmarked any time on or before August 31, as long as it is received in the proper BLM office no later than 15 days after August 31. One comment asked whether paragraph (m) was meant to allow postmarks that fall on holidays and weekends. Deadlines that fall on a day the BLM office is closed are carried over to the next working day. One comment asked whether paragraph (m) was restricted to mailings postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service. This paragraph has been amended to include other mail delivery systems that are independent of the claimant and for which the date of filing with the system can be verified. Paragraph (o)(1) is amended to state clearly that the FLPMA filing due on December 30, 1999, is the last FLPMA filing affected by the Act of August 10, 1993. Paragraph (o)(2) is removed in the final rule because it duplicates §3833.1&hyph;7(d). A comment received concerning the wording of this paragraph is therefore moot. Paragraph (o)(3) is removed because it duplicates §3833.1&hyph;5(b) as it is revised in this final rule. Thus, the concerns raised in two comments that referred to the conflicting wording of these sections have been addressed. Because of the removal of paragraphs (o) (2) and (3), paragraph (o)(1) is merged into the introductory text of paragraph (o). Paragraph (w) has been simplified to remove information provided elsewhere in the rule. Paragraphs (bb) and (cc) are amended to reference §3833.1&hyph;1, which is the final rule redesignation of §3833.1&hyph;8 of the proposed rule. One comment suggested that paragraph (cc) should provide that refunds of payments made by credit card will be made as a credit to the card account. This suggestion has been adopted in the final rule. 43 CFR 3833.1&hyph;1 Although it was not addressed in the proposed rule, the existing language of this section is removed in its entirety and replaced with §3833.1&hyph;8 of the proposed rule. The old section is being removed administratively in this final rule because it deals with obsolete requirements. Because this amendment is an administrative action to remove obsolete provisions, it has been determined that it has no impacts on the public. The Department of the Interior, therefore, for good cause finds under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and 553(d)(3) that notice and public procedure thereon are unnecessary and that this amendment may take effect upon publication.
