The agreement was signed early this morning after 18 hours of talks by, on behalf of the Croatian delegation, Hrvoje Sarinic, and, on behalf of the representatives of the Serbs, Dusan Rakic. The agreement was also signed by the representatives of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, who also chaired the negotiations -- ambassadors Geert Ahrens and Kai Eide, as well as UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander General Bertrand de Lapresle. The agreement envisages the immediate cessation of hostilities between the two sides and that the cease-fire along the front lines will begin on 4 April. Thirty-five individual maps on the separation of the warring sides were signed, and it was also agreed that by 8 April at the latest they would withdraw one km from the front lines. UNPROFOR units will then be deployed between the warring sides. Hrvoje Sarinic assessed the talks as very successful and stressed that the agreement is not an end in itself but only the first step toward the normalization of relations throughout the territory of Croatia, which will follow the resolution of economic problems and also a final political solution.
