Only the prime minister's resignation would pave the way for early elections on the basis of the Constitution and the law, Yordanov said in a statement broadcast on national radio and television tonight. In two days only the prime minister had two proofs that he does not enjoy parliament's political confidence, Aleksandur Yordanov said. He referred to the sitting last Thursday [19 May] when the cabinet narrowly survived a no-confidence vote, supported by a mere 25 MP's, as well as to last Friday [20 May] when the MP's voted down Berov's proposals for structural and personnel changes to the cabinet. What is needed for early elections is not agreements but an early end to the government's term; any other option is part of the pre- Constitution stage and is of no legal import, Yordanov said. He recalled that under the Bulgarian Constitution only after the prime minister's resignation can the president show constitutional initiative and assign the parliamentary groups to form a government; should they fail to do so, the president appoints a caretaker cabinet. Yordanov described any other initiative as an "infringement on the authority of others" which, in his view, destabilizes political life and the country as a whole. On Friday President Zhelyu Zhelev appealed to the political forces to reach agreement, including the passage of a few key acts of parliament, a date for the elections, and the appointment of a caretaker cabinet by the president later on. Prime Minister Berov proposed more or less the same to the parliamentary forces two days later. "In the name of parliamentarism and democracy, I appeal to the prime minister and the president to refrain from such initiatives," Yordanov said.
