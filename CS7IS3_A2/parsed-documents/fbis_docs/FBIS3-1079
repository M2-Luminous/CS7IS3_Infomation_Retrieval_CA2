Hercules C-130s flying from the Republic of Zaire and South Africa have been landing regularly in Andulo, carrying war materiel and fuel for UNITA rebel forces. This was revealed by citizen Domingos Lucas, who abandoned the Black Cockerel ranks on 11 March, turning himself over to government authorities in Kunje Commune. He said his decision was prompted by ill-treatment in the bush. Speaking at a news conference, Lucas said once unloaded, the war materiel and fuel are taken to Caluapanda and to Huambo Province. He said a light aircraft is permanently based in Andulo to carry Jonas Savimbi. Lucas said UNITA is transferring civilians and troops from Jamba to Andulo, presumably to shift its central base to Bie Province.
