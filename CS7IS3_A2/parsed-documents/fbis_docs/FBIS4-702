The process broke down before it began on Wednesday morning when IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi rejected the terms of reference. ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa said after the Pretoria talks the IFP still wanted to engage the ANC in negotiations on a new date for elections. He said a change of date was impossible and it was not on the table for mediation. "That date is sacrosanct and is not the subject of mediation," Mr Ramaphosa said. He left the talks for a meeting in Johannesburg with mediators Dr Henry Kissinger and Lord Peter Carrington. Mr Ramaphosa said the negotiators had agreed in principle on dividing the mediation process into two phases. The first would be a pre-mediation agreement and the second an agreement on the implementation of the results of mediation. Minister of Home Affairs Danie Schutte said government did not favour changing the election date. "The very last thing we would want to extend is the election date," Mr Schutte said. He said the proposal put together by the negotiators appeared to be acceptable to all the parties
