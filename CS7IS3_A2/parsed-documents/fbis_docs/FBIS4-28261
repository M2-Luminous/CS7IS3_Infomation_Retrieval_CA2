With the long-overdue fiscal 1994 national budget passed through the decisive House of Representatives on Wednesday, the focus of attention has shifted to whether the Hata administration can survive after the budget legislation becomes law. The once-dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has already given public notice that it intends to file a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet once the budget is enacted, in a move to wrest back power after nearly a year in the opposition bleachers. "The continued existence of this cabinet is not beneficial to Japan," LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori asserted Tuesday. "It would result in a deepening of the current political chaos." As the governing coalition lacks a majority in the 511-seat lower house, it is within the LDP's power to topple the present government in a no-confidence vote -- unless the second-largest opposition party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan], moves to obstruct the effort. The SDP, the largest force in the previous administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, walked out of the coalition in April, leaving Hata with Japan's first minority government in 39 years and fanning speculation that his cabinet would collapse as soon as the budget was adopted. Even so, it is unclear whether the SDP will automatically join forces with the LDP to bring down the six-week-old government. If a no-confidence motion is indeed rammed through the Diet, Hata will be torn between two harsh choices -- resigning or dissolving the lower house for a snap general poll. A mass resignation of the cabinet would open the way for the LDP's return to power, an idea the SDP can hardly feel comfortable with. As the main opposition party during the LDP's 38-year unbroken rule that ended last August, the SDP well knows that while it can work with the LDP to force Hata from office, it cannot cooperate in governing due to wide policy differences. On the other hand, if the premier were to call a general election on his own initiative, a feud would be triggered within the SDP over any concerted action with the LDP to overturn the Hata administration. Dozens of SDP lawmakers say that an election under the current multiseat system would be tantamount to the demise of political reform, as the Diet has already legislated a set of electoral reform bills introducing a mixture of single-seat voting districts and proportional representation for lower house polls. Masao Sakon, a reform-minded SDP rank-and-filer, warned that he and others within the SDP may have to quit the party if the leadership moves to cooperate with the LDP in defeating the Hata government through a no-confidence vote. "If such a situation arises, we may have to make a certain decision," he said. Nor is the LDP monolithic. As the nation's years of efforts to achieve anticorruption political reform will not be capped without the enactment of a yet-to-be-formulated bill drawing a new electoral map, pro-reformers within the LDP have also been against a general election under the moribund old system. "I think a no-confidence motion will ultimately not be submitted," a senior coalition official said on condition of anonymity. Hata, a veteran politician and staunch advocate of political reform, for his part has underscored the need to contest the next lower house election under a revamped system that goes into force only after the redistricting bill is acted upon. The chief executive has so far shown no interest in SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo's proposal for quitting on a voluntary basis after passage of the budget and before a no-confidence vote so as to fashion a new coalition government, possibly with the participation of the SDP. "If the voluntary resignation proposal was offered with an eye to returning to the coalition, the motive was impure," said Yoshiaki Iisaka, professor of political science at Tokyo's Gakushuin University. It is almost impossible to make a fresh start even if the SDP returns to the coalition, because the party once opted to leave the ruling alliance, Iisaka predicted. In any case, it is certain that between now and the June 29 close of the current ordinary Diet session, Hata's fragile administration will face intensifying attacks from the opposition forces. "This Diet session will wind up without an extension and the current state of political flux will likely drag on until September," said another senior coalition official who requested he not be identified.
