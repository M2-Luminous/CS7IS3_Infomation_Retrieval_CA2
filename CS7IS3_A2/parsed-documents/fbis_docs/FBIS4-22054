FBIS4-22054 "jptot016__l94011" JPRS-TOT-94-016-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 8 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA MEXICO New Group Claims Responsibility for Colosio Assassination New Group Claims Responsibility for Colosio Assassination PA0904144394 Mexico City LA REFORMA in Spanish 8 Apr 94 p 5A PA0904144394 Mexico City LA REFORMA Spanish BFN [Text] Via a communique, the Mexican Front Against Governmental Corruption [Frente Mexicano Contra la Corrupcion Gubernamental -- FMCCG] yesterday claimed resposibility for the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio during his visit to the Lomas Taurinas neighborhood in Tijuana. Sources within the Mexican Government report that a document, which was sent to the editorial staffs of PRENSA HISPANA and Radio Campesina, both headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, indicates that the front was established recently and that it opposes the president of Mexico, his cabinet, and the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party]. The document states: "The front was created autonomously through the initiative of members of the government of the Mexican Republic, members of the Mexican Army, and 7,000 Mexican `illegal alliens' [indocumentados] now residing in the United States." Members of Chicano communities in Arizona, California, and New Mexico who were questioned about this said they knew nothing about this new organization. PRENSA HISPANA is a small weekly distributed among the Mexican-American community and Radio Campesina belongs to the Peasants Union established by Cesar Chavez. The document says Mario Aburto Martinez, who is currently being held in Almolova in connection with the Colosio slaying, is a member of this front and was the person who opened fire on the presidential candidate. The document says: "The FMCCG (along with its member Aburto Martinez), weary and desperate because of the alarming economic situation facing the Mexican people for the past 24 years, is adopting measures against the government and claims responsibility for the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio." The group claims to have deployed death squads throughout the country and vows to attack its targets should its demands not be met. The document points out: "Over the past six years, we have prepared ourselves to realize, fight, and die for our ideals by punishing those politicians who are in power and are using this power to their advantage to abuse, steal, and commit injustices." Although the document says members of the group are willing to die for their cause, it adds, "of course, they will die before we do." The five-page document addressed to the Mexican people says Colosio was the first of several targets, and it adds that the attack on the politician marked the start of a fight to the death against the "corrupt traitors of the Mexican Government." The group warns that there will be no peace in the country until its demands are met and until the members of the government change their positions. The document adds: "All demands must be met or the loss of thousands of Mexican lives will be inevitable. The only person responsible for this will be you, Carlos Salinas de Gortari." Among the front's main demands is the establishment of an OAS commission to oversee respect for the human rights of prisoners. Other demands include the addition to the Constitution of an article attributing responsibility to and punishing members of several Mexican governments for crimes of embezzlement and mismanagement of public funds. The front wants capital punishment established for "traitors of the homeland," and it calls for the confiscation of personal fortunes estimated at $1 billion amassed by former Presidents Luis Echeverria Alvarez, Jose Lopez Portillo, and Miguel de la Madrid, as well as by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Fidel Velasquez, leader of the CTM [Confederation of Mexican Workers]. The group also levels charges against former Jalisco Governor Guillermo Cosio Vidaurri, other former state leaders, and federal senators and deputies.
