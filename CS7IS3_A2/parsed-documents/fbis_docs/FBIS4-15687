The newspaper said several members of the underground in Vilnius and some other Lithuanian towns are constantly watched. The security service knows secret addresses and routes used to deliver underground communist publications to Lithuania from Belarus and the Kaliningrad region, LIETUVOS AIDAS [as received] said. According to the report, the communist underground and Zhirinovskiy's supporters became especially active when coup leaders were amnestied in Russia. Leaflets claiming that Lithuania is a historical territory of Russia and that Lithuanians are assimilated Slavs appeared in some parts of Vilnius in late March. LIETUVOS AIDAS said the security service sees no need to detain any members of the underground yet because their activities pose no major threat and it is better to watch them in order to reveal the whole system. The newspaper pointed out a connection between the communist underground and the recently created Socialist Party of Lithuania, whose program was published in an underground communist newspaper.
