In the past decade, the province's Scientific Research Foundation remained weak due to its position as a frontier region. With recent economic development, more and more Guangdong residents have come to realize that only on a solid basis of scientific research will the economy keep its momentum. In the past three years, the province invested 29.18 million yuan in the construction of 11 key laboratories. The province also allocated special funds for the transformation of five scientific research institutes and the updating of equipment and instruments in another six institutes. Last year, the Guangdong provincial government continued to increase investment in basic scientific research programs, and it set up Guangdong funds for natural sciences. The increased investment in research institutes has improved research conditions. Statistics show that the annual income of 12 research institutes has exceeded 1 million yuan.
