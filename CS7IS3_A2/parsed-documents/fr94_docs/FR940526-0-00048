FR940526-0-00048 FR940526-0-00020 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 301 [Docket No. 940381&hyph;4144; I.D. 031194B] RIN 0648&hyph;AG09 Pacific Halibut Fisheries AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this final rule to implement allocative regulations governing fishing for halibut in Regulatory Area 4B as recommended by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council). This action is necessary to enhance the fishing opportunities of small, locally based vessels in Area 4B. It is intended to further the conservation and management objectives of the Council with respect to the Pacific halibut fishery. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 6, 1994, at 12:00 hours Alaska local time. ADDRESSES: Copies of the Environmental Assessment/Regulatory Impact Review/Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (EA/RIR/FRFA) may be obtained by contacting the Council, P.O. Box 103136, Anchorage, AK 99510, 907&hyph;271&hyph;2809. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jay J. C. Ginter, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, Alaska Region, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The fishery for Pacific halibut ( Hippoglossus stenolepis ) off the coasts of Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California is governed by the Convention for the Preservation of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea (Convention). The Convention is carried out by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC), which develops regulations to manage the fishery. The Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 (Halibut Act) was subsequently enacted to give effect to the 1979 Protocol to the Convention. Section 5(c) of the Halibut Act provides for the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to develop regulations, including limited access regulations, governing the United States portion of Convention waters and applicable to nationals or vessels of the United States, which are in addition to, and not in conflict with, regulations adopted by the IPHC. Since 1987, NMFS has interpreted this provision to mean that regulations having domestic allocation of the Pacific halibut resource as a primary purpose would be developed by the Council with respect to Alaska and by the Pacific Fishery Management Council with respect to Washington, Oregon, and California. Area 4B Allocation This action is designed to ameliorate the effects caused by the differing harvest abilities of vessels that catch and land all their halibut harvest in Area 4B, principally at the Aleutian Islands community of Atka (single-area vessels), and vessels that catch and land halibut in other areas as well as Area 4B (multiple-area vessels). Most single-area vessels are small relative to most multiple-area vessels. This size differential means that multiple-area vessel operators have an advantage in fishing power (i.e., a larger vessel has more space for fish, fuel, and crew) and in fishing time (i.e., a larger vessel can be fished in weather conditions that would prevent smaller vessels from being fished). To limit this competitive disadvantage, the Council, after reviewing data presented in the EA/RIR/Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and public testimony, decided at its January 1994 meeting to recommend to the Secretary of Commerce that 15 percent of the Area 4B catch limit be reserved for the early season fishery, in which there would be a 10,000 lb (4.5 mt) fishing period (trip) limit. The IPHC, at its meeting of January 25&hyph;28, 1994, established the 1994 halibut catch limit for Area 4B to be 2,100,000 lb (953 mt); 15 percent of this amount is 315,000 lb (143 mt). The IPHC also established the Area 4B early season to include one 24-hour period on June 6 through 7, 1994, followed by 31 12-hour periods to occur on every other day between June 15 and August 14, 1994. The IPHC will close all remaining 12-hour periods after the 315,000 lb (143 mt) early season catch limit is reached or add the unharvested remainder to the subsequent unrestricted fishing periods scheduled by the IPHC to begin on August 15, 1994. A proposed rule to implement the Council's recommended action was published in the Federal Register April 4, 1994 (59 FR 15700). A complete description and justification for this action was presented in the preamble to the proposed rule. Additional information is also available in the EA/RIR/FRFA. Comments on the proposed rule were invited through April 28, 1994. No comments were received during the comment period. Classification Analysis supporting this action can be found in the EA/RIR/FRFA (see ADDRESSES ). This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has determined under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act that good cause exists for waiving the 30-day delayed effectiveness period for this action. NMFS has proceeded with rulemaking expeditiously after receiving the EA/RIR/IRFA from the Council on February 7, 1994. The 10,000 pound (4.5 mt) fishing period (trip) limit established for the early season fishery in Regulatory Area 4B must be effective upon the opening date of that fishery (June 6, 1994). To delay the effective date beyond June 6 would severely undermine the intent of the Council to provide single-area vessels additional harvest opportunities in the halibut fishery of Regulatory Area 4B. To meet the intent of the Council for the 1994 fishery, the AA is waiving the 30-day delayed effectiveness period for this action. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 301 Fisheries, Treaties.
