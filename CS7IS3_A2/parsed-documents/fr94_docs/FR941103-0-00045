FR941103-0-00045 FR941103-0-00007 2. ``And'' Versus ``Or'' Pricing and Related Incentives The ``and'' versus ``or'' issue dominated the pricing comments. While arguments on all sides of the issue were expressed, the commenters generally opposed the Commission's current corporate ``or'' policy and alternatively advocated either some form of the ``and'' pricing method or corporate-average embedded cost-based rates. The positions of the commenters are described below: The ``And'' Method: Most IOUs, most Regulatory/Government entities and some Other entities support the ``and'' methodology. These commenters state that the Commission's ``or'' pricing policy does not hold the native load customers harmless and violates FPA section 212(a) (because native load customers and shareholders subsidize third party wheeling customers). When additional facilities are needed to serve third party wheeling load, and incremental (or opportunity) costs are greater than average embedded cost, native load customers subsidize that service (because no cost recognition is given to the third party's use of the existing transmission system, without which the transmission service could not be provided). Additionally, if incremental expansion cost related to third party transmission requests are not allowed by state regulators in retail rates, the transmitting utility will not be made whole. Finally, the Commission's policy on opportunity cost which applies the ``higher of'' test over the entire transaction period instead of an hourly basis precludes opportunity cost recovery in most cases, sends the wrong hourly price signals to transmission customers, and is overly burdensome administratively. The ``Or'' Method: Most NUGs/IPPs commenters agree that the Commission's current corporate ``or'' policy sends the correct price signal for third-party transmission (as long as opportunity costs are ``legitimate and verifiable'' and continue to be capped at incremental expansion costs). However several commenters oppose pricing based on opportunity costs (as monopoly rents for a constrained system). The Average Embedded Cost Method: Most of the Muni/Coops, some NUGs/IPPs, and some Other entities generally support the return to traditional corporate-average embedded cost-based rates. The majority of the Muni/Coops commenters and some of the Other commenters oppose both the ``or'' and the ``and'' transmission pricing methods (as yielding excessive rates and impeding the competitive generation market that EPAct permits). Such commenters recommend the traditional policy of charging average embedded cost-based transmission rates. Many of these commenters argue that a transmission-dependent utility (TDU) cannot be considered a ``marginal'' customer, subject to incremental and opportunity cost pricing, because the transmission system was designed to accommodate the TDU's use and has been paid for proportionally by the TDU. Furthermore, these commenters argue that applying incremental pricing to TDUs is anticompetitive and inconsistent with the EPAct because (1) it forces TDUs to favor power purchases from the host utility over those from a competing power supplier, and (2) TDUs compete with the host utility for requirements customers (who are charged an average embedded cost rate by the host utility).
