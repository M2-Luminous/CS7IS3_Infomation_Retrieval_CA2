FR940325-2-00008 FR940325-2-00004 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;427&hyph;812] Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Calcium Aluminate Cement, Cement Clinker and Flux From France Agency: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: V. Irene Darzenta or Katherine Johnson, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;6320 or 482&hyph;4929, respectively. Final Determinations We determine that calcium aluminate (CA) cement, cement clinker and flux from France are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Scope of Investigations The products subject to these investigations constitute two classes or kinds of merchandise: (1) CA cement and cement clinker, and (2) CA flux. The products covered by these investigations include CA cement, cement clinker and flux, other than white, high purity CA cement, cement clinker and flux. These products contain by weight more than 32 percent but less than 65 percent alumina and more than one percent each of iron and silica. CA cement/cement clinker and CA flux have significantly different physical characteristics and end uses. CA cement is a specialty hydraulic non-portland cement used for construction purposes. CA cement clinker is the primary material used as a binding agent in the production of CA cement. CA flux is used primarily as a desulfurizer and/or cleaning agent in the steel manufacturing process. CA clinker produced for sale as flux cannot be used to produce CA cement, and CA clinker used to produce CA cement cannot be used as a flux in the production of steel. CA flux has a chemical composition distinct from CA cement clinker. CA cement clinker contains the hydraulic mineral mono-calcium aluminate, which gives it a molar ratio of lime to alumina of approximately 1:1. In contrast, CA clinker sold as a flux does not contain mono-calcium aluminate; it contains the complex mineral C 12 A 7 (12CaO * 7A1 2 O 2 ), which gives it a molar ratio of lime to alumina of approximately 2:1. This higher lime to alumina ratio gives the CA clinker sold as a flux a lower melting point than CA cement, and also results in extra lime which can bond with sulfur and other impurities in molten steel. Although CA clinker sold as flux has some hydraulic properties, it hydrates too quickly to be used for those properties. These products are currently classifiable under the following Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) subheadings: 2523.30.0000 (for aluminous cement) and 2523.10.0000 (for cement clinker and flux). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, the written description of the scope of these investigations remains dispositive. Period of Investigations The period of investigation (POI) is October 1, 1992, through March 31, 1993. Case History Since the publication of the notice of preliminary determinations on November 3, 1993 (58 FR 58683), the following events have occurred. On October 29, 1993, the respondent, Lafarge Fondu International (LFI) and Lafarge Calcium Aluminates, Inc. (LCA) (collectively Lafarge), and the petitioner, Lehigh Portland Cement Company (Lehigh), both requested that the Department postpone the final determinations in these investigations. Pursuant to these requests, the Department postponed the final determinations until March 18, 1994 (58 FR 60843, November 18, 1993). On November 8, 1993, Lafarge submitted supplemental responses to the Department's questionnaire for CA flux sales. On November 15, 1993, petitioner requested that the Department collect data on respondent's home market sales of CA flux, objecting to respondent's use of constructed value (CV) based on differences-in-merchandise (difmer) adjustments calculated inclusive of home market bagging costs. (See Comment 11 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.) Subsequently, on November 24, 1993, the Department requested that respondent provide such data.
