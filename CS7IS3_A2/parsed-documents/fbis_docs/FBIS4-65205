Mr. Juppe also issued a warning about what could happen in the event of the fundamentalists coming to power. Alain Juppe: [Begin Juppe recording] I have said very clearly that the advent of an extremist, fundamentalist, anti-European, and anti-Western government in Algiers will have very serious consequences, not just for Algeria itself, and for France, but for the whole of the Mediterranean region, and thus for the equilibrium of this region. The Americans will evidently be directly affected. So, what can one do to prevent this happening? One can promote dialogue --the current Algerian authorities are devoting themselves to doing this, and it is not easy, of course--and above all, and this is no doubt the card that we must play, one can help Algeria pull itself out of the economic slump, the economic crisis, from which it is suffering after 30 years of socialist management. It has done what had to be done with the International Monetary Fund and devalued its currency, it has taken courageous internal measures; it now has to follow this up. This means an extensive rescheduling of the debt, and also bilateral or multilateral aid to the Algerian economy. France is making a great effort to this effect, the Twelve have agreed to make a great effort, and I hope that others will also join us in this action. [end recording]
