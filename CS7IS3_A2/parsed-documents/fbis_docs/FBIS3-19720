The Social Democratic Party [SDP] is continuing its triumphal procession in the polls. According to the most recent one, which was conducted by Taloustutkimous for the Center Party press organ SUOMENMAA, the SDP is up to a new record 33 percent -- or one-third -- of the electorate. This is all of 11 points -- or, stated another way, no less than 50 percent! -- over the 22-percent result in the 1991 parliamentary election. The rise has been accelerating ever since the 27 percent posted in the municipal elections of 1992. Since the Left Alliance has risen to more than 10 percent over the Greens despite an overall declining trend, in just over seven weeks [since the first round of the presidential elections], a red-green majority in next year's parliamentary election right now seems probable. In the nonsocialist camp the situation is most bleak for the Center Party: a drop from almost 25 percent in 1991 to a bare 19 percent in the municipal elections, to 18 now, which is almost as dramatic as the SDP's advance. It appears significantly better for the Conservative Party, whose voter support of just over 19 percent in both 1991 and 1992 dropped only to 18.5 percent now. The same can be said of the Swedish People's Party, whose 4.7 percent is nearly the "normal." It is interesting that the Rural Party's risk of dropping below the threshold for parliamentary representation is now confirmed. A main reason for the poll trend is obvious: Governing responsibility in times of economic crisis has impacted the largest governing party, while the SDP has benefited from its role as leading opposition party. What is interesting regarding this, however, is that the Conservative Party and Swedish People's Party coalition partners have not been hit as hard as the prime minister's party. It is starting to become really urgent for the Center Party to convince voters, with the aid of an economic upturn, that its policies have been the right ones. On the other hand, it seems the presidential election has not left any clear-cut influences on the parties' poll figures. It is possible that the SDP's advance could be explained as an "Ahtisaari effect," if it were not that the advance turned upward during the survey period, i.e., after Ahtisaari's election win. [Conservative Party presidential candidate] Ilaskivi's fiasco has not affected his party -- not to speak of Andersson's [Left Alliance]! In the same way, Vayrynen's result has not impacted the Center Party; he did better than his party, despite Korhonen and Kuuskoski. The Swedish People's Party will have to gaze at the moon to find some "Rehn effect." Even the Green's decline can hardly be explained by the absence of their own candidate. In the future the EU [European Union] issue will decide much.
