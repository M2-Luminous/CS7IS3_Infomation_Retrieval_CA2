FR941011-0-00057 FR941011-0-00016 40 CFR Part 60 [AD&hyph;FRL&hyph;5087&hyph;5] RIN 2060&hyph;AF14 Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources: Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Surface Coating Operations AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: On July 29, 1982, a revision to the new source performance standard (NSPS) for automobile and light-duty truck prime coat operations was proposed. Analysis of data submitted after this proposal showed that the best demonstrated prime coating system and prime coat materials could not consistently meet the proposed revised standard. This revised final NSPS is consistent with the performance of the best demonstrated prime coating system and prime coat materials. This revision of the standard does not reflect a change in the basis of the standard, but reflects a better understanding of the performance of the prime coating system and prime coat materials upon which the standard was originally based. The intended effect of this NSPS is to require all new, modified, and reconstructed prime coat operations at automobile and light-duty truck assembly plants to use the best demonstrated system of continuous emission reduction considering costs, nonair quality health, and environmental and energy impacts. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 11, 1994. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act (Act), judicial review of this revision of a NSPS is available only by filing a petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit within 60 days of today's publication of this rule. Under section 307(b)(2) of the ACT, the requirements that are the subject of today's rule may not be challenged later in civil or criminal proceedings to enforce these requirements. ADDRESSES: Docket. Docket number A&hyph;82&hyph;10, containing supporting information used in developing the revised standard, is available for public inspection and copying between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, at EPA's Central Docket Section, West Tower Lobby, Gallery 1, Waterside Mall, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.
