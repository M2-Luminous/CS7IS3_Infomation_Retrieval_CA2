This evening, I gathered the Arnulfista Party's National Directorate and Consultative Board to discuss with them the offer made to me by Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares of two cabinet ministries in his administration. The National Directorate and Consultative Board have issued the following statement in response to the offer made to the Arnulfista Party. It is a unanimous decision, and it states: The National Directorate and Consultative Board of the Arnulfista Party, faithful to the doctrine and thinking of Dr. Arnulfo Arias, categorically and definitively reject the proposal to occupy ministries in the next administration. The Arnulfista Party's ever upright position will be to defend, to the utmost consequences, the freedom and democracy the Panamanian people are enjoying today under the leadership and guarantees of an Arnulfista administration. I reiterate that our glorious party's position will be to carry out a clear, constructive, and patriotic opposition, thus giving content and solidity to the authentic democracy for which the civic-minded fought and of which we are the most legitimate guardians.
