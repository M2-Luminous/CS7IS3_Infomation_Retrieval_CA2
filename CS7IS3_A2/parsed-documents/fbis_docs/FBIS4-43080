FBIS4-43080 "drweu113_o_94007" FBIS-WEU-94-113 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 CYPRUS UN Report on Peacekeeping Mandate Submitted UN Report on Peacekeeping Mandate Submitted NC1006170094 Nicosia KIBRIS in Turkish 10 Jun 94 p 3 NC1006170094 Nicosia KIBRIS Turkish BFN [Text] New York (A.A.)--UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali submitted a new report to the UN Security Council today, asking for an extension of the UN Peacekeeping Forces' mandate in Cyprus until the end of 1994. However, his report also repeats accusations against the Turkish Cypriot side. It will be recalled that Butrus-Ghali, in his report dated 30 May, accused TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] President Rauf Denktas of being politically reluctant regarding the implementation of the "package of confidence-building measures" [CBM]. In his new report, he has selected the Turkish Armed Forces as his target. In his report on the extension of the UN Peacekeeping Forces' mandate, Butrus-Ghali expresses regret that "the Turkish military forces' approach has blocked the effort to have the sides withdraw from the buffer zone and to ban arms and ammunition in that area." He also claims that the problems related to access to Maras [Varosha] continue to exist for the same reason. Butrus-Ghali also notes that "the Turkish Armed Forces have refused to hold talks with officials of the UN Peacekeeping Forces on the withdrawal from the buffer zone, claiming that the matter should be resolved with the TRNC Government because of its political nature." Butrus-Ghali's report, which has an incriminating tone, further says: "The failure to achieve progress on reducing troops on the island has caused serious anxiety. The situation becomes even more grave when that matter is considered together with the lack of political will to implement the CBM's." Butrus-Ghali also refers to the rearming of the Greek Cypriot National Guard since 1988. He notes that the 1994 budget allocations for the purchase of arms totalled 205 million Cyprus pounds. Regarding the extension of the UN Peacekeeping Forces' mandate, Butrus-Ghali says: "The presence of the UN Peacekeeping Forces is required for the maintenance of peace on the island. As far as the achievement of the targets that have been established by the UN Security Council is concerned, I deem the presence of the UN Peacekeeping Forces on the island essential." Explaining that he has contacts with the sides concerned on the matter, Butrus-Ghali says that he will inform the UN Security Council on the outcome of his contacts. The UN Peacekeeping Forces in Cyprus are composed 1,218 men, 1,184 of whom are military personnel. The force is made up of contingents from Argentina, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Britain, and Australia.
