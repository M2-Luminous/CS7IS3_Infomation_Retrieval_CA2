FR941005-0-00008 FR941005-0-00004 PART 111_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for 39 CFR part 111 continues to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552(a); 39 U.S.C. 101, 401, 403, 404, 3001&hyph;3011, 3201&hyph;3219, 3403&hyph;3406, 3621, 3626, 5001. 2. Domestic Mail Manual C023 is hereby amended to read as follows: 6.0␣Poisons, Controlled Substances, and Drug Paraphernalia * * * * * 6.8␣Controlled Substances A ``controlled substance'' is any anabolic steroid, narcotic, hallucinogenic, stimulant, or depressant drug in Schedules I through V of the Controlled Substances Act (Public Law 91&hyph;513), 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq., and 21 CFR 1300 et seq. Because controlled substances are potentially addictive and abusable, if distribution of a controlled substance is unlawful under 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq., and under any relevant implementing regulations in 21 CFR 1300 et seq., distribution of such matter by mail is also unlawful under 18 U.S.C. 1716. Section 1716(a) prohibits from being conveyed in the mails all matter capable of killing or injuring a person. 6.9␣Mailing Requirements Under 18 U.S.C. 1716(b), the Postal Service may permit the mailing of matter not outwardly or of its own force dangerous or injurious to a person's life or health, subject to the preparation and packaging standards specified by the Postal Service. Accordingly, if distribution of a controlled substance is lawful under 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq., and any relevant implementing regulations in 21 CFR 1300 et seq., the Postal Service considers such distribution by mail to constitute the mailing of matter not outwardly or of its own force dangerous or injurious to a person's life or health, if the following preparation and packaging standards are met: a. The inner container of any parcel containing controlled substances is marked and sealed under the applicable provisions of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq. and the regulations implementing it, 21 CFR 1300 et seq.) and placed in a plain outer container or securely overwrapped in plain paper. b. If the controlled substances consist of prescription medicines, the inner container is also labeled to show the prescription number and the name and address of the pharmacy, practitioner, or other person dispensing the prescription. c. The outside wrapper or container is free of markings that would indicate the nature of the contents. * * * * * A transmittal letter making these changes in the pages of the Domestic Mail Manual will be published and will be transmitted to subscribers automatically. Notice of issuance will be published in the Federal Register , as provided by 39 CFR 111.3. Stanley F. Mires, Chief Counsel, Legislative.
