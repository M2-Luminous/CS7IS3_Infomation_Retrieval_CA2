Introduction Although the number of sewage facilities has significantly increased in Japan's urban concentrations, this is not so in areas with low population density. Water pollution caused by wastewater, domestic and from small-scale industries, in these low population density areas constitutes a critical problem that needs to be solved as soon as possible. Wastewater treatment systems which are demanded for use in such areas must feature compactness, easy maintenance, high reliability, and capable to perform advanced treatment. One system which fulfills such requirements is the activated sludge wastewater treatment process which uses integrated type membrane separation (hollow fiber microfiltration membrane) modules. The authors have been engaged in the development of this system, currently in the practicalization stage, and have reported previously that the configuration of membrane module is vital factor for stable and continuous membrane separation on a long-term basis.[.sup]1[/] The following discusses membrane fouling, membrane washing, and other relevant topics which are consequent to recent test results. 2. Test Apparatus Activated Sludge Wastewater Treatment Process Tests were carried out using a nitrified liquor recycling denitrification nitrification activated sludge treatment process. The influent was domestic sewage. The modules were submerged in a nitrification separation tank (3 m[.sup]3[/]) for solid-liquid separation. The volumetric aeration rate was set at 5.6 [1/h]. Membrane & Membrane Modules Figure 1 shows a conceptual diagram of membrane module A. This module features hollow fiber membranes which are bent into a U-shape. The potted end, wherein the membrane fibers are potted in a circle, constitutes the filtrate collector. The U-shaped section features a support ring, which supports the gaps between the membrane fibers. Figure 1. Membrane Module A Figure 2 shows a conceptual diagram of membrane module B. The hollow fibers are arranged and potted flatly. There are two filtrate collectors on both sides. Table 1 shows the specifications of both types of membrane modules. Figure 2.

The pump flow rate was adjusted so the flux could be kept at a constant. The suction pressure was measured as the filtration pressure. 3. Test Results Membrane Module Configuration A test operation using membrane module A was continued for over two years. Figure 3 shows variations in the filtration pressure during this period. The filtration pressure is corrected to 20�C of water temperature. A comparison is made between the filtration pressure measured in the activated sludge and that measured in the filtrate following the washing process. There were two phases of variations in the filtration pressure of sludge: one which was a stationary phase, where the increase rate of the pressure was low, and the other which was the non-stationary phase, where the increase rate of the pressure was irregularly high. In the stationary phase, the membrane modules indicated favorable dispersion and the pressure increase rate was low at 1 [mAq/year]. This pressure variation matched well with pressure variations of the filtrate following the washing process. Considering that the variation in the filtration pressure of the filtrate following the washing process is due to membrane fouling, it can be assumed that membrane fouling progresses during the stationary phase. However, variation in the filtration pressure during the non-stationary phase was 2 [mAq/month], necessitating a washing which had to be done within a short period of time. Interfiber clogging was found in the membrane modules at this stage. Figure 3. Variations in Filtration Pressure of Membrane Module A Membrane modules with interfiber clogging were removed from the tank and the sludge between the fibers washed off by tap water. After the operation was resumed, the filtration pressure in the sludge was almost identical to the filtrate pressure. Trends of pressure increase were identical to those before the washing. Interfiber clogging was also found during the stationary phase, i.e., in the proximity of the filtrate collector of the modules. This was assumed to be due to small gaps between the hollow fibers in the proximity of the filtrate collector, also due to the fact that module washing by the water flow was ineffective there. However, the majority of the hollow fibers were favorably dispersed and it was possible to carry out a stable long-term operation under this phase. It is probable that interfiber clogging spreads over an entire module, i.e., after a few months of such favorable condition, but the cause of this clogging is yet to be clarified. The duration of the stationary phase showed a tendency to become shortened with the increase in the operation time and was approximately five months up to the third washing. An increase in the washing was found to be impractical in terms of maintenance and it was considered necessary to modify membrane module A. Figure 4 shows filtration pressure variation of membrane module B. It indicates that a stationary phase had continued for seven months since the startup of the operation and that there was no occurrence of interfiber clogging. The pressure increase rate was only 0.5 [mAq/year], less than that of membrane module A. Figure 4. Variations in Filtration Pressure of Membrane Module B As for the transition of the pressure increase rate, there was no clarification made on the cause of the shift from the stationary phase to the non-stationary one. However, prevention of interfiber clogging was found possible by sufficient washing of the membrane surface. The aeration flow causes more movement by the hollow fibers in module B, i.e., than that by the same in module A. The aeration flow and the movement of the fibers themselves causes a greater washing effect, both of which can be attributed to the prevention of interfiber clogging. Flux and Membrane Fouling Figure 5 shows the relationship between the pressure increase rate and flux. The pressure increase rate becomes higher along the increase of flux, and is proportional to the third power of the flux. The increase rate of hydrophobic membranes is higher than that of hydrophilic ones. It's indicating that membrane fouling progresses faster for hydrophobic membranes than for hydrophilic ones. Fujita et al.[.sup]2[/] indicate a similar trend in their report on potable water treatment by membrane filtration. Figure 5. Relationship Between Pressure Increase and Membrane Washing There are two objectives of membrane washing, washing off sludge that causes interfiber clogging and washing off pollutants that attach on membrane pores and cause membrane fouling. The former can be easily done by washing with water and the membranes retain their former condition. Conditions that make it necessary to carry out washing for membrane fouling have yet to be clarified. However, tests were conducted to clarify which washing method was most effective for membrane fouling. An alkaline washing was attempted, taking into account that organic matter must be the cause of fouling. Figure 6 shows the test results. Figure 6. Effects of Washing by Chemical Solutions A membrane immersed for two hours in a 5 percent NaOH solution with water temperature at 40�C, resulted in a filtration pressure recovery to a value identical to the pressure of a new membrane. The washing effect was found to decrease with a drop in the chemical solution concentration and water temperature. Membrane Module Life and Optimum Flux It was confirmed through the tests conducted that the life of the membrane module could exceed two years. It is figured that membrane life was elongated by improvement made on the module configuration, the outcome of which was decrease in the pressure increase rate. Further long-term tests will be necessary to affirm this. Insofar as designing a membrane separation system is concerned, a decrease in the number of modules could be achieved by setting the flux at a high value. Consequently, a saving in initial cost can be made. However, this leads to a faster progress of membrane fouling and washing by chemical solutions for pollutant removal becomes necessary. For this reason, the optimum flux was determined by the initial and running costs. Although the present treatment method is designed for use in a small-scale treatment plant, to use a chemical washing system in such a plant is impractical even in economic terms. It will become necessary to transport the modules to a washing plant and this will increase maintenance requirement, not to mention increased costs. A solution here would be to set the flux to a predetermined value, considering the relation between the flux and factors such as membrane life, whereby washing by chemical solution would not be necessary. Quality of Treated Water Table 2 shows results of analyses on water quality. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

The ratio of total nitrogen removal was not favorable, because the DO level in denitrification tank did not indicate zero for the small BOD loading. As for phosphorus removal, it was the same level as that by the conventional activated sludge process, as no phosphorus removal system was applied. There was negative indication of E-coli groups; however they became detected along an increase in hollow fiber damage. One future objective would be to study the application of phosphorus removal methods fit for the said treatment. 4. Conclusion The following are results of tests on the activated sludge wastewater treatment process which featured the integrated type membrane separation (hollow fiber microfiltration membrane) modules. 1) There are two phases of variations in the filtration pressure during continuous filtration: one which was a stationary phase, wherein membrane fouling progresses, and the other which was a non-stationary phase, where interfiber clogging occurs. 2) The progress of membrane fouling was related to the flux, while the pressure increase rate was proportional to the third power of the flux. 3) Interfiber clogging could be easily dealt with by washing and the membranes retain their original pressure as a result. 4) Alkali washing of fouled membranes is effective to a high degree whereby the washed membranes could retain a state which is close to that of new membranes. 5) Module life was elongated to exceed two years by configuration improvement, but further studies are necessary to affirm this. 6) Optimum flux should be determined in an overall manner, i.e., considering factors such as the necessary washing and membrane life. 7) The treated water quality by the said process was favorable.
