In connection with the issue of standards and certification for automobiles, which is a focal point of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the MOT will improve the system of accepting international standards and data on foreign inspections. The 27- item deregulation plan also includes: 1) flexible management of freight railway fares and warehouse charges; and 2) expansion of business areas for trucks. The plan will be incorporated into a deregulation package to be compiled by the government at the end of June. The MOT will not introduce the price ceiling system (price cap system) for railway fares, saying "there are still many problems" in the system. The introduction of the system has been demanded by JR [Japan Railway Company] and the Administrative Reform Headquarters' working group on imports promotion, market access improvement, and distribution.
