Although the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement is imminent, al-Surani, who is opposed to the Declaration of Principles agreement, believes that "the Palestinian-Israeli negotiation sessions have exposed Israel's lies about its desire for peace and also exposed its continuing refusal to implement the UN resolutions and its violation of the fourth Geneva Convention." In a statement to AL-HAYAH, al-Surani described the agreement between Fatah and the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) as "a step toward unification of the various Palestinian factions within the framework of the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people." He accused the U.S. Administration of "appeasing" Israel. He added that when the Palestinians "defend their rights they are accused of terrorism but the Israeli repression and murders are seen by them as security preccautions."
