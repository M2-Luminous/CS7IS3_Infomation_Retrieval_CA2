ITAR-TASS learned this from an official source in the Kremlin, who also said that Yeltsin was in favor of Nixon holding meetings with representatives of different branches of power in Russia. However, the Russian president himself will still be unable to receive the former U.S. President because of the death of his wife's, Naina Yeltsina's, mother several days ago. An ITAR-TASS correspondent has been told by Nixon's aides that U.S. President Bill Clinton and Robert Dole, the leader of the Republican group in the U.S. Senate and one of the most influential American legislators, approached the Russian head of state with requests to settle the complicated situation around this issue. Representatives of Nixon have reported that on Monday [14 March] he will make a speech at a sitting of the Russian State Duma Committee for International Affairs at the invitation of the committee's chairman Vladimir Lukin.
