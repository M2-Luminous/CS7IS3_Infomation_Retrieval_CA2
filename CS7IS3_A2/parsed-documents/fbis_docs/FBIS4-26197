The operation of the new systems has, over nearly five months, produced new situations and new problems in economic life and has attracted the wide attention of people in all spheres of society, especially those in economic circles and enterprise circles. Thus, our reporters visited Liu Zhongli, minister of finance and concurrently head of the State Administration of Taxation, and asked him to give his views on several questions which are of great concern to people. [JINGJI RIBAO] Financial and taxation reform and financial and taxation work are the most important aspects of economic life this year. All sides have shown great concern about the operation of the new financial and tax systems and the current financial situation. Could you please give us some idea of the situation in these areas? [Liu] The current financial situation is, speaking overall, quite good. First, the implementation of the financial system and tax system reforms is going quite smoothly, and there are no major problems. This year, reforms of all major aspects of the financial and tax systems are being carried out concurrently. This provides the advantage of coordination, but certainly also exacerbates the risks of reform. In order to guarantee the normal operation of the new financial and tax systems and realize our anticipated goals, from the beginning of the year, we have greatly concerned ourselves with the implementation and operation of reform. Seen from the current situation, the levying of all taxes is now handled completely in accordance with the new tax system, and there has been a marked decrease in losses through tax leakage. The reaction of foreign businesses and the majority of domestically funded enterprises to changes in tax burdens have been stable, and no instances have occurred of wild price rises resulting from the tax system reforms affecting financial income. The revenue-sharing financial situation is now being implemented level by level in accordance with the requirements of the central authorities and no major distortions have occurred. The fiscal revenue situation is basically normal in central and local financial administrations. The work of setting up branch taxation organs is now being firmly grasped and carried out. As to the new situations and new problems which have appeared in the implementation of the new systems, on the basis of much investigative research, we have carried out overall analysis and, in a timely way, formulated appropriate response measures for dealing with these situations and problems. From the beginning of the year until now, we have sent out over 100 documents and telegrams resolving problems which have appeared in the operation of the new systems. Second, in a situation where quite a number of reform measures have been implemented, the budget implementation situation is basically normal. From January to April, national fiscal revenue totaled 125.246 billion yuan, an increase of 22.607 billion yuan or 22 percent compared with the same period last year. Of this, growth in added-value tax, operational tax, and other major tax types was over 30 percent. National fiscal expenditure over the same period was 116.751 billion yuan, an increase of 22.357 billion yuan, or 23.7 percent over the same period last year. Expenditure in major areas such as transformation and tapping potential, education, science and technology, health, public security, and procuratorial and law work increased by over 30 percent. Comparing revenue and expenditure over the January to April period, we see that revenue exceeded expenditure by 8.495 billion yuan, a higher figure than in the same period last year. Of course, in budget implementation, there have existed and will continue to appear factors which reduce revenue and increase expenditure. These have already received a high degree of our attention. At the same time, there has been steady growth in the national economy, and from January to April, the industrial output value of enterprises at or above township level grew by 18.4 percent. Also, in April, industrial output value and realized profits of state-owned enterprises saw a turn for the better compared with the first quarter. [JINGJI RIBAO] Some people believe that since the beginning of this year, the price increase index has been quite high and that this is closely linked with the reform of the taxation system. What are your views on this? [Liu] In accordance with the taxation reform plans, this year, the reforms will not increase the overall tax burden on enterprises. Thus, in theory, there should not be a direct effect on the overall level of prices. However, seen from the actual situation, the structural readjustment of the tax system will result in the level of tax burden of some enterprises increasing, while for some others it will fall. Enterprises for whom the tax burden has been reduced will not necessarily reduce their prices, while it is very likely that some of the enterprises which will see an increased tax burden will, as a result of cost pushes, raise their prices. However, speaking overall, the influence of the tax system reforms on price indexes will be limited. Seen from the situation this year, the main factors leading to price rises will remain the excessive scale of capital construction, inflation in consumption funds, and enterprise cost-push factors. In resolving the inflation problem, we must make efforts into several areas. [JINGJI RIBAO] It is claimed that since the beginning of this year, many state-owned enterprises have experienced operational difficulties. Do you think this is linked with the tax system reforms? [Liu] Seen overall, the operational situation of state-owned enterprises is normal, and their development trend is good. As for the problems which exist in some enterprises, some of the problems are quite complex and require specific analysis. Seen from the fiscal angle, after a large number of enterprises implemented the "General Rules Governing Enterprise Finances" and the "Enterprise Accounting Standards," interest and repayment of long-term loans which had originally been expended from profits, were entered as costs, and there were also increases in depreciation rates. This reduced their book profits or potential losses were converted into explicit losses. However, funds which the enterprises were able to expend not only were not reduced, but actually increased. Thus, in the light of the implementation of the "Rules" and "Standards" noted above, this situation is normal and falls within our expectations. Of course, the tax system reforms are having some effect on the burdens of enterprises. This influence is mainly of three types: 1) Tax burdens in a small number of industries have increased. In this respect, we have already adopted appropriate measures to deal with the effects. 2) In accordance with the requirements of industrial policy, when planning our programs we have appropriately raised the tax burden levels of a small number of industries and products and abolished some inappropriate tax exemption policies for some enterprises. This should be noted as being correct and the changes in the economic situation resultant from this are normal. 3) Where, over an entire industry, the general tax burden is not high but some individual enterprises complain about the raising of the tax burden; this suggests a problem of enterprise operations. Such problems can only be resolved by enterprises improving management themselves. We cannot carry out, on the policy level, any individual readjustment of such enterprises. Otherwise, the tax system reforms will be entirely distorted and will be unable to achieve the anticipated goals. It also needs to be explained that the majority of problems which various sides have reflected to us about the tax system reforms and enterprise burdens have been rational and have already been basically resolved. [JINGJI RIBAO] According to my understanding, at present, some local financial administrations and especially county-level financial administrations are suffering a tightness of funds and some are even in a situation where they cannot issue wages. What is your assessment of this? [Liu] The implementation of the revenue-sharing system this year is being carried out gradually and, as of yet, this has not affected the immediate financial strength of localities. Thus, the reforms should not have affected the financial resources and payment capability of the localities. In particular, the central financial administration's timely readjustment of the funds transfer ratio played an important role in improving the financial expenditure situations of the localities. As for some localities which are experiencing tightness in their finances and are even unable to issue wages, the reasons differ with each locality. Each region has its own situation. However, as far as the whole country is concerned, a common problem is that the degree of wage readjustment for staff and workers in administrative and institutional units exceeded the standards set down by the state. This is a problem worthy of attention. In order to safeguard stability, it is hoped that financial administrations at all levels will seriously organize well their various revenue channels and, in making expenditure arrangements, will give precedence to guaranteeing the issue of wages. [JINGJI RIBAO] According to the budget approved by the National People's Congress at the beginning of the year, this year, the Ministry of Finance is going to issue over 100 billion yuan of treasury bonds. This is a major element in our country's economic life this year. At the same time, it has also attracted wide attention from circles in society. Please advise us of the most recent situation in the issue of state bonds. [Liu] This year, because of the attention given by leaders at all levels, the adoption of appropriate measures, and the cooperation from banks and other relevant bodies, the issue of state treasury bonds has gone very well. Up to 21 May, 60.295 billion yuan of state treasury bonds had been issued. Of these, the sale of two-year maturity state treasury bonds has already reached 82.7 percent of the figure set as the target for the year, while the sale of three-year maturity treasury bonds has completed 63.28 percent of the planned annual figure. Throughout the country, half of provinces and cities have completed or exceeded their tasks in terms of selling two-year maturity state treasury bonds. At present, the situation in terms of the issuance of state treasury bonds is still looking good. We are still putting efforts into the work and are striving to complete the issue tasks within the specified issue period. [JINGJI RIBAO] Seen from the present situation, what is your appraisal of the prospects for this year's financial and tax reforms and budget implementation? [Liu] Perfecting the reform measures will still require a lot of work. In the following several months, there will also appear many factors which will reduce revenue and increase expenditure. Thus, in respect of the overall annual situation, we must not be blindly optimistic and relax our efforts. However, if we put all our efforts into it and do good work, we will be able to absorb the effects of the disadvantageous factors. I believe that if we are able to firmly uphold the macroeconomic regulatory and control targets; maintain a rational scale of investment, scale of credit and price levels; and continue to put efforts into organizing revenue, controlling expenditure and seriously handling the problems which appear in reform, it will be fully possible to guarantee the normal implementation of the reforms and to complete the annual budgetary tasks.
