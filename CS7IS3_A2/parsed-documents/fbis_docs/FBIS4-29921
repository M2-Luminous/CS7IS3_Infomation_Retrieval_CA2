"You have glorified the immortal chuche idea as the great guiding idea of our era and strengthened and developed the WPK to see that miracles and changes for the century were effected in the revolution and construction with the might of the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses. "You, respected comrade supreme commander with unexcelled grit, iron will, brilliant resources and commanding art of a famous general who descended from the heaven, have reared the People's Army into a matchless army each man of which `can match a hundred foes' and made Korea of chuche rise up imposingly as an impregnable military power. "Your astonishing revolutionary feats in leading the worldwide movement for rebuilding socialism along a straight road to victory, displaying the invincibility of anthropocentric Korean-style socialism under the grim situation in which the imperialists and reactionaries are getting hysteric in the moves to stifle the DPRK on all sides are throwing brilliant rays on human history." The message states that Chongnyon will successfully discharge its noble duty in the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of chuche, trusting and following only the respected general in the future, too. It wishes the respected Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il a long life in good health.
