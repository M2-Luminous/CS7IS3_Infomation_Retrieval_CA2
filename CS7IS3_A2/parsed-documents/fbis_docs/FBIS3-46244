CAS also won widespread international acclaim, he said. Internationally recognized research results include the Liquid Crystal Biomembrane Theory, which won "an outstanding achievement award in physics" in 1993, and an independently-developed 2.16 meter telescope for observing space. Other projects embraced computer control, laser processing and automation of industrial production in some fields. And some new drugs, species and living substances were produced in genetic and cytological projects, he added. The highest academic body also produced some influential reports last year on environmental protection, effective use of China's human resources and the role of overall government control as the country converts to a market economy, the spokesman said.
