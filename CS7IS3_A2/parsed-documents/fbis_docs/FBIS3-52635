FBIS3-52635 "drnes004_p_94002" FBIS-NES-94-004 Document Type:Daily Report 6 Jan 1994 SOUTH ASIA Afghanistan Four-Point Statement Released NC0501192494 Paris AFP in English 1818 GMT 5 Jan 94 NC0501192494 Paris AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Report by Ismael Iraqi] [Text] Kabul, Jan 5 (AFP)--A loose grouping of rival Afghan forces called Wednesday for the resignation of President Borhanoddin Rabbani, as heavy fighting raged through the capital for the fifth day. "Rabbani should resign in the next 48 hours in order to have peace and stability in Afghanistan," began the four-point statement released in Islamabad. The communique was issued under the names of Rabbani's main rivals Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, ex-communist militiaman General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, and two other factions, calling themselves the "Supreme Coordinating Council of forces fighting Rabbani." The other three points called for an assembly of mojahedin leaders to nominate a replacement for Rabbani, the establishment of an immediate interim government, and the appointment of joint commissions to run the Finance, Interior and Foreign Ministries. The communique, released by Hekmatyar's Islamabad spokesman Mengal Hoseyn, also "welcomed" any delegations from Pakistan, Iran or Saudi Arabia to come to the embattled Kabul capital to evacuate those wounded in the bloody five-day fighting. Factional fighting has plagued Afghanistan since the mojahedin overthrew the Afghan communist rule of president Najibollah in April 1992. An Afghan Ministry of Public Health official Tuesday estimated that more than 1,000 people -- mostly civilians -- have yet to receive medical treatment for shrapnel and gunshot injuries. Although the joint communique released in Islamabad implied it, Mengal Hoseyn was careful to distance the battlefield relationship between Hezb and Dostam's Junbish or National Islamic Movement. "So far there is no coalition -- we are fighting Rabbani forces and Dostam is fighting Rabbani forces," Mengal Hoseyn said. He said Hezb was fighting in many different parts of Kabul, including "in the vicinity of Bala Hissar," which is the ancient fortress guarding the eastern approaches to Kabul, and Dostam's main military post in the capital. Bala Hissar has been under severe jet bombardment Wednesday, and it is believed that Hezb forces have joined with Dostam's defenders there in order to hold off an infantry attack by the Shora-e-Nazar forces of Rabbani's strongman, former Defence Minister 'Ahmed Shah Masud. In coordination with retaliatory jet attacks on Kabul by Dostam's airforce based in northern Mazar-e-Sharif, Hezb gunners subjected the city to a fresh wave of artillery salvos Wednesday evening from their mountain strongholds in the southeast. In this shelling, from Zamborak mountain close to Bala Hissar, the AFP office in the northern suburbs took a direct hit which caused extensive damage but no staff were injured. This intensified artillery attack by Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], combined with the unexpected participation of Junbish's jets, is seen as a move to counter intensive military pressure from Masud's fighters. The sound of light weapons heard inside the central city late Wednesday could be a sign of the shifting frontlines, and the ever changing fortunes of the factions battling for control of the Afghan capital.
