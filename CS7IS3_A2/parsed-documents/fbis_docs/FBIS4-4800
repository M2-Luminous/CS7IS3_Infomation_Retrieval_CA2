THE NEW YORK TIMES March 23 said the pressure of "economic sanctions" against North Korea is like trying to squeeze blood from a stone. Recalling that the Clinton administration and its Asia allies found themselves in an embarrassing position as regards the "economic sanctions" against North Korea one year ago, the paper asked what was the use of another "sanctions" against the country which was virtually suffering from sanctions. The paper said North Korea, unlike other countries of the world, has long since adhered to "chuche", "self-reliance", the keynote of the idea of the great leader President Kim Il-song, and he has taught the people that dependence on any other country results in the loss of the political independence of the state in the long run, encouraging the Korean people to walk without the help from outside. Predicting that the world would know the viability of his independent policy, the paper quoted a Japanese official as saying that getting on the nerve of North Korea causes an adverse effect. The British paper THE TIMES March 22 noted that the U.S. diplomacy was now in the worst phase, adding that "economic sanctions" against North Korea could not be regarded as a wise option and some countries do not like "sanctions" much.
