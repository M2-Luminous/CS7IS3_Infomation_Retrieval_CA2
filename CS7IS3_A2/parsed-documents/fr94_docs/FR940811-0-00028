FR940811-0-00028 FR940811-0-00012 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Parts 556 and 558 Animal Drugs, Feeds, and Related Products; Melengestrol Acetate AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of 12 supplemental new animal drug applications (NADA's) filed by The Upjohn Co. The applications concern the use of Type A medicated articles containing melengestrol acetate (MGA) (alone and in combination) to manufacture certain combination drug Type B and Type C medicated feeds for heifers fed in confinement for slaughter. The supplements provide for a revised tolerance of 25 parts per billion (ppb) MGA residues, which is a change in the regulation of medicated feed applications to a Category I drug, and the removal of the requirement for a 48-hour preslaughter withdrawal period. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 11, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jack Caldwell, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;126), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1638. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI 49001, filed 12 supplemental NADA's revising the conditions of use of melengestrol acetate (MGA) Type A medicated articles to make Type B and Type C medicated feeds for heifers being fed in confinement for slaughter. The NADA's supplemented are: (1) NADA 34&hyph;254: MGA 100/200. (2) NADA 39&hyph;402: MGA Liquid 500. (3) NADA 124&hyph;309: MGA 100/200 plus Monensin. (4) NADA 125&hyph;476: MGA 500 Liquid plus Monensin. (5) NADA 138&hyph;792: MGA 100/200 plus Monensin and Tylosin. (6) NADA 138&hyph;870: MGA 500 Liquid plus Monensin and Tylosin. (7) NADA 138&hyph;904: MGA 100/200 plus Lasalocid and Tylosin. (8) NADA 138&hyph;992: MGA 500 Liquid plus Lasalocid and Tylosin. (9) NADA 138&hyph;995: MGA 100/200 plus Tylosin. (10) NADA 139&hyph;192: MGA 500 Liquid plus Tylosin. (11) NADA 139&hyph;876: MGA 100/200 plus Lasalocid. (12) NADA 140&hyph;288: MGA 500 Liquid plus Lasalocid. The supplements provide for the following actions: (1) Deleting the 48-hour preslaughter withdrawal period for use in heifers being fed in confinement for slaughter for increased rate of weight gain, improved feed efficiency, and suppression of estrus; (2) amending the classification in §558.4 Medicated Feed Applications (21 CFR 558.4) from Category II to Category I because the use of the drug no longer requires a withdrawal period; and (3) revising the tolerance for residues of MGA in uncooked, edible cattle tissues from no residue to a finite tolerance of 25 ppb. The tolerance was set based on the determination that the endpoint of toxicological concern is hormonal activity and that residues of MGA at or below 25 ppb in edible tissues of treated animals will not elicit a hormonal response. Also, §556.380 (21 CFR 556.380) includes a gas-liquid chromatographic (GLC) method of analysis for residues of MGA in tissues. That method was in the regulation recodified from food additives to animal drugs in 1970. The Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC), 15th ed., 1990, in section 976.36 (pp. 629&hyph;631) provides an updated GLC method for determining MGA residues in animal tissues. The procedure is also published in the Journal of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists , JAOAC 59: 507&hyph;515, 1976. FDA is removing the analytical method in §556.380 and relying on the AOAC for the method of analysis for MGA. These are new animal drugs used in Type A medicated articles to make Type B and C medicated feeds. With approval of these supplements, MGA is a Category I drug which, as provided in §558.4, does not require an approved form FDA 1900 for making a Type B or C medicated feed from a Type A medicated article. Approved form FDA 1900's may be withdrawn at the request of the sponsor. The supplements are approved as of June 29, 1994. 21 CFR 556.380 is revised to remove the existing text and provide for a finite tolerance. Section 558.4 is revised to remove the MGA entry from the Category II table and add it to the Category I table. 21 CFR 558.342 is amended by revising paragraphs (c)(1)(ii), (c)(2)(ii), (c)(3)(ii), (c)(4)(ii), (c)(5)(ii), and (c)(6)(ii), and 21 CFR 558.355 is amended by revising paragraphs (f)(3)(iv)( b ) and (f)(3)(viii) to remove the 48-hour preslaughter withdrawal statement. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and §514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), these supplements for food-producing animals do not qualify for marketing exclusivity because the supplements do not contain new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) and new human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(i) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. List of Subjects 21 CFR Part 556 Animal drugs, Foods. 21 CFR Part 558 Animal drugs, Animal feeds. Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and redelegated to the Center for Veterinary Medicine, 21 CFR parts 556 and 558 are amended as follows: PART 556_TOLERANCES FOR RESIDUES OF NEW ANIMAL DRUGS IN FOOD 1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 556 continues to read as follows: Authority : Secs. 402, 512, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 342, 360b, 371). 2. Section 556.380 is revised to read as follows: §556.380 Melengestrol acetate. A tolerance of 25 parts per billion is established for residues of the parent compound, melengestrol acetate, in fat of cattle. PART 558_NEW ANIMAL DRUGS FOR USE IN ANIMAL FEEDS 3. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 558 continues to read as follows: Authority : Secs. 512, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b, 371). 4. Section 558.4 is amended in paragraph (d) in the ``Category I'' table by alphabetically adding a new entry for ``melengestrol acetate'' and in the ``Category II'' table by removing the entry for ``melengestrol acetate'' to read as follows: §558.4 Medicated feed applications. * * * * * (d) *␣*␣* * * * * * Category I 1Drug 1Assay limits percent 1 type A 1Type B maximum (200x) 1Assay limits percent 1 type B/C 2 ␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣ Melengestrol acetate 90&hyph;110 10.0 g/ton (0.0011%) 70&hyph;120 ␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣*␣␣ 1Percent of labeled amount. 2Values given represent ranges for either Type B or Type C medicated feeds. For those drugs that have two range limits, the first set is for a Type B medicated feed and the second set is for a Type C medicated feed. These values (ranges) have been assigned in order to provide for the possibility of dilution of a Type B medicated feed with lower assay limits to make Type C medicated feed. * * * * * §558.342 [Amended] 5.
