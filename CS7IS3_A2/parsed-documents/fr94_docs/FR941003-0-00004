FR941003-0-00004 FR941003-0-00001 The 1989 interim rule amended several provisions of the regulations pertaining to the medical deduction, particularly in the area of reporting and verification requirements for allowable medical expenses. Under the 1989 interim rule, households subject to monthly reporting are given the option of either reporting and verifying all medical expenses monthly, or of reporting and verifying changes in medical expenses in excess of $25 occurring during the certification period, but they cannot be required to report under both procedures. The 1989 interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.21(h)(3) (i) and (ii), (i)(1), and (j)(3)(iii) to specify the household's options with regard to reporting and verifying medical expenses in a monthly reporting and retrospective budgeting (MRRB) system. In addition, 7 CFR 273.12(a)(1)(vi) and 7 CFR 273.21(h)(3)(iii) were amended by the 1989 interim rule to simplify reporting changes in medical expenses. The 1989 interim rule required that changes in total medical expenses greater than $25 must be reported, as opposed to a $25 change in each individual allowable medical expense. Following publication of the 1989 interim rule, the 1990 Leland Act was enacted. Regulations published to implement provisions of that Act superseded some of the changes made in the 1989 interim rule. Section 1724 of the 1990 Leland Act delegated to each State agency the responsibility for design of the monthly report form, including the determination of what information relevant to eligibility and benefits was to be included on that form. These provisions of section 1724 were implemented by the Monthly Reporting and Retrospective Budgeting Amendments and Mass Changes final rule, published on December 4, 1991 at 56 FR 63597. Conforming amendments to verification requirements associated with the monthly report were also made at that time. The regulatory amendments in the December 4, 1991 final rule superseded the changes made to 7 CFR 273.21(h)(3) (i), (ii), and (iii), and (i)(1) by the 1989 interim rule, because the interim provisions concerned the information that the Department mandated be contained on the monthly report form. The amendments made to the regulations at 7 CFR 273.12(a)(vi) and 273.21(j)(iii) (C) and (D) by the 1989 interim rule were neither finalized nor superseded by subsequent regulations. As explained below, however, the Department is now making new amendments to these sections. Section 1717 of the 1990 Leland Act amended section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act to provide for a simplified means for eligible households to claim the excess medical expense deduction for recurring medical costs. Section 1717 requires State agencies to estimate at certification a recipient's recurring medical expenses for the certification period based upon the recipient's current verified medical expenses, as well as available information about the recipient's medical condition, and public or private medical insurance coverage. The household's medical deduction would be based on these estimates, and further verification would not be required. In a proposed rule entitled ``Miscellaneous Provisions of the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act and Food Stamp Certification Policy,'' published on June 28, 1991 (56 FR 29594), the Department stated that food stamp regulations at 7 CFR 273.2(f)(8) and 273.12(a)(6) already reflected the intent of the statute and that, therefore, no change to the regulations was required. No comments disputing this position were received, and the position was reiterated in a final rule published on December 4, 1991 (56 FR 63594). It has come to the attention of the Department that some State agencies may not be properly applying section 1717. This may be due to confusion on the part of State agencies with regard to the Department's decision not to issue regulations in connection with section 1717. To ensure that State agencies are in compliance with section 1717, the Department issued three memoranda to FNS regional offices, dated February 3, 1994, April 1, 1994, and May 12, 1994. In the memoranda, the Department instructed the regional offices to remind State agencies that they must be in compliance with the provisions of section 1717. The Department also offered direction as to how the State agencies can implement the provisions of section 1717. In a further effort to insure that State agencies are implementing the provisions of section 1717, the Department is amending food stamp regulations that concern the medical expense deduction. These changes will clarify current regulations to better express the intent of section 1717. Accordingly, this rule amends 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i), 273.10(d)(4), 273.12(a)(vi), 273.21 (h), (i), and (j)(iii) (C) and (D). Under the amendments, the household will be required to report and verify all medical expenses at certification and recertification. The household's monthly medical deduction for its certification period will be based on the information reported and verified by the household, and any anticipated changes in the household's medical expenses that can be reasonably expected to occur during the certification period based on available information about the recipient's medical condition, public or private insurance coverage, and current verified medical expenses. If the household reports a medical expense at certification but cannot verify the expense at that time, and if the amount of the expense cannot be reasonably anticipated based on available information about the recipient's medical condition, public or private insurance coverage, and current verified medical expenses, the expense will be considered at the time the amount of the expense or reimbursement is reported and verified. The household will not be required to file reports about its medical expenses during the certification period. If the household voluntarily reports a change in its medical expenses, the State agency will act on the changes in accordance with current regulations at 7 CFR 273.12(c).
