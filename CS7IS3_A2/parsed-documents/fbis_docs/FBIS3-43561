Regional secretary Lerumo Kalako said on Saturday Dr Boesak was one of the front-runners for the regional premiership by virtue of his position as regional chairman of the ANC, a post to which he was recently unanimously re-elected. He dismissed as "mischievous" reports that Dr Boesak had suffered a setback in his bid to head the western Cape regional government and said the order of appearance on the list did not influence a candidate's chances for the premiership. Mr Kalako said the ANC's western Cape region had invited nominations for the premiership from all its structures and affiliates and would elect a candidate before the movement's national election list conference on January 15. The region's lists of nominees to the National Assembly and the provincial legislature were released at a press conference at the University of the Western Cape [UWC] on Saturday. Dr Boesak's name is 12th on the provincial list and fourth on the list of candidates for the National Assembly. The regional list is headed by Executive Committee member Ms Zou Kota, followed by REC [regional executive committee] colleagues Cameron Dugmore, Vincent Diba, Lerumo Kalako, Johnny Issel, Hilda Ndude, Chris Nissen, Ebrahim Rasool and National Executive Committee member Reggie September. Others nominated for the regional parliament are Dr Boesak's former wife, Dorothy; former ANC western Cape secretary Tony Yengeni; NEC members Dullah Omar, Trevor Manuel and Albie Sachs; ANC-aligned MPs Jan van Eck and Jannie Momberg; Mrs Adelaide Tambo, widow of late ANC Chairman Oliver Tambo; Peninsula Technikon Rector Franklin Sonn and academics Rob Davies and Colin Bundy. Topping the list of nominees for the national assembly is civil rights lawyer and ANC regional spokesman on constitutional affairs Johnny de Lange. His name is followed by that of South African Municipal Workers' Union leader Salie Manie; ANC constitutional negotiator Dullah Omar; Dr Boesak; Mr Yengeni; trade unionist Daniel Oliphant; regional office-bearers Vincent Diba, Lerumo Kalako and Zou Kota and UWC Professor Rob Davies. Other names on the national list are NEC [National Executive Committee] members Kader Asmal, Thozamile Botha and Trevor Manuel; SA Democratic Teachers' Union general secretary Randall van den Heever; ANC MP David Dalling; Mrs Dorothy Boesak and Labour Party MPs Ken Lategan and James Swiegelaar. ANC regional head of information and publicity Bulelani Ngcuka said the ANC had "made every attempt" to inform those nominated. "We have tried our best to contact everyone, but it could be that there are one or two names on the list who have not yet been consulted. There is, however, still an opportunity for people to withdraw their names if they do not wish to be nominees." Mr Kalako said both lists were still subject to adjustment, particularly with regard to the "affirmative action principle" that women should make up one-third of the candidates. The region would also try to ensure that all communities and social sectors, such rural people, were fairly represented in its lists of nominees.
