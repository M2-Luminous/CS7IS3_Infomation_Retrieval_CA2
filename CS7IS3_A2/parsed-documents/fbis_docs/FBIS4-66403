FBIS4-66403 "jpjst016__l94001" JPRS-JST-94-016-L JPRS Science & Technology Japan 29 April 1994 MICROELECTRONICS 64M DRAM 64M DRAM Trends -- Mask Count Reduced To Lower Cost 94FE0096A Tokyo NIKKEI MICRODEVICES in Japanese Nov 93 pp 22-28 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0096A Tokyo NIKKEI MICRODEVICES Japanese CSO [Text] By the end of this year, major foreign and domestic LSI manufacturers are expected to ship samples of 64M DRAM devices in order to give companies a chance to evaluate the electrical characteristics of the chips. Due to a strong insistence on lower cost, domestic makers say they will reverse the trend of using more masks to using less masks in the first generation of 64M chips. LSI manufacturers have narrowed down the types of transistors used. The sample chip is meant to be a "probe chip" that will be used to absorb demand in the marketplace. The word configuration will switch from the x1, x4 configuration used through the first generation of 16M chips to an x8, x16 configuration for the first time, and companies will try to consolidate this even further in the second generation chips. In order to keep producing chips with existing equipment, most of the chips are 200mm[.sup]2[/] or larger in size, or one and one-half times the size of 16M devices. For that reason, the second generation chips might be available as early as 1995, and be 150-160mm[.sup]2[/] in size. A survey of major LSI manufacturers indicates that companies have begun shipping the first full-scale shipments of 64M DRAM devices in order to let users evaluate the electrical characteristics of the chips. Following on the heels of four companies who have already started shipping, another five companies plan to begin shipping by the end of the year.[.sup](1)[/] Including both joint ventures and Korean companies, that figure could quadruple in three years' time. Most manufacturers plan to have their chips out by the first half of 1994. Changing Role The biggest difference between these chips and the 16M DRAM chips is the change from using more DRAM masks to using fewer masks. The first generation of chips is clearly moving toward the role of being a "probe chip" in order to absorb some of the demand in the market. LSI manufacturers have been able to keep the number of masks to around 20, which is the same as the first generation of 4M chips, and by using existing production lines to produce the first generation of probe chips, they have been able to avoid the large investment in new equipment. Therefore, the greater portion of 64M DRAM chips are 200mm[.sup]2[/] or larger in size, or one and one-half times the size of 16M devices. In terms of specifications, instead of the x1, x4 word configuration that were found throughout the first generation of 16M chips, many of the new 64M chips have switched for the first time to not only x4 word configurations, but also x8 and x16 configurations (cf. Table 1). Most manufacturers aim to supply high-speed versions with access times starting initially from 50 ns. There is a dispute among companies over whether to give the chips a synchronous feature in order to achieve faster data transmission. Table 1.

[.sup]*1[/]: Estimate made by Nikkei Microdevices; Hitachi and Texas Instruments refused to make any comments before announcement in December. The technology used by IBM (US)-Siemens AG (Ger) is discussed in more detail starting on page 38. Five More Companies To Ship by Year's End NEC announced in March of this year that it had already shipped samples of the 64M DRAM to users before any other company so that it could give its users the opportunity to evaluate features and performance. At the start of February, it delivered samples of the chip to major users in the United States. One week after that, Samsung Electronics of South Korea also began distributing samples to its users. In the fourth quarter of 1993, IBM (US) and Siemens AG (Germany) also started shipping jointly-developed 64M DRAM devices. Following on the heels of those four companies, three other companies, namely, Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric, and Hyundai Electronics (S. Korea), are planning to start shipping by the end of the year, and there is a strong likelihood, though it might be behind schedule, that Hitachi and Texas Instruments (US) will also start shipping a jointly-developed 64M chip in December. Fujitsu is scheduled to start shipping in the second quarter of 1994 after making a number of design changes. Oki Electric, Gold Star Electronics (S. Korea), and Micron Semiconductor (US) have also made it known that they plan to start shipping by the end of 1994. NEC and Samsung (S. Korea), who are now in the midst of shipping samples, are reported to have confirmed full-bit operations in their chips, which is an indicator as to how far along the chips are in terms of being technically complete. Toshiba, Mitsubishi, Oki Electric, and others are making claims about the level of completion of their chips as well, which are reported to be nearing full-bit operations. Reducing Number of Masks to First Generation 4M DRAM Level In developing the 64M chip, most of the manufacturers including Toshiba, NEC, Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Mitsubishi gave priority to reducing cost. As a result, many indicated the fact that they had reduced the number of masks, which is an indicator of fewer processes used to produce a particular chip, to the same mask count used in the first generation of 4M devices. The mask count prior to this had been on a steady upswing (cf. Figure 2). There were many companies like NEC who said that this was due to the cost of chips being allowed to rise until the 16M generation chips were developed. Most manufacturers like Mitsubishi say they recognize the advantage of stressing performance and containing cost. <graphic> <capt> Figure 2. Reducing Number of Masks to 4M First Generation Level. This is a graph showing the shift in number of masks used by large domestic and foreign DRAM manufacturers. In the 1M generation of DRAM devices, companies turned to CMOS to reduce power, whereas in the 4M generation, they used two-layer aluminum wiring to make the chips faster, and used three-dimensional cells to ensure reliability, and in the 16M generation, increased the number of masks due to the increase in transistor types to make the chips faster. A portion of this information includes estimates made by Nikkei Microdevices.</graphic> Fujitsu reported that its aim in developing the first generation 64M DRAM, which was re-examined in light of such problems, and the second generation of 16M chips, which it developed at the same time, was, needless to say, attaching highest priority to reducing cost. Toshiba said that it had reversed its earlier policy of putting performance first and cost second, and Hitachi also like many others voiced concern over cost. Transistor Types Reduced To Lower Mask Count As a result of fewer transistor types, LSI manufacturers only had to use around 20 masks to produce the 64M chip, which was 20 percent less than that used in the first generation of 16M chips, and the same number used in the first generation of 4M chips. NEC officials said that reducing the types of transistors was the most effective way to cut down on the number of masks. Most domestic manufacturers eliminated the transistors in the 64M DRAM that were used to increase speed in the first generation of 16M devices. Companies have also been turning to ion implantation to control threshold voltage. Another way to reduce the number of masks is by implanting ions in the n[.sup]-[/] region of the nMOS, and compensating for the n[.sup]-[/] created pMOS when building in p[.sup]+[/]. This enables a further reduction of two to four masks. The areas in which transistors have performed poorly were resolved by changing the circuit and array configurations, thereby giving the 64M chip a faster access time than the 16M. This is because chip manufacturers were able to get the chips to work reliably with less of a margin allowed for transistor performance. Mitsubishi and Samsung also reduced the number of masks using a high-energy ion implantation technique. Mitsubishi, which has been using that technology since 16M chips, continued using that technology in 64M devices, achieving a reduction in the number of masks by two compared to if the technology had not been used. Though it has not specified the number of masks used, Samsung decided to start using this technique with the 64M generation of chips as a way of being able to make a 10 percent reduction in the manufacturing costs and number of processes. Though the number of masks remains the same, there are ways to reduce the number of processes including: (a) using tungsten in the wiring, (b) using a doped poly-Si in which impurities are mixed into the film, and (c) an aluminum reflow method. There are a growing number of companies who have adopted the first of these methods. Hitachi applied this method in its 16M devices, and Fujitsu and Oki Electric used it for the first time in the first generation 64M chips. NEC is also looking to use this method in its second generation of 64M chips. The first method, which changes the wiring configuration from a two-layer aluminum to a one-layer aluminum/one-layer tungsten, eliminates the etching process after tungsten is embedded, which is quite costly in terms of equipment. The second method effectively eliminates the P diffusion process. This method can be applied to processes that use poly-Si for bit lines and contacts. This method also seems to be particularly effective in terms of characteristics when poly-Si is embedded for holes. This is because P does not diffuse to the bottom of the holes after being embedded. Mitsubishi, which partially adopted this method in 16M devices, increased use of this process in its 64M chips. Both NEC and Hitachi have this method under study. Samsung has been using the third method (c) since its 4M chips, and is also considering using this method again in its 64M chips. Applications Expected in Servers and Engineering Work Stations The area that gives design specialists the biggest headache is what type of specifications to incorporate in the initial chips. Before a market can be created, a demand must be forecast, and even if the technology has been perfected, it is still hard to create a market. For example, the work that went into promoting the 4M generation of chips even after the bit price was lowered is quite indicative of the market demand in the initial stages for multi-bit versions for PCs. Companies are using the 64M samples as "probe chips" in order to investigate for what systems the chips might be used. For that reason, most companies are using a different strategy than before and, like Mitsubishi, have given the sample chips a diverse range of features and will nail down specific features in later versions of first generation and second generation chips. For example, the areas corresponding to multi-bit configurations are different from the 16M chips in terms of specifications. This is due to the size of the chip, which is 200mm[.sup]2[/], and to the chip's position being changed. Because this chip is not directly linked to a particular use, it was designed, according to NEC, on the condition that it be manufactured with existing equipment and technologies rather than reinvesting in new equipment. The reason behind the chip's position being changed had to do first with the fact that the market, which had been fairly reliable when it came to mainframes, was becoming somewhat unpredictable, and systems such as servers, engineering work stations, and high-performance PCs that would use 64M chips, were becoming more diversified (cf. Figure 3). The first areas in which the 16M chips were used was in memory cards and mid-size computers. In fact, NEC has said that it has already gotten requests from two domestic and two foreign companies who want to use the 64M samples in servers. NEC also reported a strong demand from makers of large 10-gigabyte semiconductor disks who want to use the chips to replace slower hard disks. <graphic> <capt> Figure 3. Uses of 64M DRAM Devices. Immediate uses for the chips include 1G-2G-byte range engineering work stations and servers, and 10G-byte range mainframe computers. In other areas, Mitsubishi believes from the view of packaging that these chips will quickly be put to use in high-end portable electronic information equipment. Data furnished by Mitsubishi Electric.</graphic> Multi-Bit Chips From Outset The specifications of the initial samples show that the word configuration has been widened. Portable data processing equipment requires multi-bit configurations of x16 or more, and engineering work stations and PCs require x8 configurations because of expanded memories. Meanwhile, large computers such as mainframes require x4 configurations. A total of 13 companies have designed their chips with x8 configurations, and eight companies have included x16 configurations. Seven companies, meanwhile, do not have a x1 configuration. The word configurations favored in the first generation of chips are x4, x8, and x16, but this will be narrowed down further in other first and second generation versions.[.sup](2)[/] The area in which there is some debate is over whether the chips should have a synchronous feature. Companies are planning to include this feature in second generation chips, but are divided in terms of the first generation. Fujitsu decided, based on strong requests made inside and outside the company, that this function was essential in engineering work stations, and knowing that it will be late in shipping the chips, has been putting a lot of energy into changing the design. Toshiba and Oki Electric will have this function in later first generation versions. Meanwhile, NEC, Mitsubishi, IBM-Siemens, and Micron Semiconductor plan to offer this function in second generation versions, and for the first generation, plan instead to offer an extended data output feature with an upgraded page mode to do high-speed data transmission. Manufacturers, such as NEC, have decided that an interleave type memory configuration used in high-capacity chips was not necessary initially for the high-performance systems that will adopt the 64M chip. Most of the 64M samples have access times of 50 ns, and cycle times of 90 ns. All companies surveyed reported using a 500 mil wide package. The CBR[.sup](3)[/] method, which emerged as the favored refresh method among users of 16M chips, has emerged in the standard specifications of 64M chips. A major portion of companies are adopting the CBR format for both extended memories and SIMM, and have said that the number of refresh cycles will be decided after consultation with users. The first generation 16M DRAM is between 200-220mm[.sup]2[/] in size, or 1.5 times larger than the first generation 16M chips, thus, all companies are scrambling to develop a second generation chip. NEC says it is planning to start shipping a second generation chip as early as 1995 (cf. Figure 4). The second generation version will be 150-160mm[.sup]2[/] in size, have a design rule between 0.32�-0.30�, and be placed in a 400-mil package. The 16M versions featuring a synchronous function that most companies plan to offer in the second generation of chips will be divided into those with two-bank and four-bank configurations.[.sup](4)[/] <graphic> <capt> Figure 4. More Than 1.5 Times Larger Than 16M DRAM. The 64M chips is more than 200mm[.sup]2[/] in size, which is more than 1.5 times larger than 16M devices. The first generation of chips was manufactured without any new major investment in equipment because companies could use existing production lines to manufacture the chips.</graphic> Footnotes 1. Here, the number of companies participating in a joint development of two companies is counted as two. The four companies that have shipped chips already include NEC-Samsung (S. Korea), and the IBM-Siemens groups. The companies that are planning to ship by December include Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric, and Hyundai Electronics (S. Korea). There is a high probability also that the Hitachi-Texas Instruments group will also ship by December. That brings to nine the total number of companies. Up to the 16M generation of chips, a cooperative relationship existed between Gold Star Electronics and Hitachi in which the former supplied the latter with OEM. The same type of relation existed between Fujitsu and Hyundai Electronics in manufacturing, but it is uncertain at the present time whether that or the other relationships will continue in the 64M generation of chips. 2. There is general negativity among companies when it comes to parity bits such as x9 and x18. This is because it is hard to find any cost advantages. 3. CBR stands for CAS before RAS refresh. 4. The reason that it is separated into a two-bank and four-bank system is because the four-bank system effectively improves the bit rate of the cache memory assuming the load capacity of the system is not more than four times, but there is a tradeoff relationship between the area of the chip and how much money is spent on tests. Going from a two-bank to a four-bank system increases costs by about 5 percent, so NEC and others selected the two-bank system. Fujitsu, meanwhile, which had started with a synchronous feature in the first generation of chips, went with a four-bank configuration due to user demands.
