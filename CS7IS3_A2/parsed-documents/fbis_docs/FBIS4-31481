"Politicians engaged in the process of building democracy and market economy pay great price and cannot expect society to be grateful for this. What is important is the aim, not personal successes," the president said. The Albanian delegation has been visiting Poland at the invitation of the Sejm. During the meeting with Lech Walesa, President of the Albanian People's Assembly Pjeter Arbnori thanked for support offered to Albania by the Polish delegation in the Council of Europe. He recalled that Poland has always had its own opinion at the crucial moments of history, and owing to that it became an example for Albania and other states on the road to reforms. On Wednesday, the Albanian MPs met with the parliamentary floor group of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and representatives of Sejm committees.
