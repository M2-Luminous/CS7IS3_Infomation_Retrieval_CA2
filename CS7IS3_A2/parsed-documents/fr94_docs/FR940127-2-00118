FR940127-2-00118 FR940127-2-00075 [Release No. 34&hyph;33491; File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;93&hyph;10] Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Options Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change Related to Cash-Settled Foreign Currency Options January 19, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on May 26, 1993, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared primarily by OCC. On December 22, 1993, OCC filed an amendment to the proposed rule change. 2 The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from interested persons and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 The amendment was necessary to: (1) correct language in OCC's Rule 2302 to clarify that cash-settled foreign currency options that are in-the-money by any amount will be subject to OCC's automatic exercise procedures; (2) conform the definition of ``expiration date'' in Article XXII, Section 1, E(3) of OCC's By-Laws with amendments filed by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. in File No. SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;93&hyph;10; and (3) make certain typographical corrections to the original filing. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend OCC's By-Laws and Rules to allow OCC to issue, clear, and settle cash-settled foreign currency options such as have been proposed for trading by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc (``PHLX''). 3 3 For a discussion of the PHLX proposal, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32685 (July 7, 1993), 58 FR 41529 [File No. SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;93&hyph;10] (notice of filing of proposed rule change). II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, OCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. OCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend OCC's By-Laws and Rules to accommodate cash-settled foreign currency options such as have been proposed for trading by the PHLX. In general, these amended By-Laws and Rules will apply the same procedures OCC currently uses to clear and settle transactions in existing options to the clearance and settlement of cash-settled foreign currency options. However, unlike OCC's procedures with respect to other foreign currency options, cash-settled foreign currency options will be settled by requiring clearing members to pay to or receive from OCC the amount of U.S. Dollars that reflects the difference between the spot price 4 and the exercise price of the underlying foreign currency. 5 Cash-settled foreign currency options that are in-the-money by any amount on the expiration date will be automatically exercised. Options not automatically exercised will expire unexercised. Clearing members will not be permitted to submit exercise instructions with respect to cash-settled foreign currency options. 4 The term ``spot price'' with respect to an option contract on a foreign currency means the price, in terms of U.S. dollars, quoted by various commercial banks in the interbank foreign exchange market for the sale of a single unit of such foreign currency for immediate delivery, which generally means delivery within two business days following the date on which the terms of such a sale are agreed upon. 5 Currently, all OCC-cleared index options are cash-settled. The procedures proposed for exercise settlement of cash-settled foreign currency options are similar to the procedures for exercise settlement of index options. Pursuant to OCC Rule 1806, index options settle by OCC either paying to or collecting from the exercising or assigned clearing member the difference in U.S. dollars between the exercise price of the index option and the exercise settlement value ( i.e. , the value of the index as reported by the reporting authority designated by the options market where the option is traded). Pursuant to the proposal, the definitions of ``clearing member'' and ``option contract'' in Article I of OCC's Bylaws are amended to add references to cash-settled foreign currency options. The definition of ``exercising clearing member'' is amended to make clear that when used with respect to an option that is subject to an automatic exercise, including cash-settled foreign currency options, the term refers to the clearing member in whose account an option so exercised is carried.
