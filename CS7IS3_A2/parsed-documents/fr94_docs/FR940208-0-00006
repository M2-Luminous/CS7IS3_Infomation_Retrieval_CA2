FR940208-0-00006 FR940208-0-00002 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 16 CFR Part 305 Rule Concerning Disclosures of Energy Consumption and Water Use Information About Certain Home Appliances and Other Products Required Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act AGENCY: Federal Trade Commission. ACTION: Final rule revision. SUMMARY: The Federal Trade Commission's Energy and Water Use Rule requires that Table 1, in §305.9, which sets forth the representative average unit energy costs for five residential energy sources, be revised periodically on the basis of updated information provided by the Department of Energy (``DOE''). This document revises the table to incorporate the latest figures for average unit energy costs as published by DOE in the Federal Register on December 29, 1993. 1 1 58 FR 68901. DATES: The revisions to §305.9(a) and Table 1 are effective February 8, 1994. The mandatory dates for using these revised DOE cost figures are detailed in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section, below. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Mills, Attorney, 202&hyph;326&hyph;3035, Division of Enforcement, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 19, 1979, the Federal Trade Commission issued a final rule, then called the Appliance Labeling Rule (44 FR 66466), in response to a directive in section 324 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (``EPCA''), 42 U.S.C. 6201. 2 The rule requires the disclosure of energy efficiency or cost information on labels and in retail sales catalogs for eight categories of appliances, and mandates that these energy costs or energy efficiency ratings be based on standardized test procedures developed by DOE. The cost information obtained by following the test procedures is derived by using the representative average unit energy costs provided by DOE. Table 1 in §305.9(a) of the rule sets forth the representative average unit energy costs to be used for all requirements of the rule. As stated in §305.9(b), the Table is intended to be revised periodically on the basis of updated information provided by DOE. 2 Since its promulgation, the rule has been amended three times to include new product categories_central air conditioners (52 FR 46888, Dec. 10, 1987), fluorescent lamp ballasts (54 FR 1182, Jan. 12, 1989), and certain plumbing products (58 FR 54955, Oct. 25, 1993). In accordance with a directive in the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;486 (October 24, 1992), the Commission imitated a proceeding to amend the rule to include certain lamp products (58 FR 60147, Nov. 15, 1993). On December 29, 1993, DOE published the most recent figures for representative average unit energy costs. Accordingly, Table 1 is revised to reflect these latest cost figures as set forth below. The dates when use of the figures in revised Table 1 becomes mandatory in calculating cost disclosures for use in reporting, labeling and advertising products covered by the Commission's rule and/or EPCA are as follows: For 1994 Submissions of Data Under §305.8 of the Commission's Rule The new cost figures must be used in all 1994 cost submissions. For convenience, the annual dates for data submission are repeated here: Fluorescent lamp ballasts: March 1 Clothes washers: March 1 Water heaters: May 1 Furnaces: May 1 Room air conditioners: May 1 Dishwashers: June 1 Central air conditioners: July 1 Heat pumps: July 1 Refrigerators: August 1 Refrigerator-freezers: August 1 Freezers: August 1 For Labeling and Advertising of Products Covered by the Commission's Rule Using 1994 submissions of estimated annual costs of operation based on the 1994 DOE cost figures, the staff will determine whether to publish new ranges. Any products for which new ranges are published must be labeled with estimated annual cost figures calculated using the 1994 DOE cost figures. If such new ranges are published, the effective date for labeling new products will be ninety days after publication of the ranges in the Federal Register . Products that have been labeled prior to the effective date of any range modification need not be relabeled. Advertising for such products will also have to be based on the new costs and ranges beginning ninety days after publication of the new ranges in the Federal Register . Energy Usage Representations Respecting Products Covered by EPCA but not by the Commission's Rule Manufacturers of products covered by section 323(c) of EPCA, but not by the Energy and Water Use Rule (clothes dryers, television sets, kitchen ranges and ovens, humidifiers and dehumidifiers, pool heaters and space heaters) must use the 1994 representative average unit costs for energy in all representations beginning May 9, 1994.
