Zasurskiy: "Gaydar Was Right--and Chernomyrdin Also"] [Text] In the opinion of Vladimir Shcherbakov, the first six edicts are not sufficient to evaluate how comprehensively the president approaches economic reform. Vladimir Shcherbakov, president of the Interprivatizatsiya fund, expressing his views on the presidential decrees, commented that the first six indicate movement in the right direction, while the return of two drafts for additional elaboration out of eight that were prepared provides grounds for evaluating the approach to economic reform as a weighed and thoughtful process. It is still too early to speak about how comprehensive they are, as it is necessary to see if only the drafts of the others, of which, as is commonly known, over 100 are currently in preparation. A selective state industrial policy is fundamental to the former deputy prime minister of the USSR. Emphasis must be placed on it, and not on the accelerated bankruptcy of enterprises. The legislative base for bankruptcy is undoubtedly necessary. Bankruptcy was and will continue to be a routine phenomenon in a market economy. The question is what type of policy will be implemented--one with additional limitation of the money supply, which will generate massive bankruptcies of enterprises in a difficult financial position, or with stimulation of individual types of production and enterprises as well as selection of producers in the interest of preserving the domestic economy and the life of the people. A grasp of the essence of what constitutes a selective policy is highly important. The elaboration of such a policy must afford us the possibility of differentiating not individual enterprises, but groups of them, perhaps types of production, those that we need and without which we simply cannot survive--in this case I do not have in mind preferential credits for individual enterprises. We must not have a situation where the appropriate government commission would decide which plant is to get what amount of money. That commission has another task: formulation of the goal, tasks, selection criteria, determination of forms and methods of stimulation, and control to ensure that the money is not spent on wages but on organization of production, purchase of materials, and the like. At present, however, in the view of the former deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, such a policy has not been worked out, and money is being received by lobbyists blackmailing the government with strikes. Shcherbakov asserts: "The government cannot be blamed for the fact that some are able to twist its arm until it crunches, it is only possible to sympathize with it, however it is necessary not to succumb to blackmail. At one time," Shcherbakov continues, "we were unable to hold out: Having given in to the miners, we were compelled to give in to others as well. The consequences of that for the economy are well known." How to conduct a selective policy? For instance, we pick a criterion--vitally important branches. Today that is not the entire Ministry of Railways, but only its enterprises involved directly with organization of traffic on the railroad. It is clear that without it we are nowhere. Then let us declare that it will be operating under special financial conditions. Let us grant it special-purpose credit at a reasonable interest rate, but not in order "to keep its pants up" and cover current expenditures, but for repairs, because if the old tracks used by trains disintegrate completely, there will be an entirely different situation developing in the country. It is the same with oil workers. Issue credit for repair of wells and pipelines, but not for wages. It is not very difficult to ensure that technically. Today money turnover in production equals about 100 days. This means that practically all enterprises are insolvent. Money is the lifeblood of production. That is, if the policy of limiting the money supply is to be continued with a rise in inflation, Vladimir Shcherbakov believes that would be a situation where blood was drained from everyone, one after the other--from those who are not needed in a market economy as well as from those who were forced to give their production for state needs but were not paid, and those without whom we will perish as a sovereign state and people. By way of an example, even if an absurd one, for instance--who in the world would think of turning off electricity in a hospital? At the airport control tower? In our case, however, such cases are not that rare. Simple solutions are deceptive. Neither bankruptcies nor promissory notes are a panacea for the problems faced by the Russian economy. That is, promissory notes can and must promote the resolution of certain tasks with an appropriate legislative support. Just as bankruptcies are important so that enterprises know what may happen to them. But a policy prodding toward bankruptcy is highly unpromising. It is dangerous both in the economic and in the political regard. That is a very heavy social scene in the revival of the economy. It is impossible to get by without that, but it is important not to agitate for the conduct of such policy. If matters develop in the way on which certain members of the government are insisting, then no agreements will rescue us." In the opinion of the former chairman of the State Planning Commission of the USSR, there is another aspect of the problem pertaining to the industrial crisis that can also be resolved only through comprehensive methods--that is, the problem of business in industry. "At present I do not know whether enterprises will ever give me the money or not, and if the state shares even with regard to a few branches, then I will know for certain that the pharmacists will give me the money. The railway workers also. Then I will invest in them and will organize production for them." It is necessary to see the entire system of problems in all of its complexity. When Gaydar started with abrupt moves, he was correct, Shcherbakov believes, and when Chernomyrdin allowed everyone to adapt a little bit and regain their senses, he was also correct. Is Livshits also correct? I do not know who is the real author of the edicts. I can only note that until it becomes clear what edicts will follow the first six, it is impossible to tell whether their author is right.
