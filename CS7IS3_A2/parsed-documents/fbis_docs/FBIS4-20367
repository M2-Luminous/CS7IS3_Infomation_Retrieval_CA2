Legislation on legal supervision is still not sufficiently developed in China, and further explicit clarifications are required as to procedure, methods, and the effects of legal supervision. For instance, the procuratorial organs find it very difficult to straighten out problems in cases involving human relations, cases of favoritism, and imposition of fines instead of criminal punishment. The procuratorial organs merely investigate and give approval for arrest, but do not supervise the execution of the arrest, so that the execution of the arrest order will not be subject to effective supervision. In the supervision of trials, procuratorial organs have no means of supervising cases which have been referred back for further investigation. For instance, in 1992, in the case of 85 percent of the appeals filed by the procuratorate of Jilin Province, the law courts did not convene any sessions to hear the cases. There do not exist, therefore, even the preconditions for procuratorial organs conducting legal supervision of cases of the second instance. In cases of reduction of sentences or release on parole, the procuratorial organs can also only conduct supervision after the fact. A supervisory system for the review of death sentences has not yet been established. Obstacles are also great in the case of crimes that are to be prosecuted only on the petition of the injured party, also in civil litigation, and in administrative proceedings. All these facts adversely affect the conduct of legal supervision by the procuratorial organs. In some places the leadership as well as the judicial organs have confused ideas about the functions and intentions of legal supervision by the procuratorial organs. In some places the leadership regards the procuratorial organs merely as departments that initiates cases or as administrative departments of the government. The position and functions of the procuratorial organs is not yet fully understood, with the result that the procuratorial organs cannot fully exercise their functions. Serious insufficiency of funds budgeted for the prosecution of cases. The insufficiency of funds has all along been an old problem that has never been adequately resolved. In recent years, the problem of insufficient funds for the prosecution of cases has become even more acute. Many big cases could not be investigated because of a shortage of funds. When initiating cases, the basic level procuratorates will generally adopt the method of recovering procedural expenses from out of the confiscated money or materials of the case in question, or will obtain funds from the unit that initiated the case in the first place. Although the superior procuratorates repeatedly tried to stop this procedure, it could not be completely eradicated and has resulted in certain negative consequences. Besides these difficulties, much resistance is encountered by the procuratorial organs in the prosecution of cases of graft and bribery, especially when leading cadres are involved. In some places, party and government leaderships are not sufficiently aware of the dangerous and serious nature of such economic crimes as graft and bribery. There is anxiety that prosecution of such cases could jeopardize the key undertaking of economic construction; action is therefore held up. Some places have gone even so far as to decree that such-and-such must not be investigated and such-and-such must not be reported. Some leading cadres are themselves not clean and afraid that they themselves may be found out if these cases of graft and bribery are investigated. They will therefore use manpower, finance, and material power to make things difficult for the procuratorial organs, and as a consequence some cases cannot be dealt with justly and fairly. Then there is also local protectionism that seriously and adversely affects prosecution of cases according to law. In a small number of places, party and government leaderships, out of considerations for the interests of their local department or local district, ignore party discipline and state law. They use their power to suppress the law, they make their word, rather than the law, count as decisive, and they interfere in the investigation of particular cases that are being pursued by the procuratorial organs. In criminal cases involving so-called "able persons [neng ren 5174 0086]," who in some way have made contributions to the local economy, the local party and government leaderships are afraid that bringing down these "able persons" will cause the enterprises concerned to collapse. They fear that this would then also adversely affect the economic development of the local district, and for this reason they will obstruct prosecution of such cases. In yet another type of situation, the units will not report criminal cases that might have occurred in their units, but will dispose of such cases by somehow "absorbing" them themselves. Their various anxieties are: First, they fear that confiscated money will have to be turned over and will not be returned to them. Some units, especially those that are badly off economically, will rather deal with such cases themselves, because they fear after they transfer the cases to the procuratorial organs, the confiscated money will not be promptly returned to them. Second, they fear that the case may adversely affect their reputation. Third, they fear that they will be "rejected by one negative vote [yi piao fou jue 0001 4384 0694 0414]." In some places, the system has willfully expanded the scope of the "rejection by one negative vote" responsibility system. Regardless of how well the unit may be doing with regard to all other norms, if there happens only one security, criminal, or other case, each one will result in "rejection by one negative vote," when even welfare items accrued to cadres, staff, and workers will be cancelled. As soon as that kind of a problem arises in a unit, they will therefore always raise obstructions in every way possible and settle the matter in some other, perfunctory way.
