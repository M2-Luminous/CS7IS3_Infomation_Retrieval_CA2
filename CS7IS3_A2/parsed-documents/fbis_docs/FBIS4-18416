Following a long period of sickly timidity--relations with Saddam Husayn are bad memories on the Right and on the Left--Paris has awakened, no doubt because it noticed the Baghdad comings and goings of companies from the United States, Japan and other countries. The first sign came in mid-October 1993. Always enamored of foreign policy, [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua decided to stop discreet contacts. He organized--and [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur did not object--the Paris visit of Tariq `Aziz, deputy prime minister of Iraq. A police team piloted him, protected him, and even took him to Pasqua. As a result, the Foreign Ministry, where the interior minister's incursions into official or secret diplomacy are not appreciated, decided that overture must be the game to play. All the more so since the Elysee [president's office] and the Matignon [prime minister's office] approved of the invitation transmitted by the Elf and Total oil companies to a delegation of Iraqi oilmen. On 26 February of this year, these Iraqi experts, with whom the two French companies have been discreetly negotiating the exploitation of two huge oil deposits in the Majnun islands and in `Nahr Umar for the past three years, arrived in Paris. Insisting that the meetings are symbolic, Jean-Bernard Merimee often meets with his UN counterpart, the Iraqi Nizar Hamdun. Finally, on 4 March, a Saddam emissary, Riad al-Qaysi, was officially received at the Foreign Ministry, and an Iraqi parliamentary delegation is slated in principle to visit Paris in a few weeks. The virtuous explanation: the French Government is interpreting UN resolutions "juridically" and wants the embargo against Iraq be lifted soon, an initiative Washington opposes. The U.S. position is cynical and makes for good policy. A high official of an Iraqi ministry summarized it as follows to a French businessman: "The Americans are telling us: open your markets to us, sign contracts with us and our oilmen, and the embargo will be lifted." For a long time now, Baghdad has become a salon where American is spoken. Chevron and Occidental Petroleum are interested in the same oil "sponges" as Elf and Total. Bechtel is interested in petroleum engineering, ATT is eyeing Iraqi telephones--to Alcatel's irritation--and in the automobile sector, Chrysler is poised to enter the race. Iraq is not the only battlefield. In Saudi Arabia, the Americans are glorifying their support for the Bosnian Muslims and Boeing is ahead of Airbus--Clinton made a point of announcing it personally!--even if the contract was supposed to be shared. The same is happening in Kuwait and Abu Dhabi, where Washington is pressuring the emir to reduce the order for 390 Leclerc tanks and purchase Apache helicopters rather than the French Super-Pumas or Tigers. This is a generalized offensive, and everything is done to discredit the competition. Hence the attempt by French intelligence to monitor the commercial field and to identify French and other "friends" of the Americans in these complicated games. According to French intelligence, "what the Americans want is for the only arms industry offering a complete range of materiel that they do not control to disappear." And, if necessary, prices are lowered. In Pakistan, American F-16's are offered for $10 million less than the Mirage 2OOO-5's, and the F-18's for $15 million less in Malaysia. Warlike consumers will not complain.
