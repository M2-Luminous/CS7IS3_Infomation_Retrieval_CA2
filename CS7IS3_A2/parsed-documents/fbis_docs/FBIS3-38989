Completely overshadowed by the negotiations on EU membership, the EFTA countries and the European Commission have now reached agreement on the big package of approximately 400 EU directives that will become part of the EEA agreement. The so-called EEA-II agreement can now be submitted to the EU and EFTA countries for final approval before it goes into effect, probably on 1 July of this year. "We feel very relieved," Foreign Ministry Deputy Secretary Per Ludvig Magnus told AFTENPOSTEN. He stressed that the commission and EFTA now have the final political framework for EEA-II ready, but that nothing will be settled until the countries have debated the matter. The supplementary package must receive final approval from the EEA Committee on 8 March before it is ratified by the European Parliament and the national assemblies in the EFTA countries. EEA-II consists of all the new directives the EU has adopted between 1 August 1991 and the end of this year. The EFTA countries will not really be able to reap the benefits of the EEA agreement until this package has received final approval, the EFTA pointed out. Norway has been particularly concerned with shipping and the rules on harmonizing standards for plant and animal health. EEA-II also, however, involves free market access for large parts of the service sector, transportation, and mutual approval of qualifications and job training certificates for nonacademic occupations. Norway and the EU have still not resolved the remaining problems connected with transporting fish and antidumping, while Austria lacks agreement on the transit of heavy vehicles. Timetable Having a complete EEA agreement in place appears increasingly important as a result of new signals that the EU membership negotiations will probably take longer than planned. Hans van den Broek, the European Commission's foreign affairs commissioner, has now said openly that the European Parliament cannot count on being presented with the full text of the agreement with the applicant countries by 1 March. He hopes the parliament will agree to begin its deliberations on the basis of a general summary of the results of the negotiations so that the finished texts can come at a later date. The European Parliament must approve the agreement with applicant countries by 4 May at the latest. If this deadline is not met, the debate will not take place before fall with the result that new members cannot be accepted before the summer of 1995 at the earliest.
