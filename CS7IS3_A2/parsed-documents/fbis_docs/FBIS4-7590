"The talks we had in Minsk covered all the aspects of the Yugoslav crisis, primarily the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina," Jovanovic told Radio Belgrade upon his return from the first official visit to Belarus since it became independent. "Both sides underscored identical interests that the crisis in the space of former Yugoslavia end as soon as possible, that Yugoslavia recover its legitimate rights in international relations," Jovanovic set out. Speaking About the talks in Moscow, which he visited earlier, Jovanovic said that he had agreed with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev that developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina were marked by positive changes, but that there were still serious situations which made it imperative for both countries to be very active and to collaborate even more closely. It was underscored that Russia had played an important positive role in the resolving of recent crisis situations, but that it can have an even more active role in removing the obstacles to peace, of which the biggest is the continued maintenance of the sanctions against Yugoslavia, Jovanovic said.
