If the Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave leadership does not claim responsibility for the attack, once more we see a manipulation of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] itself, which on the eve of the arrival of U.S. congressmen in Angola, intends to create facts. In this way on 11 December 1993 it attempted the life of the UNITA president. Those who do not know the MPLA and prop it up, will reap a tempest. MPLA is a liar. 3. The UNITA leadership is committed to finding viable and definitive solutions for the Angolan conflict through talks which are scheduled to resume in Lusaka on 5 January. [Issued] Huambo, Angola, 3 January, Cabinet of the Chief of General Staff. [Signed] Director, Brigadier (Elidio Paulo Sachiambo).
