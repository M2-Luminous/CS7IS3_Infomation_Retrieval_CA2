It is well known that an aggressive attack is the best defense. Well. The IMF has announced in its attacking style that it was not going to release the second part of its long-promised loan to Russia. The first $1.5 billion was given to us on fairly beneficial terms as early as last summer. It was expected that after a pause, approximately by January 1994, the Russians will get the remaining half as well. U.S. Vice President Albert Gore added fuel to the fire when he took international experts to task while in Moscow for their short-sighted rigidity in imposing the IMF's economic recipes on the Kremlin. It seemed that the IMF had no other choice given that the United States itself holds a dominant position in the fund. But the fund men have shown their mettle. They continue to set those same conditions for carrying out reform by the Russian authorities. As if there were no fear following the breakthrough of V.V. Zh. [Vladimir Zhirinovskiy] and his ilk. The IMF is not going to compromise its principles in an apparent belief that there are enduring economic values. Fund experts are not content with the Russian Government's commitment to subsidize staple foodstuffs and energy resources. This is why the money will not come to Russia until it fulfills the established standards for putting brakes on inflation and cutting the budget deficit. Our official economists have repeatedly promised yet more budget "breakthroughs" in the past few months and cheered those who so wished with optimistic figures about decreasing inflation. Apparently, neither Fedorov nor Shokhin were taken at their word as the fund preferred to continue to exert pressure. It is another matter that the fund may come under renewed American pressure following Clinton's visit. The Yankees account for the bulk of contributions to the IMF budget and are inclined to make the fund the main channel for infusing at least some Western assistance into Russia. Hence, even the IMF's professed resolve looks as if it were a direct threat to Clinton's course toward propping up Russia's volatile democracy. So, Washington and the IMF may reach a gentleman's agreement in the near future -- unfortunately, delays may amount to a few months -- whereby U.S. officials will no longer question the wisdom of fund experts (at least in public), and the IMF will finally agree to release the remaining part of the $3-billion loan to us.
