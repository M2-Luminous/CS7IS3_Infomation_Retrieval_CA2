The delegation includes MP's of the Social Democratic Populist Party, the Welfare Party, the True Path Party and the Motherland Party. "This is the first visit of a head of the Turkish Parliament in the last 20 years and it is an indication of good neighbourly relations," Aleksandur Yordanov, chairman of the Bulgarian National Assembly, said welcoming the Turkish guests. Late in the afternoon, the Turkish MP's conferred with Mr. Yordanov. "We share similar views on all issues with the exception of the commitment of Turkish troops to the UN peace-keeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina," Mr. Cindoruk said after the meeting. According to him, it is not a case of differences of opinion but rather of the interpretations of the United Nations' decision. "We respect the Bulgarian position (on non-involvement of the Balkan countries in the Yugoconflict)," the president of the Turkish Parliament said. "The blue helmets going to Bosnia are not Turkish troops but troops of the United Nations," Mr. Cindoruk argues. According to the chairman of the Bulgarian Parliament Aleksandur Yordanov, instead of resolving the problem, the presence of Turkish blue helmets in Bosnia and Herzegovina would cause further escalation of the tensions based on historical experience in this region. "Both Bulgaria and Turkey see the promotion of their commercial and economic relations mainly within Black Sea Economic Cooperation, together with other countries in the region like Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Greece," Mr. Yordanov said after the meeting. He explained Bulgaria's stand on Turkey's active efforts to accelerate the formation of a parliamentary assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation. "Bulgaria believes such a parliamentary body could only be instituted on the basis of a well-developed economic cooperation," Mr. Yordanov said. According to him, there are some other forums for parliamentary contacts, like the Council of Europe and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Mr. Cindoruk sees no obstacles to the development of Bulgarian-Turkish economic relations. Aleksandur Yordanov raised with his Turkish counterpart the problem about Bulgarian immovable property in Istanbul: The Bulgarian Church, hospital and school. Mr. Cindoruk conferred today with Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. They agreed that bilateral relations are making positive progress and discussed the possibilities for their further promotion in various fields, the Foreign Ministry press centre said. Mr. Cindoruk and Mr. Daskalov were unanimous about the need to strengthen Balkan stability by peaceful means. Black Sea Economic Cooperation was also discussed during the meeting.
