FR941202-2-00027 FR941202-2-00012 [I.D. 112394C] Endangered Species; Permits AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Issuance of Modification 3 to Scientific Research Permit 818 (P211C). On September 8, 1994, an application was filed by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) for a Modification to their scientific research Permit 818. ODFW requested an increase in the number of their authorized take of endangered Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ), for the period 1994&hyph;95 only, as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217-222). ODFW requested an increase in the take of listed fish, because an unexpectedly high production of juveniles in 1994, partially attributed to recent progeny production from listed Rapid River Hatchery adults passed above the hatchery to spawn, is resulting in greater capture numbers and associated indirect mortality. The juvenile salmon's larger than expected escapement in the spring of 1995 allows ODFW to increase the sample size for their research. Notice is hereby given that on November 16, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the ESA, NMFS issued Modification 3 to Permit 818 for the above taking, subject to certain conditions set forth therein. Issuance of this permit, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that such permit: (1) Was applied for in good faith; (2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is the subject of this permit; (3) is consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA. This permit was also issued in accordance with and is subject to parts 217-222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits. The application, permit, and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons in the following offices, by appointment: Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, NOAA, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910&hyph;3226 (301&hyph;713&hyph;1401); and Environmental and Technical Services Division, NMFS, NOAA, 525 North East Oregon St., Suite 500, Portland, OR 97232 (503-230-5400). Dated: November 29, 1994. Patricia A. Montanio, Acting Deputy Director, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service.
