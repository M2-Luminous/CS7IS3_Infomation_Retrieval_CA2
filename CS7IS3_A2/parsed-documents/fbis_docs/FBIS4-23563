Addressing the 60th ordinary session of the OAU Council of Ministers in Tunis yesterday, the honorable minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Molapo Qhobela, said he hoped that the member states would now be in a position to concentrate better on their financial obligations to the regular budget of the OAU. Mr. Qhobela welcomed South Africa, which was formally admitted as the 53rd member of the OAU at the Council of Ministers' meeting. One of the main battles of the OAU for decades, since its founding in 1963, was to dismantle apartheid. The minister said the admission of South Africa, whose tenacious struggle for freedom and democracy commanded universal recognition, brought a particular kind of joy to Lesotho, which is South Africa's closest neighbor. Commenting on the report of the OAU secretary general, Dr. Salim Achmed Salim, on the organization's activities since the last summit of heads of state and government in Cairo last year, Mr. Qhobela said commendable progress had been made by the organization over the past year. In particular, the minister applauded the work achieved in the areas of management, of peaceful transitional to democratic rule, economic integration, as well as work on conflict resolution among African countries. Mr. Qhobela recalled with gratitude the contribution made by the OAU towards resolving, through peaceful means, the crisis situation that resulted from the confrontation between the two warring factions in the Lesotho armed forces earlier this year.
