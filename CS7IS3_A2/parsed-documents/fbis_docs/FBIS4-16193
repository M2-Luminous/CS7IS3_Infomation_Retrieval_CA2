Speaking about the goals of Palestinian President 'Arafat's trip to the Russian capital, the ambassador said that this would be his first visit to the Russian Federation. In the course of talks with Russian officials, 'Arafat will discuss the deadlines for the establishment of Palestinian autonomy and for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from territories where Palestinian self-government is to be proclaimed. He also said that 'Arafat had addressed a message to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The document calls on Russia to exert influence on Israel in order to make it fulfil the terms of the "Gaza-Jericho-First" agreement, in accordance with which Palestinian self-government is to be established in the Gaza Strip and in the area around Jericho (the Western Bank). The second purpose of the visit is to discuss bilateral relations in the political and economic spheres. A Russo-Palestinian agreement on cooperation in these spheres is expected to be concluded. Asked what the Palestinian leadership expected from Russia in the process of the Mideast settlement, Barakat said: Russia's role is clear. It is a member of the U.N. Security Council and co-chairman of the Madrid peace conference, and one of the initiators of the "Gaza-Jericho-First" agreement, signed in Washington last year. In my opinion, Russia will play an important role in the further promotion of the settlement process at the stage when it helped, together with the Palestine side, to break the deadlock in this process. The ambassador expressed the hope that Russia, which is a great country with a huge potential, would help Palestine to estabish its national statehood. Touching on problems, interfering with the early fulfilment of the Palestine-Israeli "Gaza-Jericho-First" agreement, the ambassador said that representatives of the two sides were now discussing in Cairo the details of its implementation, linked with the Israeli withdrawal from the territories that are to be transferred to Palestinian self-government, with the security measures that are to be taken there, and also with the transfer of powers to the Palestinian national authorities after the withdrawal of the Israeli Army. He noted that Israel was trying to misinterpret the formulations of the agreement at the Cairo talks. "Instead of deciding how Israel is to withdraw from those territories, the talks are again being focused on individual provisions of the agreement," the Palestinian ambassador noted. "We shall continue the negotiations without renouncing our vision of autonomy, which will eventually develop into a Palestinian state," he added.
