The Foreign Ministry warned that if state security is violated, the authorities will try to stop these actions, which are considered "antidemocratic" and which have sometimes been carried out in a "veiled" manner and "brazenly blatant" in others. In a communique issued this evening, the Foreign Ministry stated that the alleged interference of the media and international envoys is part of an "international conspiracy to unite Haiti and Santo Domingo." The document, signed by Foreign Minister Juan Aristides Taveras, added that the actions carried out during and after the electoral process by the media and international observers "is definitely unacceptable." In an interview with the U.S. network Telemundo, Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer said the reports of fraud issued by the opposition do not alter the social peace that prevails in Santo Domingo after the general elections. "I believe this is an international plot rather than a result of Pena Gomez' claims; this has something to do with the Haitian problem, and it is the old idea of integrating the two countries," the 87-year-old Balaguer said. On Thursday [19 May], the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) began to gather the necessary evidence to prove the alleged fraud perpetrated in Monday's general elections. Social Democrat Francisco Pena Gomez ordered his lawyers to prepare the corresponding writs and lists, with names and voters numbers, of party members who were not able to vote in different provinces. Pena Gomez said the complete set of documents will be delivered to the Central Electoral Board (JCE) and "to the world as proof of the colossal fraud perpetrated against us."
