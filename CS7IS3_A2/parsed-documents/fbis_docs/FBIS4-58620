At present, the chances for its implementation are remote, and one cannot even think about it. A practical solution to the Kashmir dispute would be to recognize the Line of Control as the international border. Addressing a seminar at the Asia Society on Indo-U.S. ties and ways to improve them, Lee Hamilton, who is regarded as an influential and powerful personality in Washington, made the above statement. Although the latest salvo fired by Lee Hamilton is totally against and in contrast to the American government's stance on Kashmir, it is not difficult to assess the policies of the most powerful group of American legislators, which they want to adopt in the subcontinent in future. The Indian lobby has been exerting pressure on this group for a long time. Lee Hamilton's statement on the plebiscite in Kashmir endorses Indian policy. In politics, the so-called elections, that made the late Shaykh Abdullah the puppet chief minister of the occupied valley, are described as a plebiscite. First, these elections were not held under the supervision of the United Nations but under the Indian Government. Secondly, Shaykh Abdullah also realized his follies later for which he had to undergo an imprisonment of 14 years. Lee Hamilton's point of view that the United Nations adopted the resolution on Kashmir at a time when India itself took the issue to the Security Council and pleaded for intervention does not hold good here. At that time also, the freedom fighters were continuing their struggle for independence, and there is no change in the situation now even after almost 50 years. Despite the stepped up Indian atrocities, the Kashmir freedom fighters are continuing their movement. There is no change in India's inclination, either. Therefore, terming those resolutions obsolete now is totally outrageous. In South Africa, the minority whites ruled the local black population for three and half years [sentence as published]. In spite of that, the nations of the world did not accept it as a rightful government. As a result, not only the racist policies came to an end, but the African National Congress led by Nelson Mandela has also won a clear majority in the recently held free and fair elections there. If this principle of rejecting UN resolutions as obsolete is accepted, every aggressor country will try to keep the UN Resolutions under suspension until they become obsolete and become a thing of the past. As far as the matter of recognizing the Line of Control as a permanent border is concerned, if the people of Kashmir were willing to endorse it, what was the need for them to continue the freedom struggle for such a long time, endure the Indian atrocities, and sacrifice their lives and property as well as dignity and honor? They did not tolerate the injustice for 45 years to let India occupy Kashmir after reckoning the existing Line of Control as the international border. The pleas made in favor of the laws of jungle by the distinguished politicians and scholars of the greatest human rights champion, the United States, in this era of liberty may only mean that wherever they want, they impose their ideology for personal gains. If the United States has decided not to grant the right of self-determination to the Kashmiri people, it should not resort to lousy arguments and should overtly state that India is right and all other countries are liars. The authorities and the politicians in the United States have made India the regional don of South Asia and are bent upon denying the right of self-determination to the Kashmiris and making all the countries of the region, including Pakistan, the scion states of India. Therefore, this matter warrants a moment of thought from our government, politicians, and Kashmiri leaders. It is not only imperative on their part to intensify their campaign at global level, but the government also should make its lobby strong and effective in the United States.
