But he did not rule out the possibility of meeting with President Li Teng-hui. He said: "I don't know whether I will meet him or not. Even if there is a meeting, it will not be an official one. I think that it is acceptable if one wants to have a private meeting with an old friend." He said that President Li Teng-hui's visit to Thailand is simply a vacation trip which has nothing to do with the Thai Government. Such a visit will not undermine Thai-Chinese relations. He said that Thailand upheld the policy of having political dialogue with Beijing only, and not Taiwan. Thailand only has economic relations with Taiwan, which includes investment, labor, and technology exchanges. [passage omitted]
