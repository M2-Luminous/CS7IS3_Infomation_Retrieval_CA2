Mr. President, I would like to have a human reaction on the part of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a political assessment. How does it feel to leave a creature, in whose gestation, birth, growth, and development you had a primary role, now that that creature has learned how to walk. [Salinas] The most important thing is for initiatives to become institutions. For the first time in history, in fact, all the chiefs of state and government of the Ibero-American nations met in 1991 in Guadalajara; this served as a formidable backdrop. The residents of that city showed their generosity, enthusiasm, and hospitality and served as an exceptional framework for that first Ibero-American summit. For me it is truly encouraging that what emerged first as an idea, as a mere proposal, later became in Guadalajara this Ibero-American initiative, confirming that Mexico does not forget its roots when it envisions the future. [Cortes] A document, which all the participants at the Cartagena de Indias summit signed, recognizes the work of Mexico and the work of Carlos Salinas de Gortari in being capable of convoking what has turned out to be a reality, which someone five years ago would have said was impossible to achieve. The mere gathering of diverse personalities -- often showing unnoticeable differences and other times a marked contrast -- sitting down at the same table is a triumph. Specifically, however, what were the achievements of the previous three summits and this one in Cartagena de Indias in particular? [Salinas] The specific agreements are twofold. The first is that it was confirmed that a state of pluralism in the representation of chiefs of state and government at this Ibero-American summit could exist and still yield common goals. In other words, common purposes can be built amid diversity. I have always believed in pluralism. I also believe that diversity can be transformed into a similar purpose to achieve better living standards for our peoples. This was demonstrated in the Ibero-American summit in Guadalajara and in subsequent summits: the one in Madrid in 1992, the one in Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, in 1993, and this one in Cartagena de Indias in 1994. This is the first concrete result. Political dialogue within the framework of pluralism permits achieving common objectives. The second concrete result is that, through this framework of achieving consensus and dialogue, which have marked the Ibero-American Summit, we have managed to secure concrete initiatives. This has resulted in the opening of bigger markets and the possibility of selling more of our products and increasing trade and has meant the creation of more jobs and more opportunities for more Mexicans. [Cortes] Mr. President, all of those who have been sitting around that table during these two days agree on the fundamentals. They agree on the necessity of free trade, cooperation, understanding, exchanges, rapprochement, and cordiality. When one reaches a thorny topic, as is the Cuban political system, then not everybody has similar views. Would you say, as some observers have said, that this Ibero-American community, although it sits at the same table, is divided? [Salinas] I would say that we never sought uniformity. What we sought, I repeat, recognizing the pluralism of systems in the region, was to find common points of agreement. The results show that it is possible to find similar goals, despite the diversities and differences in the political systems of the region. If there is respect and recognition of the existing pluralism -- we have demonstrated they exist -- one can reach such consensus. We never intended to have any country similar to another or to be a clone of another system. No, recognizing the differences, we wished to stress that we have common roots and similar desires. [Cortes] Finally, Mr. President, are you saddened by the fact that you will not continue to attend these meetings? [Salinas] Well, the meetings will continue to be held as part of their institutional structure. I must tell you that I am leaving very animated by these meetings. I am stimulated by the existing recognition of our Mexico. It is important to underscore this, because in recent months we have experienced difficult times, tragic and sad moments. Despite this, however, there is broad recognition internationally of what Mexico has constructed with great effort in recent years. Without failing to recognize the challenges and problems that we face, we can count on the fact that there is recognition of our work and of Mexican realities, which are many and varied in different fields. That is truly encouraging. [Cortes] Don Carlos, thank you very much.
