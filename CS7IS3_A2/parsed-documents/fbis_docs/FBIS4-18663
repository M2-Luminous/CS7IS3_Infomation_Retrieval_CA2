Recently, more signs than "bang" and "whoom" have demonstrated that the Bundeswehr is underfinanced. The structure, consisting of size, assignment, and funds, is now breaking up. The long-term investment plan for the army, designed for the 15 years up to the year 2007, has now been cut by 24 billion German marks [DM] (of DM56 billion). This makes impossible not only the renewal of some of the equipment, but also the procurement of entirely new weapons systems. The cuts affect the navy and the air force in a similar way. The defense budget has now been cut in the last three years. In February of this year, it was reduced once more by DM1.25 billion. The annual investment and procurement quota used to stand at 27-29 percent in the past. After the cuts of 1992-1994, is has now plummeted to about 20 percent. At the level of the army, the renewal rate was even halved. After DM5.6 billion (1990), only DM2.4 billion have been made available this year for procurement and the modernization of facilities (barracks). No Experience in Use of Major Items of Equipment Right now there is already a appalling lack of funds for exercises on training grounds: no money for rail transport, practice ammunition, gasoline, maintenance and spare parts, and no money for keeping conscripts as volunteers after their compulsory service and for exercise days for reservists. Worst hit are units that have to use major items of equipment, that is to say tank units, artillery, army aviation units, engineers. Training in such units requires experience in moving such large equipment most of all. As far as engineers are concerned, funds have been cut for maintaining their construction machinery in civilian workshops. When a large part of the machinery can now no longer be maintained and has to be put out of service and people can be trained only with the help of the remaining machinery, then training has to be reduced. Engineers are still acquiring the licenses necessary for operating such machines, but they no longer acquire the experience for safe handling. The effects can be easily foreseen: The personal risk to the soldiers and the rate of damage to machines as a result of operating mistakes will increase. An absolute ban is currently in force on the building of temporary bridges to prevent certain components from wearing away, as they can only be replaced in two years. In the army aviation units, the number of flying hours for liaison helicopters has been cut by more than half, from 62,700 flying hours in 1987 to 27,800 in 1994, and for transport helicopters by 10 percent (from 55,650 to 49,800 hours). This is making it more difficult for the commanders of the major units to supervise their troops in garrisons that are dispersed over a larger area during practices. The safety of the aviation services is also affected if it is no longer possible to keep a sufficient number of pilots adequately trained. In talks with commanders of the 21st Tank Brigade (Augustdorf) and the 1st Armored Infantry Brigade, with many of their battalion commanders, heads of company and batteries, one can learn of the distress that is now prevailing in the army, an impression that is shared by most of them. The "crisis reaction forces" (KRK) that can be quickly mobilized are slightly better off than the "main defense forces" (HVK). The 21st Tank Brigade of Augustdorf belongs to the first category, the 1st Armored Infantry Brigade (Hildesheim) to the second. The budget item that is most important for the combat training of forces is funding for staying at training areas. This includes mainly practice ammunition, the cost of the rail transport of heavy arms, and the per diem allowance for the soldiers, referred to as "bush money" in the military jargon. The 21st Tank Brigade was allotted DM1.06 billion in "bush money" in 1992, while DM2.3 billion was provided for the rail transport of tracked vehicles to Bergen-Hohne. The rail transport of a single tank company on this track stands at DM130,000. So the funds only allow one transport of tanks, armored vehicles, and mortars for 15 companies and batteries. These funds permit two practices a year on the training area if one unit moves its tracked vehicles by rail and another takes them over at the training area and returns them to barracks at the end of the practice. KRK units are allowed up to 30 days of practice a year, while HVK units can have no more than 25 now. Taking into account the time for shifting everything to the training areas and returning, the cancellation of practices involving heavy ammunition at weekends, and the cleaning of vehicles, only about 25 days are actually left for the KRK forces and 20 for the HVK units. In the past, 30 days on the training area were regarded as the minimum for training, while now it is the maximum. Combat forces used to practice by the battalion, while now they only do so only in companies, and, in practice, only at the level of platoons, because one part of the company always has to act as the enemy. Thus, the individual soldier hardly ever experiences his own company as a combat unit, let alone the entire battalion. In the past, there were 64 rounds of large-caliber practice ammunition for each gun barrel per year for combat tanks and artillery. Three years ago this was reduced to 44 units. Now it is only 30. Practicing with heavy mortars at the training area but then only being able to fire a maximum of two shots on a long day of training is demoralizing for the soldiers. "What," the gunner asks his commander, and the commander the battery head, "is the point of going to all the trouble of transferring everything to the training area, putting up the mortars, adjusting them, continually repeating identical aiming exercises with the gun or in the fire direction center -- what is the good of all the changes in position, when a single shot should be the `reward' of a whole day on the terrain?" Soldiers must -- at least once, as the climax of their combat training -- see actual shooting and be able to hear the noise. They must be able to experience what they can do with their weapons and what effect these can have in a unit, also together with other arms. One does not have to describe that as "weapon proud." Yet, soldiers need trust and confidence in their own equipment and their own unit as a group and community to survive. They want to be challenged, but they also want to learn that they can do what they are asked to. It is such stuff that the troop's "morale" is made off. The cuts are undermining it. Night operations training no longer exists in the army because there is hardly any pyrotechnical ammunition for light signals and the lighting of the combat area. One signal cartridge costs about DM2.30 -- but money is short. The same applies to low-altitude air defense at the level of all forces. In almost all special training, individual elements that do not belong to the essence of the training of the individual unit have to be left out. Commanders say that the main targets of training of recruits are still being achieved, yet the instructors disagree, and say that the army's resources were being drained. Simulators help save training costs. Marksmanship training on the simulator in front of moving images on video films with combat noises is effective to a certain extent, because any decision or action taken by the soldiers is documented and can be discussed immediately afterwards. The objective of tank firing exercises and combat training is to recognize the enemy at an early stage, to fight him within 10 seconds, and to achieve an average score of 90 percent. Practice is everything. The first shot must count, and do so quickly, because otherwise the enemy is faster. Training on the simulator helps to save ammunition, gasoline, and wear and tear. Yet, it remains a solitary video game in a cell and cannot replace being in a real vehicle on the training area, the frictions and the experience of cooperation with others. It all boils down to the following: Training protects the soldier, training is the superior's obligation. Yet the ultimate superiors of the soldiers sit in parliament and do not see the consequences of restricted training. Borrowing Is Inevitable To have heavy arms such as tanks and mortars on training areas and to have them used by several units to save transport costs makes sense. On the tank firing range at Castlemartin in Wales and on the Shilo training ground in Canada this is an old tradition. Yet it requires a maintenance unit on location as well as logistical organization. Still, at home, it would probably be more expensive to keep all kinds of equipment in larger numbers and in all versions (for example three series of "Marder" combat vehicles) and the necessary repair units permanently on the exercise areas. On domestic grounds it is cheaper to have the equipment of one unit subsequently used by only one other unit of the same battalion and then returned. Yet, since this practice was introduced, the rate of damage has significantly increased. After all, nobody takes as much care of what belongs to others -- the familiar weakness of socialism. No vehicle is as perfectly maintained as one's own. If a soldier returns another's tank after the practice something will "certainly" be damaged. (After a few days on the training area something will always be damaged.) The damage caused by someone else to "his" equipment would "certainly" not have happened to him. It upsets him and cannot be ignored. The forced borrowing of large items of equipment causes exceptional frustration among the troops, and that is something that one hears again and again from every sergeant. It does indeed matter whether a vehicle is being driven below full capacity by someone who knows its "quirks" or by someone else who either cannot use its true potential (the conclusion is that the equipment "is not up to much" or causes damage (then the conclusion is that the weapons system is not up to anything). Borrowing undermines responsibility for and confidence in equipment. Economizing on transportation costs markedly more than maintenance. Funds for maintenance have also been reduced. In the past, to economize, the Bundeswehr gave up a maintenance service of its own. In its origins, the Bundeswehr is no expeditionary force and has a network of civilian bases in its own country. Large repairs to normal commercial vehicles are awarded to civilian firms. Funds for such repairs in particular have become scarce, which is, for example, the case at the 12th Armored Infantry Battalion in Osterrode am Harz. The commander has requested DM80,000 for maintenance in 1994. It is assumed that DM55,000 will be approved, that is, 30 percent less. However, in the first quarter of this year, he already had to spend DM48,000, which includes bills from December of last year. Other units have mentioned similar figures. One can predict, without taking any risks, that in the second quarter, or in the third quarter at the latest, the civilian maintenance of military vehicles will collapse. At the Technical Supervisory Association, certificates have been denied and permits withdrawn. The demand for repair work will not disappear, but increase with each quarter. In addition, there will also be damage resulting from the fact that equipment is not used. Personnel is the most important thing, however. The Bundeswehr finally has a corps of noncommissioned officers that one can only wish for. Almost every company now has a second lieutenant as was envisaged. The first sergeants, who command third and fourth platoons are masters of their job after years of advancement and experience. One sees that in the respect with which they are treated by officers and in the manner in which sergeants speak to officers. The conduct is strikingly open and friendly, although one does not get the impression that this is so at the expense of discipline. On the contrary, in relation to "internal leadership," it has probably never been so good before. Commanders talk about "high motivation." Now in particular, however, they are being denied the possibility of taking on men performing national service who have discovered the Bundeswehr as a profession as longer-serving soldiers, either because vacancies to be filled by promotion or funds for future noncommissioned officers have been frozen, or because currently, every battalion has a three-month period during which men liable for military service cannot be taken on as a result of insufficient funds and thus companies remain "empty" for a three-month period. At the end of the year then, there is a shortage of noncommissioned officers or specialists, for example, drivers for vehicles transporting fuel and ammunition and mine-clearing vehicles. The training lasts about 10 months. If men cannot then serve longer and achieve appropriate promotion, they are only available for the remaining two months of the basic military service period, and that is a poor investment. If that remains the case for several quarters, then units will experience substantial deficiencies. Basic Facilities Are Being Affected In the meantime, the economy measures have greatly exceeded a healthy level of reducing resources. Basic facilities are being affected. The infrastructure at bases is not being renewed (kitchens, laundries). Demand will not disappear, but will pile up. The Bundeswehr can live with temporary difficulties for a time, assuming that the gaps that emerge now will be filled later. "We will survive. We will still achieve training objectives. The Bundeswehr can survive a lot. We will try to see this winter through." That is how the Lieutenant Colonel Bentler, the commander of the 12th battalion describes the situation in his unit. "We will try to see this winter through." But it will only be possible to see this winter through if it will be spring in a few months time. That is the tacit condition for the Bundeswehr to retain the will to tackle these difficulties. The new army inspector, Lieutenant General Bagger, has also said that the Bundeswehr can put up with much. If the Bundestag and the government treat things as lightly as they have so far and will increasingly "test" how much soldiers put up with, as well the responsibility borne by their commanders, this patience will not disappear gradually, but will do so relatively suddenly, without warning. The military's inculcated obedience vis-a-vis the political leadership and public opinion makes it difficult for the military to convey the gravity of the situation with the domestic political noise that is customary in a democracy.
