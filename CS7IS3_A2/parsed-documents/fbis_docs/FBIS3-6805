A Korean Chinese resident who often visits North Korea said that the situation in North Korea is very miserable. Correspondent Yi Tong-sik reports why North Korean residents are leaving North Korea one after another. [Yi Tong-sik] The situation in North Korea as told by the North Korean escapees is really hard to believe. In Tumen in Jilin Province, across the Tumen River from Namyang, North Korea, women entering North Korea from the yard in front of the customs office are loading their shabby-looking packages onto carts. What are these? [First unidentified speaker] They are things like bags. Do not take pictures. [Second unidentified speaker] Take care. [Unidentified woman] I will let you pass it on to you after I have seen the leader [suryongnim]. [sentence as heard] [Yi] For those who visit North Korea to see their relatives, the most important thing is to carry these packages, large and small. The packages contain old clothes, vegetables, and beans, but these are precious gifts for the North Korean residents. Most of the escapees from North Korea give the very serious North Korean food shortage as the reason for their escape. [Unidentified male escapee, age 52] The North Korean authorities do not permit edible food to be imported. Therefore, they have to import animal feed, such as ears of corn. They are going hungry because there is no time to process it to make it more suitable for man to eat. They give us crude corn with the husk in bags, telling us among whom we must divide them. [Unidentified male escapee, age 20] When I was working in a coal mine while I was serving in the Army, I collapsed from hunger while I was tunneling. My mother was arrested on 21 April 1987 because she said it is as hard to live at present as it was in the days under Japanese domination. [Yi] This difficult situation of North Korea is more vividly told by the Korean residents in Yanbian, who often visit North Korea. [Unidentified Korean resident in Yanbian] Barley was the last thing I wanted to eat there. They gave me meals made from corn without the husk. They do not throw away the husks. They make cake out of the husks. Here the husks are eaten by swine, but in North Korea people cannot fill their stomachs. [Yi] Do they eat rice? [Korean resident in Yanbian] No, they cannot afford it. They cannot even afford to eat refined corn. [Unidentified Korean resident in China of North Korean nationality] If I go to North Korea, they welcome me for coming from another country. They have difficulty in providing the guest with food. It is a pity for them. When I go there, I feel guilty because I feel I enjoy too much comfort compared with them. [Yi] The seriousness of the North Korean economic difficulty is seen not only in food shortage, but in electricity shortage as well. [Unidentified escapee] Although a worker's monthly wage is 170 won, he can work only three to four hours because the plant cannot operate fully due to the shortage of raw material and shortage of electricity. This means the wage one actually gets is 30 to 40 won a month. [Unidentified Korean resident in Yanbian] It is a real pity. Many have to do without socks to wear. Most children go barefoot because they cannot afford to wear shoes. Their feet look like duck feet from malnutrition. [Yi] Is there any other reason, except for the starvation and economic difficulty, for them to risk their lives by escaping? [Unidentified escapee] If they could hope for a better future, they would be patient and wait a few more years. There is no hope in the North. Unless a fundamental change is brought about in the North Korean system, there is no hope for any improvement in the livelihood of the 20 million people there. [Yi] No matter how difficult the situation in North Korea is, crossing the border is a life-risking adventure for those who attempt to flee. [passage omitted on material covered by ref]
