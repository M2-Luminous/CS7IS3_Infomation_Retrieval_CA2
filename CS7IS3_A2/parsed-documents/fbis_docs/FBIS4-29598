Ozawa called "invalid" the House of Representatives Budget Committee's decision Thursday to summon Hosokawa next Tuesday. Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, the coalition's core party led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, met reporters and criticized the decision in which Budget Committee Chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi overrode the ruling coalition's objections and declared his panel would make Hosokawa testify under oath. The opposition parties forced a motion through the lower house budget panel to summon Hosokawa in an apparent bid to use Hosokawa's plight to their advantage and force Hata's minority government to step down. Hosokawa's questionable deals were partly responsible for his April 8 announcement of his resignation as prime minister. Hosokawa's former financial secretary appeared before the budget panel Wednesday to say Hosokawa has indeed paid back a loan of 100 million yen borrowed in 1982 from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm. The secretary, Masatoshi Miyama, denied allegations that Hosokawa may not have paid back the 100 million yen loan and that it was received as a secret political donation.
