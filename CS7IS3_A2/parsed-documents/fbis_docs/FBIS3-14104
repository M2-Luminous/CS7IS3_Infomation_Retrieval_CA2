This was emphasized to our station by an authoritative source, who added that the talks also dealt with the U.S. position on Security Council Resolution 904 on the Hebron massacre. Jordan asked Washington to explain its abstention from voting on the paragraph which stated that Jerusalem is part of the occupied territories and whether this abstention constitutes a change in the U.S. position on the holy city. The House of Representatives strongly condemned the U.S. position on Jerusalem and denounced what it termed the continuous U.S. aggression on the Arab nation. It asked the Jordanian Government not to return to the negotiations before the siege of al-'Aqabah is actually lifted and so announced at the Security Council. The deputies said this siege is aimed at bringing pressure to bear on Jordan with all possible means to deprive it of its free decision vis-a-vis all issues of concern to the nation.
