FR940216-2-00031 FR940216-2-00018 National Park Service Pecos National Historical Park; Minor Revision of Park Boundary Public Law 101&hyph;313 established Pecos National Historical Park on June 27, 1990. The March 1990 map, referenced in the legislation as ``Pecos National Historical Park Boundary Concept'' and numbered 430/80028 identified the area of the park as being approximately 5,865 acres including the Forked Lightning Ranch. Section 202(b) of Public Law 101&hyph;313 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make minor revisions in the boundary of the park in accordance with section 7(c) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460 l &hyph;4 and following). Since establishment of the park, the National Park Service has determined that the Forked Lightning Ranch actually included property located outside the established boundary: A 66.29-acre parcel of land encumbered by an easement for the old U.S. Highway 85, and an unencumbered 29.26 acres located west of the old highway easement. It was the intention of the parties involved in the expansion of the park to include the entire Forked Lightning Ranch property within the boundary. In order to facilitate improved resource protection and law enforcement it has been determined necessary to revise the park boundary to include an additional 100.55 acres. This includes the Old Highway 85 right-of-way (66.29 acres), the 29.26-acre parcel located west of the old highway, and an additional 5.00 acres owned by the State of New Mexico located adjacent to the old highway. Therefore, notice is hereby given that in accordance with the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act, as amended, the boundary of Pecos National Historical Park should be revised as described above. The revised boundary is depicted on a map entitled ``Boundary Map, Pecos National Historical Park,'' Drawing No. 430/80,043, and dated September 1993. This map is on file and available for inspection in the Office of the National Park Service, Department of the Interior; the Office of the Southwest Region, National Park Service; and the Office of the Superintendent, Pecos National Historical Park. Dated: January 26, 1994 Mary R. Bradford, Acting Regional Director, Southwest Region. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3542 Filed 2&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;70&hyph;P
