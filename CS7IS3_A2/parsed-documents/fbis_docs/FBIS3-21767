Referring to sources in Prague and Italy, the paper wrote that the KDU-CSL Chairman and Deputy Premier, Josef Lux, had ordered last March the transfer of three million crowns (about 100,000 USD) sent to the Czech Republic in October 1992 by Italian entrepreneur Leonello Mosca, 45, from Perugia, to his party's account. LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE wrote that Mosca had been arrested six weeks ago on charges of cocaine trading, but later was released on bail and was now living in an unknown place. The three million crowns have never been returned to Italy, the paper said. According to it, Mosca allegedly responded to a KDU-CSL demand and paid three million crowns to the Ceska Typografie publisher, to which LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE, then a press organ of the Christian Democrats, owed millions of crowns. Nevertheless the debts were paid by the later new owner of the paper, Fidelis Schlee, and the three million crowns, originally destined for the purpose, were later transferred by Lux to his party's account. Orel told CTK that in the summer of 1992 the KDU-CSL concluded a preliminary agreement with Mosca's company on the establishment of a paper publishing company, but withdrew from the agreement in the autumn of the same year. The KDU-CSL has also concluded an agreement with Mosca's company on a loan repayable on September 30, 1994. The KDU-CSL has never challenged the loan and will repay it as agreed, Orel said. He stressed that neither the KDU-CSL nor its chairman "are laundering money coming from cocaine trade and from night clubs" as the daily alleged. The KDU-CSL sees LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE's attack as reaction by a person interested in the purchase of the state-owned publishing company Pragopress, Fidelis Schlee, whose bid was turned down. These are pressure methods which the KDU-CSL will never accept, Orel said. Lux along with another two KDU-CSL ministers--Defence Minister Antonin Baudys and Economic Competition Minister Stanislav Belehradek--voted two weeks ago against a privatisation project under which Pragopress was to be sold to Schlee and the direct sale could not be realised.
