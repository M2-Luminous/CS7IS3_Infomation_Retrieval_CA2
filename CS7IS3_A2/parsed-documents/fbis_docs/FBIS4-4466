They carried a mock-up corpse on a bamboo stretcher through the corridors and burned incense, in what they said was Indonesian democracy's funeral. Security officers stood by watching but made no attempt to interfere with the procession. "Arrest us if you dare. Let's fill up the Salemba detention center," one said. The court yesterday proceeded with the trial of the 21 accused of defaming the name of President Suharto. The students were arrested last December after staging a demonstration at the House of Representatives (DPR) at which they demanded the People's Consultative Assembly convene to grill the head of state for his conduct. Yesterday was the defendants' turn to present their defense and none showed remorse for their behavior and used the opportunity to lash out at the government for arresting them, calling it an infringement on their freedoms. The defendants remain divided into three groups, depending on the government's view of the severity of their alleged offense. The prosecution's "hard core" group of defendants consists of Yeni Rosa Damayanti, Masduki, Hendrik Dikson Sirait and Adi Kurniawan. The other two groups consist of six and 11 defendants. A lawyer of the group of four, Frans Hendra Winarta, told presiding judge Sutrisno yesterday that the prosecution's argument was obscure. "It was not clear, precise or accurate as required by the Procedural Code." Frans blasted the prosecutors for using a law inherited from the Dutch penal code, formerly used by the colonizers to charge freedom fighters. The article in question, that is a part of the current Criminal Code, prohibits expressions of hostility, hatred and disrespect towards the President. "During the Dutch period, that horrible and scaring article was heavily criticized by our forefathers," Frans said. Yeni also read her own prepared, hand written defense statement, entitled "Speaking the Truth is not a Crime." She said the protest at the House had nothing to do with the president. "We have no intention of mocking the president," the 29-year-old student militant noted. The protesters main concern, she said, was the excessive involvement of the military in day to day affairs, known locally as the security approach to development. The system has turned Indonesia into a "state of fear", she said using a theme of a speech by Myanmarese [Burmese] Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. "I was accused of defaming an official, in fact it's I who has to feel insulted," Yeni said, adding that a number of high ranking government and military officials had called the students "anti- Pancasila" [state philosophy].
