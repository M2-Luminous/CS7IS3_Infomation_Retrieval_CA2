FR940112-0-00044 FR940112-0-00016 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity 24 CFR Part 104 [Docket No. R&hyph;93&hyph;1699; FR&hyph;3485&hyph;F&hyph;01] Administrative Proceedings Under Section 812 of the Fair Housing Act AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, HUD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule revises the regulations involving discovery procedures in HUD administrative proceedings. The revision more clearly sets a standard whereby a party or a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party will not be required to submit to a physical or mental examination, except upon order of the presiding administrative law judge pursuant to a motion by the party requesting the examination and a showing by the moving party that the physical or mental condition of the person who is the subject of the request is in controversy and that good cause exists for the requested examination. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 11, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Harry L. Carey, Assistant General Counsel for Fair Housing, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 9238, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;0500, telephone: (202) 708&hyph;0570.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Part 104 of Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations contains HUD's regulations governing administrative proceedings under section 812 of the Fair Housing Act. Under 24 CFR 104.500 and 104.540, any party may serve on any other party a request to submit to a physical or mental examination by a physician, specifying the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the physical or mental examination, and the person or persons who will make the examination. Relevancy is the only explicit requirement regarding all methods of discovery provided in the Fair Housing Act's implementing regulations, 24 CFR 104.500(b) (1992). The Department is revising 24 CFR 104.500 and 104.540 to conform more closely to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as interpreted in certain Federal court precedents. This regulatory revision is designed to further the already developed practice of Federal administrative law judges looking to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in instances in which they construe HUD's regulations governing administrative filings and hearings. See, e.g., HUD v. Jerrard, Fair Housing-Fair Lending (P&hyph;H) para. 25,081 at 25,086 (HUDALJ Sept. 28, 1990) (Accepting analogy to Rules 41(b) and 8(c), Fed. R. Civ. P.); HUD v. Downs, HUDALJ 02&hyph;89&hyph;0322, Order at 2 (June 21, 1991) (Reliance on Rules 28(a), 30(b)(7), and 32(d)(3)(B), Fed. R. Civ. P., to reject respondents' claim that deposition was technically defective); and Downs, Memorandum Opinion at 2 (Nov. 22, 1991) (Finding Rule 24(a), Fed. R. Civ. P., to provide guidance for resolution of motion to intervene). 1. Rule 35 Standard Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 35, relevancy is not a sufficient basis for a court to order a physical or mental examination. Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104, 118 (1964). Rather, because such examinations are a more intrusive form of discovery than other available discovery methods, Rule 35 requires stringent standards for their use in Federal court litigation. Such examinations are only provided for by leave of court and in limited circumstances. Rule 35 provides: When the mental or physical condition (including the blood group) of a party or of a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party, is in controversy, the court in which the action is pending may order the party to submit to a physical or mental examination by a suitably licensed or certified examiner or to produce for examination the person in the party's custody or legal control. The order may be made only on motion for good cause shown and upon notice to the person to be examined and to all parties and shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made. As stated in Guilford National Bank v. Southern R. Co., 297 F.2d 921, 924 (4th Cir. 1962), ``Under Rule 35, the invasion of the individual's privacy by a physical or mental examination is so serious that a strict standard of good cause, supervised by the district courts, is manifestly appropriate.'' The Supreme Court, in Schlagenhauf, supra, emphasized the limited circumstances under which a court may order mental or physical examinations under Rule 35: Sweeping examinations of a party who has not affirmatively put into issue his own mental or physical condition are not to be automatically ordered *␣*␣* Mental and physical examinations are only to be ordered upon a discriminating application by the district judge of the limitations prescribed by the Rule. To hold otherwise would mean that such examinations could be ordered routinely *␣*␣* The plain language of Rule 35 precludes such an untoward result. Schlagenhauf, 379 U.S. at 121&hyph;22. See also In re Mitchell, 563 F.2d 143 (5th Cir. 1977) (Rule 35 order requires greater showing than general discovery under Rule 26). The requirements under Rule 35 differ from those imposed by other discovery provisions in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, such as the taking of oral and written depositions (Rules 26&hyph;32), interrogatories to parties (Rule 33), and the production of documents (Rule 34). None of these other discovery methods require that a matter be ``in controversy'' and only Rule 34 imposes a requirement that the moving party affirmatively demonstrate ``good cause.'' See Schlagenhauf, 379 U.S. at 117. In general, other discovery devices under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require leave of court. Rule 35 requires that the party requesting a physical or mental examination make a motion and meet notice requirements. For such a motion to be granted, the following standard must be met: 1. The physical or mental condition of the person to be examined must be in controversy; and 2. There must be a showing of good cause.
