These statements were made during the visit by the World Bank vice president Welfred Thaiwitz to Moldova. Moldovan officials pointed out that the World Bank is "a co-author of the economic transformations in Moldova." Welfred Thaiwitz was certain of the irreversible character of the reforms and the effectiveness of Moldovan authorities' efforts to improve the economy. He pointed out that "the World Bank will further grant financial support for supporting reforms in Moldova." World Bank experts assert that there have been some achievements -- the most important being the stability of the national currency in relation with the U.S. dollar and the reduction in inflation. Official statistics indicate a surprising decrease in inflation to 5 percent in April compared to 45 percent in January. The last auctions of the Interbank Currency Exchange indicate the stability of the leu. Winson Temple, UN permanent representative to Moldova, hastened to declare that the pace of reform in Moldova exceeds the pace in Russia and even the Baltic republics. Obviously, Temple stated that the economic situation in Moldova very difficult, mentioning that the national income decreased by 50 percent in the last three years. It is obvious that given such difficulties, without foreign hard currency injection it would be impossible to reanimate an economy undergoing recession. Moldova has been granted credits amounting to $86 million by the World Bank and it stands to receive more. During his visit to Chisinau Thaiwitz did not specify a figure for the eventual loans. However, sources from banks say that another $150 million could be granted. "The World Bank can grant Moldova significant financial assistance its reforms are successfully promoted," stated Thaiwitz. He especially insisted on privatization of state property, thereby making a qualitative leap in the "structural reform" of the economy. It can be easily seen that the Chisinau officials to all possible in order not to lose credibility in the eyes of the international financial organizations. The statements made by the decision-makers in the area of economics regarding the acceleration of the privatization process, realization of structural reforms in industry, and the assurance that the international agreements and especially the Memorandum concluded with the IMF will be respected are significant. Regardless of government measures and substantial financial support, realities press hard on the Moldovan economy. Industrial output is falling. Financial blockage which has engendered general insolvency has the most pressing effects. Undertaking complete price liberalization while many salaries go unpaid under can provoke much dissatisfaction. Even the presidential decree on increasing the minimum salary to 18 lei seems not to diminish from the weight of the burden carried by the population, since the average salary covers only 30 percent of the minimum consumption budget. On the other hand, the recent price liberalization and salary raid could lead to a new wave of inflation that will aggravate the economic situation.
