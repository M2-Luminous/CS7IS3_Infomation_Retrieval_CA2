The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper writes: "Let us devote a few kind words to the first cosmonaut along with the whole world which marks Gagarin year at the call of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural organisation. Do not shun idealisation. After all, we should have some ideals". The TRUD newspaper carries reminiscences by Cosmonaut no. 2 Gherman Titov about Gagarin. "Gagarin preserved dignity, despite the hard test of world-wide fame and general love. His fate is like a sun-drenched smile of Russia." Writing about Gagarin, the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper runs an exclusive interview with Valeri Alaverdov, first deputy managing director of the Russian Space Agency, under the headline "We've Gained Experience of Man's Longest Stay in Space". He comments on the Russian Federal Space Programme up to the year 2000 which was recently approved by the government. The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper writes that "Gagarin was brought up by the Soviet socialist state which inculcated him with high spiritual qualities". The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper prints a feature on Gagarin. ROSSIYSKIE VESTI prints an article by chairman of the state property committee Anatoli Chubais, noting that the voucher privatisation in the country will end on June 30, 1994, as planned, despite any changes in the situation. "The post-privatisation operation of enterprises is the key element for us now," he stresses. Therefore, we are increasingly shifting our activities to creating sources of financing privatised enterprises." The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper describes ongoing military reforms in the country, regarding them as a top priority for the state. "The armed forces have entered the second stage of their restructuring which will end in 1995. It is highly probable that its tasks will be accomplished, despite the difficult economic situation in the country." The same newspaper carries an interview with the former assistant of the U.S. military attache, retired Lieutenant-Colonel James Halbrook. He noted that Russia's golden age is still ahead. When Russia, designer of numerous technologies challenging world standards, will gain stability, it will turn into a mammoth Japan, although this comparison, may be, is not very apt, the Lieutenant-Colonel continued. The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper prints an article on stepped-up activities of American diplomacy near Russia's southern borders, stressing that consequences of these activities "can be unpredictable, including for the United States". The newspaper notes that Washington can "achieve an unheard-of strategic advantage peacefully or with a minimum use of military force. Coming to the region of the post-Soviet south, the United States will turn to be in the rear of several states to which the U.S. has or can have claims (Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, China, Pakistan, India and, of course, Russia)." The same newspaper informs its readers of a meeting between U.S. ex-president Richard Nixon, now on a private visit in Moscow, and former Russian Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, leader of the Free Russia Party. Rutskoy said that the party's task should be struggle against authorities with "peaceful parliamentarian means". The PRAVDA newspaper also reports a meeting between Nixon and Russian Communist Party Leader Gennadiy Zyuganov. It singles out the latter's words that the Russian Communist Party "does not embrace either right-wing or left-wing radicalism and is ready to cooperate with all political forces championing the revival of a strong Russia". RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA calls on the Russian Federation of Independent Trade Unions to step up its activities. In turn, first deputy chairman of this federation Aleksey Surikov writes in the same newspaper what interferes with unions' reformation work. According to Surikov, these are inner problems and contradictions, on the one hand, and strong outside pressure from authorities and various political movements and parties, on the other.
