The Seiyu chain's Kichijoji store prepared 350 two-kilogram bags and another 350 five-kilogram bags of the rice, priced at 750 yen and 1,850 yen respectively, but they were sold out in two hours, store officials said. Japan is expected to import as much as two million tons of rice to make up for a shortage resulting from last year's worst postwar harvest. Rice produced in the United States, China and Thailand is expected to be sold at retailers throughout the nation by late February.
