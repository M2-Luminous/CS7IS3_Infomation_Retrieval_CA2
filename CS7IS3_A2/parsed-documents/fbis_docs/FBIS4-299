However, calm prevailed in Bujumbura where many civil servants and traders did not report for work, an AFP correspondent said. UN officials in Kigali and the security forces could not provide details on possible material damages resulting from the shooting which was heard mainly in the center of the city. According to a spokesman of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR], security forces have cordoned off the strategic areas and UN patrols are cruising the city. The spokesman was not able to give details on whether the shooting was between organized armed groups. The shooting, which began early this morning, could still be heard by 0930. The Rwandan Government has appealed for calm on the radio, and has asked people to remain at home, "to avoid panic," and to "avoid engaging in acts that could threaten state security." According to various Rwandan sources, the plane that was returning Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira from Tanzania was attacked by heavy weapons before crashing at Kigali Airport. The UN officials and the security forces could not confirm this information. According to unofficial sources, the Rwandan presidential plane, which was carrying about 10 people who all died in the crash, took fire and literally exploded.
