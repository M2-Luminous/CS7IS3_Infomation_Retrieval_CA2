The paper says that the network leaders had often visited the security strip and a European capital. According to the top leader, AL-HAYAH says that the investigations into the incident will inevitably confirm whether party and militia leaders are involved in the bombing, particularly since the group leader, who probably has escaped to the Jazzin area in the security strip, was in charge of security affairs in a local influential militia in the Kasrawan region. The group leader, according to AL-HAYAH, is a relative of a prominent party leader. AL-HAYAH also cites official sources as saying that the initial stage of the preparation of the explosives was conducted in Sinn al-Fil before the culprits moved to the Zuq area. The culprits then used a party center, which has often been raided, to assemble the explosive devices before planting them in the church.
