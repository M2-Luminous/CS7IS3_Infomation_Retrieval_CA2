A reporter asked: What is your comment on the report which the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons has published on Sino-British relations? The spokesman replied: On 13 April the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons published a lengthy report about Sino-British relations. The conclusion of this report runs totally counter to its professed desire to develop Sino-British relations. Disregarding the facts, this report confuses right and wrong and insists on supporting the erroneous policy of the British Government on the Hong Kong issue and supporting its continual confrontation with China, thus fully revealing the British side's real intention of prolonging its colonial influence in Hong Kong through creating chaos [zhi zao hun luan 0455 6644 3236 0052] there. No forces whatsoever can stop the return of Hong Kong to the motherland. The Chinese Government has the confidence and the ability to resume exercising sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled, carry out the policy for "one country, two systems," implement the basic law, and maintain Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. While the report recognizes China's economic success and the importance of its international role, it makes indiscreet remarks about China's internal affairs and even attempted to meddle in them. We would like to remind the authors of this report that they should have some sense of history and reality. Today's China is no longer the old China which could be bullied at will. People will never forget the role Britain played on the Tibet issue, and we can only hope it will draw lessons from history and adopt a prudent attitude. Any attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" runs counter to the principles governing the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Britain and therefore will meet our firm opposition. A reporter asked: What is the purpose of Vice Premier Zou Jiahua's forthcoming visit to the United States. When will he make the trip? What will be the main issues to be discussed? Is China ready to concede on the most-favored-nation status issue? The spokesman answered: Vice Premier Zou Jiahua will pay an official to the United States from 27 April to 8 May at the invitation of the U.S. Government Ever since the official meeting between Presidents Jiang Zemin and Clinton in Seattle last November, bilateral exchanges and contacts have been increasing at all levels and in all fields. The main purpose of Vice Premier Zou Jiahua's visit is to maintain the momentum of high-level exchanges between the two countries, to enhance understanding, and develop cooperation. During Vice Premier Zou's visit to the United States, he will have extensive contacts with U.S. leaders, government officials, and business personages. He will exchange views with them on Sino-U.S. ties, Sino-U.S. economic cooperation and trade, and other issues of common concern, in order to promote the improvement and development of the two countries' relations [tui dong liang guo guan xi de jin yi bu gai shan he fa zhan 2236 0520 0357 0948 7070 4762 4104 6651 0001 2975 2395 0810 0735 4099 1455]. A reporter asked: A report says that Premier Li Peng's current trip to four Central Asian countries aims at contending with Russia for influence in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. What is your comment on this? Wu Jianmin replied: Premier Li Peng's current trip to four Central Asian countries is to reciprocate the visits paid by their leaders to China, and the purpose is to enhance mutual understanding with these countries, promote good neighborliness, and develop mutually beneficial cooperation. The trip is by no means directed against [zhen dui 6859 1417] any third country. The friendly cooperation between China and Russia is developing steadily in all fields. We want to see that the friendly relations between Russia and the Central Asian countries, which are our neighbors and Russia's, will continue to develop.
