He did not make an appearance for the recent grass-roots people's congress elections in Beijing. Deng did not appear in the television footage of some big shots casting votes. However, the official news reports said Deng cast his vote. This was rather mysterious and confusing. So it was rumored that Deng had fallen ill, and he did not come to the polling booth. His vote was cast by other people on his behalf. It was also said that Deng had not contracted any special disease, but was simply getting senile, so his health remained normal. It was even said that Deng left Beijing in the last month of 1993, and the rumor came from some senior officials. In December 1991, Deng Xiaoping began his inspection tour to the south, and uttered a series of remarks that shocked all quarters. In December 1993, Deng travelled to the south again, and was said to have spoken many times. The main subject of his talk remained economic reform and he still called for promoting production through reforms. In addition, Deng also emphatically opposed localism and their local assertions for "independence." There were some detailed reports about Deng's travel to the south: On the evening of 9 December, accompanied by Yang Dezhong of the CPC Central Committee's General Office, Wu Xiuquan, and Li Desheng, Deng Xiaoping set off on a special train from Beijing's South Railway Station. Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, Ding Guangen, and Wen Jiabao saw him off at the railway station. It was said that strict security measures were taken for the special train, which had eight carriages. One was for Deng Xiaoping, one was used as a conference room, one was a dining place, one for the security personnel, one for the entourage, and two for Yang Dezhong, Wu Xiuquan, and Li Desheng. Another carriage was a spare one. Before Deng Xiaoping boarded the train, Liu Huaqing, Wen Jiabao, Tao Siju, and Yang Dezhong personally inspected the special train, stopping on a special railway line. One year ago, at a meeting of the Central Security Guard Bureau, Liu Huaqing said: "We must guarantee Comrade Xiaoping's health and safety with a responsible attitude toward the party and the people, and this is your noble duty." On the early morning of 10 December, Deng Xiaoping arrived at Baimashan Station in Jinan, Shandong, and the train moved to a special line. Deng met with Shandong Province's party and government leaders and the Jinan Military Region's leaders on the train. He mainly talked about several issues. Deng Xiaoping said: "Reform should be deepened. This is a battle of assaulting heavily fortifications, and is also a revolution. Certain costs will have to be paid for a revolution. I agree that action should be taken as long as a correct judgment is made, and we cannot just wait and see. The conditions will not fall from the heaven, and the God will not endow us with such favorable conditions." "There is a valuable conclusion in these years. That is, there is no debate inside the party, and our work should not be bothered by theoretical controversy. Thus, we can concentrate our time and energy on fulfilling the central task and properly handle new questions in reform and opening. Some people inside the party were not happy to see that no debate was launched. They are keen to launch debates and polemics. The attitude of the central leadership is firm. That is, no debate is to be started. I think that it is difficult for those who want to start a debate to actually do so." Deng Xiaoping added: "Now, we should overcome localism and individualism, and should punish those involved in serious cases. The central leadership has repeatedly stressed the need to reinforce the party spirit and the sense of organization and discipline in the course of reform. People must keep the overall interests of the nation in mind and should take the interests of the whole into account." "I should commend Shanghai, Guangdong, and also Shandong, Sichuan, Beijing, and Liaoning. They have all done a good job." "Party cadres should have a self-sacrificial spirit, and should give more consideration to the benefit of ordinary people and actually seek more real benefit for them. This is an important point. Whether the reform principles and policies will achieve the expected results will first be tested by practice and will also depend on where the work performances and behavior of our party and government leading cadres are decent and proper." In his talk, Deng stressed the point of fighting against localism. From the above-quoted remarks, one may see that the main current obstacles to reform and opening first come from the intention of some people to start a debate and secondly from localism. Some local party and government leaders ignored or even defied the central instructions and orders. Deng warned that those involved in serious cases should be "punished" [yao fan yi fan 6008 0646 0001 0646], and this remark was rather important. However, Deng also had to appease the local authorities, and required that the Armed Forces give support to local construction. He told the responsible people of the Jinan Military Region: "The Army should fulfill its own central task. In the period of peaceful construction, some troops are rather lazy, weak, and loose. Serious attention must be paid to this problem. The troops are often affected by the environment and the local conditions. So the political and ideological work must not be relaxed. When there are conditions, the Armed Forces should support and help local construction. In recent years, relations between local party organizations and governments on the one side and the military units on the other were rather harmonious, and this is the mainstream. It is still necessary to improve relations between the troops and the civilian people. The local party organizations and governments are also responsible for this, and must not neglect the work in this regard." From Jinan to Nanjing, Deng Xiaoping once again sternly criticized localism, and blamed some local party and government cadres for disregarding the superior authorities and the central leadership. On the late evening of 10 December, Deng's special train arrived in Nanjing. On the morning of 11 December, Deng Xiaoping met with party and government leaders of Jiangsu Province and principal party and government leaders of Suzhou, Wuxi, Xuzhou, Lianyungang, Changzhou, Nantong, and Zhenjiang Cities. After listening to the work reports by the provincial and city leaders, Deng said: "Jiangsu Province has good conditions, and should make greater contributions to the state, to other provinces and regions, and to the general public. Greater efforts should be made to advance reform. Now, a favorable factor we have is that the local authorities and the central authorities are striving for the same objective, and the party, the government, and the people are striving for the same objective. However, when achievements have been made, you should guard against complacency, and should not unwittingly pursue localism and individualism. This is not good. The subordinate should obey the superior, individuals should obey the organization, and the whole party should obey the central leadership. Now, in some party and government departments, some cadres disregard the superior authorities and disregard the central leadership. How can they be allowed to behave in this way? If this problem is not rectified, they will commit major mistakes." Reportedly, after Deng Xiaoping and his entourage stopped over in Nanjing, they went to Nanfang Fountains of the Tai Hu in Wuxi the same afternoon, where there is a holiday resort of the Central Military Commission. Deng Xiaoping stayed in Villa No 2. There are a total of 12 villas in the holiday resort, and there are also two four-story buildings for holiday-makers. They were built in the spring of 1992. There are doctors and medical experts from the military medical schools in this sanatorium, which serves military cadres at and above the army level or retired cadres at and above the ministerial level. Some central leaders call it the August 1 Sanatorium. This reporter visited an informed old cadre, and asked him to talk about his feelings about Deng's remarks in his recent travel to the south. -- Deng basically told the truth. -- Deng still insisted on the idea of "pursuing quick development" and "no simply waiting." This showed that he felt that his days were numbered, and this was the mentality of an old man. -- Deng mentioned that "some people are unhappy to see that no debate is launched and they are still keen to start a debate." This referred to the conservatives. These people have become an obstacle to reform. In a briefing circular, the General Office of the State Council recently made public Zhu Rongji's speech at a meeting, and he more clearly mentioned such obstacles. Zhu Rongji said: At present, the whole party is advancing reform, opening, and economic construction under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory about building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This has become an irreversible trend. However, we should note and should be courageous enough to admit that there remains certain resistance. The resistance mainly comes from inside the party, including the outdated and backward idea of sticking to the rigid dogmas that are no longer suited to the development of our society. Practice has proved that this is an erroneous and even harmful idea. The thinking and behavior of some leading comrades also constitute an obstructive force at some times and in some events. This has had a substantial harmful impact on the situation. Obviously, Zhu's remarks were directed at the conservatives. -- Of course, differences not only exist between reformists and conservatives but also between reformists and "radical reformists." For example, on the issue of the central authorities' macrocontrol, Zhu Rongji admitted that there were "different ideas." He said: The central leadership holds that macrocontrol is not only an instant need but also a long-term task. However, another opinion holds that the central authorities' macrocontrol can only be a temporary measure or an urgent means, which is short-term and temporary, in the transition to the market economic structure. People holding the latter opinion fear that permanent macrocontrol may lead to retrogression, that is, the guideline of "taking the planned economy as the mainstay" may be effected in the name of macrocontrol, and the market economy will thus be confined to a limited scope and cannot extend and grow freely. -- On the one hand, Deng admitted the existence of localism to a serious degree. On the other hand, he said that the local authorities and the central authorities shared the same objective. This was obviously self-contradictory. In fact, there are sharp interest conflicts between the localities and the central government. Deng's talk in fact admitted the existence of localism to a serious degree, so it was necessary to overcome it or even "punish" some people. Reportedly, local officials aired resentment at a recent national economic conference, and complained about a series of wrong actions taken by the central authorities. The contradictions between the central authorities and the localities not only find expression in policies and measures, but also in the distribution of tax revenue. Differences also exist over the current anticorruption work. Zhu Rongji himself said: The central leadership holds that the anticorruption work is a long-term task. The current condition of corruption is rather serious. Corruption has seriously harmed economic construction, reform, and opening, and may even directly ruin the people's political power and ruin our party and our cause. Corruption has laid bare the problems and errors in the work of the central authorities. The other opinion holds that corruption is unavoidable in the course of economic development, reform, and opening. Such problems emerge in an endless stream in the high level of the political and business circles of such capitalist countries as Japan and the ROK. The "different opinion" mentioned by Zhu mainly came from local officials. In addition, a third opinion holds that the problem exists in the incorrect line taken by the central leadership, which gave up the inner-party ideological struggle, denied the objective existence of class struggle, and ignored the corrosive influence of Western ideology. This resulted in corruption. This is the opinion of the conservatives. -- Deng said: "The party, the government, and the people are striving for the same objective." This was not completely in keeping with facts. In fact, the party only pursues a limited degree of reform in the economic field and does not pursue any political reform at all. The people are opposed to the policy of not carrying out political reform. To a certain degree, they welcome economic reform, but they are not completely satisfied with it. Zhu Rongji also frankly mentioned this without mincing words. When talking about the reform orientation of the state-owned enterprises, he said: The central leadership holds that the key lies in how to give play to the initiative of the large and medium- sized enterprises. The state-owned enterprises must carry out reforms, and must adapt their management and operation mechanisms to the requirements of the market economy. In the next 10 years or so, the state-owned enterprises will still play a main role. The different opinion holds that reform must proceed from the large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, competition should be openly supported, enterprises which do not achieve good business results, do not sell their products well, run in the red, and fail to repay debts should be merged, auctioned openly, or transferred to the hands of overseas investors or private entrepreneurs, and the joint- stock system be adopted among state-owned enterprises. One more opinion holds that now is the time to totally adopt the joint-stock system among all state-owned enterprises and even effect privatization. They say that the joint-stock system and privatization represent the orientation of enterprise reforms. These are different opinions on deepening reform and on the orientation of the reform. People holding the first opinion are mainly scholars and experts. People holding the second opinion include scholars, experts, intellectuals, and many ordinary people, who also hold similar ideas. If there is a referendum, it is believed that the option of "privatization" will win. -- It is not certainly correct to stop all debates. The conservatives may be defeated in a polemic. Why isn't this a good thing? On the other hand, through debates, the voice of the people will produce positive effects on reform, and the truth will become clearer in the course of debates. It was said that Deng Xiaoping stayed some time in Wuxi after traveling from Beijing to Jinan and Nanjing. Because the whereabouts of the CPC leaders and policymakers are extremely secret, it is believed that the enigma about Deng Xiaoping's admonition to local officials during his southern tour will not be made clear for a certain period of time.
