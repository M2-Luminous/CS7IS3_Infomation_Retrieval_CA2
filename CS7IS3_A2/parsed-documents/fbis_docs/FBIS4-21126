On 4 April, the State Department published its annual report on its global strategy to fight drugs. With regard to Colombia, the report states among other things that the mafia "still manipulates the judicial system through intimidation and bribery." Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose Sintura denied this allegation, saying that arrests, sentences, confiscations, and seizures prove the opposite is true. "Such a general claim is unacceptable," Sintura stressed in a news release. Noting the achievements made by the Prosecutor General's Office, Sintura said it is not clear who the report refers to as a "fourth-level member of the (Colombian) Prosecutor General's Office who is under investigation for his alleged links to the Cali Cartel." The news release says that in 1993 "Colombia extradited a presumed Argentine drug trafficker to the United States, as well as four citizens of various nationalities during 1994. In addition, seven others whose extradition was requested by the United States were arrested, and those cases are currently moving through the legal process." Sintura adds that as a result of the fight against drug trafficking, 40 people linked to this crime have surrendered, 30 have been arrested, and 23 have been killed in clashes with the authorities. The news release stresses that all of these people were "members of drug trafficking organizations, and not common criminals." Sintura's report adds that "17 top leaders of these organizations have received sentences of 10-24 years in jail."
