He was analysing the preliminary results of elections to the republic's Supreme Soviet at a press conference today. According to Chornovil, far more candidates, supported by Rukh and democratic forces than were expected, have entered the second round of the elections to the Ukrainian parliament. The Rukh leader himself received over 62 per cent of the total number of votes cast today. The most important thing is not to let the second round of the elections disrupted, Vyacheslav Chornovil said. When asked whether he will present himself as a candidate for the probable presidential elections, Chornovil said that this question will be decided at the second stage of the V Congress of Rukh scheduled to be held in the second half of April.
