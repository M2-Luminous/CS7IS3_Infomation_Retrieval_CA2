The "Cheesebread Republic" is no longer the same. The debate on the economic plan in Congress has broken up the Juiz de Fora group and shown who is holding the ball now: Minister of Finance Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The president's friends from Juiz de Fora no longer meet around the chief's desk late every afternoon for cheesebread and a bit of chitchat. Itamar is enthusiastic about his minister of finance's performance in getting the plan approved and has caused his friends to lose the influence they once exercised on government decisions. They still have power, but they no longer act as a bloc. Each one has started tending his own garden. Minister Henrique Hargreaves, the leader of the "Republic of Juiz de Fora," is back in command of the Civilian Household (see the end of this article). His sister Ruth Hargreaves manages the presidential temper with patient work that pleases the president. Physician Saulo Moreira is waiting resignedly for the administration to come to an end. Attorney Jose de Castro, the president of Telerj, wanders around Brasilia acting like someone uninformed, although in fact he is much better informed than ever. And Minister Mauro Durante is worrying about the future. The collapse of the Juiz de Fora group coincided with Fernando Henrique's ballet for getting the plan approved. Two weeks ago, Itamar was in his office talking to his old friend Raul Belem, leader of the PP [Progressive Party] in the Chamber of Deputies, and former Minister of Finance Eliseu Resende. At one point, Belem ventured a comment: "Itamar, just look at how things are. Inflation is rising steadily, interest rates are way up there, and Fernando Henrique has the support of the media and prestige in Congress." Then, looking to the side, he added: "If only it had been that way with you, eh, Eliseu?" The former minister was realistic: "Oh, I was at the end of my rope, Raul," Eliseu said. A pleased president chimed in: "You are right. Fernando is incredible. Incredible. He is very competent." So far, Itamar's friends have not shown signs of envying Fernando Henrique his power. "We all know our limitations now," says Minister of Planning Alexis Stepanenko, a member of the Juiz de Fora group by adoption. "That's good because we can do a better job with the work before us." Senator Pedro Simon, the government leader, has noticed the change in the president's conversations. "He is talking to more people," Simon says. Dull life--Now that the Republic of Juiz de Fora has fallen apart, some of Itamar's friends have lost interest in power, and others are tending to their duties in the corridors of the palace. Spokesman Francisco Baker is leaving the administration at the end of this month to work as adviser to the IMF in Washington, where he will earn $5,000 per month. Physician Saulo Moreira, in charge of the policy for reducing the price of medicines, is counting the days until this administration ends. "I'm going crazy waiting to get out of this" is the scornful phrase frequently repeated around the palace. Former presidential adviser Thales de Souza Ramos, an anesthesiologist, no longer has a guaranteed seat at Planalto Palace. Immediately after Itamar took office, Thales spent a long period in Brasilia and then was asked to return on several occasions. Now he almost never leaves Minas Gerais, and he rarely meets with Itamar. "I would rather keep on drinking beer with friends in Juiz de Fora than put up with that boring life in Brasilia," he once commented. Among those who are still active, special adviser Ruth Hargreaves has seen her influence grow. A friend and confidante of Itamar's, she keeps the chief in a good mood. On Wednesday the 2d, when Congress failed to approve the Emergency Social Fund, Itamar was furious. Ruth immediately went into action to calm him down. "Don't worry," she said. "I've heard that the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] is going to vote for it." Playing coy, attorney Jose de Castro let it be known that he was not informed. But he was. Last week he landed in Brasilia and followed a well-informed agenda with absolute discretion. He talked to the president, held a secret meeting with Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, and held a lengthy conversation with Minister Fernando Henrique about the introduction of the URV [expansion not given]. Minister Mauro Durante is another presidential friend whose influence with the president has increased recently as he has filled the vacuum left by the departure of Hargreaves. But he is worried about his future means of livelihood. "All it will take is a stroke of the pen by Lula, and I will no longer have a means of supporting my family," the minister confided to a friend. Durante, an attorney from Embrapa who was hired under the CLT [Consolidated Labor Laws], can be fired by the administration at any time. "We need to start thinking about the future," the minister was told by his friend Osiris Lopes Filho, whom he had appointed to the Federal Tax Office. One adviser at Planalto Palace says: "Itamar may arrange a lifetime position for him, perhaps by appointing him to a vacant judgeship, before this administration ends." Astral: Itamar himself already regards the current phase of his administration as being the last. "I am absolutely convinced that this administration will end on 3 October," he told a friend during a conversation at the end of January. "From then on, the country will have two presidents, and my job will be to manage the transition." In view of Fernando Henrique's popularity, some of Itamar's friends are concerned about showing who possesses the presidential sash. They want the president to do more traveling around the country and be seen with the people. Itamar is scheduled to spend Carnival in an improvised theater box on Marques de Sapucai Street in Rio de Janeiro, from where he will watch the Mangueira parade. Then he plans to visit Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo. Minister Elcio Alvares had another idea. He is organizing a dinner with the president for the ministers, since Itamar has abandoned tedious routine business. The president currently meets with ministers only when something specific needs to be dealt with. "In practice, the economy is now being run by Fernando Henrique's team, not the president, who works with the minister to formulate general guidelines," says one of the ministers. According to another adviser, Itamar has finally acquired the notion of limits. "More than just learning what a president can do, he has realized what he will not be able to do, with the result that he is free of the anxiety that existed at the beginning." While his Juiz de Fora friends scatter and others try to make him look more like a president, Itamar Franco has started living on an astral plane. He leaves his office earlier than before: at around 2030 rather than 2300 as formerly. He has stopped eating with advisers at Planalto Palace and now leaves every day to have lunch at home: at Alvorada Palace. He no longer becomes irritated at criticism of the government while watching the news on television, and he has even started calling his former girlfriend, Lisle Lucena, again. Pleased with the approval of Fernando Henrique's second economic plan, Itamar is happy with a poll whose results will soon be released. It shows that the figures on his first year in Planalto Palace are much better than Collor's. But inflation, which has doubled under his administration, is the most negative feature of his administration (see the table). The only episode to spoil the president's good mood last week was a health problem. According to an announcement by Carlos Alberto Oliveira Faria, Planalto Palace's official physician, Itamar suffered food poisoning after eating a chicken potpie at Alvorada Palace. The person who brought the potpie to the president's table claims that the tidbit was in perfect condition and very tasty besides. At around 1030 on Sunday, the president went out to read the newspapers beside the swimming pool at Alvorada Palace and went to sleep in the sun for an hour. He ended up with heatstroke. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Figures on Itamar | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Description |Collor (1992) |Itamar (1993) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gross domestic product (-|-0.9 |5.0 | |percent) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Industrial production (p-|-3.6 |9.0 | |ercent) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |International reserves ($|23.0 |33.0 | | billions) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Foreign investment ($ bi-|2.8 |7.0 | |llions) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |New loans ($ billions) |7.9 |10.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yield from privatization |2.3 |3.0 | |($ billions) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vehicle production (mill-|1.0 |1.4 | |ions of units) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Roads repaired (kilomete-|1,400.0 |6,600.0 | |rs) | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Inflation (percent) |1,174.0 |2,567.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: Special Office for Intergovernmental Communication, Office of the Pr-| |esident of the Republic. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |President Itamar Franco is pleased with the results of his first year in off-| |ice.

Hargreaves left the Civilian Household 101 days ago after being accused of involvement in the Congress budget scandal. Since nothing against him was proven, Hargreaves took office again before a single witness last Tuesday. The minister stationed himself beside the bed of President Itamar Franco, who was recuperating in Alvorada Palace, and signed the book making him chief of the Civilian Household. Soul cleansed, he postponed the ceremony until later, when a party held in Planalto Palace included the popping of 14 bottles of French champagne. "I would not say that I was depressed because of my departure. My feeling was one of bitterness," Hargreaves said. At 57 years of age, married, and with two children, the minister, who was once a sergeant in the Army, resented his forced removal from power. After being accustomed to meeting up to 40 congressmen in his office every day and answering an equal number of telephone calls, Hargreaves suddenly found himself alone and being visited only by a few friends. One of them was President Itamar himself, who telephoned Hargreaves a few times and visited him on five occasions. During one of those visits, Hargreaves was invited to return to the administration. He accepted immediately. During his hibernation, he had gone on a diet and lost five kilograms, which he has now duly regained, and even contacted future clients with a view to reopening his law office in Brasilia. Arrogant--Hargreaves always retained a thread of hope that he would return to power. Mainly because Itamar, besides showing him friendly support, never actually installed his successor, Tarcisio Cunha. "It was a good time for me to engage in some self-criticism," the minister says. "I feel that I made a lot of mistakes; I was quite arrogant, but I have come back a changed man." All that remains is to convince his opponents. Last week, a direct adviser to the president was already spreading venom over the minister's return. He said that during his first period in Planalto Palace, Hargreaves had been one of the ministers making the most use of government jets, mainly on Fridays.
