Boris Yeltsin named as evidence of this the drafting of an agreement on civil peace. which an ever broader circle of parties and organizations are voicing the wish to join. Yet another lesson of those dark days is the vital necessity for the strengthening of the state, the president declared. Nobody should be allowed to destroy state buildings, mount assaults upon television, and form armed detachments. In the words of Boris Yeltsin, there is now the necessary minimum for strengthening the state. The Constitution has been adopted by the vote of all the people.
