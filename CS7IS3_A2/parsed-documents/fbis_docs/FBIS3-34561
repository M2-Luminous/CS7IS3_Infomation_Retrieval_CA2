He said that the threats made by the outlaws will not frighten the police organs, which have decided to confront and chase them firmly and decisively everywhere and at all times. In his meeting with the press delegation accompanying the Austrian president, who is presently visiting Cairo, the Egyptian interior minister said that the security organs always have the initiative and are completely ready to confront the remnants of terrorism. He noted that the perpetrators of the incidents carried out by terrorists have been arrested and many crimes that were planned have been foiled. Al-Alfi also noted that a large quantity of weapons and equipment were used in these operations, stressing that the crimes being perpetrated now are a reaction meant only to prove that they still exist. He added: We have complete information about them. In reply to a question about the countries that support and sponsor the terrorist groups, the interior minister said that a number of countries are supporting and sponsoring the terrorists but he refused to divulge these countries' names, saying that there are diplomatic contacts to sign security agreements on the extradition of these elements. The Egyptian interior minister denied what the human rights report said about torture in Egyptian prisons. He stressed that Egypt is a state where the rule of law prevails, which has an ancient civilization, and which is among the leading countries that care about human rights inside and outside prisons. He said that these criminals inflict injuries on themselves as part of a plan to terrorize the police commands and officers. He noted that the human rights report was only concerned with the protection of defendants but did not mention the victims of their operations. He added that the perpetrators of many crimes had been apprehended and found to have weapons and explosives and were brought to trial, while many policemen had been killed in defense of innocent citizens, legitimacy, and law and order. Hasan al-Alfi stressed that cases of torture in Egypt, the state where the rule of law prevails, are not closed because of the statute of limitations. He said: If there are individual mistakes or excesses in the application of the law, then those making these mistakes and excesses are brought to account and punished in accordance with the law. Hasan al-Alfi described the terrorist organizations as gangs that violate the teachings and tenets of religion, adding that the crimes solved confirm that the police are in control. In reply to a question about the terrorists' names and leaders, the interior minister said that the terrorist groups' leaders are abroad and are known to the security organs. They also recruit people in the country in the name of religion, which is innocent of them. The minister stressed that these groups' objective is to ruin development and stability in Egypt, adding that these terrorist groups do not exist in Egypt alone but that many countries are targeted by terrorism. On the nationality of these terrorist elements, he said that they are Egyptians and their leaders abroad are recruiting some Egyptians and non-Egyptian under false and baseless pretexts. In reply to another question about the possibility of having a dialogue with the terrorist groups, the interior minister rejected the idea of a dialogue with these terrorists groups. He asked: A dialogue with whom? With criminals? A dialogue with gangs? He added that a dialogue with them is rejected because they are not Muslims and have no official, constitutional, or legal status and they are dealt with according to the law. He stressed his intention to continue to liquidate these elements and to bring them to court. Hasan al-Alfi said that there are no religiously based parties in Egypt and that no organization or society that is based on religion and practices political activity is recognized. The interior minister appealed to the foreign press to convey the true picture of the situation in Egypt and to expose these terrorist groups' practices.
