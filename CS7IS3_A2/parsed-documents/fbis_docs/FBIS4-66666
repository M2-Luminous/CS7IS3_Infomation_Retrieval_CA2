FBIS4-66666 "jpnea024___94020" JPRS-NEA-94-024 JPRS Near East & South Asia 18 April 1994 NEAR EAST ISRAEL `Disavowal' of Israel Among Haredim Denounced `Disavowal' of Israel Among Haredim Denounced 94AA0062A Tel Aviv HATZOFE in Hebrew 18 Apr 94 p 3 94AA0062A Tel Aviv HATZOFE Hebrew CSO [Text] The Haredi journals HAMODI'A, YATED NE'EMAN, and SHAS' [Torah Observing Sephardim] YOM LEYOM, covered Israeli independence day in their weekend issues. Each of them, in its own way, took pains to emphasize its estrangement from the state while critically judging those "religious Zionists" who behave as if the state were the first step towards redemption. It is not merely that the state cannot be viewed as the start of redemption, they stressed, but that the opposite is true. As HAMODI'A put it, "This is the worst diaspora." HAMODI'A filled an entire page with three articles ticking off the evils of the Zionist state. In this they seemed to glory in vindictive satisfaction. This state, one of the articles proclaimed, is incapable of assuring the peace and safety of its citizens. It depends on the views of others. What is more, it even eradicates "Jewish roots." The joy of independence is not their joy. And as in the past, this year, too, they have expressed their opinion that the Jewish state, which arose miraculously after 2,000 years of exile, is not be seen as the end of exile and the start of redemption. Indeed, one of the authors makes an effort to emphasize that his commentary cannot be understood as "schadenfreude" unless it is taken, as it must be in these times, as the soul searching of a Jew. To prove that we are not safe in this land, he mentions the attacks in Afula, Hadera, and other places around the country that have claimed the lives of more than a prayer quorum of innocent Jews. We read in YATED NE'EMAN, among other things, that: "The grand vision promoted by the Zionists and the various religious nationalists of Israel as the safe haven where Jewish blood will no longer be spilled, as they have put it, has been utterly shattered, almost obliterated. Most unfortunately, today, more so than other time since the founding of the state, they themselves see the great lie that they have made of the reality and existence of the state. This fact gives us great joy, for exposure of the lie is essential to recognizing the truth. This day, independence day, is appropriate to [text illegible] in our hearts, for if the day shall come when a new idolatry arises in a different guise, they will not pursue it and be seduced into becoming complete fools." In an editorial on independence day, YATED NE'EMAN also called on its readers not to rely on the security of the state or its independence since it is neither secure nor independent and its behavior, of course, is alien to the spirit of Judaism. SHAS' organ, YOM LEYOM, treated the state in the same vein. We read in one of its editorials that: "Despite the hopes placed in it by its founders, it has not succeeded in solving the problems of the Jewish people. It sought to create a land in which Jews would be able to live their lives independent of outsiders. But that has not happened. On the contrary, Jewish lives in the state of Israel are more at risk than are the lives of Jews in other countries.... Accordingly, we must recognize that the diaspora still continues in all its aching force notwithstanding the founding of the state. Until the advent of redemption, there is nothing for us to do but try to protect Jewish lives, even at the painful price of yielding the territories." On the same page of YATED NE'EMAN, there appeared an article under the headline, "Some Celebration, Some Independence." The author ridicules not only the celebration of independence but the state itself. Referring to the prayer for the peace of the state, he glibly asserts that "Whoever blesses the national government, its ministers and advisers each Sabbath, in fact, is blessing Shulamit Aloni, Amnon Rubenstein, Shim'on Peres, Yosi Beilin and their colleagues and advisers.... Even these last-named Zionists are now confounded by this land. So who is it, exactly, who is celebrating independence here?" The author also has something to say about standing at attention for the siren blast in memory of the soldiers who fell in the line of duty. In his view, "The state established the siren as a form of identification, but it is a ritual void of any substance or meaning...." As to the Jewish character of Israel and the state's relationship to Torah life, he writes that one can learn from the media, the Knesset, the courts, the street and every stone and wall. He notes desecrations of the Sabbath, violations of kashrut, a decline in Jewish Torah education and so on. In short, there is no room for Jews who observe Torah and the commandments to identify with the state. These are harsh words but the author, with all due respect, apparently forgot to add that his movement, SHAS, is an active partner in this anti-Jewish, antireligious government, and has prevented it from falling and being replaced by another government that would be more Jewish, more religious, etc. We read these articles in three newspapers, two of them dressed in very Haredi garb and the third in the clothing of a community becoming just as orthodox. To tell the truth, we were not surprised by what we read. This is not the first time that Agudat Yisra'el in its two incarnations and SHAS have not identified with the state of Israel. They treat it as they do any diaspora. They never have a kind word to say in praise of the state that arose by the grace of God after 2,000 years of exile. They also deliberately ignore that the founding of the state triggered a great turnabout to the benefit of Jewish life in Israel and the communities of the diaspora. It has become a defender for untold thousands of Jews in foreign countries and has even rescued many from the attacks of anti-Semites seeking to raise their hands against Jewish lives. Not only that, but also despite the state's continuing war against terrorists and the enemies around us, there is no better and safer place for Jews today than in this country. For all the criticism of what has happened in Israel, no one can overlook the flourishing Torah education to which we have been witness, the dissemination of Torah sources to thousands of Israelis and everything else that instills pride in a religious person in Israel. Only the blind cannot see all this and, instead of blessing the creation of the state of Israel as the beginning of our redemption, raise their hands against the state of the Jews and treat it as they would the exile of the Jews. Even if we continue to pray for the redemption of all Israel, God forbid that we should be grateful and offer up a blessing for the beginning of our redemption or make a prayer of thanksgiving that, by the grace of heaven, we have been delivered from the bonds of exile and, as free men, built a new home in the land bequeathed to our forefathers. We have no illusions that the haredim, including SHAS, will change their minds and admit that what they have said is wrong. Even so, it is worth reminding them that, by the lives they have chosen to live, they have forgotten the words of the great sages on the subject of lepers, warning against speaking evil of any son of Israel. These reproaches are seven times truer when it is a matter of repudiating and slandering not just the state of Israel but those who believe in it and each day offer up anew a blessing on the start of the redemption of the people of Israel in the land of Israel.
