"I can neither confirm nor deny if the operation will be directed against the FN 3-80 Northern Front; we will investigate. I prefer to leave it in general terms," Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo Wheelock, spokesman of the Sandinist People's Army, EPS, has said. Jose Angel Talavera, El Chacal, has denied the military operations are against the FN 3-80, and he said his 250 men who are still armed will demobilize on 15 April. "In addition, the EPS knows the exact location of my men," El Chacal has said in Managua. Wheelock praised the FN 3-80's demobilization, but in his opinion, he has said that action will not end violence in that area, stressing the EPS will have to fight against the rearmed groups. "What will permit the disarming of the FN 3-80 will be assigning more funds for the struggle against the rearmed groups," he has said. This past weekend, General Luis Alonso Discua, Honduran Armed Forces chief, ordered the reinforcement of the border with Nicaragua to repel recontras who are constantly attacking the people in that agricultural and forest area. EPS Deployment According to Wheelock, that was the Honduran reply within the framework of existing agreements to a recent clash in which a Honduran NCO and two Nicaraguan rebels, one of whom was recontra Kaliman, were killed. There will be no movement on the Nicaraguan side, Wheelock has said, because the 1,500 Nicaraguan soldiers were deployed some time ago. The reasons for this joint operation, the first since 1976, are due to the existence of thousands of weapons on both sides of the border and an alarming increase in crime in an area that was the theater of war: the Honduran former rear guard, and the Nicaraguan northern border. According to Wheelock, the EPS believes civilians in the northern region have at least 15,000 rifles, which are sold in Honduras at prices that are 20 times higher than in Nicaragua. The third reason is the existence of arms caches the contras "planted" in Honduran territory, from where its remnants operate. Honduran soldiers have promised to destroy them, Wheelock has said. According to EPS statistics, last year armed actions in the Nicaraguan countryside caused the death of 48 soldiers, 225 rebels, and 176 civilians. Twelve soldiers, 49 rebels, and 33 civilians have been killed so far this year. The same statistics give a breakdown of those casualties as follows: 95 EPS members, 602 rearmed, and 397 civilians.
