[Levada] Will the new parliament reflect the spread of opinions in society? How far will it be trusted? Today the answers to these traditional questions are uncertain and vague because the situation has ceased to be traditional. The type of public life which used to exist before and after the frontier of 1985-1989 no longer exists. Neither in society nor in parliament does there exist nor most likely will there ever exist a "leading and guiding force" and a people obedient to it. The forces seeking to fill the vacuum of trust and order are well represented in the deputies' corps. For all the haste and even random nature of its formation. How can we tell, perhaps the very uncertainty of the boundaries and program aims of the future factions will even benefit parliamentary activity: After all trial by jury, for instance, presupposes the completely random selection of jurors.... The accepted rules of the constitutional game do not promise the parliament a long life. But apart from the functions prescribed in the Constitution it has one more very important function -- preparing elections of the president and the permanent, "real," parliament. I have in mind not so much legislative as social preparation, the formation of political forces and their presentation to society, the definition of leaders, authorities, and programs. Virtually all the declared contenders for the supreme state post (and a similar number who have yet to declare themselves) are now in parliament and they will have to constantly assert themselves to deputies and public opinion. And that means that the new parliament will have to be a school of politics and political struggle. The country's future depends to a considerable degree on what subjects are learned in this school and by whom. [Betaneli] It is already obvious that the Federal Assembly threatens to become a source of at least two tough confrontations: confrontation within the legislative organ itself and "skirmishes" between the parliament and the president. The institute's many years of study, first in the USSR parliament, then in the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet and also the all-Russia public opinion polls of voters before the recent elections make it possible to understand the nature of the future conflicts. They will be based on psychological, political, and ideological incompatibility reinforced by the traditional lack of parliamentary culture in society and the customary orientation toward conflict and force. As before the members of the new parliament are distinguished by the diversity of their views, positions, and value orientations, the lack of an "overall picture of the world." To all appearances many parliamentarians will not consider Ambrose Bierce's joking warning: "Debate is the best way of confirming an opponent in his misconceptions." We may perfectly well expect that either parliament or its individual factions will sharply oppose the Russian president. The majority of political parties and blocs represented in the federal Assembly are geared not so much toward lawmaking activity as toward preparation for the presidential elections and the creation of a situation which brings these elections closer. But perhaps the most dramatic of future events is the "Zhirinovskiy effect": Since V. Zhirinovskiy's win at the elections many representatives of other parties and blocs will deliberately nor unwittingly copy the "winner's" style and his arguments and, in borrowing the symbols, run the risk of borrowing his orientation and values.
