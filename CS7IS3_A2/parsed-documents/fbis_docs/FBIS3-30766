We had very useful and important talks with the president [Milosevic]. We discussed regional issues, as well as the issue of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the ways to avoid tragedies like the one that occurred in Sarajevo. [Jevdjovic] It has been reported that Butrus-Ghali had sought authorization for the use of air strikes. Are we any closer to these air strikes now? [Owen] I hope that through the negotiations we will be able to avoid tragedies like the one that had happened in Sarajevo. Last night in Zvornik, Mr. Stoltenberg and I received Dr. Karadzic's consent that he would negotiate with the UN administration on the demilitarization of Sarajevo. Therefore, we can make progress. Mr. Akashi and the UN generals will try to find an agreement on military steps that are necessary to ensure a true cease-fire and demilitarization in phases. We are negotiating, and we hope that this can be accomplished. Only an idiot wants the air strikes. On the other hand, only idiots can further tolerate the situation in which many people are losing their lives, as in Sarajevo on Saturday. This is a question of a sensible solution. The way I understood the letter from the UN secretary general, he is seeking the authorization of the NATO Council. Let us recall that NATO is supposed to follow UN policy. The United Nations does not want to be a warring side but wants to remain objective. However, it must protect the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] and the UNPROFOR mandate. Namely, UNPROFOR has a mandate in relations to Sarajevo, which is to stop the shelling of Sarajevo and the infantry attacks and clashes on the lines of contact. The Bosnian Government Army and the army of the Bosnian Serbs should sign an agreement that would deal with both problems, the situation regarding the infantry, the situation on the field, and the situation regarding heavy arms around Sarajevo. [Jevdjovic] Did Mr. Karadzic agree to the project of Sarajevo's demilitarization? [Owen] Yes, he is willing to negotiate with the UN administration. We hope that this will be discussed in detail with the United Nations on a daily basis. This should have happened yesterday. It could appear on the agenda of the meeting dedicated to the measures of trust, which is scheduled to take place in Geneva on Thursday [10 February]. The Thursday meeting in Geneva is not a meeting on a global peace solution. If something like this happens and it is discussed, then fine, but it is a meeting dedicated to the measures of trust.
