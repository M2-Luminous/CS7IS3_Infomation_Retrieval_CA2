The only remaining hostage is Father Cirilo Lacorda. The announcement was made by Armed Forces Chief General Arturo Enrile in a news conference last night at a military camp in Manila after receiving the report from Armed Forces Southern Command Chief Orlando Soriano. Based on the report, all the hostages, including 18 public school teachers, were freed Monday afternoon. Enrile said that the release of 20 Christian hostages was made possible with the intervention of the civilian negotiators led by Basilan Governor Gerry Salabudin to the local Abu Sayyaf leader Barhama Sali alias Amir. However, the AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] Chief of Staff did not mention whether the demand of the kidnappers for a P[Philippine pesos] 1 million ransom for the safe release of the hostages was paid. There are reports that Gov. Salabudin paid P200,000.00 for the release of the 20 hostages. Earlier, government authorities met three of the five demands sought by the notorious group of Muslim-based bandits for the safe release of the hostages. Among these demands include: the reinstatement of 737 Basilan-based schoolteachers who were earlier terminated form service because they were not Civil Service eligibles; disallowing the wearing of short pants by female Muslim students during physical education activities and allowing them to wear turbans while inside the campus and not to allow military and police authorities to interfere with the ongoing negotiations between the government and the bandits led by (Juljilang). The Abu Sayyaf group is also demanding the suspension of military and police offensives in Basilan. However, AFP Chief Arturo Enrile said that despite the safe release of the hostages, massive military operations will resume against the dreaded extreme Muslim fundamentalists operating in the Provinces of Sulu, Basilan, Maguindanao, Cotabato and in the cities of Zamboanga, Davao, Cotabato and General Santos. General Enrile deployed a battalion of marine contingents from Luzon to provide reinforcement to the government forces in Mindanao.
