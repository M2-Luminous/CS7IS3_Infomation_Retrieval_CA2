FR940202-0-00017 FR940202-0-00003 III. Description of Final Rule The final rule makes some significant changes from the proposal, but follows the same general framework set forth in the proposal and the previous FDIC rule. PMSRs and PCCRs will be considered qualifying intangible assets and included in the aggregate in core capital up to 50 percent of core capital, provided that PCCRs may not exceed 25 percent of core capital. Associations may include the same amount of PMSRs in tangible capital that they include in core capital. The valuation requirements of this rule apply to PMSRs and PCCRs to be included in assets and not deducted from capital. The major differences between the final rule and the proposal, then, are: (1) The deletion from section 567.5(a)(2)(ii) of the three criteria used to determine whether an intangible asset qualifies for inclusion in core capital; (2) the reservation by the OTS of the authority to require an independent market valuation of PMSRs and PCCRs on a case-by-case basis or by the issuance of separate policy guidance; (3) the transfer of the requirements imposed in conducting the book value test from this rule to the Thrift Financial Report; and (4) the elimination of the 90 percent of original cost limitation for purposes of calculating capital. IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), it is hereby certified that this rule will not have a significant or disproportionate economic impact on a substantial number of small savings associations. Furthermore, this rule will not impose any new recordkeeping or other requirements on any associations. It generally will retain the current treatment of thrifts' PMSRs and will allow PCCRs to be counted in thrifts' core capital. Accordingly, a Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis is not required. V. Executive Order 12866 The Director of the OTS has determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866.
