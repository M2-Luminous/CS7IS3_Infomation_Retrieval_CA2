Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), told reporters that he regards the Social Democratic Party's [of Japan] [SDPJ] call for resignation of the Hata cabinet en masse as a sign of no-confidence in the cabinet. Kono expressed readiness to strengthen the alliance with the SDPJ, the second largest opposition party, saying it is important for the two parties, which have great influence in the Diet, to have talks. SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo on Thursday called on Hata to resign voluntarily once the state budget clears the Diet and before a no-confidence vote is taken so as to fashion a new coalition government. Kubo, the No. 2 man in the SDPJ, has indicated that the SDPJ may move to bury the hatchet with its former coalition partners and join a new ruling union. The SDPJ walked out of the coalition in late April to protest the abrupt formation by other coalition parties of a new parliamentary group excluding the SDPJ, forcing Hata to form the first minority government in 39 years.
