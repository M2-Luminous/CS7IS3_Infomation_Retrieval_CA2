FBIS4-28191 "dreas110_c_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 North Korea IAEA Impartiality Regarding Japan Questioned IAEA Impartiality Regarding Japan Questioned SK0806050494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0454 GMT 8 Jun 94 SK0806050494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Japan's Dangerous Nuclear Activities Must Be Called in Question" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in a recent communique issued over the discovery of 70 kg of unaccounted-for plutonium at the Tokaimura nuclear fuel-making plant reportedly said it did not call it in question, claiming that the nuclear facilities of Japan "are under a complete inspection." This is an extremely unreasonable act of conniving at Japan's moves to become a nuclear power and encouraging them, which fully reveals the double-standard policy and partiality of the IAEA in the solution of the nuclear issue. Who believes the claim of the agency that the nuclear facilities of Japan "are under complete inspection"? As much as 70 kg of plutonium has been accumulated and concealed unreported in five years at a Japan's plant where the agency's inspectors teams are said to be permanently stationed. This fact itself clearly proves that there is a problem in the inspection by the agency. Judging from the fact that many nuclear facilities of Japan have been in operation for scores of years, it is crystal clear that the recently discovered plutonium is a tiny part of the whole amount of hidden plutonium. World opinion is demanding a probe into the truth behind the case out of the apprehension that a huge amount of plutonium might be concealed in Japan and it probably has been diverted to the production of nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, the agency stated that it did not call the case of concealment in question. It is hardly understandable and it gives rise to greater doubt about the inspection by the agency. The unjustifiable attitude cannot be regarded otherwise than a criminal act of defending the nuclear criminal who has been caught red-handed while wantonly violating the publicly accepted international law and, moreover, encouraging the nuclear armament of Japan which is posing a grave threat to peace and security on the Korean peninsula and the rest of Asia. The double-standard policy and partiality of the agency which calls in question the declared minimum amount of plutonium of the DPRK extracted for the experimental purpose, magnifying it, while conniving at the huge amount of unaccounted-for plutonium of Japan the diversion of which is highly probable, only undermine confidence of the international community in the agency. The agency must call in question the dangerous nuclear activities of Japan and strictly observe the principle of impartiality in its activities in compliance with the unbiased public opinion.
