An agreement to this effect was reached this week by top Finance and Defense Ministry officials. The source of the allocation has not been established yet, but Finance Minister Avraham Shohat announced yesterday that he will refuse to approve a supplementary budget and that the funds will have to be created by changing the present budget priorities. Under the agreement, 250 million shekels will be allocated for the evacuation and the construction of new headquarters, for new fences and roads, and for other evacuation-related expenses. Approximately 25 million shekels will be allocated for settlement security in the current year and about 25 million shekels for settlement security next year. The settlements in question are those situated in the territories and along the Green Line. The Finance Ministry has rejected the demands for additional allocations from the defense establishment and other elements. It is believed in Jerusalem that the top Finance Ministry echelons may decide at some stage to finance some of the expenditures from the budget that had been earmarked for fighting the intifadah.
