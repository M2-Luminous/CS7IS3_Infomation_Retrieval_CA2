Do you agree? [Okamatsu] I believe the United States has criticized the Japanese bureaucracy for rejecting its demand that numerical targets be set. Criticism of bureaucrats has grown in Japan since 1993 and I think, perhaps, the United States mistakenly believed that if it criticized bureaucrats in Japan it would be able to crush opposition to the setting of numerical targets. It appears there are some Americans in the government and in the business community who see numerical targets and the liberalization of beef and orange imports in the same light. The liberalization of beef and orange imports has made it possible for Japanese consumers to buy these products at lower prices because there were import limits on them. The United States says "Japanese consumers want to buy American-made cars, but Japanese bureaucrats prevent them from buying those cars." Japanese duty on imported cars is zero. American automakers have failed to supply Japan with cars that Japanese consumers like, and the United States does not understand this. Without Forgetting Bitter Experience [Tachibanadaka] Japan went along with the United States on its trade demands when former President Bush visited Japan with American business leaders in 1992, but Japan has refused to meet the Clinton administration's trade demands. How should the United States see this? [Okamatsu] Japan was careful in choosing the wording of its voluntary plans to purchase American-made auto parts in 1992, to prevent them from becoming numerical targets. It also announced they were a "statement by the Japanese business community." Nonetheless, the United States has pressed Japan to implement the plans after distortedly interpreting them as a "promise by the Japanese Government." Japan will not repeat the same bitter experience. The United States has persistently maintained that "if numerical targets are not set, Japan will do nothing," while at the same time hinting at "sanctions" against Japan. While the U.S. takes such a stand against Japan no trade agreements can be reached between the two. [Tachibanadaka] Japan and the United States have failed to break the deadlock at their framework talks on the issue of numerical targets. [Okamatsu] While the United States demanded Japan accept numerical targets, Japan rejected the U.S. demand. The United States has since said that no results have come from numerous trade treaties concluded between the two countries, and has repeated its demand that Japan set specific numerical targets and work to meet them. The U.S. position is that although setting any percentage figure could lead to managed trade, the maintenance of past import growth rates will not. Japan, though, does not agree. U.S. Urged To Understand Japan's Political Situation [Tachibanadaka] Why has the United States stuck to its demand for numerical targets? [Okamatsu] Perhaps because its more than $50 billion trade deficit with Japan continues to grow. The Hosokawa government is now promoting economic reforms, the centerpiece of which is deregulation. It seems the United States has failed to fully understand the changes taking place in Japan. New officials in the U.S. Administration largely share the view of revisionists and it appears that they have yet to purge themselves of the revisionist view. [Tachibanadaka] What does the United States expect of Japan's macroeconomic policy? [Okamatsu] The United States has reportedly complained about Japan's macroeconomic policy, but I had hoped it would have understood a little better the political situation that forced the Japanese Government to cut taxes for one year. The United States praised the national welfare tax announced by Prime Minister Hosokawa. The government later decided to cut taxes by 6 trillion yen for one year, triggering complaints in the United States. If the government had decided, however, to cut taxes by 6 trillion yen for three years running, this measure would have met a favorable response in the United States. Premature To Review Framework Talks [Tachibanadaka] Japan and the United States agreed last summer to hold the Japan-U.S. framework talks. Is there any possibility the framework talks will be reviewed? [Okamatsu] I believe it is premature to review the framework talks. Since leaders of the two countries agreed to hold framework talks, it has become unavoidable that Japan and the United States would disagree. But Japan has no intention of giving up the framework talks because of a dispute with the United States over numerical targets. If the United States sticks to its demand for numerical targets, the two countries will be unable to settle the framework talks. Although we do not know if the United States will agree to negotiate with Japan at the framework talks after putting aside the issue of numerical targets, we intend to look for areas of agreement. [Tachibanadaka] How can the deadlock be broken? [Okamatsu] We plan to look at how we can build a relationship of trust with the United States. Japan is proposing that the two countries promote industrial cooperation in the automobile sector. Even if the United States refuses to agree to the proposal, Japan intends to work to break the deadlock in the framework talks by doing what it has promised to do.
