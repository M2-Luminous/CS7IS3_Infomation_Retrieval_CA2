According to him, he has brought a whole package of economic proposals, the purpose of which is the integration of the two republics' economies. [Chernyshova] Serious economic issues were discussed. The market of our closest neighbor may be assessed as being in an even greater plight than that of Russia. The inflation rate has risen to more than 25 percent per month. The official rate of exchange is 4.5 coupons for a ruble. The difference between imports from and exports to Russia ranges from $36 to 100 million. Enormous amounts of money are being spent on eliminating the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. Today, according to our correspondent, there was a wave of rallies throughout the republic staged by industrial trade unions. The main slogan called for halting the collapse of production. Recently, both in political circles and in the mass media, there has been discussion of the desire of the two countries to sign agreements on setting up an economic alliance and ruble zone of a new type. These agreements will make it possible to remove the technical barriers which restrict cooperation in what is essentially a single people. At the same time, both the Belarus opposition press and some Russian observers think that such a decision will be detrimental to our countries. Belarus will turn out to be subject to Russia once again and will lose its sovereignty. Russia will be forced to provide additional food to its closest but poor relative. Such suggestions were rejected by Stanislav Shushkevich who agreed to give us an interview after meeting Boris Yeltsin. [Shushkevich] Where did all this talk come from about the confrontation, lack of understanding, and selling out of the interests of Belarus? Read our communique from today. We have tried to state in the most concise form that the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation are seeking ways of achieving an extensive, real rapprochement of the two peoples. They are seeking ways of expressing this drawing together in a legislative document so that people should not experience difficulties. We need to conclude a wide-ranging treaty on cooperation which takes into account the actual situation today. For us the main issue in setting up a ruble zone is that the Russian ruble -- if we set up the zone on the basis of the ruble -- should have the same value both in Belarus and in Russia. If a variant like this can be found, then it must be done as soon as possible. [Chernyshova] If an agreement like this is signed, then a new basis for the rapprochement of our peoples will be opened up.
