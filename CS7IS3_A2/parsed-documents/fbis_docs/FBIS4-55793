This was stated at a joint meeting that this committee organized with the Tirana branch of the Association of Political Persecutees. For more details we go over to our correspondent, Arben Karapici: [Karapici] It seems that Archbishop Anastasios Janullatos has finished his stay and temporary religious mission in Albania. This is, at least, the opinion of the Committee for the Protection of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, which was confirmed at a joint meeting with the branch of the Association of Former Political Persecutees in Tirana. Several cases were reported on at this meeting. The latest was in Elbasan, where the Orthodox believers of this city asked Janullatos to consecrate Nikolla Marko from Elbasan as archbishop of the city's Orthodox Church. As a response to this demand by the Elbasan Orthodox believers, Janullatos was reported to have said that he had taken advice from God, who ordered him not to hurry in such affairs, i.e., the ordaining of Albanian Orthodox priests. Petrit Bidoshi, chairman of the Committee for the Protection of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, informed those present at the meeting that Janullatos has maintained the same stance toward the demand to ordain the priest Arian Koja from Tirana. Bidoshi said that both Orthodox priests from Elbasan and Tirana have high theological backgrounds and, according to him, they should be appointed as soon as possible. But Janullatos's stance in this case runs counter to his own religious mission, Bidoshi stressed. For the intellectuals present and all the believers who filled the hall, these two cases were sufficient argument for the meeting to conclude that the conditions had been created to terminate Greek Archbishop Janullatos's temporary stay in Albania.
