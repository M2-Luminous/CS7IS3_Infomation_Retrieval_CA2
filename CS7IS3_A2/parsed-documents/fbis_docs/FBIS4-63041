Responding to a question from ITAR-TASS, he noted that "the joint Uzbek-Japanese documents signed during the visit and the talks with Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata" justify such hopes. Yesterday the Uzbek president and the Japanese prime minister adopted a joint declaration setting out the fundamental principles to which Tashkent and Tokyo intend to adhere in bilateral relations. In the document Uzbekistan expresses support for Japan's admission to the UN Security Council as a permanent member. The signatories to the declaration proclaim their intention to cooperate closely within the UN and other international organizations. They advocate the expansion of political dialogue between the two countries. After the adoption of the joint declaration the foreign ministers of Uzbekistan and Japan signed a joint document which asserts that both sides regard all treaties between the former USSR and Japan, relating to Uzbekistan, as remaining in force. During yesterday's Uzbek-Japanese talks Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata announced that Japan will grant Uzbekistan fresh medical aid worth $5 million. The total value of Tokyo's medical aid to the Republic now amounts to $15 million. The chief aim of the Uzbek president's four-day visit to Japan, which began Monday , is to establish a basis for the rapid development of economic cooperation between Tashkent and Tokyo. Referring to the prospects for this, Islam Karimov drew attention to the fact that the interests of both countries would be served by the harnessing of Japan's technological power to Uzbekistan's huge natural resources. "According to estimates by U.S. experts, Uzbekistan's mineral and raw material reserves are worth $3 trillion," the president said. Islam Karimov disclosed that the possibility of opening a direct air link between Uzbekistan and Japan was discussed during his talks in Tokyo. Uzbekistan is ready to open up direct air services to any Japanese city and to resolve the technical questions which this involves, the president noted.
