FR941117-0-00022 FR941117-0-00005 Therefore, OSM did not request EPA's concurrence. OSM did solicit comments from EPA on the proposed amendment (administrative record Nos. AR&hyph;497, AR&hyph;506, and AR&hyph;523). EPA responded on October 25, 1993, that because the amendment demonstrates legal authority, administrative capability, and technical conformity with controlling National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System regulations necessary to maintain water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act, as amended, it concurred with the proposed amendment (administrative record No. AR&hyph;514). 4. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from the SHPO and ACHP (administrative record Nos. AR&hyph;497, AR&hyph;506, and AR&hyph;523). The ACHP did not respond to OSM's request. SHPO responded on August 27, 1993, that, although the revisions did not directly address cultural resources issues in Arkansas, it wanted to remind OSM of the need to be responsive to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (NHPA, administrative record No. AR&hyph;510). SHPO further commented that because NHPA requires Federal agencies to give due consideration to historic properties when those historic properties may be affected by the undertakings of the agency, surface mining activities that may have the result of affecting historic properties should be submitted to its office for review and comment prior to their commencement. As SHPO is award, the NHPA definition of ``undertaking'' at 16 U.S.C. section 470w(7) was expanded by 1992 amendments to include those projects, activities, or programs funded in whole or in part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency, including, among other things, ``those subject to State or local regulation administered pursuant to a delegation or approval by a Federal agency'' (see 16 U.S.C. section 470w(7)(D)). This new statutory language encompasses State permitting actions carried out under SMCRA. As a result of the 1992 NHPA amendments, OSM has taken action to clarify that the State permitting activities are Federal undertakings subject to the section 106 review and consultation requirements of NHPA. OSM, in conjunction with ACHP, the National Council of SHPO's, and others, has developed a draft programmatic Agreement as the preferred alternative for implementing OSM's responsibilities under the 1992 NHPA amendments. The draft agreement has undergone public review and the agencies involved in its development are currently reviewing public comments. Upon completion, the agreement will assist OSM, through coordination with the States, in fulfilling OSM's responsibilities under section 106 of NHPA. V. Director's Decision Based on the above findings, the Director approves Arkansas' proposed amendment as submitted on March 31, 1993, and as revised on July 22, 1993, and August 26, 1994. The Director approves the statutes as proposed by Arkansas with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 904, codifying decisions concerning the Arkansas program, are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. VI. Procedural Determinations
