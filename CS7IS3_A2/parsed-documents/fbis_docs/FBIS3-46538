A government official pointed out that the reason the ROK Government will announce the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise is to make North Korea aware of the fact that its efforts to exclude the ROK Government's role in the negotiations to resolve North Korea's nuclear issue is a very unrealistic measure. This official said that even after the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise is announced, if the result of the IAEA's inspection is not satisfactory and the exchange of special envoys of the South and North is not realized, the ROK Government will decide to resume the Team Spirit exercise and will make the announcement. This official added that the reason it was decided that the ROK Government will announce the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise and its resumption, if the result of the IAEA's inspection is not satisfactory and the exchange of special envoys of the South and North is not realized, is to show that the ROK Government is playing a clear role in the process of nuclear negotiations between the United States and North Korea, and to point out that it is very unrealistic for North Korea to insist only on direct negotiations between the United States and North Korea.
