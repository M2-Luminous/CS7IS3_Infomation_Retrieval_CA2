Many plants and factories in the country have stopped working, and in the next few weeks this process may acquire the nature of an avalanche, the union declared in a statement published on Monday. Under the circumstances, the union considers it necessary to take a range of urgent measures designed to overcome the crisis, such as work out a mechanism for regulating prices and incomes. According to the authors of the statement, the prices of many goods, above all food products, are already above the world level. In addition, the union calls for taking steps aimed at decreasing the volume of free funds handled by commercial banks, and at limiting the activity of commercial structures at currency exchanges. Its statement says it is necessary to announce increases in the cost of basic types of fuel two or three months in advance in order to prevent continuing uncontrolled price hikes on essential types of raw materials. According to the statement, the clamor about "the only slightly reshuffled government" poses an attempt by some political forces "to lay the blame for economic blunders on the president and prime minister." "The record fall in production -- by over 25% in the first month of the current year, and the runaway price hikes -- in January prices rose by 20%, are a consequence of the shock therapy policy adopted by the monetarist reformers in January of 1992," the statement says.
