The local election law says that towns with over 150,000 people shall have between 35 and 55 council members but when towns fail to state the exact number of counselors for the next term 85 days before the elections they are only allowed 35 counselors. The present council, which has 76 members, is yet to announce the number of districts for the local elections and how many counselors will be elected in each district.
