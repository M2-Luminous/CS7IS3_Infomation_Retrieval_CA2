FBIS4-46337 "jptot024__l94014" JPRS-TOT-94-024-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 3 June 1994 INTERNATIONAL Hizballah Said Ready To Abduct Israelis in Germany Hizballah Said Ready To Abduct Israelis in Germany `Western Intelligence' Cited JN0406145694 Paris AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI in Arabic 3 Jun 94 p 8 JN0406145694 Paris AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI Arabic BFN [Report by Rafiq al-Zayn in Nicosia] [Text] The question is no longer if Hizballah will retaliate for the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani, but how it will retaliate. Information received by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI a few days after the Israeli operation indicates that a quick decision was made at the highest levels between Beirut and Tehran, following which a commando group was sent to Europe to carry out a revenge operation that will grab media headlines and remind Israel and the world that Hizballah's arm is long and able to retaliate in kind against international terrorism. Three days after the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani, who was a prominent leader of the Believers Resistance, a report by a major Western intelligence organization in Beirut noted that Hizballah's threats are very serious this time, and its analysis of these threats fit in with the movements on the ground, which emphasize that preparations are under way for a powerful strike in retaliation against this Israeli operation. The report referred to the activation of a military plan that had been previously worked out to carry out an operation or a series of operations against Israel. The information stresses that the Hizballah leadership decided to strike outside Lebanon. This decision was made following protracted deliberations and after requesting an Iranian green light, which was conveyed by a party's security official dispatched to Tehran on Saturday morning, hours after the kidnapping. According to the information, the Hizballah leadership--which emphasized that it is expanding the area of confrontations in Lebanon and that it will no longer adhere to restrictions on resistance actions--ruled out the idea of carrying out the violent retaliation for which it is preparing from the south for several reasons: First, to avoid being accused of playing Israel's game, which seeks to confuse the internal situation in Lebanon and endanger peace through this operation. Second, the party's leadership fears that the retaliatory operations would ignite a confrontation between the party and the Lebanese authorities, especially since the party has fears of such confrontation to implement a plan to liquidate it. The third reason is a regional one that has dangerous dimensions. The party's leadership knows that igniting the situation in south Lebanon continues to be a redline, especially concerning the dangerous results it may have on the peace process and the current negotiations. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI's information emphasizes that a decision has been made by Bi'r al-'Abd, in Beirut's southern suburb [Hizballah headquarters], and Tehran to resort to an old-new style of powerful revenge outside the country. This will protect Hizballah itself in Lebanon, delay confrontation with the government, and offer a goodwill gesture, and at the same time will issue a threat of strong retaliation that will gain more international media attention than a suicide operation in south Lebanon or by firing Katyusha missiles at Israel. The information adds that a plan has been worked out to carry out exciting and major operations against Israeli targets in a West European country. It has been emphasized that the retaliation should not be an assassination or booby-trapped car, but it should be similar to what Israel did, that is to kidnap ranking Israeli diplomats from embassies--an ambassador, consul, or more--and detain them in a building or a crowded center in a manner that incites media clamor and angers and forces negotiations with the Israelis through the media. Through this hostage-taking operation, Hizballah seeks quick negotiations with the Israeli Government in which it will not only demand the release of Mustafa al-Dirani, but all Lebanese intellectuals in Israeli prisons, who currently number 350, including Shaykh 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ubayd, who was abducted by Israel from his house in the south in 1989. Special security sources say that 'Imad Mughniyah, Hizballah security officer who currently lives in Tehran and carries an Iranian passport, played an important role in preparing for the operation and training of the commando group that will carry out the operation. Earlier, Mughniyah held intensive contacts and meetings in Tehran in the presence of Intelligence Minister 'Ali Fallahian, Revolutionary Guard Chief Mohsen Reza'i, and the supervisor of the "al-Quds Battalion," which is specialized in overseas operations. It is known that 'Imad Mughniyah is one of al-Dirani's closest friends. They, together with Husayn al-Musawi, were responsible for taking Western hostages in Lebanon in the eighties. According to the available information, a four-man Hizballah commando group has arrived in Germany to carry out the operation as soon as possible. Germany has been selected because of the existence of the headquarters of the Iranian terrorist network in this country, where Iranian terrorist groups move freely thanks to the close relations of cooperation between Bonn and Tehran. Taking advantage of these relations, Hizballah formed and organized its networks in this country and a number of neighboring countries. Hizballah maintains an important logistics base in Germany in cooperation with Revolutionary Guard elements. It seems that Tehran has given the green light for the implementation of the operation in Germany despite its relations with it. Besides avenging al-Dirani, Iran wants to pressure the Bonn government to keep it from going too far in the current trial of perpetrators of the Mykonos restaurant [in Berlin] crime, in which four Iranian Party of Kurdistan members were killed. Tehran attaches great importance to this trial since the suspects are Revolutionary Guard and Lebanese Hizballah members. Convicting them would threaten to officially prove for the first time that Iran has a role in international terror. It has been learned that Tehran has offered all means of support to the Hizballah group to carry out the operation. However, it has set the condition that the operation should take place in the name of Hizballah only, and that not a single Iranian thread should appear in it. Actually, the Hizballah cells in Germany and Europe have for days been preparing and planning for the operation in order to carry it out successfully. They are also considering the possibility of carrying out similar operations in any other country, should a chance become available. Therefore, the Hizballah networks in Europe held contacts with fundamentalist Islamic groups in other countries to help them secure logistical support. They also asked radical Palestinian groups that are known to have a presence in more than one capital to contribute to taking revenge on Israel. According to the latest information, when these lines were written last weekend, the Hizballah networks had not received clear answers from its "Islamic fundamentalist" partners, who, despite their enthusiastic response to the idea, asked for some time to consult with their leaders and to do their own calculations, especially since they for a while have been under strict security surveillance in their own locations, restricting their movements. However, Western security authorities well acquainted with the alliances of radical fundamentalist movements and international terrorist organizations of various orientations and nationalities do not rule out the involvement of a radical Palestinian group in the Hizballah revenge plan, since this plan is in line with this group's calculations and the international terrorist plan it has been preparing for months, after it redeployed its cells in Europe, specifically in Germany. Will the alert and precautionary measures taken by the Mosad in Israeli embassies and the intensive exchange of information between most major Western intelligence services be successful? Or will Hizballah manage to avenge itself and prove to the world that its arm is long, just like Israel's?
