FR940711-0-00058 FR940711-0-00016 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Parts 520 and 558 Animal Drugs, Feeds, and Related Products; Fenbendazole AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of two supplemental new animal drug applications (NADA's) filed by Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co. One supplemental NADA provides for use of fenbendazole granules, the other provides for use of a fenbendazole Type A medicated article to make Type C medicated feed, both products for use as dewormers for zoo and wildlife animals. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 11, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marcia K. Larkins, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;112), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;0614. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., Rt. 202&hyph;206, P.O. Box 2500, Somerville, NJ 08876&hyph;1258, filed a supplement to NADA 121&hyph;473 that provides for use of fenbendazole 22.2 percent granules to top dress feed, and a supplement to NADA 131&hyph;675 that provides for use of a fenbendazole Type A medicated article (4 percent, 8 percent, and 20 percent) to make Type C medicated feed. The supplements provide for using 2.5 to 10 milligrams of fenbendazole per kilogram of body weight per day for 3 days for removal and control of internal parasites in zoo and wildlife animals. Supplemental NADA 121&hyph;473 is approved as of May 31, 1994, supplemental NADA 131&hyph;675 is approved as of July 11, 1994, and the regulations are amended in 21 CFR 520.905b and 558.258 to reflect the approvals. Approval of NADA 131&hyph;675 is for use of fenbendazole Type A medicated article to make Type C medicated feed. Fenbendazole is a Category II drug which, as provided in 21 CFR 558.4, requires an approved form FDA 1900 for making a Type C medicated feed. Therefore, use of fenbendazole Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds as in NADA 131&hyph;675 requires an approved form FDA 1900. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and ยง514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of these applications may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), these supplemental approvals qualify for a 3-year period of marketing exclusivity, for supplemental NADA 121&hyph;473 for this use beginning May 31, 1994, and for supplemental NADA 131&hyph;675 for this use beginning July 11, 1994, because new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) conducted by the sponsor were required for the approvals. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
