The delegation met with businessmen in Damascus and Aleppo and held meetings with the Syrian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and several government officials. The meetings with the businessmen resulted in the signing of several contracts with owners of industrial firms. The delegation examined economic feasibility studies on several projects, foremost the "plastic insulation" project, at the Damascus Chamber of Commerce. It was decided that the British will provide expertise while Syria will provide local raw materials and manpower for this project. The other important point raised was that the British side will study Investment Law No. 10, since not many British businessmen and investors are fully aware of it. The Aleppo Chamber of Commerce requested the British delegation to dispatch a legal mission from Britain to read this law and to explain it to British businessmen at the chamber's expense. The British delegation proposed dispatching a woman lawyer who is also a board member in the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry to compile a study on the law. [passage omitted] The British delegation expressed its satisfaction with the Syrian laws regulating foreign trade and also with the Investment Law. Several contracts were signed between Syrian and British businessmen. The members of the delegation affirmed that they will return to Syria to conclude other projects which they are studying and that businessmen outside the London Chamber of Commerce and industry might also visit Syria.
