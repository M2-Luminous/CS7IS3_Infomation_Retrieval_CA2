This was stated by Alviri, secretary of the Supreme Council for Free Trade and Industrial Zones, in an exclusive interview with our correspondent. Alviri added: The import of goods from the free trade zones to other parts of the country will be subject to import-export regulations. He described the monetary and banking regulations that were approved by the Supreme Council for Free Trade and Industrial Zones yesterday as one of the most important procedural regulations of the law on free trade zones. He said: Domestic banks as well as domestic and foreign credit establishments can be either set or open branches in these zones, while foreign banks can only have branches in these zones. The secretary of the Supreme Council for Free Trade and Industrial Zones also stated that the Iranian banks should have an initial capital of at least 5 billion rials, while foreign credit establishments should have at least $4 million to be established in these zones. Alviri added: Domestic banks and branches of foreign banks can carry out off-shore banking activities, which are solely foreign exchange transactions and will be exempt from the regulations and laws that apply inside the country. Alviri added: The banks in the free trade zones should clarify their situation within a period of six months or conform their articles of association with the banking and monetary regulations that apply to these regions. Commenting on the foreign exchange system that will apply in these areas, he said: [Begin Alviri recording] Another noteworthy point is the existence of a single-parity rate in the free trade zone. This means that we will not have one rate announced by the Central Bank and another rate that is the free market rate. There will be a single parity rate system. In other words, the foreign exchange market in the free trade zones will adjust its rate on the basis of supply and demand. This will be the official rate inside the free trade zones and the basis on which all the banks will carry out their transactions. [end recording]
