Presiding Judge Shigeru Sato said in the ruling the vote disparity of 2.88 to 1 "cannot be ruled unconstitutional in view of the preceding decisions by the supreme court." The ruling cited the highest judicial body's 1985 decision that said a maximum disparity of 2.92 to 1 is constitutional as well as a 1993 decision that found a gap of 2.99 constitutional. However, Sato said the Diet should observe the principle of equality under which the weight of a vote in a certain constituency should not be double that of a vote in another. The judge also urged a government panel -- now commissioned with redistricting the current multiseat constituencies for the 511-seat House of Representatives into 300 single-seat electorates -- to pare down the disparity to less than 2 to 1. The ruling was made in response to a lawsuit filed last year by a group of 72 voters from 16 constituencies in Kanagawa, Tokyo, Chiba and Saitama Prefectures, who said the 1993 general election was unconstitutional because of the 2.82 disparity. The group of plaintiffs was spearheaded by Kiyoshi Miyagawa, a Dokkyo University professor, a resident of Chiba's No. 4 constituency, as well as attorney Yasushi Koshiyama, a voter in Tokyo's No. 3 constituency. Miyagawa has condemned as unconstitutional the current legal provision that allows the Diet to allocate to constituencies seats whose numbers are often disproportionate to the number of registered voters. The plaintiffs said they will appeal the ruling to the supreme court. The latest ruling was made when a panel of experts named by the previous government is trying to demarcate the 300 new single- seat constituencies so that the next Japan's next general election could be held under the new voting system. The Home Affairs Ministry has reportedly said that whittling down disparity in the weight of votes among the 300 single-seat constituencies to less than 2 to 1 may be unattainable due to limitations associated with a new electoral map being worked out on the basis of the package of electorate change bills legislated in January.
