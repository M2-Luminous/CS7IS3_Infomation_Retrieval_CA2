A vigorous dash was made by Russian exporters who increased by 69.4 percent the sale to the PRC of different goods; 53.8 percent of which consisted of raw materials and semifinished items and 46.2 percent--machines and equipment. During a year Russian import from China increased by 28.1 percent, the share of industrial consumer goods comprising 55.5 percent. Russia's favourable balance of trade stood at 1.2 billion dollars. In the framework of direct trade contacts about 60 percent of the deals are in the nature of barter operations of the "Russian raw materials, plant and equipment for Chinese foodstuffs and consumer goods" type. Quite often the latter are dear in price and low in quality whereas in the stucture of Russia's "barterized" export there has been an increase in the share of "hard currency" goods which are sold on prices below world prices. This has produced a certain price inequivalence in favour of the Chinese partners. The Russian side is represented by a large variety of enterprises and firms (about 1,300 juridical persons) whereas the Chinese side (to the extent of 80 percent) by a mere three large-scale enterprises--the Heilongjiang Foreign Trade Company and the border trade companies of the "open" cities of Heihe and Suifunhe. In fact border trade boils down to the barter exchange of rolled metal and mineral fertilizers from Russia (65 percent of export) for ready-made products of the light and textile industry (62 percent of import) from China. It is through border channels that Chinese firms "try the keys" to Russian raw materials, buying them on low prices and often bypassing quota-licenced state regulation. Beijing's official governmental quarters have voiced an opinion that the export of Russian raw materials has been considerably facilitated through the CIS countries. This is assisted by customs benefits when taking goods out of Russia into the CIS states, as well as by the actual absence of real customs control on Russia's borders with new neighbouring countries. Quite often two sets of commodity-accompanying documents are registered for the same commodity: at Russia's custom house the commodity passes as a mutual delivery of the enterprises of Russia and CIS countries, and on the border of CIS states, with China--as Russia's transit export cargo. In 1992, even as assessed by Chinese experts, 100 million dollars' worth of duly undeclared cargoes was taken out of Russia to China. As far as state-to-state trade relations are concerned, at present they are regulated by the trade agreement of May 5, 1992, and the technical inter-bank agreement of November 27, 1992. In keeping with the latter, every form of payment, being determined in contracts by the buyer and seller, is permitted. Moreover, all settlements with the PRC are carried out solely in freely convertible currency (with the exception of credit operation). Specifically, China has granted Russia two commodity credits, while Russia has extended to China a credit for the construction with Russian participation of a nuclear power plant and a uranium-enrichment installation. State-to-state agreements and clearing settlements are used as the basis for exporting complete sets of equipment (mainly power industry equipment) and special facilities to China and to import consumer goods and foodstuffs (on applications from Russian plants supplying complete sets of equipment and special facilities). Moreover, the Chinese have cancelled all taxes on Russia's export and import. Russia's Trade With China in the First Half-year of 1993 (min dollars) TRADE TURNOVER 1,994.2 Export 1,240.6 Chemical goods 48.3 Mineral fertilizers 100.5 Metals and metalware 371.6 Transport facilities 207.4 Aviation equipment 44.8 Motor transport 148.8 Import 753.6 Clothes 158 Footwear 37.3 Sugar and confectionery 94.5 Cereals 14.5 Alcoholic beverages and soft drinks 2.5 Source: State Committee of the RF for Statistics In the foreseeable future a major aspect of Russian-Chinese cooperation will evidently consist in the organization of border checkpoints, the construction of railroads, highways and bridge overpasses on the basis of Russian road-building equipment and Chinese manpower; the establishment of JVs in the sphere of river, sea and automobile transportations; shipbuilding and ship repair; the creation of a Russian-Chinese nonstate-owned air company, as well as the construction of the Metro planned in Harbin. In the PRC's north-eastern provinces, where many enterprises were built in the 1950s with assistance from the USSR, there is a need to renew plant and equipment and the machine-tool fleet by 7-8 percent annually. The enterprises are interested in importing machines and equipment and assembly from the CIS even for hard cash because this is much cheaper than their import from Japan and other developed countries. To accelerate the development of North-East China, it is vitally important to have electric power the deficit of which is estimated at 20 percent. Therefore along with increasing the export of electricity from Buryatia, the Urkutsk and Chita regions, it is advisable to continue expanding cooperation in the construction of thermal power stations and nuclear power plants, and the corresponding infrastructure. The talks held in August 1993 between G. Fadeyev, Russia's Minister of Railways, and his Chinese counterpart, Han Zhubin, demonstrated the sides' mutual concern for the solution of one of the most pressing problems of Russian-Chinese cooperation--that of transport. The Russian side suggested using our country's fleet of railway cars on China's roads and expanding the use of large-capacity containers. According to available estimates, up to 7,000 cars become accumulated from the Russian side in the areas of Manchuria-Zabaikalsk and Suifanhe-Grodekovo alone due to their shortage in China. But in 1993 alone the volume of shipments needed to ensure mutual trade comprised six million tons. In China up to 70 percent of all cargoes are delivered by rail, and therefore closer coordination in this sphere amounts to an exceedingly important factor of economic cooperation between the two countries.
