Guerrillas opened fire with rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns at an SLA position in Sujud on the edge of Israel's self-declared "security zone," the militia said. The attack was claimed in a statement issued in Beirut by a hitherto unknown movement, "The Arm of the National Revolution." The group said the Muhammad Salim group of that movement carried out the attack. Salim, who was killed five years ago, was a leader of the pro-Damascus secular National Social Syrian Party in Lebanon. Elsewhere, guerrillas fired three Katyusha rockets overnight Friday at the areas around Marj 'Uyun, headquarters of the Israeli army and SLA in the occupied zone, but caused no casualties, the police said. On Tuesday the pro-Iranian Hizballah militia pounded the security zone, notably Marj 'Uyun, firing more than 100 Katyusha rockets and heavy artillery shells, and launched some 20 attacks against SLA positions. Israeli helicopters carried out a series of retaliatory raids against positions of the fundamentalist movement which left four people dead, including three Hizballah guerrillas. Hizballah has spearheaded daily attacks on Israeli and SLA forces in south Lebanon since Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed a limited Palestinian autonomy accord on September 13 in Washington. The anti-Israel attacks come ahead of a summit this month in Geneva between U.S. President Bill Clinton and his Syrian counterpart Hafiz al-Asad, to discuss the resumption of Syrian- Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli peace talks.
