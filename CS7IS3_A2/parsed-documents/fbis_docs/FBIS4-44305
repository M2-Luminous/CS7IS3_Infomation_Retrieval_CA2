FBIS4-44305 "drweu125_e_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-125 Daily Report 29 Jun 1994 UNITED KINGDOM Official, Iranian Charge Condemn Mashhad Bomb Attack Official, Iranian Charge Condemn Mashhad Bomb Attack LD2906115094 Tehran IRNA in English 1108 GMT 29 Jun 94 LD2906115094 Tehran IRNA English BFN [Text] London, June 29, IRNA -- The British Government has denounced last week's terrorist bomb blast at the holy shrine of Imam Reza (as) in Mashhad and offered commiserations for the Iranian pilgrim victims. The denunciation was made by assistant under-secretary to the Foreign Office [FCO], Andrew Green, during a meeting Monday [27 June] with the Iranian charge d'affaires to London, Gholamreza Ansari. In the meeting, the Iranian charge delivered a letter from Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, to his British counterpart, Douglas Hurd, in which he called upon the UK Government to terminate the activities of the Mojahedin Khalq (MKO) terrorist group following its bombing of the shrine. A similar message is understood to have been relayed to other European governments, which allow the activities of the anti-Iran terrorist group to go on unhindered in their countries. In response, Green said that the British policy was clear in taking all appropriate measures to combat terrorism in Britain. He said the UK Government "condemned the bomb explosion and its perpetrators" and conveyed its condolences to the Iranian people. He added that "Britain does not in any way support the MKO." With regard to the anti-Iran terrorist group taking over Persian programs on London's Spectrum radio on the day of its bombing attack in Mashhad, the British official said radio stations in the UK were free to broadcast as long as it was within the law. Any breach of law would be a matter for the radio authority, who report to the Department of National Heritage under the terms of the 1991 Broadcasting Act and Green acknowledged that an official complaint was being investigated. The complaint was understood to have been raised by the chairman of the Britain-Iran parliamentary group, Peter Temple-Morris, who told IRNA Tuesday that he was raising the matter with the British minister responsible for broadcasting. The terrorist exploits of the MKO are well documented and the Conservative MP called it a "very sad error" to allow the station, which is officially authorized, to be used for subversive purposes in broadcasting anti- Iran propaganda. He said the organization had the technique of coming through in various disguises and making themselves as very presentable and pleasant young men that very few people in the west actually realized their terrorist background. When challenged about allowing the terrorist group to transmit its propaganda, managing director of Spectrum, Wolfgang Bucci, said that the MKO presented itself as an "intellectual refugee group" under the name of Iranzamin. He said that its first week of broadcasts had worried him and had been surprized to learn more about the group that commonly describes itself as the National Council of Resistance of Iran.
