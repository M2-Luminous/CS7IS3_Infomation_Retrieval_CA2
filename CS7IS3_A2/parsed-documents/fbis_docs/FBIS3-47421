In the initial stage, the source said, the government plans to call for improvement of human rights conditions in the North in cooperation with international organizations like Amnesty International and the International Red Cross. "Through these bodies, Seoul would ask Pyongyang to allow visits by human rights inspectors and to stop torture and all other forms of maltreatment of prisoners," he said. Another method is to have North Korea accept a human rights manifesto applicable to all member countries in return for economic cooperation when Northeast Asian multilateral security dialogue involving the North is set up, he continued. "When inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation are promoted in earnest, the South could extend support to the North with emphasis on those areas which could be helpful in elevating the quality of North Koreans' lives," he said. "At this stage, efforts could also be made to arrange the reunion of dispersed families by South and North Korea without linking it to political questions such as the nuclear issue," he added. The source said that the Unification Board feels the need to think about a method to have the North Korean authorities release political prisoners and facilitate the reunion or meeting of dispersed families. "Before their integration, West Germany paid 3,440 million marks in all to East Germany from 1963 until 1989 to get the communist regime to set free 34,000 political prisoners and allow the reunion of 250,000 displaced families," he noted.
