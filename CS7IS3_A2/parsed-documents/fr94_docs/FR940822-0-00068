ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule executes a major revision of the rules for measurement of vessels using the Panama Canal effective October 1, 1994. The existing rules of measurement are replaced with a simplified, objective approach which brings the Commission's system in line with an international practice which entered into full application worldwide on July 18, 1994. The revised measurement rules apply a mathematical formula to the vessel's total volume to produce the basis for assessing tolls. The tonnage values computed under the proposed system are comparable to those calculated under the Commission's existing rules and, in the aggregate, are equal to existing tonnages. Accordingly, no changes are made to the rates of toll for use of the Canal; however, certain administrative changes to the regulations dealing with Canal tolls are necessary to ensure their consistency with the revised rules of measurement. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 1, 1994.
