Of course, we are not at all inclined to assume that the president of the republic was not informed by the appropriate authorities that this was the third attempt to try the case. Such an assumption would simply look naive. Something else causes concern--L. Ter-Petrosyan, using his status as president, is being guided by the psychology of a person who is free of any kind of responsibility, and not by the logic of a leader who is building a rule-of-law state. But the time of monarchs has passed, and today's president may not be tomorrow's president. What will defend him before the law then? The belated sympathy of the people? Hardly... The citizens of some other country? Possibly... However, there is still time before one of these situations arises, and we should give some thought to realities. And think out loud, inasmuch as what evokes our concern today should without fail to arouse the concern of all our countrymen. After all, under the slogans of building a rule-of-law state and affirming the principles of democracy, violations of the law are being committed before our very eyes, including also on the part of the president of the republic, who, in accordance with the presidential oath, should be the symbol and guarantor of democracy and legality in our country. But perhaps our conclusions are hasty? "Perhaps, as a matter of fact, the president does not yet want to 'squander his gifts on trifles,' perhaps it is still too early to talk about the lack of arguments," citizens of the republic and his former admirers and comrades in arms might think, possibly desiring to preserve the last memory of their trust in the president. Possibly, they have the right to cherish their last hope, but for every more or less experienced person this question was closed long ago, as if it had not existed at all. Among these are people who are sufficiently informed of the history of the ARF Dashnaktsutyun, and, consequently, also about Dashnaktsutyun moral principles, and also those who in the last five years have succeeded in sufficiently recognizing the value of the words and deeds of the present authorities (headed by the president). In particular, with the help of the latest mutual exposures and self-exposures of the president's closest circle. At the end of his television speech on 29 June 1992 the president declared his readiness to present the pertinent facts and justify the accusations raised in his speech against the Dashnaktsutyun and its representatives, if... the "accused party" calls for the legal answerability of the president. It was already evident in those days that the real aim of the president's speech was to influence the psychology of the masses, to dispose them against Dashnaktsutyun and, by obtaining the silent consent of a majority of the people, to make short work of the party. The president, not having the legal grounds to carry out his plan, intended to make use of the support of the crowd. The ARF Dashnaktsutyun accepted the president's challenge, because not to accept it would mean, in fact, concurring with the declared accusations, especially because it was already apparent, as it is apparent now, that these accusations have no factual basis and that what has happened is just an anachronistic political "farce" undertaken for the purpose of diverting the attention of the people and the opposition from the main problems. Any political party, or any political figure, especially the president of the republic, should be well aware that their words and deeds should be calculated not for one day and not even for one year, if, of course, they do not intend to limit their activity to such a short period. They must also not forget, of course, that people can be deluded for a certain time, but no one has been able to do this for a long time, and especially continuously. And if anyone tries to be guided by a different logic, this will sooner or later reveal itself, it will reveal itself, and it will turn against them. This very same logic in our country lies at the basis of actions and resolutions on national questions; therefore it should be no surprise that those guilty of political terrorism are not being exposed, or that those who are exposed are not punished. The behavior of the authorities on many questions has boomeranged against them. For example, many are openly evading service in the army. No matter how reprehensible this phenomenon is; nevertheless, there are definite reasons for this, and we will not be wrong if we say that first among them is the bad example set for the population by the authorities, in particular by the president himself. It is now obvious that the watershed in the mutual relations of the people and the authorities continues to deepen, which in these decisive days can lead only to extremely dangerous consequences. These are questions which every Armenian should ponder seriously, especially the president of the republic.
