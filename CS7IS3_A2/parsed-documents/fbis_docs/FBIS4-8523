Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gen. Michael Rose, and others who have abused their position. "We are particulary angry at Mr. Rose because we believe that he played an emperor and called the NATO pact without any cause. Why didn't he call NATO when Moslem shelled Serb positions on Tuesday," Krajisnik told Belgrade's television network Politika. "In any case, Mr. Rose has ended his role in our battlefield and he must be removed from these regions," Krajisnik said. NATO-assigned U.S. warplanes on Sunday and Monday bombed Serb positions around the Moslem enclave of Gorazde after Serbs crushed a Moslem offensive begun from this U.N.-protected area in late March. Gen. Rose requested the NATO air strikes allegedly to protect the U.N. peace troops in Gorazde, although there were only five U.N. observers and seven British special SAS troops there, who guided the NATO planes to Serb positions. The Bosnian Serb authorities suspended relations with the UNPROFOR, including the civilian sector, after the first NATO air strike on Sunday, assessing that the U.N. peace troops had openly sided with Bosnian Moslems. Krajisnik also said that the Serb side was doing its best to answer the NATO attacks. "When the NATO pact bombs us that is one evil, but it is a double evil if we attack NATO and if we answer (its attacks)," Krajisnik said, assessing that the bombing had brought harm to the Serb people, but that its effects had remained inside the borders within which it pays to be patient in the interest of peace. "If we openly started resisting the NATO pact, downing their planes, and this will probably follow if they try to continue attacks on Serb positions, then there will be neither peace nor delimitation and many plans would fail that way," Krajisnik said.
