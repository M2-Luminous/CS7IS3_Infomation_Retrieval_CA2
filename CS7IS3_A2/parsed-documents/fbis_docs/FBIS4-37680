The paper cites diplomatic sources as saying that the Egyptian warning to Israel came in the light of diplomatic information that the Israeli army is preparing to launch a military operation against Lebanon soon. AL-SAFIR says that the Lebanese Government has received information that Israel is preparing for a military operation against Lebanon. The paper says that the Israeli General Staff is planning a military operation supervised by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who ordered that such an operation be quick and painful. Lebanese Foreign Ministry sources say that Lebanese diplomatic circles are conducting intensive contacts with Arab and international quarters to contain the escalation of Israeli attacks against Lebanon. The past few days have witnessed serious escalation in Israeli air and ground attacks against Hizballah positions in southern Lebanon and the western al-Biqa' as well as continuous Israeli shelling of al-Nabatiyah and Iqlim al-Tuffah areas. These attacks left a number of civilians dead or wounded, destroyed many houses, and set crop fields on fire.
