Both officials also discussed trade and technological exchanges between both countries since Argentina may be able to offer Australia training and modernization services. Another subject broached at the meeting was animal health and its relation with the concept of regionalization (disease-free areas) recently approved by the GATT. Sola and McMullan, who is also Cairns Group chairman, were of one mind concerning the importance of making strides in the implementation of GATT's animal and plant health framework. With regard to the Cairns Group meeting, they agreed that this group's new role is of paramount importance because since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT's trade talks, now its 14 member countries will have to monitor whether countries abide by the Final Act agreed upon in Marrakech and will have to establish the basis for future negotiations on international agricultural and livestock trade. Sola and McMullan, who arrived in Chile on 16 May, will leave for Montevideo tomorrow to attend the 14th Cairns Group meeting.
