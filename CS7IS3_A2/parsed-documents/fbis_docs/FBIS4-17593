The negotiating teams led by Defense Ministers Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy, met on April 21 and 22. It was agreed, in principle, that Ukraine would own 164 vessels, or 18.3 percent, of the Fleet, and Russia -- the remaining 669 of the Fleet's 833 ships and support boats. In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX Gromov said the vessels' age, cost and class were taken into consideration. On its own suggestion Ukraine would have more ships than previously planned (more than 18.3 pct of the Fleet's total strength) but its ships would be of a lower class, whereas Russia would have more first and second class vessels -- destroyers and large antisubmarine boats. The antisubmarine cruiser Moskva with the deadweight of 18,000 tonnes, is the Fleet's biggest ship. It is to belong to Russia. The biggest ship Ukraine is to have, is Getman Sagaidachni with the deadweight of some 4,500 tonnes. Gromov said that under the Yeltsin-Kravchuk Massandra agreement the Fleet's aircraft are to belong to Russia.
