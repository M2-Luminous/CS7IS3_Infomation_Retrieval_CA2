FR940418-0-00008 FR940418-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 117 [CGD09&hyph;93&hyph;036] Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Chicago River, IL AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is changing the operating regulations governing bridges over the Chicago River System which are owned and operated by the City of Chicago. This final rule expands the periods of time when Chicago's highway bridges need not open for the passage of recreational vessels, establishes a specific number of recreational vessels that will be required to gather in order for the bridges to open, and requires recreational vessel owner/operators or their representatives to give notice in advance of a vessel's time of intended passage through the draws. Additionally, the period of time during the winter months when the bridges need open only after receiving an advance notice is expanded. This final rule also adds a Wednesday opening for the passage of recreational vessels during the Spring break-out period (April 15&hyph;June 15). This final rule also adds the Madison Street bridge to the bridge list for the South Branch. The Madison Street Bridge was inadvertently left out of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. This action will accommodate the needs of vehicle traffic while providing for the reasonable needs of navigation. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective on April 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Unless otherwise indicated, documents referenced in this preamble are available for inspection and copying at the office of the Commander (obr), Ninth Coast Guard District, 1240 East Ninth Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44199&hyph;2060, between 6:30 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
