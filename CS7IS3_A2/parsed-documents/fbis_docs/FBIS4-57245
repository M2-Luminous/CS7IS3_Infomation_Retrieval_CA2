Jonassaint took the oath of office last Wednesday. Naranjo told the media that "the international democratic community cannot accept this maneuver by the Haitian military, led by General Raoul Cedras. It is intended to impose upon the country a president who does not represent the will of the people." He added that "we cannot accept this new show of force by the Haitian military. We condemn the arbitrary appointment of Jonassaint and share the hope for a return to democracy in this Caribbean nation." Naranjo affirmed that the Haitian crisis has had a detrimental affect on the people, who "grow ever poorer and suffer the tragedy of watching their civil rights diminished and violated every day."
