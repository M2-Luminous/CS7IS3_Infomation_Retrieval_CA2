Ministers from the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest group in the coalition, opposed such a move, with ministers from other parties saying a consumption tax hike and the income tax cut are inseparable. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii reiterated his appeal for implementing an income tax cut in a package with a consumption tax hike. "If two- to three-year deficit-financing bonds are used, it would mean discharging (debts) untreated," said Fujii, a member of Shinseito, at a press conference. He was referring to proposals to issue deficit-covering bonds to pay for the tax cut. International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, also from Shinseito, voiced opposition to an income tax cut without securing a way to pay for it. Kumagai said at a separate press conference that if the government decides on "an irresponsible tax cut," public confidence in politics would be eroded. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata also indicated that a consumption tax hike is needed to finance both an income tax cut and an expected tax revenue shortfall. "Given there is a revenue shortfall as such, the government cannot avoid discussing the issue of how to secure tax revenues," he said. Takenori Kanzaki, minister of posts and telecommunications and a member of Komeito, the second-largest party within the coalition, also voiced support for a consumption tax hike to finance an income tax cut. "There is a need to include a hike in the consumption tax rate," Kanzaki said. But cabinet members from the SDP opposed raising the consumption tax as a way to finance a major income tax. Transport Minister Shigeru Ito, an SDP member, told a press conference that if a consumption tax hike is mentioned in a stimulus package to be adopted Thursday, there will be no stimulative effect. Sadao Yamahana, minister in charge of political reform, and Economic Planning Agency Director General Manae Kubota, both from the SDP, joined Ito in opposing a consumption tax hike. "There are many problems with a hike in the consumption tax rate in light of its psychological effects," Yamahana said. Kubota criticized a government tax commission report suggesting that an income tax cut be considered together with a consumption tax hike. "The Tax Commission is thinking of taxes alone. It's no good to think in a vertically divided manner," she said. Government ministers and representatives from the seven parties in the coalition government are to meet Wednesday to make a decision on whether to include in the package a future raise in the 3 percent consumption tax rate to finance a planned income tax cut. The proposed income tax cut is expected to become the centerpiece of a new pump-priming package Hosokawa's cabinet is to finalize Thursday at their meeting.
