Abiding by the most enthusiastic, unanimous demand of our beloved compatriots, in my capacity as the king of the Kingdom of Cambodia I would like to urgently beseech the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] and Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] and the PDK and National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] to immediately accept my formal and solemn proposal for an immediate, complete, and unconditional cease-fire and a standstill of all current positions of both sides. 2. If this cease-fire proposal is already accepted by the RGC and KRAF and the PDK and NADK, I invite the RGC and KRAF and the PDK and NADK to immediately send me two generals of the KRAF and two other generals of the NADK to form, under my chairmanship, a cease-fire observation committee to oversee this cease-fire throughout the Cambodian territory. 3. The roundtable proposal of which your excellency has already been aware for the past few days will be held inside the royal palace in Phnom Penh or at the Cambodian palace in Pyongyang when the cease-fire throughout Cambodia becomes truly effective and concretely secure. Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen have agreed with and given their full support to this proposal since the afternoon of Monday, 2 May 1994. Presently, I am confident that your excellency will make your answer to my above proposal known to me. Affectionately yours, [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk [Dated] Phnom Penh, 3 May 1994
