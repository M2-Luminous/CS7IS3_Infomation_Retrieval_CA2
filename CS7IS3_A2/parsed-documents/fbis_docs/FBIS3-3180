He said he left Beijing of his own accord to avoid intensifying the conflict between the government and pro-democracy activists. On the other hand, as it is believed that many dissidents still are being detained by the Chinese authorities, Krzaklewski, leader of Poland's Solidarity trade union, wrote a letter to Chinese Premier Li Peng calling on Beijing to release them. Wang Dan was interviewed by our staff reporter after returning to Beijing with Zhou Duo and Min Qi. Wang said he left Beijing because he had learned through relevant channels that if he did not leave Beijing at that time, the conflict between the government and some pro-democracy activists -- including himself -- would likely be intensified. Under the strong persuasion of Zhou Duo and other friends, and in order to avoid intensifying the conflict, he left Beijing for Xiamen. Wang stressed that the place and means of travel were decided of his own accord and that his freedom of movement during this period was not restricted or interfered with. Meanwhile, Wang corrected news agencies' remarks, saying that he also returned to Beijing of his own accord. Since he did not meet with any obstruction or warnings, he guessed that the government had given tacit consent to his move. According to news agency reports, after staying in Xiamen for several days, Wang Dan returned to Beijing with government approval. In addition, Krzaklewski, leader of Poland's Solidarity trade union, wrote a letter to Li Peng, calling for the "immediate and unconditional release" of labor and pro-democracy activists, such as Wei Jingsheng, Zhou Guoqiang, Qian Yumin, Yuan Hongbin, Bao Ge, Wang Jiaqi, and Wang Dan. The letter said, "their prolonged detention constitutes a clear violation of International Labor Organization conventions protecting the right to set up trade unions." So far, however, China has acknowledged only the arrests of Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbin, and Wang Jiaqi for their "violation of the criminal law." Yesterday, the whereabouts of Wei Jingsheng and others (with the exception of Wang Dan) remained unknown.
