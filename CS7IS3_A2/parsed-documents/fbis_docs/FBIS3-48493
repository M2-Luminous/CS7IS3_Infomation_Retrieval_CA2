"We requested that the United States be prudent in extending his visa or giving him residentship in consideration of the fact that Kim once served in diplomacy and national security and that he is implicated in an irregularity," Hong said. Washington formally confirmed Wednesday morning that Kim has applied for permanent residentship. "It was a preliminary confirmation," he said. "It's preliminary because Washington has not given any details other than that Kim has applied, such as where or how he applied." Seoul officials say they do not know Kim's whereabouts. The former top presidential secretary for diplomacy and national security left for the United States last April as a guest researcher at the Heritage Foundation. He has virtually been in hiding since reports in Seoul that he took bribes from lobbyists selling arms to Korea for its Yulgok (military modernization) project. Hong suggested Seoul could go beyond seeking U.S. refusal of residentship, commonly called a "green card," saying his ministry will have to consult with the Justice Ministry on whether to make additional requests to Washington. Sources said that one possible request would be to have the Americans investigate Kim. Washington officials told Seoul via the South Korean Embassy that they will take Kim's case into consideration and make a prudent decision after internal consultation. "There are many legal aspects to consider," Hong said. "The decision will take time."
