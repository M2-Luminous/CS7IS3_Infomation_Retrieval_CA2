However, Turkey lost all four. In fact, it lost, and is still losing, a great deal. Turkey lost its trade with Iraq through which it used to make $20 billion annually. It also lost 400,000 job opportunities which were available to workers in restaurants and gas filling stations as well as to the kids on the road to Zakho and the drivers and owners of 17,000 Turkish trucks which used to transport goods to Iraq. If we also count the family members of these workers, drivers, and truck owners we get a clear picture of the great damage that has hit that region. But what is more important than all that and which cannot be compensated or evaluated in dollars, whether U.S. or Gulf dollars, is the serious threat which the Americans pose to Turkey's national security and territorial integrity which, as we know, has always been the main obsession of all governments in Turkey. The Americans and the British have created a so-called "security zone" for Kurds in northern Iraq guarded by an Anglo-American force which they termed the "Hammer Force" to use as a tool which, they believe, would help them shake up the leadership of Saddam Husayn. They and their agents in Saudi Arabia wagered that the situation in Iraq would not last for more than six months. But their wager failed miserably. When the first six months passed, they extended the presence of this "hammer" another six months in the hope that their wishes and wagers would materialize. But they also failed. The renewal was repeated every six months and the Americans and British were disappointed six times. Yesterday, the Turkish Parliament renewed the presence of this "hammer" for the seventh abortive time. The result of the voting in the Turkish Parliament on the seventh renewal was as follows: - The deputies who voted for the renewal were 193. - The deputies who voted against the renewal were 147. - And, the deputies who were absent were 110. Although the renewal decision obtained the "legal" majority, the large number of deputies who voted against the renewal and those who were absent -- it was said that most of them had stayed away deliberately -- indicates that the decision did not gain the "political" majority. This means that the opposition to U.S. presence, which has become a real threat to Turkey's national security and territorial integrity, U.S. tampering with the question of the pipeline which carries Iraqi oil across Turkey, the pressure being brought to bear on Turkey concerning the Cyprus issue, the campaigns which are being waged in Europe and the United States against the violation of human rights in Turkey, and the lack of a U.S. desire to open the Zakho gateway before Turkish trucks; all these facts have for some time now aroused strong reactions among Turkish nationalist parties and figures which have reached the point of disgust at the continuous U.S. domination and pressure to influence Turkish national policy in order to satisfy the egos of worthless politicians in Washington. But what is regrettable is that in his defense before the Turkish Parliament of the decision to renew the presence of the Hammer Force, Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said: "Were it not for this force, the Turkish Army would not have been able to cross into northern Iraq from time to time to strike at elements of the Turkish Kurdish Workers Party-PKK. He also said: "It is the prerogative of the Turkish Government to ask these forces to leave Turkey whenever it wants. That time will come when Baghdad abides by all the UN resolutions and enters into a direct dialogue with the Kurds, Turkmen, and other nationalities." Cetin noted: "This subject will be discussed during a meeting of the foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran, and Syria in Damascus next month." Here, we would like to remind the Turkish foreign minister of the following facts: 1. Coordination between the subversive organizations in northern Iraq and the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] in Turkey has actually increased with the presence of the "Hammer Force." Turkey has carried out several large scale air raids on PKK military bases in northern Iraq without avail. 2. The coordination which existed before the U.S. aggression between Iraq and Turkey on issues concerning border security was most effective and security conditions in both Turkey and Iraq were stable, calm, and satisfactory to both sides. 3. The so-called "security zone" has not been secure for a long time. In fact, we are not exaggerating when we say that this zone has witnessed, and continues to witness, under the ignorant U.S. hegemony the worst state of insecurity and instability similar to the one existing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially after Iran has also come in to secure a foothold for itself in the region -- something which it would not have dared to do in the past -- through the formation and training of Islamic movements operating under the direction of the Tehran ayatollahs. 4. Turkish-Iranian cooperation on this issue in particular is more beneficial to Iran than it is to Turkey under the existing insecure conditions in northern Iraq. By cooperating with Iran, avoiding cooperation with Iraq, and approving U.S. policy in the region, the Turkish side places all its cards before the Iranian side. Turkey will not gain anything from this cooperation other than more headaches. it is understood that for some time now Iran has been preparing and backing subversive movements which claim to be Islamic inside and outside Turkey and that the current situation in northern Iraq is so precarious that Iranian presence in it has become clear, thanks to the "security zone" policy which is supported by Turkey. If the Turkish side is unaware of these facts or ignores them, this is a tragedy. While it is correct from the legal viewpoint, as the Turkish foreign minister has said, that the Turkish Government has the prerogative to ask these forces to leave Turkey whenever it wants, the question is: Can Turkey do that politically? Moreover, what is the relationship between the Hammer Force and Iraq's implementation of the Security Council resolutions? Why does the Turkish foreign minister purposely mix the cards when he knows full well that the Hammer Force was a unilateral hostile action by the Americans and that there is no Security Council resolution authorizing them to take this action? Cetin also knows full well that Iraq has implemented its obligations under the Security Council resolutions and that several states, including three major powers, are demanding a partial or total lift of the blockade on Iraq since it has fulfilled its obligations. Cetin also says that the time to ask these forces to leave will come when Baghdad enters into a direct dialogue with the Kurds, Turkmen, and other nationalities. Although such talk constitutes an interference in Iraq's internal affairs and is therefore rejected, Cetin knows full well also that the Iraqi Government had entered into a deep and wide dialogue with the Kurds and reached an agreement with the Kurdish parties in September 1991. We were about to sign and announce this agreement were it not for the interference of the U.S. Administration which prevented the Kurds from signing it and kept them prisoners in the "U.S. protectorate." Cetin should remember also that one of the problems of the Kurdish region is the refusal and inability of the Turkish side to hold a dialogue with 15 million Kurds in its own country all these past years. Unfortunately, it seems that the Turkish side has been infected by U.S. double-standards. The day will come when the hammer will fall on the heads of the worthless politicians in Washington and London.
