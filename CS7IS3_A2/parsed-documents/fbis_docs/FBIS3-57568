Russian officials earlier had promised to end the delay and hand the files over by Jan. 27. The head of the Russian passport office at Paldiski today failed to turn out for a scheduled meeting with the Estonian commandant of the town, Col. Raul Luks, said Taimi Laar, municipal secretary at Paldiski. Estonian officials say it is impossible to prepare for elections for the Paldiski town council or establish a normal civilian rule in the town until the files are delivered. Justice Minister Kaido Kama, however, has said the files drawn up and held by the local Russian police office without any authorized supervision lately cannot be trusted. He said that even if the files were to be returned, Estonia would still have to call a new municipal census, and the country's own officials will have to register the town's legal residents anew. Laar said the Russian passport office until very lately had continued issuing Estonian resident's passport inscriptions, which currently is the only means of confirming the passport holder's permanent resident's status. She insisted that the office close its doors finally by Thursday. "If they won't close the doors by Jan. 27, we will have every reason to raise alarm," she added.
