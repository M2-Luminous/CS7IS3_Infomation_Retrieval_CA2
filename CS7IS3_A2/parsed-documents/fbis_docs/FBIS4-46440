Ocalan: It could be said that the special warfare is now trying to launch its final onslaught by turning for the last time to its domestic and foreign supporters and to its highly developed combat experience. In his latest statement, the Chief of General Staff Dogan Gures said: "They have three to four months to live." During his visit to Sirnak he also said: "We have other weapons not used so far." He was, of course, implying chemical weapons. He says: "If need be, we can use them too." This is a great threat. Already, nothing has remained unused. Such statements clearly show that the regime is in a difficult bind. He wants to use the last few months in office to accomplish his annihilation mission -- and this has been practiced for the last millennium -- in a manner befitting his ancestors. This is barbarism. [passage omitted decrying regime] KURD-A: You know the situation in South Kurdistan [Iraqi Kurdistan]. How do you assess Turkey's role in the clashes between the Democratic Party of Kurdistan [DPK] and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK]? Ocalan: This is how the plan worked out recently is unfolding. The head of the special warfare is shouting every day: "We want to attack northern Iraq with a joint plan." They have forged an underhanded agreement with the Iraqi regime. [passage omitted] Besides, there is also the interests of the United States and the "new world order." Under this "new order" the United States cannot give unconditional approval to Turkey's blind, colonialist-imperialist ambitions. Otherwise, its own interests will be under threat. Turkey also wants to launch an imperialist-colonialist policy no less inferior than the U.S.. Therefore, there are contradictions among them, even if at tactical level. Turkey will also experience similar contradictions with Iran and Syria. [passage omitted] Unlike Turkey, the United States might not like the Saddam regime to exist in its present form. Turkey has oil pipeline problems, a serious economic crisis, and wants to monopolize the economic plunder in Iraq. This is a vital issue. Therefore, friction with the United States was inevitable. Essentially, there is a plan, which has been worked out over the last three months, to completely eliminate the PKK. The Chief of General Staff Dogan Gures has made a promise to the Turkish nation and is now saying: "I will definitely fulfill this promise." They have now formulated a plan, which somewhat resembles the 1992 plan, but it is not completely identical. This is rather a Turkey-patented plan. We are not in a position to say exactly what extent this plan obtained the United States' approval. The Germans and the French are possibly behind this plan. It could even be that Russia has decided not to raise much clamor about it. They might even want to enlist Iran in this plan. We know that initiatives in this direction are taking place, Demirel has decided to pay a visit to Iran. Demirel also went to Egypt, most probably to enlist Egypt in this plan. He might want to secure an Egyptian role in Kurdistan similar to the latter's role during the Iraqi incursion into Kuwait. The United States might decide to give direction to this plan. We think that the United States will not do such a thing because of its differences with other states, but then on the other hand it might support this plan. The situation is confusing because of these uncertainties. Who is in this plan and to what extent? What we know at this stage is that Turkey is guiding this plan, and England, and hence the United States, will not fully support it. KURD-A: What are the dimensions of this plan in the North [Kurdish regions in Turkey]? You know that there are ongoing efforts or preparations to form a Kurdish party dependent on the state. Ocalan: Yes, one wonders how a traitor Kurd [former Turkish cabinet minister Serafettin Elci], who was in the service of the special warfare just yesterday, could raise up his head? He will admit his Kurdish identity but will remain thoroughly loyal to the Turkish state! He will be Muslim but will not endorse Shari'ah. He will oppose if (we describe Shari'ah as the correct Islam)? [sentence as published] What sort of a Muslim would he be opposing Shari'ah? This is enormous duplicity and hypocrisy. I do not know if he will be liberal, but it is said that he will have links to this or that! There has never been such an extreme blend of reactionism and progressivism! It is said that the person in question is aiming to become the Ozal of the Kurds. They say the revolutionary war will be crushed within few months, that the plan has already been put into effect, and that they have great hopes of success. They would not have been able to prolong their success had they not been so hopeful. The traitors have pinned great hope on Turkey's success. They were also pinning the same hopes on the 1992 Southern war [when Turkey launched attacks in northern Iraq] and were shouting "long live Turkey." These were the slogans used in greeting their real masters in their difficult days. Now they trust Turkey even more, apparently they have received guarantees. This movement of agents and traitors is biding its time. The revolutionary militanism and patriotism is being suppressed and eliminated in the South. The plan is also to eliminate them in the north and lay a huge Kurdistan table in front of them [agents and traitors]! They would be allowed to sell off as much as they could, eat as much as they want, but it would be sufficient not for forty but for four hundred years, and that would save their lineage! Yes, all the collaborationists are acting within this plan. It is obvious how cruel the plan is. It applies to those who have no relation to homeland, people, freedom, and life, and who have involved in plunder, exploitation of labor, and sucked human blood to make such ghastly fun of people as old as mankind, not to let-up their oppressive grip on the people, and to deceive themselves with the claim that they are "succeeding" on this issue. KURD-A: Finally, we want to know how you assess this existing situation from PKK's perspective. Ocalan: At this point revolutionary tactics enter the developments. Sometimes, a situation arises requiring the reassessment of tactics. PKK has some experience in this direction. We have prepared ourselves considerably against DPK's stealthy politics. For the last 20 years of ideological, political, and practical work, we have been duty-bound to formulate correct positions against it. Basically, our tactic is to prevent DPK's collaborationism. We are faced with a situation of constantly giving replies. This will not only be a wide initiative within Kurdistan, it will also spill the problem over to the international level; it will lead to the emergence of some sort of an independent force and open the way for intensive diplomacy. It will seriously affect Turkey. It will not only bring its plan to destroy Kurdistan to naught, but also open the way for revolutionary war plans to gain strength. It will not lead to suffocation but breathing, not to retreat but advance and growth. Already there are Northerners now going to the South. Already the people in the North have physically joined with the people in the South. The people living on two sundered fragments should unite in some way. In 1990 the people of South got to know the people of the North, and now the people of the North are uniting with the people of the South. This will have international repercussions. It may open the way for UN support. All these will enormously strain Turkey's regional balances and status quo. Without a doubt we will put all these into effect. More importantly, we will intensify our activity. We will apply pressure in the political and diplomatic arenas. It appears that this counter-revolutionary plan has increased the chances of the revolutionary plan. That is, this counter-revolutionary plan might feed the revolutionary plan; it could be utilized for that purpose. We are not carried away with illusions. Most importantly, we are not waiting for developments to take their own turn. Developments could be given a direction by hard work.
