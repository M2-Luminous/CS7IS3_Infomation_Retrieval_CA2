An Analysis of China's Stock Market"] [Excerpt] Editor's Note The stock market is extraordinarily sensitive. The investment psychology of major economic decision makers and of the shareholding public may cause stock market fluctuations. Conversely, stock market developments also have a certain affect on the decisions of decision makers and the shareholding public. For some time since the beginning of 1994, the stock market has been at low ebb. How this should be regarded -- is it depressed or is it stable? -- requires calm analysis. Both the decision making level and the shareholding public must maintain a clear head to make prudent decisions. Although China's stock markets got off to a good start during the first week of 1994, during the remaining three weeks of January, the overall share price index on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets continue to slide. By 28 January, the overall share price index on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets had fallen 13.62 and 11.87 points respectively. This brings to mind 1993 when the share price index for the year fluctuated within a narrow range, and groups active in the share market (shareholders, share evaluators, and securities traders) reacted the same way as the share price index, reaching the conclusion that China's stock markets had entered a depressed and turbid state. The author disagrees. On the contrary, he feels that China's stock markets are not depressed but stable. Manifestations of the Stability of China's Stock Markets First, for the year as a whole, the stock markets made virtually no big leaps during 1993. The Shanghai overall share price index bobbed around near 900 points, and the Shenzhen overall share price index mostly shifted around 250 points. The share price index projects the best picture of market activity. No matter whether it goes up or down, so long as there are no alarmingly dangerous leaps, when the share price index moves gradually within relative limits -- including a gradually decline -- one should feel optimistically that the stock market is exhibiting a stable trend. Even though the overall view is that the stock market trend was toward a slide in 1993, this slide was gradual, and fluctuations were not great. This was the most direct manifestation of the stability of China's stock markets. Second, no major surprises occurred in China's stock markets during 1993. This precluded the most direct reasons for stock market upheavals. Such a beneficial situation was the best possible reminder for those engaged in stock market activity. Thus those who directly played a part in stock market activity were in a peaceful frame of mind and went about their business in a steady way to lay the foundation for stability in China's stock markets. Though some buying wars occurred during 1993, and some spurious information circulated, causing tumult in the stock market, the vigorous intervention of the authorities and the close cooperation of shareholders promptly defused the problem to eliminate disturbances. Thus, China's stock markets showed stability. Third, 5 billion shares were issued publicly, and they were sold in every city in the country. Such an action was unprercedented since founding of the people's republic. Furthermore, the safe, orderly, and complete fulfillment of this task even more inspired people. In addition, by comparison with 1992, listings of A shares by the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges totaled 174 for a 2.35 fold increase. Listings of B shares by the two exchanges totaled 41 for a 1.28 fold increase. Listings of the shares of juridical entities totaled 17 for a 4.67 fold increase. This manifold issuing and listing activity greatly eased the discrepancy between supply and demand in China's stock markets, and the whole process was completed without fanfare. This is the best indicator of the stability of China's stock markets. Fourth, departments in charge of negotiable securities recently announced that 5.5 billion shares of stock would be issued openly during 1994. This loosening of the "share supply" strongly confirms the government's confidence in the stability and momentum of China's stock markets. It may be further inferred that it is only because of the stability of China's stock markets that the government is extremely pleased, and has the assurance needed to increase the issuance of shares by 5.5 billion. If one assumes that China's stock markets are depressed rather than stable, it is very difficult to imagine that the government would loosen rather than tighten the "share supply." (Note: The author has coined the term "share supply," from the term "money supply." It applies to the amount of shares issued. If the amount issued is large, this is termed a loosening of the share supply and vice versa). Reasons for the Stability of China's Stock Markets 1. Gradual Founding and Improvement of the Legal System. The turbulence in China's stock markets of recent years attests to the truth of the saying that "without rules, nothing can be done well." Consequently, once China's stock markets suffered setbacks and had to try harder, the establishment and perfection of stock market laws and regulations became a priority matter for the Chinese Government. The "Temporary Regulations on the Regulation of Stock Share Issuance and Trading," which the State Council promulgated in April 1993, and "Corporation Law of the People's Republic of China," which the NPC promulgated in December 1993, are notable examples. This brought the Chinese share system and stocks markets under legal regulation for the first time. Today, the number of national level documents pertaining to share system laws and regulations, articles, provisional regulations, etc. number more than 20. In addition, the securities exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and in every jurisdiction in the country have drawn up regulations and articles that apply to their own circumstances, thereby beginning to shape a legal system for China's share system and stock markets, which lays a foundation for the stability of China's stock markets. 2. Loosening share supply to ease the share shortage. It must be admitted that the doubling and redoubling of share prices of the past several years has been extremely abnormal. The main reason for this was a tightening of the money supply which produced a huge gap between the supply and demand for shares. The issuance of 5 billion worth of shares in 1993 eased the supply problem and expanded listings somewhat, giving more shareholders a chance to take part in stock market operation. Therefore, the fall in share prices is entirely normal; the stock market positively should not be blamed. Loosening of the share supply has been an effective means of stabilizing China's stock markets. 3. Determined Stamping Out of Illegal Trading. Illegal trading (including insider trading and trading between legal entities without approval, people issuing and trading shares unauthorizedly outside the market) poses an extremely great threat to the legal trading of shares inside markets. It can indirectly influence popular feeling and damage confidence, or even cause a hedging flow of share capital inside or outside the market, which can become a damaging factor that causes market upheavals. In 1993, the Chinese Government resolutely stamped out spontaneous illegal black market trading, thereby ensuring the stability of China's stock markets. 4. Crackdown on Speculation, Improving Supervision and Control. Improper speculation will directly set off market upheavals. For example, spreading of false information, insider trading, cross trading, and abuse of official position to obtain shares are all within the category of improper speculation. Any such conduct can alter the direction of flow of share capital causing one party to rejoice at the expense of another party's sadness, thereby making the market fluctuate abnormally. In 1993, the authorities concerned adopted measures and took action to control the quality of information passed around, and seriously punished offenders. They also firmly enforced the "Three Impartials" [sangong 0005 0361] principle, thereby reducing deer [lu 7773] markets to stabilize the stock markets. 5. Wringing the Water Out of the Stock Markets. The sharp increase in share prices during recent years has been complex. Therefore, the primary and secondary market share price, and market value are seriously at odds with original value causing a bubble phenomenon. The 1993 increase in shares and various measures gradually squeezed water out of the stock market, eliminating the bubble phenomenon for a great narrowing of the gap between the original share price and the primary and secondary market share price. This has restored the original value of shares. It is a major element in stock market stabilization. 6. Open and Fair Issuance of Subscription Forms. The shortage of shares and the even worse shortage of subscription forms led directly to the "10 August affair." In 1993, subscription forms were issued openly and fairly, most forms being issued in unlimited numbers so that everyone had an opportunity to buy shares. It dispelled the concentration in the hands of a few of opportunities to buy, narrowed the difference between the issuing price and the list price, and successfully suppressed subscription form scalping and stock scalping by large illegal traders, thereby creating stable conditions for truthfulness in stock price listings. 7. Gradual Maturation of Shareholders. Risk awareness has become a part of most shareholders. Haphazard coat tailing, stock churning, and other stupidities are no longer in vogue in the stock market. Many shareholders are not adept at analyzing the market and entering in prudently. Consequently, it is only natural that the stock market is stable. 8. Rise in Bank Interest Rates and Issuance of Government Bonds. The continuous rise in bank interest rates in less than two months during 1993, and the issuance of 30 billion yuan worth of government bonds immobilized most savings, thereby causing a severe shortage of funds for share speculation. Interest rates stood up well to share dividends. When people compared their confidence in the banks with stock market risk, they chose the banks. In a certain sense, both bank funds and stock market funds stabilized. 9. A fine political and economic situation. During 1993, virtually no serious political or economic ups and downs occurred. In particular, the macroeconomic regulation and control measures of June, and the assumption that the market economy would continue were keystones in the creation of stock market stability. Reasons for the Mistaken Notion That the Stock Markets Are Depressed Just why is it that some people have come to the conclusion that China's stock markets are depressed? 1. Lopsided comparisons with the past several years. What have the past several years been like? During 1990 and 1991, share prices increased manifold. Against the special background of the times, stock market operation was completely askew. Some people's rambling summarization of experiences in stock speculation at that time make others laugh when they think about it. It was less a boom than chaos. And today? Thanks to the building of a legal system and other factors, particularly the gradual increase in the number of shares issued and market trading, China's stock markets have become routine. The spread between primary and secondary market prices is also reasonable. As a result, wild rises in share prices have naturally disappeared. If one makes a lopsided comparison with this state of affairs, of course he will reach the conclusion that the stock markets are depressed. However, what we need is stability and not the chaos of a false boom. 2. Misunderstanding of the Expansion of Stock Market Capacity. China's share system must be resolutely continued. Expansion of stock market capacity is inevitable. Some people feel that the expansion of capacity led to stock market depression. This is a biased view. During the last half of 1993, stock market expansion was particularly intense yet the markets did not falter dramatically. The overall share price index on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges hovered around the 870 and 250 mark. Moreover, it was precisely this expansion of capacity that eased the share supply problem, suppressed speculation, brought in many new shareholders, and created conditions for enterprise share system scale operation. If any difference about depression and stability remain, that is bound to produce a misunderstanding about this expansion. No matter, continuing to expand stock market capacity is the inevitable result of the on-going development of share system pilot projects. 3. Efforts To Solidify Personal Benefits. Some old shareholders and securities traders are prone to feel that the stock markets are depressed. This is because of the following: 1) As a result of the release of large amounts of share capital, returns from the shares they hold have depreciated rapidly; 2) when the cost index of shareholdings if fairly high, it is difficult to attract shareholders to buy and sell; 3) the leeway for speculation is reduced; 4) the market price and the original price are close, which slows trading and reduces securities traders' trading fees; 5) idle funds enter the market gingerly, securities traders' business volume declining as a result. For the foregoing reasons, both old shareholders and some securities traders' vested interests and incremental increase in returns are eroded. In order to solidify their personal interests, they naturally hope that the more the market "booms" the better, and the less market capacity expands the better, because in both cases they can reap tremendous returns in the long run. Because of their business interest, they naturally have a pessimistic view. Conclusions and Suggestions 1. The author positively does not advocate an unabated slide in the share price index but rather stands for a correct understanding of current market conditions. The author hopes that the share price index will gradually rise, but not shoot up; otherwise a share price decrease in the future will mean greater losses for trading groups engaged in stock market activity. 2. We should cherish the stable and favorable stock market situation. The media and stock market trading groups should not one-sidedly fan a stock market "boom." A stable stock market is important to China's social stability, and it is also the key to intensifying trials of the share system. One must understand that maintenance of stock market stability is no easy matter, and that its destruction may occur in an instant. Furthermore, its destruction may rock the whole society. 3. We must continue to build and perfect applicable laws and regulations, persist in the expansion of capacity, adhere to the unlimited issuance of subscription forms, continue to loosen the share supply, use bank interest rates and treasury returns ingeniously, improve use of bank interest rates and treasury bond returns, improve supervision and control, and stamp out illegal trading. Then China's stock markets will certainly be stable, and will move in the direction of a real boom.
