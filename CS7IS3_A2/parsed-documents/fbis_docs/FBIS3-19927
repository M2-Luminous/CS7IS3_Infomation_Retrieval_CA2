Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos made his remarks when he was asked what Greece's stance would be following UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's proposal to send 1,000 Turkish blue helmets to Bosnia. According to Venizelos, no formal decision has been made. He said Greece is optimistic and expects the criteria governing the composition of the peacekeeping forces will remain in force. Venizelos pointed out that Turkey, in addition to its historic impediment in the region, has no legal right to participate in the UN peacekeeping forces, because of the Turkish occupation of Cyprus. Asked if Greece has expressed any desire to participate in the UN force, the spokesman said: It is one thing to utilize particular procedural possibilities and participate in conferences, and it is another thing to insist on the firm criteria on the composition of the UN peacekeeping forces. Venizelos stressed that Greece is not considering the possibility of Greek blue helmets going to Bosnia and said that Greek foreign policy moves within the framework that was decided at the latest party leaders conference chaired by the president.
