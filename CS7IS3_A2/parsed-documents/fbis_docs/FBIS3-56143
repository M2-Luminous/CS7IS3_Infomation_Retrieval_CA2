Shumeyko's name appeared on slips with nominations filed by every member of the chamber ahead of the actual voting, which is also to be by secret ballot. If the same number of ballots are cast in his favour as there were nominations it will take Shumeyko over the 50-percent hurdle and land him safely in the chair. On Wednesday, in the first round of voting this pro-Yeltsin candidate missed the election by a single vote by scoring 85 votes, one short of the required 86 vote majority. But the second round confusingly brought his figure down to 81, just two votes ahead of his main rival, Siberian industrialist Petr Romanov. The situation has changed in an unpredictable manner again. Today Romanov was renominated by a mere 37 people. The other challengers, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of an ethnic Kalmik Republic, and Eduard Rossel, the leader of the powerful association of several industrial regions in the Urals, got few votes each and have next to no chance to be elected.
