According to unofficial information, a private meeting between Serhiy Tsekov and Borys Oliynyk, who heads the Ukrainian parliamentary delegation, was held prior to the beginning of Ukrainian-Crimean parliamentary negotiations. Serhiy Holovatyy and Oleksandr Skipalskyy, members of the Ukrainian delegation, informed a UNIAN correspondent that no decision on any issue was made as of 1700 [1400 GMT]. Commenting on the current situation, Volodymyr Hrynyov, cochairman of the Interregional Bloc of Reforms, said that what the Crimean parliament did demonstrates that the first step toward Ukraine's federative structure has been taken. He believes that the only appropriate way out of the situation is to follow the example of Russia and Tatarstan, which did not allow the situation to escalate. V. Hrynyov believes that Ukraine must use that example because, except for a federation, he can see no other way. "You cannot hide the truth, and that it had to be this way was clear as long ago as when the previous Supreme Council passed the law "on delimiting powers between the state bodies of Ukraine and Crimea." Volodymyr Hrynyov believes that compromise can cause furious disagreement in the parliament. From Simferopol: Viktor Mezhak, deputy chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea Praesidium and leader of the People's Party of Crimea, told a UNIAN correspondent on 24 May that the Crimean delegation at the negotiations in Kiev intended to press for strict compliance with the law "on delimiting powers between Ukraine and Crimea" and, in particular, on the annulment of the Ukrainian presidential directives on reorganizing the Crimean Internal Affairs and Justice Ministries and the Security Service. He said the formation of Crimean authorities was the prerogative of the Republic of Crimea, as well as on the obligatory provision for the Crimean side of information on any Ukrainian troop movements on the territory of the peninsula, and so on. The Crimean delegation will also demand that the the office of the Ukrainian presidential representative in Crimea be disbanded.
