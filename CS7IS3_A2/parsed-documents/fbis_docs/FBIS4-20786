Opposition members in the Rajya Sabha, particularly the Janata Dal and the CPI (Communist Party of India) today objected to the Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, making a statement in Patiala about the acceptance of the recommendations of the Malhotra Committee, which went into the issue of restructuring the insurance sector. Raising the matter during zero hour, Mr. Jaipal Reddy, JD (Janata Dal), said the Finance Minister had said in the course of his budget speech that the Malhotra Committee recommendations were under the active consideration of the Government. When Parliament was in session, the Finance Minister had announced in Patiala that most of the committee's recommendations had been accepted. Saying that the Finance Minister should have informed Parliament first, Mr. Reddy said he had committed contempt of Parliament. Mr. Reddy was strongly supported by Mr. M.A. Baby, CPI(M), who said the Minister should not have made the statement outside Parliament. -- PTI
