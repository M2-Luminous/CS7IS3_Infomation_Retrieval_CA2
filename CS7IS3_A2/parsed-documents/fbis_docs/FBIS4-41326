He said, "there are many indications testifying to the opposition's involvement in these acts, although we lack conclusive proof." "Using various channels, Russia has warned the leaders of the Tajik armed opposition about the threat of these methods. If we discover that the opposition is involved in these acts, our answer will be very severe," Adamishin said. He stressed the fact that "Russia undertakes certain measures to bar the wave of terror. Combat patrolling has been introduced in places densely populated by ethnic Russians, and armed guard has been reinforced." Adamishin does not rule out that the crimes committed in Tajikistan can affect the course of the inter-Tajik dialogue underway in Tajikistan. "Those who plan and accomplish these actions strive not only to provoke trouble inside Tajikistan but to attack the negotiation process between the government and the opposition," he said. Adamishin expressed satisfaction with the fact that despite numerous difficulties inter-Tajik dialogue had been resumed. Russia, he said, had made a significant contribution to this process. "The major task of the Teheran round is to develop the results achieved at the negotiations in Moscow, namely to adopt the agreement on a cease-fire and hostilities along with several political measures inside Tajikistan as the opposition insists," he said. Referring to the data presented by the Russian representatives at the negotiations in Teheran, Adamishin also said that the work on this agreement had been begun. "It is being carried out on the basis of the draft proposed by the U.N. envoy Ramiro Piriz-Ballon. The work is proceeding slowly, but there are some improvements. I'd like to hope that both Tajik parties would finally reach an agreement," he said.
