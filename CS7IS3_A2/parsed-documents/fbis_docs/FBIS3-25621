The attackers, whose number could not be determined, killed two soldiers and took six four-wheel drive vehicles belonging to the Akokan Mining Company. During the hot pursuit launched shortly after the attack, the defense and security forces recovered two vehicles. We got this report a while ago from our permanent correspondent in Agadez, Mousselai Nazadane. This is the first rebel attack since the last technical meeting held in Ouagadougou. Following that meeting, the coordination of the four Tuareg rebel movements published its political agenda in the form of a document entitled, "Outline of the Resistance Program." In a nutshell, the rebels are claiming their right to autonomous administration of the territory they claim a right to, and guarantees that their community will be represented in the government, the National Assembly, and the Armed Forces. These are the fundamental demands of the rebels as published by the NIGER NEWS AGENCY. [passage omitted]
