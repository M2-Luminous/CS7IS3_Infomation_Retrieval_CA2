The president added that "the very same group of young people who advocate Marxism and had nothing to say when vandals attacked La Tablada Regiment" are waging the campaign to besmirch the Armed Forces. Menem met the crew of the Granville corvette that had participated in the Haiti embargo at the request of the United Nations. The ceremony took place this morning at the northern docks of the port of Buenos Aires. Defense Minister Oscar Camilion and high-ranking military officers also attended the ceremony. In his speech to welcome the sailors, Menem accused those who are signing proclamations and staging demonstrations to demand an investigation into the death of Private Omar Carrasco of "trying to resuscitate the conflict between the Armed Forces and the people." He thus criticized "those who take advantage of the unfortunate death of one soldier to pit sectors of Argentine society against one another." The president added that "these are the very same people who did not criticize the attack on La Tablada Regiment." Speaking to Radio Municipal earlier, the president warned that certain youngsters, "incensed by fashionable ideologists, play the role of useful idiots" in an effort to "make certain ideas prevail through the use of violence." He compared these groups to those "once expelled by General (Juan Domingo) Peron from Plaza de Mayo, although they bore different names and belonged to a different generation." Menem was referring to the Montoneros, who were forced to go underground after the Plaza de Mayo event. At the welcoming ceremony for the Granville corvette, Menem said: "We are sorry for what happened to the soldier in Zapala, and are making an effort to find those responsible" for the murder of Private Omar Carrasco. "The very same people who now exude hatred had nothing to say about the soldiers who were shot down during the attack" on La Tablada Regiment, on 23 January 1990, "although they, too, had fathers and mothers," the president said. Without calling them by name, Menem also lashed out at those in the south who are "staging demonstrations and signing proclamations which, based on crude lies, advocate hatred rather than peace." Menem stated that the murder of Private Carrasco "is something we are all against," but he criticized "those who always try to take advantage of this kind of thing to cause chaos and anarchy." Menem said that "this should never again happen in Argentina," and voiced his hope that "there should never be a repetition of Argentina's sorrowful and tragic recent history." In his statement to Radio Municipal, President Menem indicated that "the signs, the posters, the hatreds, the people who made armed struggle a common event in this part of the continent, are back." Although Menem said that "there are few of them," he added that they could "prepare the ground for what could come if we do not stop them in their tracks in time." He stated: "Many of these young people play the role of useful idiots." He pointed out: "If you were to ask some of these -- fortunately few -- people who Che Guevara was, you will find that they do not have the slightest idea." He added: "They know about Che's appearance, his personal style, his look [preceding word in English] as they say nowadays, but they know nothing about his ideology."
