The operation also yielded 741 kg of processed ganja, valued at over Rs 10 lakhs. The illegal crop, regularly grown in these districts for many years, was spread over 205.63 acres in 31 villages. A NCB official told TOINS [TIMES OF INDIA NEWS SERVICE] that in many areas it was found that the ganja crop had substituted cash crops like groundnut and turmeric. In other areas, the crop was found interspersed with regular crops. The official added that cultivators who had been growing ganja over 1,000 acres about ten years ago had now spread out to about 6,000 acres. One acre of crop fetched a price of as much as Rs 2 lakhs, thereby attracting more and more cultivators over the years. NCB officials found that in many cases local government officials were colluding with cultivators. However, no arrests were made during the operations as all the cultivators had fled.
