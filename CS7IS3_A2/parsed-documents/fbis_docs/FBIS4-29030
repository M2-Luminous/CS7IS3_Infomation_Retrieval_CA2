The 1994 reserve generals' advisory council meeting was held on 14 June at the War Buddies' Hall in the War Memorial, where some 200 people participated, including Yi Yang-ho, chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; high-ranking Armed Forces leaders; and reserve generals of the Army, Navy, and the Air Force. The meeting was held to discuss pending military issues through explanations about the National Defense policy and the latest North Korean military situation. Our Armed Forces' military readiness posture related to North Korea's nuclear issue and major national defense policies were discussed at the meeting. In a speech delivered prior to today's meeting, General Yi said: Under the circumstances in which tension is mounting on the Korean peninsula because of the latest North Korea's nuclear issue, our Armed Forces are completely equipped with military preparedness on the basis of the ROK-U.S. military relations. General Yi continued to say: The issue of redeeming the peacetime operational command right--on which an agreement was reached between high-ranking military officials concerned of the ROK and the United States last year--seems to be settled before the end of this year. We are planning to develop the Armed Forces through the promotion of military exchanges and cooperation with neighboring nations. (Cho Song-tae), chief of the Policy-making Office of the Ministry of National Defense, said that our Armed Forces' military preparedness related to North Korea's nuclear issue is solid. He added that we are mapping out all military countermeasures against an emergency on the basis of the ROK-U.S. combined military capability. Cho analyzed: North Korea is now suffering from triple hardships--an unrest inside its own system, an economic crisis, and an international isolation brought about by the nuclear issue. To solve these problems, North Korea is capable of launching an accidental provocation at any time. Our Armed Forces are building up military preparedness to give immediate punishment against this. In today's meeting, the director of the Intelligence on North Korea Department and the director of the Strategic Planning Department of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Headquarters gave explanations about pending military tasks and also had in-depth discussions with the participants.
