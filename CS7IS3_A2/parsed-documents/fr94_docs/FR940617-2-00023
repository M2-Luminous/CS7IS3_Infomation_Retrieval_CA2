FR940617-2-00023 FR940617-2-00010 The adjustment to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance with the United States Court of Appeals' holding that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP. Zenith Electronics Corp. v. United States , 988 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In addition, the CIT has specifically held that an adjustment should be made to mitigate the impact of expenses that are deducted from FMV and USP upon the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included in FMV. Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd. v. United States , 760 F. Supp. 200, 208 (CIT, 1991). However, the mechanics of the Department's adjustments to the USP tax adjustment and the foreign market tax amount as described above are not identical to those suggested in Daewoo . In this investigation, Venezuela began collecting a value added tax (IVA) during the POI, on October 1, 1993. Consequently, for those U.S. sales invoiced on or after October 1, 1993, we added an amount for this tax, calculated as described above, that would have been collected had the U.S. sale not been exported. For the U.S. sales invoiced prior to October 1, 1993, we also added an amount for value-added tax when no home market comparison sales were made prior to October 1, 1993 (see below). Foreign Market Value In order to determine whether there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Since Hevensa's volume of home market sales of silicomanganese lump was greater than five percent of the aggregate volume of third country sales, we determined that the home market was viable and, therefore, based FMV for silicomanganese lump on home market sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.48(a). We found that the home market was not viable for silicomanganese fines. We selected Peru as our third country market for sales of silicomanganese fines, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.49. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.46, we calculated FMV for silicomanganese lump based on delivered or FOB plant prices to unrelated customers. In light of the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit's (CAFC) decision in Ad Hoc Committee of AZ&hyph;NM&hyph;TX&hyph;FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement v. United States , Slip Op. 93&hyph;1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), the Department no longer deducts home market movement charges from FMV pursuant to its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. We instead adjust for those expenses under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56 and the exporter's sales price offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1) and (2), as appropriate. Accordingly, in the present case, we made circumstance of sale adjustments for post-sale home market movement charges under 19 CFR 353.56. This adjustment included home market inland freight and loading charges. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we also made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses and royalties. As discussed above, the IVA was only levied on sales in the home market invoiced on or after October 1, 1993. Therefore, we divided the reported home market sales into two categories, one covering home market sales invoiced during the period June-September, 1993, and one covering sales invoiced on or after October, 1993. We accounted for the application of the IVA tax only on sales invoiced on or after October 1, 1993. As the basis for FMV, we selected the home market group depending on when the U.S. sale was invoiced. For U.S. sales invoiced prior to October 1, 1993, we used the former group, and for those sales invoiced after September 30, 1993, we used the latter group. We also calculated the amount of the tax that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base (i.e., the sum of any amounts that were deducted from the tax base). See the ``United States Price'' section of this notice, above. This amount was deducted from the FMV after all other additions and deductions had been made. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.49, we calculated FMV for silicomanganese fines on FOB plant prices, inclusive of packing, to unrelated customers in Peru. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses and royalties. We deducted third country packing and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.
