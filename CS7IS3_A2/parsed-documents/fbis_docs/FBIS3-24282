I am glad to be here today among you. During my previous visits to the Europarliament, when in the West hardly anyone talked about the collapse of the last totalitarian empire of the 20th century, it was this high assembly that realized what changes occurred in my country and with its resolutions gave the support that Armenia's democracy expected from Europe--the defender of human rights and liberties. The movement of the Republic of Armenia toward independence and democracy can be characterized by the enumeration of a number of key moments. In May 1990, still under the communist order, the strong democratic movement succeeded in forming a parliament, which as early as August published a manifesto of tasks predetermining the establishment of an independent democratic state and freedom of political and economic systems. Political Sphere The Republic of Armenia became a party to international pacts concerning human rights and adopted the law on the freedom of parties. The parliament carried out political reform aimed at transforming the system of former soviets based on the principle of division of power, which made it possible to retain stability in the course of political and economic reforms under foreign conditions most difficult for the republic and under the blockade. The Republic of Armenia did not accept Gorbachev's referendum on the preservation of the Union of 17 March 1991 and on 21 September 1991 through a democratic referendum (with the fulfillment of all the requirements of USSR laws) the Republic of Armenia became an independent state. Complete freedom of speech and the press, in fact, exists in the republic. Numerous independent publications, newspapers, and journals and those belonging to various parties appear. In the Republic of Armenia today there are more than 30 parties, which are represented in the parliament. Economic Sphere As is well known, for several years Armenia has been under an economic and energy blockade, which dramatically affects our people's life and suffocates the economy. Despite all these difficulties reforms are being carried out in our country. Land privatization was carried out everywhere at the beginning of 1991, as a result of which as of now the agriculture of the Republic of Armenia is almost completely private. Housing was privatized, legislative acts were prepared for a large-scale program for privatization in production and service spheres, and 1994 was planned as the year of privatization and reform of the financial and banking system. The implemented transformations created the basis, on which the draft of the new Constitution of the Republic of Armenia was prepared. It has already undergone large-scale discussions. The adoption of the Constitution is also envisaged in 1994. On Nagorno-Karabakh The leadership of the Republic of Azerbaijan continues to reject the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem by political methods, as a result of which hostilities between the Republic of Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh become even more violent. Not having accepted the CSCE [Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe] timetable, the Republic of Azerbaijan not only reduced to naught the efforts of the Minsk CSCE group on Nagorno-Karabakh, but also officially announced its nonacceptance of UN Security Council resolutions, in which the UN Security Council called upon the parties participating in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to accept the CSCE timetable and to put an end to the bloodshed. As is well known, the Republic of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh officially accepted the timetable of the Minsk CSCE group on Nagorno-Karabakh and expressed their readiness to carry out UN Security Council resolutions. On the question of the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict the Republic of Azerbaijan to this day rejects both the peace-making mediation of the Russian Federation and all the initiatives directed toward a peaceful settlement of the conflict. The facts of the participation against this background of Afghan mujahidin, Turkish military specialists, and Russian soldiers in military operations as part of the Azerbaijani Army demonstrate that Azerbaijan relies only on the solution of the problem by force and the policy of its leadership is aimed at expanding the conflict. Having rejected all peace-making efforts, on 18 December 1993 Azerbaijan began and to this day continues an offensive--unprecedented throughout the history of the Karabakh conflict--along the entire front. A full blockade against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh on the part of Azerbaijan has continued for more than 4 years. At the same time, provocative attempts to draw the Republic of Armenia into a major military conflict do not cease. Under such conditions organized self-defense was and remains the only guarantee for the life and security of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, because the people of Nagorno-Karabakh do not have guarantees on the part of the world community. The world community should give its assessment of the aggressive policy of Azerbaijan's leadership, which stubbornly strives for an exclusive military resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh confrontation, while in the meantime some states continue to give military assistance to Azerbaijan. My visit to Strasbourg takes places within the framework of the political dialogue established between the European Union and Armenia. I am glad to note that we have succeeded in establishing this constant communication, which enables us to be better understood. I realize that we will have to traverse a long path in order to establish closer relations between our two institutions. With regard to changes in the European Union and Armenia, you know that after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the European Union and Armenia in June 1992 Armenia participated in technical assistance programs envisaged for CIS countries. Armenia also received humanitarian assistance in the European Commission (in 1993 about 18 million ECU). In particular, the latest deliveries of mazut must be noted. Armenia also received credits twice (38 and 20 million ECU), most of which went for the purchase of grain. There is another sphere, in which the European Union can help Armenia--this is the sphere of nuclear power. The serious energy crisis led to the fact that the government of Armenia adopted a decision on the restart of one unit of the Metsamor Nuclear Station. In connection with this Armenia asked the Union for technical assistance, as well as for the financing necessary for the implementation of this program. It goes without saying that the implementation of this program, the goal of which is to meet most of the energy needs, is of vital importance for the economy of my country. Such is the considerable assistance granted us by the European Union. Despite all this the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has a certain effect on mutual relations between the European Union and Armenia. Thus, despite the mandate issued to the European Commission by the European Union on the beginning of negotiations for the purpose of signing partnership agreements among all former USSR countries and the European Union, such negotiations did not begin with Armenia. The conduct of such negotiations with the Transcaucasian republics is connected with the establishment of stability in the region, in particular with the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. At the same time, Armenia--the only state in the Transcaucasus that has internal stability, has carried out serious economic reforms, has laid down the foundations for a democratic society, and respects human rights and liberties--is the object of a parity attitude on the part of the European Union: the principle of a differentiated approach to Transcaucasian countries is reduced to naught. It is difficult to understand such an attitude on Europe's part if we take into account that Armenia's attitude toward peaceful negotiations held within the framework of the Minsk CSCE group was constructive, whereas Azerbaijan's nonacceptance of the program of nine members of the Minsk group, which sets the task of implementation of UN resolutions, places on it the responsibility for the intensification of the violence in the region. In this context the European Union's breaking away from conducting any negotiations with Armenia for the purpose of concluding partnership agreements can prove to be predetermining for the process of transformations begun in Armenia. We also believe that the European Union has the opportunity to hold a more serious position in the cause of the search for the solution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict through negotiations--by means of three participant countries, which are members of the Minsk CSCE group, and the appointment of observers of the European Union there. I hope that the Europarliament will raise before the European Union and the commission matters important from its point of view and will take advantage of its opportunities to inform the Union's legal institutions of all these factors and to submit proposals to them for rendering technical, financial, and humanitarian assistance to Armenia.
