The overall price increase should reach around 7 to 9 percent, and although prices for some goods will go even higher, more than half of all prices should remain the same, said social democrat Audrius Rudys. Rimantas Stanikunas, head of the State Prices and Competition Service, said higher bread prices, which should go up by around 20 percent, will be the worst experience for consumers. He said the service and bakeries in Vilnius will try to keep bread prices as low as possible. Members of the Budget and Finance Committee, all of whom represent different political parties, said prices should jump only once. In their words, some store owners may use the opportunity to inflate prices. But the competition service said it will take strict measures against enterprises which will ungroundedly increase state-controlled prices. The lawmakers said all other prices should be regulated by the market. Rudys said the price increase is "the price to be paid for proper order in the tax system." He said producers and sellers will avoid non-registered payers of the value-added tax. Besides, the lawmaker said, the new tax will also help collect other taxes which are now concealed. Rudys noted, however, that not enough effort was made to explain the essence of the new tax to the public, while explanatory work usually takes more than a year in other countries. The new tax is expected to increase budget receipts by 2 to 3 percent. Lithuania's 18-percent tax is smaller than in a majority of European countries where the value-added tax is 18 to 21 percent, and as much as 25 percent in Denmark.
