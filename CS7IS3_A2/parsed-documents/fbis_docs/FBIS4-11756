The questions involve his name, family, his true ties to Palestine, etc. Why are these questions being raised now? Why weren't they asked on such a large scale when 'Arafat experienced a meteoric rise to fame against the backdrop of armed struggle? These questions are definitely the result of skepticism. The "rebel" who sparked off armed resistance in 1965 is now a would-be "governor". The identity of a "rebel" lies in his rifle. A rebel can also lead others while he remains in caves and hideouts and walks the streets wearing a mask. However, a ruler cannot rule wearing a mask and cannot become a head of state without revealing his identity. The Arabs of Palestine, just like all other Arabs, care a great deal about knowing people and their background, even if this means little to them. Faced with such questions, what will 'Arafat do? Press and radio reporters have tried to ask Yasir 'Arafat where he was born. He avoided their questions. Television reporters have persistently asked 'Arafat to tell viewers about Jerusalem, his birthplace, and about the playground of his childhood. He refused. When pressed, however, he said: "I was born in the al-Aqsa Mosque." A witty person commented: It seems Mr. 'Arafat does not know that the al-Aqsa Mosque has no hospital. Also, women do not usually give birth during prayer. The "rebel" has turned into a would-be "governor". The people want to have an idea about their new ruler, who has now abandoned the assumed role of liberating rebel and agreed to supervise a process of liquidation. What has 'Arafat got to tell those people? How will he reply to their persistent questions? He cannot now refuse to answer, as he did in the past on the pretext of security and secrecy. He will say: My real name is Muhammad 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Qudwah. The majority will be surprised. Where was your father born? Where did he die? Where was your grandfather born? Where did he die? My father was was born in Cairo. He also died in Cairo. My grandfather died in Cairo. That is all. Do you have a family home in Palestine? No, we were not like all the other Palestinians who had a home and planted trees. Besides, Salah-al-Din did not have a house in Palestine. How do you consider yourself a Palestinian according to the law of the Palestine National Council [PNC], when you do not have well-known Palestinian parents? Why did you deny Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, membership in the PNC because he does not have Palestinian parents, even though his father's birthplace is known? Hawatimah's birthplace is known. Hawatimah has been leading a Palestinian faction since 1968. Why did you foment a parochial Palestinian approach driving the people who advocated your leadership to consider Palestine an entity that differs from the rest of the Arab homeland; to say that the Palestinians descend from non-Arab Kanaanites; to say that Palestine, the West Bank and Gaza, should be a state; that..., that..., that..., and that the Palestinian identity should be asserted before the Arab identity, so that it can merge with the Zionist identity? It is true that Salah-al-Din did not have a house in Palestine. However, he went to Palestine to liberate it and not to become a mayor under occupation. The man who came to us from Egypt and who lived in Egypt, along with his father and grandfather, also does not bear Egyptian nationality. He would not tell us where he came from, how he became Palestinian, and why did he not become an Egyptian, like all others who lived in Egypt late last century. If we go to Jablah, we will find the roots of the al-Qassam family, who was martyred in Palestine in 1963. If we go to Homs, we will find the roots of the family of Sa'id al-'As, who was martyred near Hebron in 1937. Where can we find the roots of the man who lives amongst us and plans to go back to Gaza-Jericho as a ruler under occupation? The people asking this question will go to Jerusalem and Amman and will not find an answer because the experts in family trees and city and village dwellers know nothing about 'Arafat, nor about 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Qudwah. Bi'r Zayt Mayor Tawfiq Ibrahim al-Kaylah asked me in 1978 in Baghdad: Do you know where Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] comes from? I replied: Why? He said: We, the mayors of the West Bank and Gaza, got together and none of us knew anything about 'Arafat, his father, grandfather, or house. I told him: You will not find anything of this, because his father and grandfather were nor born in Palestine, nor lived there. His father visited Jerusalem in the 1920's and married a woman from Jerusalem, and this is the secret of 'Arafat's affinity with Palestine, as people in the know say. 'Arafat has led the Palestinians to Gaza-Jericho after wresting leadership in the name of armed struggle and full liberation. He reduced this liberation into a state, then into representation, and then into Gaza-Jericho. No one knows where he will end up. The Palestinians, together with the Arab masses, should ask: How did this change happen? In whose interest is it? Why did the factions fail to know the person who was leading them and the PLO since 1968, in accordance with his program, until we reached the Gaza-Jericho accord? As it has become necessary now to know the person who will become a ruler, it is necessary to know his program well before he, together with his followers, become the authority that liquidates the cause and turns the Palestinian municipal system into an alternative to liberation and the cause. However, why are these questions raised now? We believe there are many reasons, and the most prominent are the following: First: The Gaza-Jericho accord prompted people to ask: Where did the man who agreed to something that was never previously accepted by any Palestinian leadership come from? Who is this person, who carried the gun in the name of liberation, to lead his supporters and opponents to the liquidation of the cause? Second: 'Arafat's competitors from the West Bank and Gaza, who exploited his move toward the settlement, are working to replace him now that he has played the role they could not play. They are the alternatives who want to rule. Therefore, sons of famous families, who agreed to play a limited role under the power of resistance, are now trying to show that their origins are more deeply rooted than those of the president. Third: Many people want to know the personality of the coming ruler, because the identity of this ruler is not known like that of Faysal al-Husayni, Sirri Nusaybah, Hanan 'Ashrawi, and others. This makes people ask many questions. Fourth: His aides, who agreed to play secondary roles in the past, now want to play greater roles, to have positions in the future. Those people are encouraged by Arab and foreign quarters that seek to implement the Gaza-Jericho accord in accordance with the set plans. What will 'Arafat say in response to questions about his identity? What will he answer regarding his program, which was exposed by the Gaza-Jericho accord? The secret is in the official quarters in Cairo that sent 'Arafat to become the chairman of the PLO instead of al-Shuqayri [former PLO chairman], that has taken care of him throughout all these years, which sent him to Gaza-Jericho, and which is still planning for him and looking after his march. However, the answers to the questions might come from Tel Aviv and Washington, or from any other place. 'Arafat, who does not know the Palestinian people, will face many difficulties. The first: How can he govern while his identity and program are still unknown, although he led the resistance with an unknown identity and program? Resistance is one thing, governing is something else. The secret, however, will become more ambiguous if the ruler leaves before stepping on the land of Palestine, when other well-known leaders appear. The bitter fact, however, will remain, whether or not the man stays, and whether or not the secret is revealed. How did 'Arafat lead committees, councils, and masses that did not know him? How was he able all this time to hide the reality of his program, which is more important than his identity and origin? We admit he is smart and others are naive, although the man was exposed by his personality and acts, although his course was not revolutionary, his experience not that of a leader, his bravery not real, and although he did not enjoy any of the skills that qualify him to be a leader. All this was known by all those who dealt with him inside and outside the PLO. What is not known about him was not hidden from those who wanted to know and who refused to place their fate in the hands of unknown persons. Despite all this, some factions supported him while others opposed him in a way that strengthened his position. The whole Arab order supported him. Although the Arab order differed with him, it wanted him to stay and to expeditiously impose his full authority over the Palestinians. Now that he has led the resistance, the PLO, and the Palestinians to the Gaza-Jericho accord, his identity and program must be known so that despair will make people see no other savior except him. [as published] As people such as 'Adnan al-Yasin [Palestinian security official arrested in Tunis for collaboration with the Mosad] have been exposed, other people will be exposed in the coming days, months, and years. In brief, 'Arafat has hidden behind the liberation program in order to hide his identity and his program, in order to lead the Palestine question to its present situation. He has strengthened and protected himself by the capitulation of the Arab order and by American arrogance. Now that he has revealed his program, he does not care if his identity is revealed as long as he is protected by the force of the international order.
