In a statement issued today, the follow-up committee said the humanity of the U.S. Congressional delegation is confined to Israeli soldiers while the fate of 300 prisoners in Israeli prisons is ignored. For over nine years Israel has refused to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit al-Khiyam prison. And over 165 Lebanese have been held in the enemy's prisons since the 1982 invasion. Israel is also holding the bodies of 125 martyrs. The committee said this shows the inhumane nature of the U.S. stance, which uses Israeli double standards and views our issue with an Israeli eye. The committee called on the Lebanese Government to adopt a firm stance on the international silence regarding the issue of the detainees.
