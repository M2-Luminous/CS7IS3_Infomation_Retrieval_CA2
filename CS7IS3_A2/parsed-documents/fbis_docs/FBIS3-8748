Good evening. [Granic] Good evening. [Gojan] Minister Granic, negotiations within the Croat-Muslim transitional committee ended in Vienna late last night. You took part in the last two days of its work. Tell us what was exactly agreed. [Granic] We have finally agreed on the constitution of the federation and we also reached a preliminary agreement on the confederation. Today, an agreement on the transitional period was agreed upon; before that a military agreement was signed. We agreed that both delegations should meet in Washington by the end of the week and sign all the agreements in the White House. [Gojan] This will confirm what has been agreed upon. [Granic] Correct. A Croatian delegation led by President Tudjman is expected to leave, most probably on Thursday. [Gojan] The talks yesterday lasted for 14 hours. These were very long talks. Obviously, there were some problems. Can you tell us what the problems were? According to our reports, the Croatian standpoint was well coordinated. It was obviously the Muslim side that had some problems. [Granic] Problems in connection with certain definitions arose. Each side firmly defended its standpoints. We sought better compromise solutions. The Bosniak side spent more time coordinating its views with Sarajevo than we did with Zagreb. [Gojan] Tell us what the agreement to be signed by Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic in Washington by the end of the week means for the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina and for the Republic of Croatia? [Granic] The agreement will also be signed by Mr. Zubak, the president of the presidency of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. This also provides a guarantee for the equality and survival of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina at all levels, from the cantons as the basic federal units to the level of the federation, in judiciary, economy, and all other spheres. For the Republic of Croatia it means that an important strategic, political, and economic goal has been accomplished -- this represents a link with Bosnia-Herzegovina, a link with the Croat people, and a link with the Bosniak-Croat Federation. [Gojan] Everyone agrees that the third warring party in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Bosnian Serbs, should, necessarily, be involved as soon as possible. Have you outlined any strategy? [Granic] We talked, of course, about this. We agreed today that the transitional committee -- which negotiated both in Washington and in Vienna -- would negotiate with the third party. We also agreed on a strategy for the negotiations. These negotiations will probably start following the signing of the agreement in Washington. [Gojan] According to Ambassador Redman, the future federation of the Muslims and Croats of Bosnia-Herzegovina is expected to have about 51 percent of territory -- something that has been denied by Momcilo Krajisnik, who says that 45 percent of the territory is enough. How can the Bosnian Serbs be forced to hand back these territories? [Granic] At least 51 percent. Everything else is a matter of negotiating positions. Not only the Bosnian-Muslim side but the international community, too, will surely help in bringing about a final solution. [Gojan] Tell us, do you perhaps know which areas might be at stake? Which side within the Federation of Croats and Muslims may possibly get them? [Granic] This is a matter of negotiations. [Gojan] When do you expect these transitional measures to end? Will they function well? When do you expect the federation will be established? [Granic] Everything that was agreed in Washington has been implemented -- even at an earlier stage than envisaged. For example, the Vienna negotiations were expected to wrap up by 15 March. They ended yesterday. Likewise, the military agreement was signed in time. Consequently, there is no doubt that so far everything has been taking place according to the agreed schedule against the backdrop of positive developments on the ground. As for negotiations with the third party, there is a great deal of international pressure to the effect that such negotiations should take place as soon as possible. Right now we are talking about the location and organization of these talks. [Gojan] Recently, in the media, radio, and TV, there has been a considerable degree of confusion about the possibility of the Bosnian Serbs being incorporated into a possible federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including their confederal links with the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Articles have been published here saying that this perhaps means that Croatia's occupied areas would possibly join Serbia. [Granic] There are two certain things: Croatia will never want anything that resembles Yugoslavia or anything that is any kind of new link or whatever with Yugoslavia. By the same token, the UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] are Croatian territory under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] supervision. They are integral parts of Croatia. This is what we are going to discuss. President Tudjman will give the UN secretary general a full plan of our proposals for a peaceful reintegration of the UNPA's through a new UNPROFOR mandate. We will demand firm support from the United States, the European Union, and other international institutions.
