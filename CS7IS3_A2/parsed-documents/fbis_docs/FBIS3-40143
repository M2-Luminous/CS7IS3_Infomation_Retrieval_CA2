According to statistics, at the end of November the number of workers nationwide was 147.72 million, up 180,000 people from the end of October but still down 200,000 people from the end of 1992. Growth in the number of workers at state-owned economic units and urban and rural collective economic units was slow while growth in the number of workers at various other economic units rose rather greatly. At the end of November the number of workers in the last category was 3.36 million people, up 540,000 people over the end of 1992 and up 850,000 over the same period in 1992. In state-owned economic units the number of workers was 108.84 million people, up 160,000 people over the end of October and down 60,000 people over the end of 1992, or basically the same as the end of October. In urban and rural collective economic units, the number of workers was 35.52 million people, down 690,000 people by the end of 1992, basically the same as the end of October. Besides greater flexibility of worker use in enterprises and ever stronger worker use mechanisms, the main reason for the rather slow recovery growth in the number of workers is the change which has occurred in people's choice of occupations in line with the transition toward a socialist market economy. There has been a non-stop increase in some surplus or terminated workers or workers who are retained with no salary who engage in indidivual operations or are reemployed by private enterprises. There is a steady increase in workers in the contract system of state-owned economic units. At the end of November, the number of such workers reached 22.31 million, up 1.72 million people from the end of 1992. The number of fixed workers was 74 .07 million people, down 1.54 million people from the end of 1992. The number of temporary workers and those used outside planning was 12.46 million people, down 240,000 people from the end of 1992. In November, workers nationwide were issued 40.02 billion yuan in wages, up 7.8 billion yuan over the same period in 1992, or up 24.2 percent. Of this figure, state-owned units accounted for 31.3 billion yuan, up 6.0 billion yuan over the same period in 1992, or up 23.6 percent. Urban and rural collective economic units accounted for 7.18 billion yuan, up 1.1 billion yuan, or up 17.9 percent. Various other economic units accounted for 1.54 billion yuan, up 750 million yuan, or nearly 100 percent. Considering January to November as a whole, workers nationwide were issued 395.5 billion yuan, up 70.92 billion yuan over the same period in 1992, the highest point for accumulated wage growth in 1993. Of this figure, state-owned units rose 21.9 percent, urban and rural collective economic units rose 15.1 percent, and various other economic units rose 73.5 percent. Total wages continued to maintain a fairly high increase rate. The main reasons for this are: one, in 1993 material price inflation has been consistently rapid, accelerating wage increase; two, there has been a turn for the better in enterprise overall economic efficiency. Bonuses and subsidies correspondingly rose substantially. According to statistics, from January to November, as a whole nationwide workers were issued 81.44 billion yuan in bonuses, up 34.5 percent over the same period in 1992. State-owned units accounted for 67.07 billion yuan of this figure, up 17.34 billion yuan over the same period in 1992, or up 35.1 percent. Allowances and subsidies accounted for 94.07 billion yuan, up 20.57 billion yuan over the same period in 1992, or up 28.0 percent. Since 1993, worker wages nationwide have consistently maintained a fairly high growth rate. In some areas the pace of wage increases has consistently been lower than the national average due to sliding enterprise economic efficiency. Heilongjiang Province consistently has had China's lowest wage increase level. According to reports, four large complete coal mines, large-scale military industrial enterprises and forestry industry enterprises in Heilongjiang defaulted on approximately 1.1 billion yuan in worker wages, seriously affecting workers' security and stability. Therefore, further deepening reform, accelerating the transformation of the operating mechanisms of state-owned enterprises, especially large- and medium-sized ones, will allow them to develop in a fair and rational market competition environment in a healthy manner. This is the key to fundamentally turning around the overly low growth in worker wages at large- and medium-size enterprises.
