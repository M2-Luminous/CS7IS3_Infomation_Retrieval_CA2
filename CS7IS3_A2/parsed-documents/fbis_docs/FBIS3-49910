Partnership For Peace is the only possible realistic project and both countries want to play an active part in the initiative, Klaus said. Both countries see the project as a means of attaining full NATO membership, Boross said. Hungary sees somewhat greater potential for the overlapping of common interests, in the Visegrad countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia) cooperation than the Czech Republic, Klaus said, adding however that he agreed with Boross on the extension of concrete and practical cooperation and above all on the opening of a Central European Free Trade Zone. Hungary, too, is not interested in building institutions reminiscent of the former COMECON [Council for Mutural Economic Assistance], but in concrete cooperation, Boross said.
