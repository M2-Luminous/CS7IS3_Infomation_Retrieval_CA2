Radio Havana Cuba would like to ask Ricardo Alarcon his general impressions of the visit of a Cuban assemblymen's delegation to Great Britain. [Alarcon] This visit has to be seen, first, within the framework of a specific reality. The British Parliament invites only two foreign delegations each year. This year, they decided to ask us to visit the UK. We accepted and discussed a date mutually convenient to the two countries, which was at this time. It allowed me to make this visit following the special session of the ANPP in early May, and here we are. But I must point out that it is significant, in my judgment, that this country's parliament considered Cuba to be one of only two delegations to be invited this year. I have been here a little over two days, and we have not had a break. We have had meetings with the speaker, that is, with the president of the Parliament's House of Commons, who, together with the president of the House of Lords, invited me. We met with two parliamentary commissions today and with a group of British businessmen. Tomorrow we will have two more meetings with this country's businessmen and with the British Government's Caribbean Trade Advisory Commission. We also met today with the secretary of state, who is in charge of the Latin American and Caribbean area. I would say it has been, or rather continues to be -- I still have various meetings tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and then we shall end the visit -- a very intense, very useful stay during which many contacts were made and discussions held with many people on a level of great respect and cordiality. I think our British friends are capable of showing their guests much hospitality, and a certain degree of frankness, flexibility, and understanding, which is truly admirable. [Calvo] How will this visit benefit the relationship between Cuba and Great Britain, and the European countries, in general? [Alarcon] To tell you the truth, here we have been concentrating on Great Britain, which is a European country that has a lot of influence. Its conduct, its inclination, tends to attract followers from other European countries. I can tell you that it is clear that in the next few months there will be a follow-up on actions that were slowly taken this year, which I am sure will result in more British activity in Cuba. We await -- and that was decided in today's conversations -- the visit of Great Britain's secretary of state for trade in September. The UK, Great Britain, has traditionally been linked to the Caribbean area. Remember that a large part of the Caribbean, from Jamaica to the Caribbean's eastern limits, was colonized by England, had a special link with the UK, is part of the Commonwealth, etc. The British have more knowledge of and more presence in the area. Based on that, they have a more reasonable, realistic policy, and a better understanding of the Cuban reality and the international reality that has allowed them, through frank dialogue with Cuban authorities, to slowly build a relationship that grows more cordial and natural every day.
