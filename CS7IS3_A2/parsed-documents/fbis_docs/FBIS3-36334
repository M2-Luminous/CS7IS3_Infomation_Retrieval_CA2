The Final Decision Rests With the Executive Branch"] [Text] Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma's Economic Policy Committee, said yesterday in a press conference that he expects the government to work out a single program of anticrisis measures. Differences at the Council of Ministers are "a common thing," but they should be resolved "within the government," he said. At the same time, the Duma is in no way intent on "imposing on the government its approach" to adjusting economic policy. Parliamentary hearings on the economic situation and anticrisis measures in Russia, which have been scheduled for 10 February, will apparently provide the stage for competition among a number of draft programs. Mr. Glazyev said that he fully understood Boris Fedorov's statement that he did not know "nonmonetarist methods of fighting inflation." "A finance minister does not have other levers but monetarist ones," he said, "but if Boris Fedorov were an industry minister," he would have taken into account the need to pursue structural policy and to provide government support. Mr. Glazyev said also that the struggle of industrial sectors' representatives for raising customs tariffs was going on at the Council of Ministers. In his words, "as a result of the hyperinflation of the last two years and the artificial propping up of the ruble exchange rate in the past six months," Russian products have become uncompetitive even in the fuel sector. According to Mr. Glazyev, "specialists and the industrial establishment have been particularly dismayed by the excessive tax burden placed on the current incomes" of enterprises. "A fairly chaotic tax system impedes the government's actions and destimulates production," he said. The approach being worked out by his committee will apparently call for cutting corporate taxes and increasing rent payments. Sergey Glazyev is considered an advocate of the state's active intervention in economic processes in Russia. Among other things, his committee plans to submit to the State Duma draft laws on indicative planning, on managing government-owned enterprises, and so forth, and also to get around to devising approaches to Russia's pricing problems. Mr. Glazyev believes that "society has to choose" one alternative: either spontaneous pricing or an administrative regulation of prices. In the first case, Sergey Glazyev said, it is necessary to carry out a regular general indexation, including budget revenues, expenditures, and the amounts of centralized credits. But we should take into account that in current conditions the period of "galloping inflation" may last "fairly long." If an approach calling for administrative price regulation gains the upper hand, "prices in various sectors will have to be temporarily frozen, profitability limits established, and state subsidies introduced." Administrative methods, however, may turn out to be ineffective owing to "a lack of administrators in the conditions of a very loose executive discipline," Mr. Glazyev said. In any event, despite his own reference to society, Mr. Glazyev divulged that "the final decision rests with the government." This confidence in the current government displayed by a moderate reformer, an advocate of structural policy and the reintegration of the economy by setting up financial-industrial groups, may be easily attributed to the similarity between his concepts and the ideas of specialists who drew up economic documents in the "post-Gaydar" government. What is disconcerting, however, is Mr. Glazyev's remark about a lack of possibilities for normal administration in Russia. It is unlikely that he meant lackluster or corrupt bureaucrats. To all appearances, the issue is the functional unpreparedness of the Russian administrative system for influencing economic processes in an efficient and rational way. This means that monetarist declarations, made in order to regain the West's confidence, will also remain a "paper dragon" for the domestic industry, and structural policy will boil down to sectoral lobbying motivated not by the selection of promising industries, but by the struggle for survival among managers who have access to government offices. In Mr. Glazyev's words, economic activity in Russia comes down and, admittedly, will continue to come down, to the reallocation of state resources.
