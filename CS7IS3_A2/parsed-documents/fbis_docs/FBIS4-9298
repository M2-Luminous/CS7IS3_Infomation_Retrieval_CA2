The conversation in the Pretrial Custody Prison in Bijelo Polje, mainly into events that occurred after the arrest, lasted from 1300 to 1700 hours. Gajo Joksimovic, investigating judge of the Bijelo Polje Superior Court, and Luka Bulatovic, warden of the Pretrial Custody Prison, attended the conversation between the defense lawyers -- Branko Vukotic and Vladan Djuranovic from Podgorica and Velje Muric and Adil Nasufovic from Bijelo Polje -- and their 13 clients (four hired other lawyers and another four are still at large). All the accused -- Esad Omerovic, Harun Hadzic, Rizah Burnazovic, Isad Skenderovic, Umer Hadzic, Rifat Veskovic, Hakija Muratovic, Erdzan Fetahovic, Rasim Sahman, Avdo Ciguljin, Sefket Brkovic, Sead Gec and Sabahet Spahic -- confirmed that from the moment they were arrested until they were brought before the investigating judge they were subjected to almost unimaginable mental and physical torture. Every one mentioned the hood and blindfold and spoke of terrible beatings with "fists, kicks, sticks and all kinds of things on the head, soles of the feet, and the entire body." Police Creations Still, the reason why the conversation confined to events after the arrest took up four valuable hours of the time of the defense counsel will best be explained by excerpts from the testimony of a few of them concerning particular police inventions. Harun Hadzic was forced to do 100 jumping jacks and kneebends. He did not get water; he had to drink from the toilet to avoid dehydration. He was beaten until the last moment, even now in the corridor as he was being brought before the investigating judge. He was not allowed to sleep for three days. During interrogation he was exposed to a strong floodlight and high temperature thanks to a device he described as an "asbestos cap." Exposed to electric shocks, that is, to a device with which they touched him behind the ear, causing a strong pain and twitching of the legs. The electric shocks and beating lasted at least 48 hours. He suspects that he was taken to Foca, since the people who drove him there threatened to turn him over to Turtle. He described the building where he was interrogated as a "labyrinth of many rooms, booths, and bars." It seemed to him that the room in which he was tortured was lined with red velvet. They threatened to kill him the whole time. Esad Omerovic, a mental patient who was discharged from the army in the care of a guardian, was kicked and beaten and hit with sticks over his entire body and head. The defense counsel had the impression that he neither knew where he was nor why. After his arrest Rizah Burzanovic, hooded and blindfolded, was driven in an unknown direction "an hour and a half or two hours from Pljevlja." They beat and kicked him over his entire body and hit him with sticks. They did not allow him to sleep for three days. They threatened to kill him. The investigating judge interrogated him at night. The Middle Ages Umer Hadzic is certain that he was in Foca, which he recognized from the window of the room in which he was tortured. Along the way his escorts stopped the vehicle to stage an attempted escape in order to kill him. They fired shots in the air around him and beat him as he attempted to stay near the vehicle. They told him to prepare to be shot. When they reached Foca, he received numerous blows as he ran the gauntlet. The man they referred to as "Vojvoda" [commander] told them not to beat him since he was a friend of Lazo Boricic, former head of state security. Another man, who he thinks from his speech was a Bosnian, threatened to kill him and avenge his brother whom the Muslims had "roasted alive." He was "treated" with electric shocks over his entire body, especially the genitals. He spent at least two days tied to a radiator in a position that did not allow him to sit or stand. They threatened they would kill him, and also said his children would pay if he did not confess. He says that he would recognize some of the people who tortured him. They kicked and beat Erdzan Fetahovic and hit him with sticks. They told him that they had also picked up his wife ("right now they are lining up for her in the other room"). They asked Avdo Ciguljin whether he could count to 10. When he said he could, they asked whether he knew how many blows he had received. When he said he did not know, they retorted that he should count from the beginning. He counted 100 blows on the soles of his feet and 50 to his head. They forced a stick into him, first into his anus and then into his mouth. Sefket Brkovic's words "If once again I had to go through all I have gone through, I would find a way to end my life" are perhaps the best testimony to the sadism of the torturers representing such an important state agency that it is entrusted with care for the security of citizens as well as the "inviolability of the physical and mental integrity of the individual," even though he has been detained on suspicion of the most serious crimes. If perhaps the top leadership of the Montenegrin government is not privy to the secrets of police treatment of imprisoned Muslims, as this issue of MONITOR comes off the press, the defense counsel will be trying to inform it firsthand. Under the Constitution and Law The superior court in Bijelo Polje, and we have to hope for an honest trial, will decide whether these people took it upon themselves "to divide Montenegro and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia." At the same time the president of all the citizens of Montenegro must fulfill his promise made in his speech to his party's congress that "the law-governed, democratic, and civil state" will treat them "strictly under the constitution and law and without discrimination." Just that, nothing more. Nevertheless, even the way in which the investigation has been conducted does not instill confidence in the specific institutions of the "law-governed, civil, and democratic state." A majority of those detained told the defense lawyers that the attitude towards them during pretrial detention was correct, given the circumstances, but also that out of fear of new mistreatment they had repeated the testimony extorted from them by the police when they were examined by the investigating judge. The presence of prison personnel when the accused are interrogated is unthinkable and contrary to the Law on Criminal Procedure. The decision to suspend all rights of defense counsel, issued 1 February, was supposedly rescinded no later than 4 February. However, it was delivered to the defense counsel only on 21 February, so that for 17 days the defense was prevented from doing its job. While the defense lawyers were allowed to examine the papers in the case for the first time only on 22 February, some of the government media were given information from police and investigation files much earlier. Medical examinations were conducted only 12 days after the suspects were detained, when visible traces of the abuse might have already disappeared. The defense lawyers were informed tardily of certain actions in the investigation even after the suspension was lifted. In view of the presence of the investigating judge, the visits of the defense lawyers to the accused were limited by his time. It was not even possible to photocopy the file, since the machine in the court was broken, and they were not allowed to take the file out even in the company of a court employee. MONITOR nevertheless has learned one piece of good news from confidential sources: The superior court in Bijelo Polje has rejected the motion of the superior public prosecutor to turn certain investigatory operations in these cases over to the police, although the cases have already been turned over to the court.
