Was it not Moscow diplomacy which covered the backs of American negotiators in recent weeks? And now, as sole response, American NATO planes arrive to strike Serb positions without even informing the Kremlin, without consulting it, [not] giving it a mere telephone call from Clinton once everything had been decided. A true affront, which could extend the flames of Gorazde to the relationships between the United States and Russia. A furious, red-faced Boris Yeltsin expressed himself more or less in this way to manifest his indignation. But do not fear: There will be no fire in relations between Washington and Moscow because neither of the two supposed pyromaniacs has any interest in lighting it, and indeed the appropriate diplomatic maneuvers are already under way to cool things down. Yeltsin will calm down. But the problem posed by his outburst of rage remains, because the West continues to lack any policy worthy of the name toward Russia. The anti-Serbian incursions around Gorazde pose no question of legitimacy. For one year now there has existed a UN resolution which Russia voted for, along with the others, and which provides for the use of every necessary means to preserve certain Bosnian cities. Gorazde is one of these, and UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali had repeated in the last few days that the United Nations would resort to air strikes if the Serbs continued their murderous shellings. Hence Yeltsin cannot raise the question of the right to take action. But he can raise and he is raising a question of the appropriateness of this action, precisely the question which NATO and the United States have been unable to manage. Perhaps it was felt at the White House that it would have been better for Yeltsin not to know, and that by leaving him in the dark NATO would, in reality, have protected him against the assaults of nationalists like Zhirinovskiy (the same person who yesterday was suggesting to heaven knows whom to attack Aviano). Maybe. But thinking this way would signify a lack of understanding of the fact that, in Russia, image is more important than politics, and that the greater offense, for Russians, is not to be opposed, but to be neglected. In particular when the Kremlin has already taken the risk of being unpopular within the country. A Crucial Role We have to admit that Russian diplomacy for the last two months has been playing a crucial and constructive role in the Bosnian problem. Moreover, only Moscow is in a position to exercise fruitful pressure on the Serbs, who are Slav and Orthodox. The conclusion is obvious: There is today and there will continue to be tomorrow an absolute need for Russia, because, without its work of convincing, no peace project drawn up by the Americans or Europeans will be able to really involve the Serbs and therefore have a hope of success. Was it not, therefore, necessary to be realistic, and to consult Yeltsin, and not to go ahead with the strikes in the absence of his approval? Not for a moment. NATO cannot and must not concede to Russia a power of joint decision which would pervert its role, leading very rapidly to a process of breakup. And neither is it conceivable that America, as such, the sole real superpower, rely on the red telephone with the Kremlin before deciding on what has to be done. Long ago diplomats invented ways of squaring the circle. One provides information at the appropriate times and in the appropriate fashion (as moreover happened for the second attack), one involves without subordinating anything, one shows respect without showing pliancy. Family Picture This, and no more, the West owes Yeltsin. Otherwise, it would be useless to think of a pretty family picture, with Vesuvius in the background and in the July heat.
