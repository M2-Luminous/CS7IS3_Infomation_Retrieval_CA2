Elizabeta Gojan reports from Madrid. [Gojan] [passage omitted] Spain's interest in the peaceful reintegration of the occupied Croatian regions, the situation in the area, Croatia's contribution to the ending of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the aid extended by the European Union and Spain to the concrete implementation of the agreement on the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation -- these subjects were discussed this afternoon by Minister Granic and Javier Solana Madariaga, his Spanish counterpart. [Begin recording] [Solana, in Spanish with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] As far as the Croatian regions under Serb occupation are concerned, the Spanish side will meet again this summer with high-ranking Croatian officials. We wish to agree on influencing a possible renewal of the mandate of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] before the autumn session of the UN General Assembly. Spanish-Croatian relations have significantly improved, although they were not all that good in the past. [Granic] Despite the Zagreb cease-fire agreement, there have been no further negotiations with the Serbs. On the contrary -- the UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] are being practically integrated into Serbia economically. Croatia refuses to accept this. Croatia will try -- in a peaceful and diplomatic way -- to resolve the issue of the reintegration of our occupied regions by requesting the help of the European Union and the UN General Assembly and Security Council. As far as Bosnia-Herzegovina is concerned, Croatia upholds the Washington agreement and the Bosnian-Croat Federation -- including the future confederation between the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Republic of Croatia -- as well as the Contact Group's efforts aimed at finding a peaceful solution. [end recording] [Gojan] The two ministers signed the first agreements between their two countries on road traffic and cooperation in the area of tourism. [passage omitted]
