The makeup of Iran's population and its concentration in the rural areas made it possible for most of the nation's active manpower to be employed in the agriculture sector. However, when the nation became inundated with oil, attention to this sector decreased day by day. With the implementation of improper policies and the adoption of guidelines and policies that were not compatible with the ways and traditions of the people of Iran, and with the rampant growth of assembly industries, Iran was gradually transformed from a producer of agricultural and food projects to a major importer of these kinds of crops. In the years prior to the triumph of the Islamic revolution the nation's income from the sale of oil was $25 billion per year, while Iran's population was 36 million at most. Today Iran's population is about to exceed 60 million, yet the foreign exchange revenues from the sale of oil are about half what they were before the revolution. It appears that it is now vitally necessary to make a change in economic structures, especially in the agriculture sector, in view of the background that has been sketched. Although during the First Five-Year Plan, with implementation of the Pivotal Wheat Project, production of this product increased, bordering on 11 million tons per year, considerable quantities of wheat, rice, cotton, meat (both white and red) and even dairy products are still purchased abroad. On the one hand, increased food production meets domestic needs and prevents the expenditure of limited foreign exchange to import food, and on the other hand, in view of the very high added value of many food industries, if the country becomes a food exporter a significant amount of foreign exchange will also be obtained in this way. On the other hand, the world's food industries are considered strategic and sensitive. The industrial and imperialist nations sometimes use them as pressure levers. The secretary of agriculture under President Jimmy Carter stated plainly that America's most cutting weapon after military weapons is food and agricultural industries and crops. In the second half of the 20th century it has been seen numerous times that the West and especially America have made practical use of this leverage to advance their goals in the world. To become familiar with the problems and issues in the food industry, the obstacles to developing conversion industries in the agricultural sector and ways to increase the production of food for consumption and export in the country, KEYHAN-E HAVA'I held separate interviews with several insiders and experts in the food industry sciences and industries, the results of which you will read below. The major place of the agriculture sector in economic development and the gross national product is concealed from no one, because even the world's most advanced industrial nations have never considered themselves to be without need of growth in the agriculture sector. Many economic experts believe that self-sufficiency in the production of agricultural crops and products is the preliminary to other technological and industrial and, in general, economic progress. Likewise, many of the world's economists consider agricultural products to be the most realistic kind of product because the wheels of production in this sector never stop, due to the ease of access to such tools of production as land, solar energy, and water. Many of the world's underground resources, ores, and metals have a limited life. Their extraction stops after a period of time because these mines and resources such as oil, copper, iron, aluminum, rock coal, precious stones and the like can never be renewed and extracted again after they are used, and in the future there will be no more resources to take their place. However, agricultural resources can be renewed. As long as work is done on the earth and as long as land, solar energy, and water exist, the production of agricultural crops will continue. In its present economic circumstances, our country has no choice but to give more attention to the agriculture sector to get away from reliance on limited and fluctuating oil revenues. Dr. Seyyed Mohammad Hoseyni, president of both the Food Sciences College and Iran Food Industries and Sciences Society, announced that there are more than 2,000 active food industries producing units in the country. He said: Because of its varied atmosphere and its 12 different climates, its productive soil and its adequate light, Iran produces some of the best quality agricultural crops in the world, crops such as Jaharom lemons, bam citrus, Rafsanjan and Damghan pistachios, Mashhad melons, and Khuzestan dates. Just as is apparent from Dr. Hoseyni's remarks, Iran has no problem with the production of agricultural crops, and the God-given and natural resources in the country are considered a suitable ground for any kind of agricultural activity. In his view however, numerous causes have kept our country from using all its capacities and talents in the agricultural sector. In his view, there are currently weaknesses in the management of some of Iran's food industries because the managers in this industrial sector usually do not have the needed specialist skills and efficiency. At the same time, however, there are also managers who manage their producing units at the level of an international institution in accordance with world standards. It appears that the lack of modern machinery and the distance in terms of technology between Iran's food industries and the other comparable producing units in the world are considered two of this industry's problems, yet if basic and fundamental measures were taken to equip and rebuild the food industries, our country would be able to compete with many of the world's exporters in the production and export of various foodstuffs. Activity in the production and export of food must be done with care and precision, because otherwise in the long term it is possible that the nation's food exports could suffer a severe blow. For this reason, on the one hand we must plan to understand the international markets and on the other hand, by standardizing the production of consumer food products domestically and maintaining constant quality control, we must take our place in the international markets and especially in those of neighboring and Islamic countries. Hoseyn Vakili has a doctorate in commercial management. In this regard, he adds: Some of the world's markets are eager for Iran's food products. In developing our exports, we must not covet all of the international markets, because this is quite dangerous, and it is not even economical. For example, in all the Islamic nations, whose populations total more than 1 billion, there are customers for food and canned goods made in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Our exporters must put their greatest attention and emphasis on the markets in the Islamic nations. Dr. Vakili, who was recently chosen as the official in charge of the Iran Canned Goods Cooperative Company, discussed the necessity to liberate the nation's economy from its reliance on oil revenues. He said: Iran's economy, which has certain industrial distinctions compared to the other nations in the world, can plan for exports of metallic and nonmetallic products, food products, and handicrafts. Ultimately, with a variety of foreign exchange-producing incomes from various sources, the reliance on oil revenues will gradually be reduced. At the same time he warned that the fever for exporting nonoil goods is high now and every exporter, especially in the food industries, is trying to export his products while adhering more or less to acceptable international standards, in order to earn foreign exchange. This is considered dangerous in international trade, because when first developing nonoil exports, if we do not observe predetermined standards, indicators, and regulations, it is possible that our products could be permanently excluded from the competition among comparable goods, which are superior on international markets, and they will lose the ability to compete. Therefore if we do not take international standards into consideration with regard to our country's export goods and products, we will be cut out of the international markets in the near future, and we will not find it easy to get back in. It is perhaps for this reason that it is necessary to set standards for export products. If the nation's exporters do not adhere to international regulations and laws to standardize their products, not only will they get nowhere exporting, they will also damage the credibility of Iran's export products and goods on the international markets. In the near future, competition on the international markets will be more complicated, with most nations joining the GATT accord. Naturally nations will have to think about themselves in this confusing world market. While making the necessary decision about whether or not to become a part of GATT, they will be seeking suitable markets for their export goods. On the other hand, studies that have been done show that the added value of the food industries compared to other producing and economic units is quite high, and this is considered one of the undeniable benefits of this industry. A simple comparison between the revenues and expenses of the food industries with those of oil shows that investment in these industries is much more economical than in the oil sector and comparable areas. Dr. Hoseyni, chief of the Society of Specialists in the Food Industries and Sciences, says in this regard that one ton of exported oil earns about $80 in foreign exchange revenues and consumes about $10 to $20 in foreign exchange, and consequently a maximum of about $60 to $70 in foreign exchange comes into the country, but a ton of export tomatoes sells for at least $500 and only consumes $70 in foreign exchange. Therefore, the country receives about $430 for every ton of tomatoes it exports. Likewise, the price of a ton of concentrated fruit juice on the international markets is about $1,300, and it consumes no more than $300 foreign exchange. Consequently the country receives about $1,000 for every ton of concentrated fruit juice it exports. Although these revenues are significant, packaged agricultural products have not been exported and these goods cannot have that much revenue. For this reason, investment in the conversion industries in the agricultural sector is important. Statistics show that 30 to 50 percent of the food produced in the Third World and in Iran is destroyed between harvest and consumption. The Fruit and Produce Union has announced that of the 15 million tons of fruit and summer vegetables produced in the country annually, about 4.5 million tons is destroyed in various ways between harvest time and consumption. In this same regard, Fereydun Golafra, manager of the specialist journal KESHAVARZ, writes in an editorial in issue 170 of this journal: While every year about 400,000 tons of tomatoes is processed by our nation's conversion industries, only about 6,000 tons of tomato paste is exported, mostly in cans. This weakness is due to the fact that the ability to package and even produce tomato paste in Iran is less than what it should be. For example, a country like Italy alone can produce about 350,000 tons of tomato paste per year, packaged in small cans. Some of the tomato-paste-producing units in this country have the capacity to produce more than 70,000 tons per year, yet the largest tomato-paste-producing factory in Iran only has the ability to produce 12,000 tons per year. Due to this very shortage of packaging and conversion industries, our country, despite its extensive resources for producing tomato paste, is unable to participate actively in international markets, and it even drives away customers because of its inability to answer their needs. Ultimately, the world markets do not even open an account for tomato paste and other Iranian food exports. Golafra noted that last year Iran lost a 32,000-ton tomato-paste deal with Libya because it could not answer the customer's need in time. The manager of the journal KESHAVARZ also noted that in the future our country will need to have a presence on the international markets more than it does today in order to be able on the one hand to reduce food product losses and on the other hand to be able to return to vegetable and fruit growers the earnings of their labors, thereby helping the economy to prosper. He also recommended that to increase food exports the government must insure all export contracts. It appears that this recommendation can be given attention and have an effect on the development of nonoil exports, provided that the exports are regulated and done in such a way that they do not damage the credibility of the nation's products. Some other experts believe that the main problem with Iran's food industries is the weakness of its packaging and shipping of goods. Behruz Forutan, a member of the board of directors of the Iran Food Industries and Sciences Society and executive director of Behruz Food Industries, is one of these people. He said: Packaging has various advantages, including the fact that in preserving the food, helping with the distribution and sale of the goods, facilitating storage and shipping, increasing the amount of marketing and providing the necessary information and instructions for the proper use of the package's contents have a strong effect on the customer. He explained that the world's food packaging and preservation industry is 180 years old, but in Iran this industry has no more than a 60-year history. According to a study by experts, about 7.2 million tons of the 15 million tons of agricultural and farm products produced in Iran can be sent to market in packaged form. Before the canning industry appeared, in the old days many Iranian families spent the spring, summer, and fall storing some of the food they needed such as jams and vinegar pickles for the winter. Sometimes in the cold regions such as Azerbaijan they fried meat in animal fat and kept it as stew in special crocks for consumption later and in the winter. Now, however, with the growth in the population, the increase in the number of urban residents and changes in lifestyles from rural to urban modes, the traditional ways of preserving food are also gradually being forgotten. Therefore, to make the best use of food and keep it from spoiling and also to find international markets, while we should pay attention to traditional methods such as drying vegetables for domestic consumption, more attention must also be given to the conversion and canning industries. Based on statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Americans convert to canned goods 90 percent of their tomatoes, 79 percent of their olives, 65 percent of their green beans, 62 percent of their green peas, 54 percent of their sweet corn, 41 percent of their asparagus, 55 percent of their pears, 75 percent of their apricots, 50 percent of their peaches, and 40 percent of their apples, but according to the executive director of Behruz Food Industries, for various reasons such as the lack of packaging and canning industries in our country, every year at least 300,000 tons of apples (30 percent of the entire crop), 50 percent of the grapes, and 400,000 to 600,000 tons of citrus fruit (25 percent of the crop) were destroyed. The production of packaged and canned food in Iran is so insignificant that nothing is left for exports. According to the statistics from Iran Customs, in the period between the years 1367 [21 March 1988-20 March 1989] and 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] an average of $7 to $10 million in packaged food was exported. According to these statistics, 90 percent of Iran's food exports were not packaged. Thus, with a simple calculation it can be seen that in the area of food industries our country has not had the necessary development and progress at all. In this regard, however, one keep in mind the important point that the level of consumption of packaged food in Iran does not have to be as it is in the West, because basically the tastes of the people in the East and especially Iranians do not resemble or have points in common at all with Westerners. The people in our society in the rural areas and even in the northernmost points in the cities will not consume packaged foods as long as they are not forced to do so. They prefer to purchase their food fresh and cook it themselves, although these kinds of packaged foods claimed their place in the Western food basket years ago. Despite the difference between the tastes of our people and those of the West with regard to the consumption of packaged and canned foods, it cannot be claimed that the the food packaging and conversion industries in the agricultural sector have grown sufficiently in Iran. Every insider in the food industries gives reasons that are obstacles to the growth of the food and conversion industries in Iran. Some believe that the collection of taxes on export food and also the heavy tariffs on the needed imported machinery and equipment are among the major obstacles to growth in the conversion and food industries. In the same regard it is said that export foods are only 50 percent tax exempt yet export goods are exempt from the payment of all taxes. On the other hand, a number of insiders in the food industries also consider the import of foreign food, which is sometimes unsanitary and lacking in standards, is also one of the problems in this sector. According to the view of these people, along with the means, which are being made available for food producers and exporters, the paths for importing beverages, chocolates and in general all the foods whose counterparts are produced at higher quality inside the country must be blocked. Of course, this not be done in such a way that the possibility of competition is eliminated and that domestic food producers, despite having undesirable products, are content and satisfied in a market they dominate and in which there is no competitor. The shortage of currency in circulation and investment are among the other existing problems of those working in the food industries. As the result of the unification of the foreign exchange rate the price of raw materials and imported machinery has risen sharply and this has caused the currency in circulation to be insufficient to meet the needs of the owners of this industry. Apparently so far the banking system has not supported the food and conversion industries as much as it should either. Likewise, due to the obstacles in the path of production, investment in our country has always been more in the services and commercial sectors than in the other sectors society needs. For this purpose, and to develop food conversion industries and increase nonoil exports, the commercial banks should grant credit facilities at low profit rates to encourage investors so they will build factories for the packaging and conversion industries in the agricultural sector. Elsewhere in his talk, Forutan discussed the necessity to activate the Export Guarantee Fund and to coordinate food export and import laws and regulations in a way that is appropriate for the current requirements. He said: The shipping problem is considered another deterrent to the development of food industries, because due to the susceptibility to spoilage for these kinds of materials, they must be moved inside and outside the country in the shortest time possible. However the high cost of shipping, especially via aircraft, on the one hand and on the other hand the lack of the necessary refrigeration at the ports and points of departure, are bringing producers up against increasing problems. It is also absolutely necessary to create centers for research and study in the food industries sector. By organizing and unifying the research under way in the food industries, wasted time and energy can be prevented to a great extent and this work can gradually become valuable. Food industries research units can be guided and supported by the government in all the food industries units with the cooperation of food science colleges. If these units are equipped with the necessary tools and if they do not remain uninformed of the research and achievements of other comparable research institutions in the world, they will be able on the one hand effectively to teach and train food industry specialists and technicians and on the other hand to increase the country's ability with regard to food exports and to develop competitiveness on international markets compared to comparable products. In any case the problem of packaging in Iran's food industries is not merely a matter of art, design, attractive packaging, and quality printing. The main problem is the weak technology and lack of advanced equipment in this sector of the industry. Mehdi Mojahedi, member of the board of directors of the Khorasan Union of Compote and Canned Goods Factories, said that Iran's production of many agricultural crops is much greater than its domestic need. He described the conversion industries as a powerful arm in the agriculture sector. He said: Due to the lack of packaging industries, a large amount of the food produced in Iran goes out of the country without packaging and without authorization via the nation's western, eastern, northern, and southern borders, so that unofficial exports of food are several times greater than the exports done officially adhering to the rules and regulations through points of departure to official markets. In any case, although during previous years the food and conversion industries sector has been ignored, now the nation's executive officials have realized this industry's importance in answering the needs of domestic consumption and also its role in earning foreign exchange. For this reason, with the decisions that have been made, one may hope that during the Second National Five-Year Social, Economic and Cultural Development Plan, the food and conversion industries will grow and develop more and find their place in society's economic affairs. According to Dr. Seyyed Mohammad Hoseyni, chief of the Society of Specialists in the Food Industries and Sciences and Majles deputy, 350 billion rials in loans for the development of food industries has been allocated from Note 3 in this year's budget bill. He discussed the quality of Iran's agricultural crops. He said: Fortunately, due to the high quality of its agricultural crops, Iran always has the potential of producing large amounts of food exports. For example, Iran already has regular customers in advanced countries such as Germany, Switzerland, England and a few other countries for its pistachios, canned goods (tomato paste, pickles, tuna fish, and other things), mayonnaise, and various kinds of dried fruits, despite the fact that it is very difficult to compete in these markets and all food exporters are making efforts to establish themselves in the European markets. With all this, our country still must seek to find new markets throughout the world and especially in the Islamic nations and in the region and it must obtain its appropriate and rightful share of the world economy. To keep from falling behind our competitors on world markets, we must give more importance to research, and along with that we must not neglect to equip and rebuild the machinery in our producing units to create variety and innovation in packaging. Dr. Hoseyni, chief of the Food Sciences University, proposes in this respect that with regard to the food industries, the training of technicians and the research it does, our country should be in continuous contact with countries like England, Switzerland, Holland, Denmark, Italy, France, and Japan, which have made significant progress in the food industries. He called upon Iranian food industries specialists living outside the country to correspond with the Society of Food Sciences and Industries Specialists, to participate in the relevant congresses and seminars having to do with food inside the country and to make their findings available to the food industries and those working in it. Along with the efforts the government and the public are making to develop food industries, one must not forget one very important point and that is that the food industries in every region of the country must be appropriate for that region's potential, because otherwise the costs of moving agricultural crops will be very high. As was said, in some of the nation's fruitful provinces the food industries are a suitable basis for development and growth. In view of the fact that each agricultural crop is harvested at a specific time of the year, the necessary proportion must be created between the size of food crops and the conversion industries. In a province like Khorasan with its relatively vast size, some agricultural crops, orchard produce and summer vegetables are produced in abundance and in superb quality. For this reason the development of the conversion industries in such provinces must never be overlooked. According to Mehdi Mojahedi, member of the board of directors of the Khorasan Union of Compote and Canned Goods Factories, in this province there are already 55 major units producing compote and canned goods, 10 of which have been recently established, and all of which have the governor-general's approval. Although the production of some agricultural and farm crops in some provinces is much greater than the provinces themselves need, one must realize that a number of regions in our country, due to their geographic position, do not have the ability to produce significant agricultural crops. In some population centers like Tehran, the people are strictly consumers and with the exception of a few farms on the outskirts, there is effectively no particular crop produced in this province. Therefore it is necessary to make maximum use of the producing capacity of the various provinces, raise the profitability of agricultural lands, make use of agricultural and orchard machinery and to the extent possible to consolidate lands to increase returns. Shahrokh Zahiri, executive director of a major food industry unit, which has been active in this area for almost two decades, emphasized the need to make use of skilled and expert manpower in this sector of industry. He said: Food producers must have knowledge of this work in order to produce the ideal product and at the same time they must prevent the negative propaganda against domestic food industries. At the same time, to the extent possible, domestically made machinery must be used to develop and equip the food industries, so that while creating the resources for the growth of industry, the departure of foreign exchange will be prevented. Behruz Forutan, a member of the board of directors of the Iran Food Industries and Sciences Society, noted in this regard that so far various experts from Asian and European countries have visited the Iran Food Industries factories at this society's invitation, and have been impressed by the positive performance of the machinery made in Iran. He believes that we must have a national motivation for the work we do, leave the "nonrenewable mines" for future generations and to make maximum use of renewable resources such as the agricultural sector, fisheries and manpower, which can neither be renewed nor preserved for future generations. Forutan added that it is very important to package food for domestic and foreign consumption, because every consumer item such as food, carpets, cloth, canned goods, and other things must attract the eye of the consumer and get his attention. Iran's geographic and strategic position and our country's position on the globe, which is about the same distance from both East and West and has numerous Muslim nations as neighbors, confers a valuable privilege on those who live in this land. Forutan, a member of the board of directors of the Iran Food Industries and Sciences Society, noted that shared religious affiliations, ease of access to the region's markets and similar tastes are among the factors that give Iranian products special distinction in the markets of the Islamic nations, and all of these factors can be used to develop exports and earn foreign exchange. Mohammad Ashkuri, formerly executive director of the "One and One" Food Production Factory is active even now in the production, installation, and start up of food machinery and equipment. He assessed Iran's existing technical potential. He said: Iranian technical experts in the manufacture and installation of machinery to produce food products have grown to the point that sometimes they can take complicated foreign or domestically made machinery and install it in other countries. He emphasized the need to use God-given and natural blessings such as the varying climates in the different regions of Iran. He said: With the exception of the nation's northern regions, in the rest of the provinces we have sunny weather about 300 days out of the year, and we must not overlook the situation that few countries enjoy other than ours, which is that the average production of various kinds of fruit in Iran is greater than the established international per-capital level. He emphasized that more than 84 percent of the raw materials needed by the food industries are produced in the agricultural sector. For this reason, Iran's food industries should be supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture, and the other ministries should be active in relation to this sector solely in construction and industry affairs. Continuing his remarks, Ashkuri said that to the extent we are able we should build the machinery needed by the food and conversion industries inside the country, but if we cannot we must import some of them, because no country in the world can produce all the equipment it needs on its own. However, what has not been discussed very much up until now is how to revitalize and make better use of of the traditional methods of preserving and keeping food in Iran. Iranians have long had various methods for keeping vegetables, fruit, and even dairy products and meat, some of which cost very little and have also passed the test in terms of hygiene. Those working in the country's food industries should not completely promote Western methods of keeping food. They should also do research and study on traditional methods of keeping food in Iran, and they should make changes in the traditional ways of drying vegetables, seeds and grains, because by drying some fruits and vegetables, not only are their special characteristics not diminished, but also sometimes with the actions and reactions that take place, the amount of vitamins in these kinds of crops sometimes even increases. Therefore, even if it is necessary to develop the conversion industries to reach export food markets, we should not plan for the people inside the country in the same way as for foreign markets and put products on the domestic markets that are suitable for the tastes of others. The final point is that some export goods such as saffron, licorice, henna, and other things, although apparently slight in volume, command a very high international price, higher than the price of the products and crops that are made from these products. For this reason, now that the world's most desirable saffron is produced in our country, we can also produce the subsequent products that are made using these raw materials and sell them on the international markets with very high added value.
