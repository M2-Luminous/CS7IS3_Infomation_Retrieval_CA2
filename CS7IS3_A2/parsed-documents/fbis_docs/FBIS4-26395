His brother Liu Qing, who is chairman of "China Human Rights" in New York, is 99 percent sure he has been arrested by the mainland authorities. Zhang Ling, another member of the LGLR in Anhui, has also been taken away by security personnel. Liu Qing is worried that a new round of dissident arrests has started in Beijing. On 9 March this year, Liu Nianchun, Yuan Hongbing, and Wang Zhongqiu officially applied to the authorities for the establishment of the LGLR. The application was handed in by Liu Nianchun to the Ministry of Civil Administration. As this was a pioneering undertaking on the mainland, indicating that the mainland's democracy movement had become more open, organized, and legalized, it attracted attention from the international media. The organization has a preparatory committee with more than 120 members nationwide, but because of their worries about large-scale arrests by the mainland authorities, their names have not been made public for the time being. Instead, Liu Nianchun and the other two shouldered the responsibility and appeared in public. Of the three men, Yuan Hongbin, a lecturer in the Law Faculty of Beijing University, was first arrested by the mainland authorities on 2 April. Another organizer, Wang Zhongqiu, was also arrested on 1 June. Wang Jiaqi, a postgraduate at the Law Faculty of Beijing University and another key member of the LGLR who was arrested together with Yuan Hongbin, escaped while being escorted from Beijing to Hebei's Tangshan Prison. With the assistance of underground pro-democracy organizations, he successfully arrived in Hong Kong on 15 April, gained U.S. political asylum, and went to New York via London. Liu Qing pointed out that Liu Nianchun had actually intended to leave for Jiangsu and lie low on the eve of the 4 June incident. His wife, who is in Beijing, last received a phone call from him on 26 May, and he said he would return to Beijing the following week. Liu Nianchun and one of his friends both disappeared on 28 May after they had a telephone conversation. Wang Zhongqiu also disappeared at the same time and his arrest was later confirmed.
