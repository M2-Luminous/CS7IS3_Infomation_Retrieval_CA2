Recently, for example, more than 100 applications for permanent residence have been filed in Dobrush Town militia passport department. People, including families with small children, from the Baltics, Transcaucasia, and Kazakhstan come here. It is better to die slowly from radiation than quickly from criminals, say the refugees. This is their main reason for changing their place of residence. Willing to demonstrate that they are not really scared by high levels of radiation, 12 families have already settled in Dubovy Loh village where the radiation level is 15-40 curies per square kilometer. Local authorities are delighted because they have acquired an additional labor force. However, what about the refugees' children?
