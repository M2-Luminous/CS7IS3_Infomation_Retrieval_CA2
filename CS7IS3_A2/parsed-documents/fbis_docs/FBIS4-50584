To implement conscientiously the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, to promote and provide guidance to a deepening of the reforms, and to ensure their healthy development, we offer the following views: I. Fully understand the importance and urgency of reforms in the property right system of town and township enterprises. The unique operating mechanism of our country's town and township enterprises, formed in the course of reform and opening up, is not only an important inner engine of growth, but also a key promoter of our country's economic structural reforms. As our country's socialist market economy system gradually takes shape, however, problems surface concerning town and township enterprises' operating mechanisms and the enterprise system. Chief among these problems is the ambiguous property right system in rural collective enterprises: Ownership is shared by everybody, while noone is responsible for the enterprise; responsibilities for property rights are unclear, and so are the respective responsibilities for administrative duties and enterprise management; rural administrative leaders frequently interfere arbitrarily with enterprises; enterprises are not really granted decisionmaking powers; workers' awareness of being the masters is weak; the lack of cohesiveness within enterprises; and the legal status and economic nature of some joint peasant household (cooperative) enterprises and the cooperative shares system remain undefined, and their legitimate interests thus are left unprotected. If we do not pay serious attention to these problems, they will affect and dampen the efficient, sustained, rapid, and healthy [gao xiao chi xu kuai su jian kang 7559 2400 2170 4958 1816, 6643 1696 1660] development of town and township enterprises. To fundamentally solve these problems, further improve and optimize enterprise operating mechanisms, and gradually establish a modern corporate system, town and township enterprises must accelerate the pace of property right reforms characterized by the cooperative shares system, make innovations in the property right system and operating mechanisms, and continually strengthen enterprises' vitality and dynamism. II. Further clarify the guiding thought and objectives for town and township enterprises' property right reforms. The guiding thought for town and township enterprises' property right reforms is: With the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as the direction, with the "three beneficial's" as the standard, and with developing the cooperative shares or the joint-stock system as the focus, we will further clarify property rights; perfect mechanisms; increase vitality; and promote the highly efficient, sustained, rapid, and healthy development of our country's town and township enterprises. The targets for town and township enterprises' property right reforms are: The rational circulation and optimal composition of various production factors in different regions, trades, enterprises, and types of ownership so as to ensure that the cooperative shares, joint-stock, contract, rental and lease, merger, and joint venture systems all can be perfected and can develop; that enterprises can become corporate entities with genuine independent operations, self-constraint, and self-development, and with responsibility for their own profits and losses and market competitive entities. This will lead, finally, to the establishment of a modern corporate system that can meet the objective requirements of a socialist market economy and socialized, large-scale production; is clear in property rights and responsibility and powers; separates administration from management; and employs scientific management. III. Continuously enrich the forms and contents of reforms in town and township enterprises' property rights. Reforms in town and township enterprises' property rights involve many types of ownership and are a complicated systems engineering project. At the present stage, the main forms for town and township enterprises' property right reforms are: 1) The definition and clarification of property rights. 2) Effective property rights transfers. 3) The final realization of property rights. 4) The management and supervision of property rights. The definition and clarification of property rights are the foundation for town and township enterprises' property right reforms. In general, we should absorb new shares (including individual and corporate shares, and so on) on the basis of sound asset evaluations and further clarification in definitions of property rights so as to put in place a business organization that allows diversification in the forms of property. Effective property rights transfers are a key link in property right reforms. Localities with conditions gradually must set up property right exchange markets so as to achieve effective property rights transfers. For enterprises not yet pursuing the cooperative shares or joint-stock systems, the basic ways for them to transfer property rights are mergers, auctions, bankruptcy, inheritance, and giving away as gifts. In the cooperative shares system, property rights generally can be transferred through conditional internal shares transfers. Joint-stock enterprises operate according to relevant state provisions. Property rights ultimately are expressed as actually possessing, deriving revenue from, and handling assets by property-holders so as to maintain and increase the assets' value. The fulfillment of property rights for town and township enterprises must comply with the principle of "being driven by multiple wheels and operating on multiple tracks," and requires the adoption of a company organization and operating mechanism in line with the characteristics of a property right-defined entity. Individual- and privately run enterprises can operate under the combination of ownership and management rights; township (town) and village collective enterprises must further improve the contract management responsibility system, actively pursue the cooperative shares and joint-stock systems, and vigorously develop business affiliation and business conglomerates so as to raise the operating efficiency of their assets. Administrative organs in charge of town and township enterprises must strengthen the management and supervision of town and township enterprises' property rights, and must supervise and inspect the enforcement of state laws, rules and regulations, and policies on enterprises' property rights. Leaders must participate in the formulation and implementation of reforms in the enterprise property right system, do a good job in evaluating enterprises' assets and defining property rights, handle disputes in enterprises' property rights properly and in conjunction with the departments concerned, and protect enterprises' legitimate rights and interests. Property- holders and operators should realize the management, supervision, and use of property rights. The property right system of town and township enterprises is being innovated continuously, and the form and contents of reforms are developing and changing perpetually. We must passionately support, correctly guide, actively help, and digest and popularize the organizational form of the new enterprise's property right created by the broad mass of peasants and verified thorugh practice. IV. Conscientiously solve the difficulties and key problems with reforms in the property rights of town and township enterprises. At the present stage, the primary and most important form for town and township enterprises' property right reforms is the cooperative shares system. This is a complicated and highly policy-related job. We should pay special attention to the following problems: 1. Do a good job of asset evaluation; it is the foundation of property right reforms. Asset evaluations should be aimed at correctly determining the value of an enterprise's assets and at guaranteeing the legitimate rights and interests of asset holders and operators; should observe the principles of authenticity, scientificalness, and feasibility; and refer to the standards, procedures, and methods provided by the state. Evaluations generally must be led by administrative departments one level higher than town and township enterprises, and require setting up an asset evaluation office that should consist mainly of personnel qualified in asset evaluations, and of village, enterprise, and worker representatives. Evaluation work should be done in the order of establishing the object for evaluation, asset screening and inspection, evaluations and assessments, and verification; its scope should include tangible and intangible assets. Methods for evaluations are tailored to the original and net value, degrees of newness, replacement cost, and profitability of the assets. Specifically, these include the present earnings value method, the replacement cost method, the present market value method, the liquidation value method, and other evaluation methods. 2. A rational shareholder composition. The owners of town and township enterprises' assets are varied, and they should be determined on the basis of relations between rationally ascertained asset holdings (including evaluated carryover assets and increases in new assets). In general, there can be village shares, individual shares, social corporate shares, and foreign-capital shares. In pursuing the cooperative shares system, rural collective enterprises must offer village and individual shares; other shares are offered subject to the investment structure. Depending on needs, after a rural collective enterprise has changed over to the cooperative shares system, it can offer ordinary and preference shares, with their respective rights and dividends clearly defined. 3. Clarify property right relations. In pursuing the cooperative shares system, rural enterprises must clarify the property right to their stock assets. The general principle is that whoever makes the investment owns it, a respect for the history of the development of the enterprise, and consultation on an equal footing. There is no need to trace how the former enterprise got hold of its stock assets, which can be allocated between village shares and individual shares for the enterprise's workers. Dividends for village shares are used mainly for developing enterprises, the projects of subsidizing and developing agriculture with industry, and social charities, but they cannot be used to cover the administrative expenditure of township (town) governments. As for clarity in property rights, the property right holder of village shares is to some extent "postulated." In this regard localities may explore boldly, as long as it benefits enterprise development. The workers' individual shares included in the individual shares come from two parts: One is from capital or other assets invested by individual workers, and shares offered to match this part of contribution are the same as social individual shares. The other comes from a certain proportion of what has been determined, in asset evaluations, as the stock assets of the original enterprise. The ownership and corresponding shares of this proportion of assets should be given to workers according to their contributions toward the establishment of the enterprises, their seniority, and their work responsibility. This kind of workers' individual shares can only generate dividends and cannot be inherited, given away as gifts, or transferred. Holders of these kinds of shares are seen as giving them up when they leave the enterprise for personal reasons. 4. Do a good job in the distribution of interests. The rural cooperative and shares system is a special business organization. Care must be taken to take into account the interests of the state, enterprises, workers, and shareholders; to combine distribution according to work with dividends according to shares; and to handle profit distribution reasonably. First, pay income taxes according to the law. Second, pay compensation for confiscated goods, as well as all tax arrears and fines. Third, make up the previous annual losses incurred by the enterprise in question. Fourth, withdraw money from the public and welfare funds in accordance with current relevant provisions. Fifth, withdraw money from the discretionary public fund, the amount of withdrawal determined by the shareholder general meeting or board of directors. Sixth, shares and dividend distribution should be such as that dividends match shares, with equal sharing in interests and risk. Ordinary shareholders should bear the brunt of risk for the enterprise, and returns on their shares may vary according to the risk taken, so that dividends may rise or fall in proportion to the enterprise's economic returns. Preference shares may be calculated on an interest-guaranteed and dividend-sharing basis, but the total sum of share interests and dividends must not exceed the rate of returns on the enterprise's total assets. 5. Integrate organically the cooperative shares system with the contract system. The cooperative shares system helps overcome the problem of short-sighted behaviors prompted by the contract system, such as reaping profits without bearing losses. In view of the fact that the contract system is still a major operating mechanism in rural collective enterprises where it plays an active role, enterprises not yet prepared to pursue the cooperative shares system should increase their efforts to improve the contract system by introducing, one at a time, the procedures and methods of the cooperative shares system, seeing the improvement of the contract system as a means of promoting the cooperatives shares system, and being ready to move into the cooperative shares system once conditions permit. Enterprises capable of pursuing the cooperative shares system can introduce some of the shareholding system into the contract system, so that the enterprise can have the advantages of both the contract system and the cooperative shares system, and can integrate the two organically. 6. Handle well the relations between rural administrative organizations and enterprises pursuing the cooperative shares system. As a new form of business organization, the cooperative shares system differs from the traditional rural collective enterprise. Rural administrative and economic organizations cannot manage these enterprises with the traditional management methods they use with rural collective enterprises. They must try hard not to interfere administratively and should be concerned mainly with providing guidance, supervision, and coordinated services. They should monitor enterprises' enforcement and implementation of state laws, rules and regulations, and policies; arrange for management for enterprises; guide them concerning work in this area, together with the departments concerned; coordinate relations between enterprises; help secure economic and technological cooperation; sum up and popularize enterprises' experiences in development; mobilize and guide enterprises on how to strengthen ideological and political work; promote spiritual civilization in enterprises; and create essential conditions for enterprises to train and recruit professional and technical staff and to introduce advanced technology. Enterprises pursuing the cooperative shares system or joint-stock system also should handle well their relations with rural administrative and economic organizations, voluntarily accept their guidance and supervision, and contribute to local economic pursuits and the common good. 7. Define the administrative and management responsibilities of town and township enterprise administrative departments to the rural cooperative shares system. The pursuit of the cooperative shares system by town and township enterprises is a reform and innovation in enterprises' business organization,and does not change the nature of town and township enterprises. Therefore, the subordination relation still remains for enterprises; planning, guidance, management, supervision, and coordinated services are still done by town and township enterprise administrative departments. Enterprises of the town and township cooperative shares system should fulfil their obligations according to the "PRC Regulations on Rural Collective-Ownership Enterprises." V. Genuinely strengthen leadership over reforms in the property rights of town and township enterprises. A significant change in itself, reform in the property rights of town and township enterprises involves adjustment in the interests of varied parties, and is a job with strong policy import, cutting across many sectors. Town and township enterprise administrative departments at all levels must fully appreciate the importance of town and township enterprises for property right reforms and the complicated nature of the task; include this job on their agendas; and genuinely strengthen leadership, especially in inducing rural and enterprise leaders ideologically in an attempt to help them overcome ideological barriers, heighten the sense of reform and opening up, and raise awareness in pursuing property right reforms. Leaders at all levels must be personally involved in pilot schemes, sum up experiences, insist on seeking truth from facts, tailor measures to local conditions, vary guidance according to different areas of work, and refrain uniform and sweeping applications. Town and township enterprise administrative departments at all levels must make clear who and which organs are responsible for this task, must actively seek support from party committees at the same level, and provide policy and legal protection for reforms in the property rights of town and township enterprises. Under the unified leadership of party committees and governments, they must work in coordination with the departments concerned, cooperate fully, pursue well reforms town and township enterprises' property rights, and work vigorously to achieve major breakthroughs in this work.
