The first of these is a change in U.S. policy and its dealings with the Arabs, particularly with the Syrian president, who has proved his ability to negotiate and make great political gains through the imposition of a just and honorable settlement. In a statement he made today, Minister Dallul paid tribute to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad for promoting the Arab position, noting that he did not treat the Golan issue as more important than the Lebanese, Jordanian, or Palestinian issues. He said that the lesson of the historic summit is summed up as the need for steadfastness in pursuing Arab rights and not to follow the method of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which is facing new obstacles every day. Information Minister Michel Samahah said that the summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton has moved the Middle East into a new era and laid the basis for achieving a just and comprehensive peace. He said: What happened yesterday put an end to efforts to achieve a separate peace. It also put an end to Israel's efforts to deal with each Arab party separately. The summit emphasized the comprehensive nature of the solution, the justness of the Arab demands, and the need for a just and comprehensive peace based on the UN resolutions, particularly Resolutions 242, 323, and 425, and on the principle of land for peace. Minister Samahah saluted President al-Asad for supporting Arab rights, particularly Resolution 425. He said: We must give due credit to the one who represented Arab dignity and expressed the Arab desire to negotiate on the basis of a firm and principled position, thus winning international recognition for Arab rights. He said: The Geneva summit is a new turning point. We must face the challenge through unity. Minister Samahah was speaking at a meeting with Milhim Karam, chairman of the Editors Association, and members of the association's council.
