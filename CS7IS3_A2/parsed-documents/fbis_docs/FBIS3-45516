When examining and approving the establishment of foreign-funded enterprises and compensatory trade projects, matters relating to the licenses for importing raw materials and spare parts and for exporting products, including the increase or decrease in the number of the originally approved licenses due to the expansion of operational domains by enterprises and goods requiring one-time export licenses should be reported in the form of official documents by the economic and trade bureaus of various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities listed separately for development to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [MOFERT], which will examine them and give official replies in the form of ministry documents. 2. Within the number of licenses permitted by the official replies from MOFERT, if the products produced by the enterprises themselves meet the stipulations of the replies, the license-issuing departments should issue licenses according to the reply documents. No license should be issued to an enterprise which does not have the MOFERT document or a letter permitting a license. Various license-issuing units should observe strict examination and inspection. 3. It is hereby reiterated that foreign-funded enterprises are not permitted to purchase products for export without authorization, and, if such a situation is discovered, it will be handled as an illegal operation. If an enterprise needs to purchase products for export in order to strike a balance between foreign exchange income and expenditures, it should go through the reporting and approval formalities according to the relevant regulations of the country.
