This was stated by the president of the National Association of Industrialists (ANDI), Carlos Arturo Angel Arango, in a message to the members of the association. According to Angel Arango, it was not easy to get good results in negotiations in which the trade commitments had been defined beforehand and the political circumstances, with the imminent change of government in Venezuela, required immediate decisions. The leader of the business association said that in view of these circumstances, an overall evaluation leads to the conclusion that the negotiations were handled well by the Foreign Trade Ministry. In his view, the Colombian industrial sector "will not find it easy" to adjust to the new system. He explained that the country-of-origin standards will be more stringent for Colombian companies and for other sectors because their production conditions are less favorable than those of Mexico, and the new developments will provide little or no protection from that country's goods. "Nevertheless," added Angel, "we are not interested in discussing the mechanisms contained in the agreement right now; the ANDI will do that later, and the necessary analyses are being prepared for that purpose." Angel indicated that the trade agreement with Mexico goes much further than this type of pact usually does. The commitment will be a key factor in the country's future tariff situation, making the economic liberalization irreversible and its expansion inevitable. The president of the ANDI reiterated that the Colombian industrial sector is preparing to compete with an economy like Mexico's, which, in turn, must face the challenge of competing on an equal footing with the United States. The Agreement Angel suggested that we join the Free Trade Agreement quickly; otherwise, we will be at a disadvantage in competing with Mexico, especially with regard to raw materials and capital goods, "since our partner will have the benefit of having the United States as a supplier in the next few years." As the agreement stands now, Colombia may export 62 percent of its industrial goods tariff-free, while Mexico may sell only 16 percent of its goods tariff-free. Mexico, on the other hand, will have to wait five years before the products that were on the semi-slow list can enter the Colombian market free of tariff. Other sectors' goods will see annual tariff decreases of 10 percent for the next 10 years. The tariff protection of vehicles will be dismantled in two years. In addition, the agreement calls for the creation of an automotive committee that is to establish a barter program within two years. This instrument obliges Mexico to import from Colombia a greater value of vehicles than it exports. In agriculture, it was decided to exclude from the liberalization program farm products that are subject to price bands or receive some type of subsidy in Mexico. The pact brings the Colombian economy into an expanded market with 145 million consumers, in a region producing $373 billion worth of goods and services (gross domestic product).
