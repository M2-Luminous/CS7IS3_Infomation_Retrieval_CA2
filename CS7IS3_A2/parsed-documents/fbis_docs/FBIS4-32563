Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik pointed out that the functioning of a parliamentary democracy requires a stable structure of political parties, which is an important prerequisite for political stability. According to him, the coming elections can also play an important role from the point of view of sharpening the profile of the political scene. Jozef Moravcik stated that the Left is forming well and that the Right of the political spectrum is also clear. However, he said that the situation is difficult in the center, where a rather complicated development can yet be expected. Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, described the coalition government as a broad-based experiment that cannot be maintained over the longer term. He said of Jozef Moravcik's Cabinet that it is heading for economic ruin in going back to a given macroeconomic policy, that it is incompetent in the financial sphere, and that it is coping badly with privatization.
