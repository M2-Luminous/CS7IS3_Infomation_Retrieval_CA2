Kvasov, leader of the Russian Federation Government apparatus, by Iosif Galperin; place and date of interview not given: "Civil Servant Should Have a Proud Ring, Believes V.P. Kvasov, Leader of the Russian Federation Government apparatus"] [Text] ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA has published a document defining the concepts of the federal state service and the federal state employee and precisely and clearly prescribes the bans and benefits connected with this service and outlines the civil servant's path from consultant to state adviser. We asked Vladimir Petrovich Kvasov, under whose leadership the document is being elaborated, what gave rise to its appearance. [Kvasov] Today we are in practice creating a new state. All its ideas are included in the draft Constitution adopted by the nationwide referendum. The controllability of the economy requires the building of an absolutely new state service system and its standardized regulation. At federal, regional, and local level. There is a decision of the president's on the restructuring of the management apparatus and even earlier decisions on the restructuring of local organs came into force. It was for this that a statute was adopted to ensure that from the outset state service is joined by qualified people. The edict states that this statute does not regulate questions of the posts of government members, the leader of the president's administration, and other so-called political posts. What is new for Russia is that we are distinguishing between administrative and political posts. We are approaching an establishment of power whereby political leaders come and go but the apparatus operates. That is necessary for the stability and continuity of power and in addition the civil servant will be protected from political tyranny. This statute is the first attempt in Russian history to put state administrative workers in their places. The actual mechanism for making and executing decisions and monitoring the job and the person doing it has been recorded. There are also prohibitions. For instance, they cannot take part in strikes. The civil servant does not have the right to hold another post at the same time. Teaching is an exception. The state employee does not have the right to engage in business personally or even through agents, to be a representative of third parties in a state organ and use for nonofficial purposes information which has been supplied to him, or to receive a fee for publishing items as part of his official activity. [Galperin] In Germany, for instance, state service is considered one of the most privileged of jobs. If a person joins the state service his whole life ahead is assured. And that plus point is evened out by very powerful protection against minus points, there is a law on the ban on professions, they do not accept political extremists for state service. For instance a Communist Party or Fascist Party member cannot be a state employee... [Kvasov] The state service should be outside party allegiance. That does not mean that the employee does not have the right to belong to a particular party or public organization. That is a violation of human rights. But he must not be tied by party decisions, which is enshrined in the statute. That is the first, quite mild, stage. [Galperin] When political life in the country once becomes settled, when the parties' real political faces become clear, then this requirement for a state employee will probably be made specific by some separate statute and separate law and so forth? [Kvasov] Initially we were more specific. But we decided to leave it like that for the time being. That is also a step forward, although it must be said that a number of norms envisaged by the draft statute are not norms for direct action (the institution of state posts and the determination of qualifications requirements for them, and others) and should be made more specific by other Russian Federation legislative acts. At the same time their inclusion in the draft lends the statute integrity, provides an opportunity for the consistent building of a state service system in accordance with necessity and as these acts become ready and also facilitates the transition in the future to legal norms. [Galperin] Take the following example. In Bashkortostan it was the Supreme Soviet chairman who signed a secret edict about how all civil servants in any state organs have the right to a 10-year loan at an interest rate of 8 percent for an amount equal to 120 monthly salaries. This was adopted before the elections and started to operate during the elections. From the viewpoint of morality, for instance, that is understandable, but how to assess this from the viewpoint of the statute on the state employee in general? [Kvasov] The state employee, because the state places him in an organizational framework, should have a certain compensation. But the compensation should be the same for all. In Bashkiria and Ryazan Oblast. That is the principle. But I consider such regional decisions to be purely populist. [Galperin] Perhaps the most interesting thing for readers will be the new table of ranks. Will the "titular counsellor" and "collegiate assessor" really become modern again? [Kvasov] We spent a long time discussing the introduction of a table of ranks. Before the revolution it simply defined a civil servant's place in the official hierarchy but did not touch on the range of his duties. We decided to reintroduce it but within a system with other solutions. Materially a "rank" adds little, merely a small percentage increase. The main thing here is the moral incentive. For instance, a third class consultant (the lowest rank) knows he can serve to a higher rank. The top civil servant is a full state councillor of the Russian Federation. Any rank is retained upon retirement but is referred to as "retired," which should attract people to state service. And, second, people will start to treat their work more responsibly. In our state service now we have cases of corruption and abuse of official position. And how should we fight this? By increasing responsibility and involvement. For instance, having worked 12 and one half years in state service a man can later, when he reaches pension age, receive a pension which is 80 percent of his salary. And the pension is then indexed. [Galperin] It is still hard for the state to vie with private firms and particularly with joint ventures.... [Kvasov] Indeed, responsibility there is less and wages are bigger. But state service is stabler. An employee can be thrown out of a firm at any time, but just try doing that here! Look at what a complex dismissal process has been included in the statute. You must understand that when a person does not value his job, when a civil servant thinks, never mind, if they dismiss me I shall join a private firm and earn several times more, it is then that temptation arises. In the West an attempt to bribe a civil servant ends with the civil servant dragging the briber to the police. A man there feels he is a representative of the state, second, the state protects him, so he cannot be gotten to. In our country, unfortunately, there has been none of all this. In the past a party card was some kind of restraining factor. But when the oppression of party commitments disappeared the double-headed flower of corruption immediately bloomed in the organs of state management at all levels. The new statute is one attempt, by increasing the value of state service, to struggle against corruption. We are seeking to change the attitude which has formed over the past 75 years which views the civil servant as a bureaucrat. What is bureaucracy? If you look it up in Dal, it is what the state needs. You remember how KROKODIL used to portray bureaucrats in our country? The bureaucrat sits there and looks up some paragraph or point or other. And he says that according to some rule you cannot do something. But who wrote that rule? The state. That means we blamed the bureaucrat for observing the state's interest. Do you understand? That is, in first publishing a law we implied it was for paper only, for form's sake. And those who tried to observe the letter of the law were called bureaucrats. But today that is precisely the kind of person we need. We are issuing thousands of laws, decrees, and directives. And to ensure that they all operate we need people who can fulfill them. At present we have a situation in which if we like a decision we fulfill it and if we don't we pretend it does not exist. But if some control organ or some inspector "catches you out" then you say: "Oh, sorry, we overlooked it! We forgot to pay 500 million rubles tax...." [Galperin] At the time of early perestroyka the main slogan was that there were too many bureaucrats. The 18 million people employed in the management apparatus had to be reduced, etc., and now there are also sometimes accusations that since the reforms the number of apparatus workers has not declined. [Kvasov] Naturally, today even in the field of economic management we cannot retain all structures in the form in which they existed a year ago. They are beginning to harm matters. We must constantly adapt the management structure's substructure to the new economic realities. So there is nothing surprising about the fact that we periodically abolish some ministries and create some organs. That is an ordinary redistribution of functions between state organs -- a redistribution dictated by life. [Galperin] And between Moscow and the regions. [Kvasov] First, an increasing number of functions are being taken from the center and transferred to the regions. Look at the Constitution. It does not state that the government manages. Although it is not ruled out that an integral system of state enterprises will remain in our country. But that is not the main thing. The government elaborates and submits a state federal budget and ensures its fulfillment. That is its task is to pursue a unified financial and monetary and credit policy. The government only manages federal property. And the amount of federal property is constantly dwindling. We are also issuing it to the regions so naturally with the reduction of the volume of federal property there will be a reduction in the sphere of federal management. Although some new structures may perhaps be created in the regions. But at a completely different level, not vertically but horizontally.
