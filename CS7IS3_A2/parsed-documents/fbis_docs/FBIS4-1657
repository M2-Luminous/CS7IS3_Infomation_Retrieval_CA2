An autonomous telecom authority would be spun off from the ministry this year, to be given charge of all telecom developments in the country and more power would be devolved to regional authorities, Li Zhigang, the section chief of the ministry's department of policy and regulation, said. "We want to separate policy matters from commercial operations to make the sector more efficient. There will be more competition and greater liberalisation," Li said after giving a speech at a business conference sponsored by the Institute for International Research. He said the establishment of China United Telecommunications Corporation (CUTC), a state company responsible for its own financing, was an example of increased competition in the sector. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has had a monopoly over all domestic and international services. This would change after CUTC became operational. Li confirmed CUTC was permitted to compete in almost all areas, including the construction of the country's second network, although the company was expected to initially concentrate on mobile phones and value-added services in coastal areas. He said CUTC was likely to have registered share capital of 600m renminbi (about HK$533m [Hong Kong dollars]), around 40 percent of which could come from the Ministry of Electronic Industry, the Ministry of Electric Power and the Ministry of Railways. Companies including China International Trust and Investment Corporation, China Huaneng and China Everbright are considering taking stakes. Li said CUTC would probably be established in May. He said China's telecom law, in the making since the 1950s, was likely to be completed next year, giving a legal framework to all telecom developments. Li told the business conference at the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel that China's public telecom switchboard capacity increased by 10.8 million lines, or 58 percent, to 29.36 million lines last year over 1992. There were 5.86 million new telephone subscribers, a rise of 51 percent, and 185,000 more long-distance circuits, up 79.5 percent. "This means the year's overall telecom traffic had increased by 68.5 percent," Li said. He said at the end of last year, the penetration rate of China's telephone lines was 1.46 percent, with the penetration rate of telephone sets at 2.15 percent. The number of mobile phone subscribers was 638,000 and pagers totalled 5.6 million, an increase of 2.5 times and 3.6 times respectively over 1992. Li said it was hoped that by 2000, on average every household in China would have one telephone, and the number of mobile phone subscribers would reach 5 million. The aim is for phone line penetration to reach 5.9 percent and phone set penetration 7.5 percent (with big and medium cities averaging 30-40 percent).
