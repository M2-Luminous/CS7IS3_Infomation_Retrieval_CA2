Bunin, T.V. Korzh, T.F. Terentyev,Ye.G. Kurzina, and S.M. Kalinina, Moscow; UDC 669.15:539.43] [Abstract] An experimental study of maraging alloy steels was made concerning their fatigue strength and the mechanism of crack propagation in them under cyclic loads. The industrial-grade EP 678 steel (0.022% C, 10 9.30% Ni, 1.95% Mo, 0.84% Ti, 0.09% Cu, 0.088% Al, 0.06% Zn, 0.02% Mn, 0.01% Nb, 0.14% Si, 0.008% P, 0.007% S, 0.002 B) had been selected as a representative of this group. Ingots of this steel were heat treated as follows: quenching from 950-970�C in water for 30 min + aging at 520+/-10�C for 3 h. For fatigue tests and for microstructural examination they were cold-rolled into 3 mm thick strips after quenching and into 2 mm thick strips after aging. Some of the steel was quenched from 980�C and then cold-rolled into rods 50 mm in diameter for extra test. For determination of its standard mechanical properties, some of the steel was cold-rolled into rods 5 mm in diameter and specimens were cut out of them with the axis oriented in the direction of rolling. Cracking resistance under static loads was determined on 15 mm thick prismatic specimens under eccentric tension. For a determination of cracking resistance under impact loads acting perpendicularly to the direction of rolling, 10 mm square and 55 mm long bar specimens with a 1 mm deep notch were tested in a Charpy machine. Cyclic testing at a 50 Hz frequency was done: 1) in an Instron-1603 machine on rods 50 mm in diameter under pure flexure, for determination of the endurance limit;2) in an Instron-1253 machine on 2 mm and 3 mm thick 50x300 mm[.sup]2[/] large plates, for exploration of the fatigue fracture micromechanisms during steady crack growth and during accelerated crack growth. All mechanical tests were performed at 20�C temperature. Microstructural examination was done under a Neophot-3 optical microscope, under a JEM-200 electron emission microscope by the method of replicas, and under a JSM-U3 scanning electron microscope. Specimens for this examination were electropolished with an electrolyte containing 1 g CrO[.sub]3[/] + 65 ml H[.sub]3[/]PO[.sub]4[/] + 15 ml H[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/] and etched with an HNO[.sub]3[/]:HCl= 3:1 mixture. Particular attention was paid to the zone of intense plastic deformation at the tip of a growing fatigue crack, metallographic examination having revealed here pores and discrete discontinuities along the grain boundary. The results of this study, including diagrams of fatigue fracture kinetics based on the test data, correlate with the hypothesis of fractal geometry in nature (B.B. Mandelbrot, 1984) and the theory of self-organized criticality (P. Bak, K. Chen; V MIRE NAUKI, No. 3, 1991.). The authors thank L.G. Orlov for helping with microstructural examination.
