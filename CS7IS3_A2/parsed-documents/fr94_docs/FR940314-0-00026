Note 3: Measuring instructions for refurbished brakes can be found in the ABS Component Maintenance Manual with Illustrated Parts List AP&hyph;652 (Fokker Manual No. 32&hyph;43&hyph;77) or in ABS Service Bulletin Fo100&hyph;32&hyph;38. (2) Any brake using a heat stack kit with an ``R'' after the P/N must use the wear pin length specified on the Airworthiness Tag that accompanies each heat stack kit, and must not use the ``Alternate Wear Measurement'' noted in Table 1 of this AD under ``Non-Refurbished Brakes'' to determine the brake's maximum wear limit. Any of these brakes that are worn more than the maximum wear limit must be replaced, prior to further flight, with a brake that is within the limits specified in Table 2 of this AD. (b) Within 180 days after the effective date of this AD, incorporate the following information into the FAA-approved maintenance program:
