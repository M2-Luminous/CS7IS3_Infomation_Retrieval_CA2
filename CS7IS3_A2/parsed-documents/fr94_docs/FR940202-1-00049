FR940202-1-00049 FR940202-1-00015 Spawning Escapement Goal Prior to 1987, the OCN coho spawning escapement goal was 200,000 adults, the MSY spawning escapement level determined by the ODFW. The current method of determining the OCN coho spawning escapement goal and harvest rate was adopted by the Council in 1986 and implemented by Amendment 7 to the FMP beginning in 1987. Amendment 7 established an OCN spawning escapement goal floor of 135,000 coho for estimated ocean abundances of up to 270,000 coho. the spawning escapement goal changes to 50 percent of the ocean abundance (50 percent harvest rate) for ocean abundances between 270,000 and 400,000 coho, and is capped at 200,000 coho for ocean abundances above 400,000 coho. Amendment 7 was intended to allow some additional harvest in years when unusual conditions such as the 1983 El Ni√±o might temporarily reduce stock abundance below 400,000 coho. The analysis supporting Amendment 7 indicated that implementing the amendment would provide increased economic benefits with a low likelihood that occasionally allowing the spawning escapement to drop to the floor level of 135,000 would jeopardize the continued productivity of the OCN stock. The analysis supporting deviations from the fixed 200,000 spawning escapement goal at low stock sizes assumed that such deviations would occur infrequently. However, since 1985 the annual spawning escapement goal has been set below the 200,000 MSY level 50 percent of the time, and since 1979 the actual spawning escapement has met or exceeded 200,000 coho in only a single year, 1984. During this same period, the post-season estimates of total OCN stock size have not exceeded 360,000 coho salmon, compared to the 700,000 stock size that is believed to represent the MSY level. The reasons for this extended stock depression are not completely understood. Factors contributing to the decline of OCN coho include widespread and significant degradation of freshwater habitat, an extended period of poor ocean survival, and overestimation of stock abundance. The methodology for predicting the ocean abundance of OCN coho south of Cape Falcon has had mixed results since 1984. Despite a rigorous technical review of the OCN predictor by the Council in 1987, the predictor has consistently and significantly overestimated preseason abundance since its adoption in 1988. As a result, the formula in the FMP for calculating the spawning escapement goal and associated ocean harvest rate for OCN coho has resulted in overharvest and spawning escapement falling short of its goal for the past 6 years. In April 1991, the Council established an overfishing work group to review the status of OCN coho. This assessment was completed in February 1992 and included a review of the stock abundance predictor. While the current methodology was under review, the Council was not able to implement a new methodology that was more reliable than the current predictor for estimating ocean abundance. To compensate for the overestimation bias in the current predictor, the Council relied on emergency regulations in 1991, 1992, and 1993 to reduce the ocean harvest rate on OCN coho from the levels set in Amendment 7, thus allowing additional natural spawners to escape the ocean fisheries. Amendment 11 would modify the OCN coho spawning escapement goal so as to achieve an aggregate OCN adult spawning density of 42 naturally spawning adults per mile in standard index survey areas each year. The standard index survey areas are 48 different stream sections that have been surveyed by ODFW each year since 1950. Under the current methods used by ODFW, the number of spawners in the standard index area is extrapolated for 4,764 miles of coastal spawning habitat. This translates to a numerical spawning escapement goal of 200,000. The original FMP spawning escapement goal of 200,000 was based on this expansion. This number of adult spawners per mile was documented as the estimated MSY spawning escapement level in an ODFW study of coastal stream spawning escapements and subsequent production from 1950 to 1980. The ODFW is currently in the fourth year of a 5-year study to confirm the relationship between the number of natural spawners counted in standard index survey areas and the total OCN coho salmon spawning populations. This study may provide a better definition of the total OCN coho spawning population when it is completed, and the results may lead to revisions in the estimated total number of spawners at the MSY level that is calculated by extrapolating from the 42 adults per mile in the standard index survey areas. This type of change would not necessitate any further changes to the FMP or its implementing regulations. If further studies result in recommended changes to the optimum number (42) of adult spawners per mile in the standard index survey areas, the FMP will need to be amended or, if the change is purely technical, the spawning escapement goal may be revised through the framework provided in 50 CFR 661, Appendix IV.B. At this time, however, Amendment 11 represents the best available science. Amendment 11 also states that when OCN coho abundance is forecast to be less than 125 percent of the annual numerical escapement goal, or below 250,000 fish at the present spawner escapement goal of 200,000 adults, an incidental exploitation rate of up to 20 percent would be allowed for ocean and freshwater fisheries targeting on non-OCN coho salmon stocks. Concern was expressed that, when OCN coho abundance forecasts are below 168,750, the proposal for up to a 20 percent incidental harvest rate could allow OCN coho spawning escapements below the 135,000 fish floor currently contained in the FMP. In response to this concern, the Council modified the proposal to emphasize that the 20 percent represented a maximum harvest rate. The Council will evaluate the actual level of incidental harvest of OCN coho that might be expected to occur in fisheries for chinook salmon and non-OCN coho salmon and will recommend only the minimum incidental harvest rate necessary to prosecute other fisheries, provided the rate chosen will cause no irreparable harm to the OCN stock.
