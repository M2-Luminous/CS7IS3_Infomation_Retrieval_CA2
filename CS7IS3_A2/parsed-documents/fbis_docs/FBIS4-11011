Marcos Balladares, National Conciliation Party representative to COPAZ, disclosed the result of the consensus COPAZ had reached to send this proposal to the Legislative Assembly within the framework of the implementation of constitutional reforms in our country. [Begin recording] [Balladares] There are three areas. The first is in the Judicial Branch. A consensus has been reached to deliver to the honorable Legislative Assembly that which concerns judicial issues. That is: the Supreme Court of Justice should not appoint and dismiss the magistrates and the judges in the diverse institutions of the Judicial Branch. Second, the National Council of the Judiciary should be in charge of making these appointments and these dismissals. The third point is to review in a bit more detail the mechanisms of the National Council of the Judiciary's integration and its duties. This should be done in view of the new duties that the very National Council of the Judiciary may be awarded within these constitutional reforms. This is in relation to the the Judicial Branch, specifically concerning judges and magistrates. These are the agreements reached by consensus in COPAZ that have already been delivered to the Legislative Assembly. There has also been consensus with regard to the attorneys. In this regard COPAZ agreed that it should definitely not be the Supreme Court of Justice that authorizes or suspends attorneys. This is an issue broadly debated in the diverse forums of our nation, and COPAZ has basically resolved that it should not be the Supreme Court of Justice that authorizes or suspends the attorneys. On this point, however, COPAZ's proposal goes even further and is much more practical [words indistinct] indicating that this is a function equal to the medical profession's oversight board. This is another issue that has even been analyzed in other forums and by other institutions, given that the National Council of the Judiciary's, through its seven oversight boards, has been very effective in its operation and in its oversight of the associations. COPAZ considers this should be something similar to an oversight board that exists in the medical profession that should have those specific duties with regard to the attorneys. As far as due process is concerned, there are some resolutions that COPAZ had taken that basically consist in reducing administrative detention provided for in [word indistinct] second, Article 13, from 62 to 48 hours. As you know when someone is detained by the administrative authorities, they have a maximum of 62 hours to be remanded over to the court. This is what is provided for in the Constitution. That is, administrative authorities have a maximum of 62 hours for this. Well, COPAZ's proposal is aimed at reducing this maximum of 62 hours to a maximum of 48 hours before being handed over to the court. This is also a resolution made by consensus that we think will help speed up the administration of justice in our country. In another point related to due process in Article 14, administrative authorities no longer will have the power to impose sanctions, or [word indistinct] detentions against individuals. Currently... [pauses] here is a little background. In the previous Constitution the administrative authority could impose sanctions -- of course after due process, before a procedure, and the handing down of a sentence. The administrative authority previously could order up to 30 days' detention. The 1983 Constitution reduced this period to 15 days. Therefore, the current Constitution provides that the administrative authority can impose detentions of up to 15 days. Well, COPAZ's proposal, through consensus, is that the administrative authorities can no longer issue any detention orders. On this point, COPAZ has been specific and clear that there is an exception in this regard. This has also been communicated to the Legislative Assembly. That is, it is proposed that administrative authorities should not be able to issue detention orders except in the case of military jurisdiction and in the case of the National Civilian Police, when internal regulations are violated in those two institutions.
