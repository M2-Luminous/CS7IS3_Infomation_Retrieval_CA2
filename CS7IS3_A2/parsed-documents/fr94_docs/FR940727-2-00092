Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Employer is a Delaware Corporation with its principal place of business located in Chicago, Illinois. The Plans are all defined contribution plans. The estimated number of participants in each of the Plans as of December 31, 1993 is: a. Bally's Employee Savings Trust for Administrative Employees: 729 b. Bally's Employees Savings Trust for Club Employees: 4,775 c. Bally's Grand, Inc. Contributory Savings Plan: 1,269 d. Bally's Grand (GNOC Corp.) Retirement Savings Voluntary Participation Plan: 1,164 e. The Amended and Restated Bally's Park Place, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan: 2,162 2. The assets of all five Plans are held in the Master Trust. Each Plan holds units of participation representing an undivided interest in the assets of the Master Trust. As of December 31, 1993, the total amount of Plan assets held in the Master Trust was approximately $95,000,000. The terms of the Plans permit participants to direct the investment of their accounts under the Plans. Each of the Plans provides its participants the option of investing in any of six mutual funds managed by Fidelity Management and Research Company, including the Interest Income Fund. The GICs, which were acquired directly by the Master Trust, are considered part of the Interest Income Fund. The Interest Income Fund has investments in several guaranteed investment contracts. On April 4, 1989, the Master Trust acquired GIC A ( # CGO 1318 A3A) from Executive Life for $4,000,000. GIC A provided for annual, guaranteed interest at the rate of 10.13%, with a maturity date of October 15, 1992. On July 3, 1989, the Master Trust acquired GIC B ( # CGO 1331 A3A) from Executive Life for $3,000,000. GIC B provided for annual guaranteed interest at the rate of 9.01%, with a maturity date of October 15, 1993. 3. On April 11, 1991, Executive Life was placed into conservatorship by the Insurance Commissioner of the State of California. The Employer represents that Executive Life ceased payments on the GICs upon commencement of the conservatorship. The effect of the conservatorship has been to freeze all assets invested in the GICs. This freeze has prevented Plan participants from exercising their rights under the Plans to request distributions, loans, withdrawals and investment transfers with respect to amounts currently invested in the GICs. 7 7 The Department notes that the decisions to acquire and hold the GICs are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements of Part 4, Subtitle B, Title I of the Act. In this regard, the Department is not herein proposing relief for any violations of Part 4 which may have arisen as a result of the acquisition and holding of the GICs issued by Executive Life.
