For its sake every politician, social figure, and citizen must renounce personal ambitions and claims to power at any price and moderate his arrogance, which is a sin of destructive force. It is necessary once and for all to renounce the view that in our society there are two hostile camps, the righteous and the unworthy. We have all been affected differently by defects and shortcomings and we have only one salvation -- justice and obedience to the law. It is that striving which will provide the opportunity to convincingly and fully reveal the character of a great nation -- determination, energy, will, and morality -- because the exalted character of each of us means the exaltation of society and the quality of a great power. That is why we need civil peace. The people of Russia have always been great in their sober-mindedness and mercy. Hatred of one another and revenge for innocently shed blood can have no place in our society today, much less in the future. Without national reconciliation the country cannot overcome the economic, political, and social chaos. Without civil peace, creation and a decent life are impossible. Last fall all who were in the House of the Soviets and on the barricades performed their civic and patriotic duty to the end in defense of the new-born parliamentarism, democracy, and the Constitution. Many of them paid the ultimate price -- their life -- trying to save the honor and dignity of the Russian state and prevent the country's slide into dictatorship. They died victorious and their names have gone down forever in the motherland's history. I grieve deeply for the dead and the maimed who were at the center of the bloody events. I am sure that the fatherland will never forget the steadfastness and courage of the selfless and cruelly slandered defenders of Russian democracy. For my part I shall do everything in my power to perpetuate the shining memory of those who died. This terrible and tragic time has shown that it is impossible to transgress the state's fundamental law in order to hold on to personal power without dire consequences for the people and the whole country. I have always consistently supported the observance of the rule of law and I shall solemnly adhere to that principle in the future too. There can be nothing higher than the law, and the law itself and right must never be replaced by might. The country and its citizens must have the opportunity to determine their system and conditions of life themselves and improve the laws by legal means. I cherish the words of the great Russian philosopher Ivan Ilin, who said that "a legal system which denies that opportunity to all or to the broad strata of the people by denying them access to the law is preparing an inevitable revolution for itself." I submit to the laws of my country and the will of the people's representatives, who adopted the wise decision that is so necessary to us all today -- the "Memorandum of Accord" and the amnesty decree. I fully share the provisions of that document and will devote all my efforts to preventing enmity and discord. I agree that each of us must find the inner strength to acknowledge his own mistakes and respond to parliament's good will with a readiness to unite our efforts for the well-being of the long-suffering people and to find a way out of the prolonged crisis as soon as possible. I consider it my moral duty to state to those irresponsible blabbermouths and dishonorable politicians and journalists who have mounted a shameful and obscene campaign through the mass media, indulging in hysterics and distorting the essence of what happened in September-October 1993: Stop this besmirching of innocent people, exploiting the dead, pinning the blame on others as if theyr were the true culprits in the tragedy, intimidating society with talk of civil war, and attributing to me comments aimed at destabilizing the situation in the country. Think before you inflame hysteria! Is the blood that has been shed really not enough for you? I appeal to a great people and I call all Russians to civil peace, accord, and creative work.
