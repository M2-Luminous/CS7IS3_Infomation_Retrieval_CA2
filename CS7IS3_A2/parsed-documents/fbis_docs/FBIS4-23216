He told a news conference at Donkerhoek the AVF's aim was to come to a settlement on an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] within the next two years while the new constitution was being finalised. He was very satisfied with negotiations with the government so far, he said. The forum created for negotiations on a volkstaat between the AVF, Freedom Front [FF] and the government was a peaceful route to attain the volkstaat goal. Ethnic violence was the most important source of violence and it was necessary that this be addressed to secure investments, he added. More and more people realised and supported the idea that the Afrikaner nation should be accommodated for a permanent solution, he said. At least two-thirds of Afrikaners wanted self-determination, also a "substantial number" of National Party supporters, he claimed. If the Afrikaner nation was free it would put "everything into it" to develop the nation and the country as a whole. There were many practical problems to attain a volkstaat but those should be solved through negotiations, he added. "We have always preferred the peaceful option". The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement] was not taking part in the activities of the AVF, he said. Signs were there that the volkstaat ideal would bring the nation together. After a report-back to his constituency, Dr Hartzenberg would contact FF leader Constand Viljoen about the tri-partite negotiations forum for a volkstaat. Very few people attended the Republic Day festivities at the Radio Pretoria premises at Donkerhoek, but Dr Hartzenberg ascribed this to poor publicity. Ds Mossie van den Bergh, Radio Pretoria management committee chairman told SAPA at the gathering that the station would consider undisclosed "alternative methods" if the broadcaste? had not been granted a licence by the end of June. The station was in the process of applying for a licence to the Independent Broadcast Authority. "We decided to obey the rules and play the game until the end of June. If it seems our efforts to obtain a licence are unsuccessful we will consider alternative methods," he said.
