Modern billboards with a cardinal bird, an attractive young woman, and seductive lips will persuade the electorate of the importance of voting for the Liberal Party candidates. Pedro Gomez was tasked with changing the party's image. [Begin Gomez recording] The goal is to motivate those who are liberal to participate, as well as to make them remember the party's achievements. [end recording] Beyond the red billboards, the Liberals have changed their old hymn and put modern music to their messages on voting, social welfare, and divorce. Things at the Conservative Party are different. The day after tomorrow, Andres Pastrana will make his presidential candidacy official, and the Conservative National Directorate [DCN] is working full steam ahead on the preparations for the 18 February convention, which will seek to draft a platform for the candidate, who undoubtedly will be Pastrana. [Begin DCN member Cornelio Reyes recording] The name of Andres Pastrana is gaining more supporters as the party, its masses, and leaders are aware that he is the only viable, possible, and winning option.
