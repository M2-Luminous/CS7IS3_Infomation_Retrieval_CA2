Recently some American and European media carried reports on the likelihood of Pyongyang's selling long-range Scud missiles to Tehran as well as testing of the Nodong-1 missiles in Iran. The Iranian source reiterated that Tehran and Pyongyang have signed no contract either on testing or purchase of long-range missiles. Experts believe that bringing up of such issues aims at intriguing the regional states, the rich Arab states in particular, to purchase more Western arms. He further added that launching of the so-called joint maneuvers of the Persian gulf littoral states with Western countries are also in this direction. He made it clear that manufacture and purchase of conventional weapons for defending the territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran is very natural. He said the West by raising such fabricated news aims at intriguing an arms race in the region. President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in his recent interview with Egyptian journalist, Hassanain Haykal, said that Iran enjoys a powerful missile technology.
