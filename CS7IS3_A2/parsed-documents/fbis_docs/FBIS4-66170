Ever since the beginning of the 1990's, economic regional collectivization has developed by leaps and bounds across the world, and trade wars have become increasingly white-hot between regions and nations. Vigorous development of multinational companies has given a powerful impetus to economic globalization. Accelerated progress of a new technological revolution has prompted the industrialization of high technology in developed countries, which is expected to become a new trend in the world. All these are fostering a tremendous change in the world's industrial structure. This is the international environment China has to face in developing its foreign trade in the 1990's. Both opportunities and challenges exist. The key question is how to draw up an economic development strategy in line with our national conditions so as to guide our foreign trade and the reform and opening-up drive and to quicken our process of modernization. In the 1990's, we should carry out a grand economic and trade strategy--that is, opening widely to the outside world on all sides, in diverse areas, and through multiple channels; integrating economic and trade cooperation among domestic industries and such cooperation with countries in the world; and giving full play to foreign trade's guiding role and comprehensive services for our economic development. We may say that if our country is to take a foothold in the world's trade, we must blaze between brambles a new trail for foreign trade development in line with our national conditions. A "grand economic and trade strategy" will no doubt assist us macroeconomically in opening such a trail. The "grand economic trade strategy" should be taken as China's overall economic and trade strategy for the 1990's. It means "great opening, wide-scale integration, and a big change in functions." Great opening. We should increase the depth and breadth of our foreign economic and trade activities so as to create a situation of opening on all sides, in diverse areas, and through multiple channels. Great integration. This means the integration of different foreign economic and trade operations, the integration of multilateral, regional, and bilateral economic and trade cooperation, and the integration of trade, industry, agriculture, technology, banking, and commerce. A big change in functions. While increasing its contributions, foreign trade should serve the purpose of readjusting our industrial structure and speeding up the development of technology-intensive industries. It should also play a guiding role and provide comprehensive and multifacet services for our economic development. Now, let us make a forecast. This overall strategy will bring our foreign trade to the following state in the 1990's: --Our foreign trade will change from its self-devised system to an open form of development. In the 1990's, under the overall situation of opening widely at home and toward the outside world, our foreign trade must also develop in an open way. Barriers between different trades should be removed, and their activities should be allowed to diffuse into each other's areas. We should combine trade, industry, agriculture, technology, commerce, and banking into an organic whole and give a fuller play to foreign trade's overall guidance role and comprehensive service function in developing the economy. --Our foreign trade operations will change from extensive to intensive operations. The export volume will be expanded mainly through the improvement of the quality of export products, increase in their varieties and designs, and creation of famous brands. Returns from both export and import businesses will be boosted to a fairly big extent. --The principal exports will change from primarily processed products with a low added value to intensively processed products and manufactured goods with a high added value. The makeup of imports will also be changed--an increase will be noted in proportion of advanced technology and equipment in the total amount of import. --Readjustment and reorganization of foreign trade enterprises will be put in high gear through the formation of Chinese-type business companies. It is expected that a "pyramidic" foreign trade enterprise structure headed by about 10 large transnational companies will come into being by the end of this century. The objective is to raise our competitiveness in world trade. --In the 1990's, division of labor among foreign trade enterprises will develop toward this goal: diversified businesses for a few big enterprises; specialized operations for most small and medium-sized enterprises. --Rational disparity will exist between different localities in developing export-oriented industries. Foreign trade operations will tend to concentrate in cities on sea coasts, along rivers, and on the border with convenient transportation and information facilities, abundant foreign trade manpower, and well-developed infrastructures. Particular efforts will be made to better utilize the all-round favorable conditions of traditional trade ports such as Guangzhou, Dalian, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin. In the 1990's, technology imports should aim at directly participating in international division of labor instead of achieving 100 percent domestic production. Emphasis should be placed on import of technologies for the machinery, electronics, petrochemical, and certain new- and high-tech industries as well as related upstream and downstream industries, including materials and equipment industries. Technological progress is a key factor for improving a country's industrial structure and the international competitiveness of its products, thus changing its own conditions for promoting foreign economic relations and trade. For a developing country like ours, technology imports are a main avenue leading to technological progress . In view of the drastic changes that will take place in China's internal and external environments during the mid- and late-1990's, experts and academics deem it imperative to study and formulate a technology import program for the new situation based on the requirements of the grand economic and trade strategy. In this regard, they say, we must draw on the successful experience of Japan and Korea. That is, while beefing up technology imports, we must energetically readjust the methods and the makeup of such imports. The strategy to be applied should be gearing our technology imports to strategic industries (meaning technology-intensive industries). We should devote great efforts to promoting the technological progress of strategic industries and shortening as much as possible the time of transit from import substitution to export promotion so as to achieve the goal of making strategic industries the leading export industries by the end of this century. Based on the above mindset, the following changes should be made in our technology imports in the mid- and late-1990's: First, it is imperative to expand the scale of technology imports. Every effort should be made to raise to an appropriate extent the percentage of advanced technology and equipment in the total import from the previous levels of 30.8 percent and 33 percent registered in 1989 and 1990 respectively. Secondly, we should speed up the implementation of the technology import strategy that emphasizes strategic industries. In the post-war period, Japan has carried out a strategy of gearing its technology imports to three categories of big leading industries (the first category is the thermal power industry; the second category includes petroleum refining, petrochemicals, iron and steel, and shipbuilding; and the third category covers automobiles, household electrical appliances, and so on). Efforts have also been made to integrate technology imports closely with its own research and development program. As a result, it has not only digested, assimilated, and improved the imported technologies, but also created new technologies of its own. This has enabled the country to achieve great success in quickly raising its labor productivity and international competitiveness and bringing its leading industries from the state of import substitution to the road of export-oriented development. In the mid- and late-1990's, China should increase its technology imports and boost its research and development efforts in the fields of the machinery, electronics, petrochemical, and certain new- and high-tech industries as well as related upstream and downstream industries, including materials and equipment industries. The purpose is to speed up the pace toward the promotion of exports instead of relying on imports. In view of the fact that China will face an open environment internally and externally in the mid- and late-1990's, China's technology imports should be changed from a simple import model to a multifacet model. This means that advanced technologies should be introduced into our country in diversified ways, including technological cooperation, science and technology exchanges, utilization of foreign capital, overseas investment, and technology and equipment imports. In addition, all-inclusive imports should be replaced by selective imports. That is, we should decide on the basis of our own backgrounds and conditions whether it is appropriate to import the whole package of machinery, equipment, and technology or part of the technology or just certain parts and elements of the machinery or equipment and the related technology. Our basic goal should be direct participation in international division of labor rather than 100 percent domestic production. We arrived at the above conclusion after paying a high price. Taking our computer industry as an example, our country has, since the 1980's, imported some production lines for the most popular computer models of the times. Nonetheless, while we are still digesting and assimilating the technologies related to these models and trying to increase the percentage of domestically made parts and elements for our computer industry--which is essentially the assembly of imported parts--new breakthroughs in computer technology have been made by foreign countries. All of a sudden, our imported computer production lines have been pushed to the brink of obsolescence. From this, we have come to understand that we should, first of all, have a high starting point and aim at the advanced international level as our target in planning technology imports. Secondly, we should stress the importance of various forms of international technological cooperation and make China's technology-intensive industries a major link in the world's industrial technology chain. In no way should we require everything to be produced domestically. Otherwise, our technology imports will always lag behind the advanced world level, the gap will remain forever, and we will fall into an absurd cycle of "technology imports--domestic production--lagging behind--technology imports again." In the 1990's, we should put emphasis on bolstering and developing the export of products of heavy industries, including the machinery, electronics, chemical, and metallurgical industries. We should expand the export of automobiles, complete sets of equipment, ships, civil airplanes, machines, and electronic products. And we should assist new-and high-tech industries, including computer and software, microelectronics, optoelectronics, biotechnology, and materials technology industries, in expanding their exports. Presently, our country's export products consist mainly of light industrial products, including textiles. A principal characteristic of these products is that they are of a low-technology nature and belong to the so-called low-grade category with a low added value. To develop export under such circumstances, our effort will be inevitably hindered by a host of domestic and international factors. The best way to change this situation is to carry out the strategy of upgrading our export industries. This means putting more emphasis on developing technology-intensive industries, primarily heavy industries and certain new- and high-tech industries. We should see to it that these industries will become our leading export industries by the end of the 1990's. Specific targets are as follows: Stress should be laid on bolstering and developing the export of products of heavy industries, including the machinery, electronics, chemical, and metallurgical industries. We should see to it that these industries will become our leading industries in the future and our prime export industries by the end of this century. Of the products of technology-intensive industries, machinery and electronic products should account for a big share. We should boost in a selective manner the export of the following items: motor vehicles (including motorcycles) and their parts and accessories, whole sets of equipment, electronic products, communications devices, ships, civil airplanes, textile machinery, clocks and watch, general machinery, power plant machinery, machine tools, bicycles, and cameras. We should make these items the main exports of our country. In addition, we should make all-out efforts to develop the export of high-value-added products turned out by petrochemical, precision chemical, metallurgical, and building materials industries. Among these industries, whichever has matured should be put on the track of export-oriented development as early as possible. Also, we should assist certain new- and high-tech industries in boosting their exports, primarily in the fields of computers and software, communications products, life science, aviation and space science, microelectronics, optoelectronics, integration of machinery and electronic devices, nuclear technology, biotechnology, and materials technology. We should make them the major exports of our country by the end of 1990's. Currently, of the nearly $100 billion worth of products that China exports each year, a sizable part are the products made by backbone enterprises, which are mostly labor-intensive enterprises. So the readjustment, upgrading, and updating of the products of these enterprises are of crucial importance to China's exports in the 1990's. To cope with the trend of developing "intellectual type" and high-grade products for international trade and to meet the growing demands for high-grade, precision, and advanced products on the world market, we should shift the stress of our future efforts to developing intensively and finely processed products. We should try to create a higher added value from every unit of material we consume. In the adjustment of our garment industry, for example, material improvement, development of new fabrics, intensive processing, and production of high-grade garments may be taken as our major tasks. In developing intensive food processing, upgrading and updating household electrical appliances, and improving the quality of footgear and toys, more efforts should be devoted to creating brand-name products so as to boost competitiveness and increase returns. With respect to primary products, export of raw materials and fuels should be put under proper control. The above ideas are based on the views held by experts and academics as well as the opinions of the government departments concerned. Some have been or are going to be put into practice. The "grand economic and trade strategy" is China's overall strategy for its foreign trade development in the 1990's. The implementation and realization of this strategy will enable China's foreign trade to catch the world's fast-running economic express. And we have good reason to believe that we will see its realization by the end of the 1990's.
