The president's friends also are trying to prove that Franco, secluded in Juiz de Fora, does not feel depressed by the consequences of his merry behavior during Carnival. Telemig [expansion unknown] director Roberto Medeiros, who is one of Franco's closest friends, said: "The president is very happy; he is cheerful and in good spirits." In the meantime, despite so much "happiness," Franco remains isolated in either his downtown apartment or his home in the Parque Imperial compound. In his apartment, Franco only received Secretary General of the Presidency Mauro Durante, adviser Saulo Moreira, his secretary Neusa Mitterhoff, and his friend Roberto Medeiros. On 18 February, as he left his apartment for another appointment with the dentist, Franco looked depressed. Franco spent some 130 minutes at dentist Luis Serrato's office, from where he went to his house located far from the downtown area. Another friend of Franco's commented: "The president is no longer worried about what happened in Carnival. What worries him is the inflation rate, the serious national problems; that is why he looks serious." Franco will return to Brasilia on 20 February, according to Acting Press Secretary Fernando Costa, who also denied the president met Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Juiz de Fora on 18 February.
