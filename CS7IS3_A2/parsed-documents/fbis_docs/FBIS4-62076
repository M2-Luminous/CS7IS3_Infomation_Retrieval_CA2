Some observers assess this resignation as a calculated strike on Filippov's "patron" Sergey Filatov, but signs are that this is rather the case of a person being victimized "in the heat of the moment." Petr Filippov, 48, graduated from the Leningrad Aviation Technology Institute in 1967. In 1990 he became people's deputy of Russia. In the Supreme Soviet he headed a privatization subcommittee. He was a leader of the Reforms Coalition parliamentary faction and member of the Supreme Economic Council under the Supreme Soviet Presidium. In early March 1993, he was appointed head of the Analytical Center on Socioeconomic Policy. A year later he became chief of the Information Support Directorate. Although the edict on Petr Filippov's resignation has not as yet been issued officially, it is clear even now that the struggle over this political figure between Sergey Filatov on one hand and the Duma's agrarian lobby together with regional "agriculturists" on the other has ended in favor of the latter. Shortly before the holidays Petr Filippov went on a vacation from which he will return to a new job. The latter has not so far been determined finally. It is only known that Filippov will get an appointment in one of the presidential administration's directorates, somewhat lower in status than his latest one. A cause for the resignation has been the ill-fated draft "agricultural edict" prepared by Filippov in early April which provoked a storm of indignation from the agrarian lobby in the State Duma. As a presidential administration official told KOMMERSANT-DAILY, the promulgation of the draft "has caused tremendous damage to the president's peace-making policy." However, attempts to assess the appearance of Filippov's analytical memorandum half a month prior to the signing of the Public Accord Pact as a way to trip up Sergey Filatov, who patronizes Filippov, are in all likelihood inconsistent. What is involved is a more large-scale action by the opposition aimed at either discrediting the president's efforts to achieve national accord or at forcing him into serious concessions. The Filippov memorandum gave the agrarians reason not to sign the accord pact on 28 April in spite of the fact that as a result of the noise they had raised, the president had to agree to include into the text of the pact a provision about the inadmissibility of "administrative measures" in the countryside. The double defeat, together with strong pressure by the Duma and regional agrarians (and not only them but also some "highbrow" officials in the presidential apparatus who believe that Filippov is not only insufficiently professional but simply not very intelligent) has angered the president and sealed the fate of the well-known proponent of privatization. Even Sergey Filatov's cautious intervention resulted only in a softening of "punishment:" resignation has been replaced by "transfer to other duties." At the same time it would be premature to think that Filippov's resignation means a change in Boris Yeltsin's position with respect to the money-losing kolhozes and sovkhozes. Especially if one recalls that the Filippov memorandum was prepared based on the experience in Shakhovskoy Rayon, whose forefather [praroditel] Nikolay Travkin recently received carte blanche to continue transformations from the president, who appointed him minister without portfolio. Generally it can be said that Petr Filippov has suffered for advocating a common cause but in a rather untimely manner. And therefore became the first victim of the Public Accord Pact.
