FR940314-0-00024 FR940314-0-00004 After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. The FAA estimates that 83 airplanes of U.S. registry and 2 U.S. operators will be affected by this AD. Although the rule requires the incorporation of maximum brake wear limits into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program, no other specific additional action, inspection, or part replacement costs relative to that requirement are involved; such actions are currently a part of the normal maintenance program. However, it is estimated that it will require 20 work hours, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour, for each operator to incorporate the brake wear limitations into its FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,200, or $1,100 per operator. Additionally, the FAA estimates that it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required AFM revision, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,565, or $55 per airplane. The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
