FBIS4-29690 "dreas119__a94017" FBIS-EAS-94-119-A Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Australia Supplying Toyota Parts in Malaysia Australia Supplying Toyota Parts in Malaysia 942A0311A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 4 Jun 94 p 11--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0311A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Toyota Motor Corp. has begun assembly production of the passenger car "Camry" (Japanese name "Scepter") in Malaysia with parts supplied from Japan and Australia. Previously, all parts were procured from Japan for passenger car production in Malaysia. This is the first time for overseas assembly production that parts circulate between three countries. It is the Assembly Service Company of Malaysia that has begun assembly production. The company is an assembly company 100-percent financed by the local agency of Toyota, and it produces Toyota passenger cars and commercial vehicles. It had produced the passenger cars "Corolla" and "Corona," but because the Corona did not suit the local market and sales were dropping, it was switched to the "Camry." It produces 100 to 200 cars a month. In production of the "Camry," undercarriage parts such as the transmission are supplied from Japan, and body parts and interior items from Australia. Some minor parts are procured locally in Malaysia. The parts procurement rate is 65 percent from Japan, 25 percent from Australia, and the remaining 10 percent locally. As an export promotion policy, Australia considers import portions corresponding to the amount of exports to be duty-free. Toyota is producing the "Camry" in Australia and if it supplies parts to Malaysia, it can receive preferential tax treatment in procurement of parts from Japan. Toyota has decided to aim at creating an optimum parts procurement system by this mutual circulating of parts.
