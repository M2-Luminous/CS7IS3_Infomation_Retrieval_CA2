The move threatens all Russia since "it can undermine political stability and disturb peace in Russia," says a statement released by the movement in Moscow on Saturday. The movement regards the decision as legally misleading since amnesty as pardon presupposes reference to concrete criminal code clauses. However, there are no such references in the ruling, which need to be reexamined by the Prosecutor General from the angle of its compliance with the law. Those Duma members and factions that voted for the amnesty, as democrats believe, cannot expect popular trust today, nor can they hope for respect by posterity. "This applies most of all to those of them who just recently disguised themselves as democrats, above all Sergey Shakhray and Sergey Stankevich, the Russian Unity and Concord Party leaders. On February 23, 1994, they deserved the name "traitor," the document says. The democrats are convinced that at a time of rampant crime and political instability, putting the Duma's amnesty into effect "threatens the rights, life, and property of the people of Russia and the constitutional system in the country; it will untie the hands of both those who once rebelled against the legitimate government and of a significant number of criminals."
