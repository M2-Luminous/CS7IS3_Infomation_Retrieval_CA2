The comments have been received and analyzed. We are approving AAR's proposal. We reaffirm our initial finding that the exemption will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy resources. We also reaffirm our initial finding that the exemption will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
