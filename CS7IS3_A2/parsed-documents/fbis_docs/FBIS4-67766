The team, led by the Air Force commander and made up of 28 military and nuclear experts, arrived in Tehran in the second week of last month. The team's mission was to put the final touches to the Nodong-2 missile, which the Koreans are developing for Tehran. This is a developed Scud version with a range of 900 km. U.S. information revealed that Tehran was planning to field test this missile, but decided to postpone that to some other time in order to avoid a confrontation with Washington, which has for months now been intensifying its spy satellite surveillance of the Iranian territories. This is the second postponement after last September's for the same reasons. However, the North Korean team returned with new agreements with Tehran to intensify bilateral military and nuclear cooperation. The U.S. intelligence estimates say that more than 800 North Korean military experts and officers are in Iran. Meanwhile, more than 53 Iranian military men are working at the Iranian military attache's section in Pyongyang.
