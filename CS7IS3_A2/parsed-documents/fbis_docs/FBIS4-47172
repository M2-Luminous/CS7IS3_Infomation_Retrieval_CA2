But Turkish invasions were always timed to coincide with our instability, whether in the government, economy, or when our territorial integrity was at risk. This time, however, the avalanche from across the sea came not to finish us off but to support us. Obviously, in their own interest. According to UNIAN (Ukrainian Information Agency), agreements signed during the visit covered cooperation in international cartage and tourism, while soon to be signed accords will encompass mutual investments, aviation, and oil deliveries. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has indicated that Turkey has plans to enter the Ukrainian market on a larger scale, particularly in the area of foodstuffs, textiles, clothing, cellulose and paper products, and leather goods. In turn, Turkey is interested in acquiring Ukrainian metallurgical products, as well as airplanes, railways cars, ships, and buses. However, statistics show that Ukrainian-Turkish rapprochement needs to overcome some economic realities. Turkey had been the biggest consumer of Ukrainian products in the Black Sea-Middle East region at the time of Ukrainian declaration of independence, but the volume of goods purchased from Ukraine fell from US$323 million in 1992 to US$185 million in 1993. Concomitantly, Turkish exports to Ukraine fell to US$18.5 million in 1993, while Iranian exports came to US$490 million. Finally, Ukrainian corporations find it advantageous to register in Greek-held part of Cyprus or in Lebanon where the tax climate is more favorable than in Turkey. The brightest spot in Ukrainian-Turkish relationship pertains to the Black Sea Economic Community (BSEC) initiative, although the Russian and Greek delegations are attempting to create roadblocks. Nevertheless, as soon as the new parliament replaces Ivan Plyushch as the speaker, which seems certain, then a pro-Russian head of the Ukrainian delegation may be appointed to the BSEC Interparliamentary Assembly and even this bright spot may dim perceptibly. Crimea is an area of shared concerns between Ukraine and Turkey. Kravchuk has already received assurances of support for forceful action from Europe if necessary. At least that was the impression gained from the visit of the British Defense Minister Douglas Herd [sic], and the outcome of the Paris conference on peace in Europe held a week ago. President Demirel's and prime minister Chiler's concerns for the Tartars are driven by the fact that if they fail to act militant muslims, whose power has been growing in Turkey, may take the initiative. The Turkish president insisted on maximum concessions from Kravchuk for the Ukrainian followers of Allah. Demirel spoke for 30 minutes with Mustafa Jemilev, the speaker of the Crimean Tartar Mejlis. The Tartar leader secured verbal assurances from the Turkish leader and the latter from the Ukrainian president. Turkey has proposed a tried-and-true educational approach that has worked in Central Asia and Azerbaijan. This includes creation in Crimea a network of schools with English and Turkish as the languages of instruction--not just for Tartars but for everyone--and increasing the number of Tartars studying at Turkish colleges and universities from 30 to 300. Access to Turkey for Tartars will also be eased. In addition, Demirel promised to assume part of the costs of Tartar relocation to Crimea. Naturally, Turkey is interested in using Crimea as a loyal outpost in Eastern Europe. For Kiev, this is an attractive alternative to a Russian enclave. Unlike Russia, Turkey has no pretensions on the Ukrainian fleet and has no insane ideas to make Crimea one of its own provinces. Both presidents agreed that every attempt should be made to avoid forceful actions in Crimea, whether in the form of an energy embargo, a demand for three billion dollar debt settlement as proposed by Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, or the use of air power. Nevertheless, Demirel clearly indicated Turkey's readiness to become an ally in protecting Ukrainian national interests. On the other hand, the Turkish president understands that Ukraine has no choice but to accept Turkish support on Turkish conditions. This applies particularly to the Tartar question and Turkish exports. Other ramifications are that Ukraine may become involved in Turkish problems. Turkey has been hit hard by the sanctions against Iraq since Turkey is the primary re-exported of Iraqi oil. These sanction were extended by Security Council in the April-May session. The recent Turkish proposal for a pipeline from Turkey through Ukraine into Europe has to seen in the Iraqi context. Then there is the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. Turkey values Ukraine's opposition to various "peacekeeping forces" in the CIS and to growing Russian influence in the Transcaucasus. Finally, there is need for a joint position on the conflict in Yugoslavia, again involving sanctions. Ukraine wants Danube to be opened up fully to navigation and Ankara favors strict isolation of Serbia. Demirel feels that if he agrees to joint control of Crimea with Kravchuk, common interests will force Ukraine to dance to the Turkish tune.
