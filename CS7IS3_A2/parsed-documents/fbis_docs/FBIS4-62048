This time the speaker of the chamber, Ivan Rybkin, could become the victim of a showdown among deputies. The opposition seems to have begun seriously to consider putting into effect the threat voiced at the last plenary session by Deputy S. Baburin to examine the State Duma chairman's personal file if he went ahead and signed the Treaty on Social Accord. Ivan Rybkin, as people will know, ignored the threats and signed the treaty, and it is to be supposed that the revenge of the former comrades in arms of the Russian Unity bloc will not be long in coming, particularly as the speaker has long caused acute irritation to the majority of left-wing factions by his desire to cooperate with the executive branch and his firm refusal to play a Khasbulatov role in the Duma. If the "Rybkin personal file" is put on the agenda, the Duma chairman could be placed in a pretty difficult position. Deputy Baburin's initiative will not, of course, be supported by the right-wing factions -- Russia's Choice, Yabloko [the Yavlinskiy bloc], the 12 December group, or the majority of centrists -- the members of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES], Women of Russia, and New Regional Policy factions. There is no reason to expect unity in the left-wing section in the Duma hall of sessions either. The Agrarians, who will be asked to oppose their own nominee, will find themselves in a difficult position. And the already small Democratic Party of Russia [DPR] faction has been split since its leader, N. Travkin, joined the government. So only the Communist Party of the Russian Federation [CPRF] faction and the small Russian Path group of deputies are consistent and firm opponents of Rybkin. Much could be resolved here by the stance of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR]. From a superficial standpoint it would be illogical for Zhirinovskiy to oppose a fellow signatory of the treaty. However, it cannot be ruled out that the Liberal Democrat faction will form a bloc with the Communists on this occasion. Admittedly, this will only happen in the event of a guarantee that the vacated speaker's chair goes, for example, to A. Vengerovskiy, first deputy chairman of the LDPR and deputy chairman of the Duma. However, it is difficult to imagine the Communists and the members of Russian Path agreeing to pay such a price for Rybkin's resignation. A far greater threat to the State Duma chairman is posed not by the configuration of forces in this chamber of parliament but by the theoretical possibility of a revision of the results of the election for speaker. As you will recall, Rybkin scraped a majority. Moreover, dubious ballot slips, which were deemed invalid, were discovered when the ballot boxes were opened. Many contentious issues also remain over the determination of the quorum for voting. All this gives grounds for questioning the legitimacy of Rybkin's election. And here the opposition could gain allies in the shape of a number of radical deputies from right-wing factions. All this clamor raised over the figure of Ivan Rybkin -- the first person in the history of contemporary Russian parliamentarianism to have tried to turn parliament from a political club into a genuine legislative body -- shows very graphically that periods of political stability in Russia's life remain of short duration, lasting as a rule less than a month. The pattern here is obvious. And there is scarcely any point in seeking the cause of the latest potential minicrisis solely in the spoiling tactics of Deputy Baburin and like-minded individuals from the Accord for Russia movement. It is difficult to expect political stability in a country with an unstable economy. This latest, expected spiral in political tension coincides to perfection with the advent of a new stage of economic crisis in Russia. Our home-produced consumer goods have begun to lose out in price to imported goods. In the opinion of leading economists in the country, the domestic economy is already in a crisis of overproduction. The first reaction to this was the demands at the start of the year to increase import duties. The political forces existing in Russia today propose two ways out of this situation: either a drive to solve the nonpayments crisis by the classic method -- through the bankruptcy of enterprises -- or reversion to a closed economy. This, of course, is to protect home producers. The first path is long and hard. To start moving along it you need at least six months in order to prepare the legislative base -- to change, in particular, the Law on Enterprises, to introduce laws on bills of exchange and bankruptcy, to seek a solution to the problem of the depressed regions, and to do much, much more besides. On the other hand, if Russia does manage to complete this path, real grounds will emerge for discussing the possibility of genuine stability not just in the economy but in politics too. Recent actions by the president indicate that he has decided to go in precisely this direction and has opted to pursue this path toward an open economy for at least two years. At the same time there is a real prospect that uncompetitive economic structures will unite, their main demand being a restoration of the closed economy. The military-industrial complex is seen as the undisputed leader here. Its financial potential and links with the power structures and the special services could turn such an amalgamation into a powerful force -- and not just a political force. And the longer Russia takes to overcome the crisis, the greater this force's chances of winning victory, even by unconstitutional means, will be. The strengthening of imperialist and nationalist motifs in the policy of various parties reflects this trend. Ultimately the question comes down to whether the president and government will manage to extricate the country from crisis by the next presidential election. There are grounds for thinking that at the current stage of development of the political situation in Russia the president sees his main task as inducing the opposition to operate solely within the constitutional framework and thereby avoiding another threat of a putsch or coup, because since 12 December the opposition, contesting the president on the constitutional field, has been unable to pose any special danger to him. The campaign launched to collect signatures in favor of the Treaty on Civil Accord, which is designed to consolidate the president's constitutional role, is, I think, primarily linked to this. Both in August '91 and last October Boris Yeltsin was victorious, not because he relied on the law (regrettably we cannot talk about respect for the law and legal standards in Russia today), but solely thanks to the support of the people. However, as the results of the elections to local organs of power show, this support does not appear unconditional today. The people are withdrawing from politics. The president is forced to rely more and more on the political and state nonmenklatura. The diplomatic domestic political activity demonstrated by Boris Yeltsin in recent days -- the unpublicized renewal of contacts with Yu. Skokov, leader of the military-industrial complex, and the appointment of N. Travkin to the government -- stems, it may be supposed, from awareness of this fact. It is clear that the president is seeking to utilize all levers to prevent any change before 1996 to the strategic economic course, the main threat to which could be posed today by unconstitutional actions on the part of the opposition.
