At present the most promising is space manufacturing of semiconductor materials for the electronic industry. The article lists factors that give thermal emission nuclear electric power units [NEPUs] advantage over solar power units and make NEPUs promising for the above applications and discusses possible concepts for using NEPUS in industrial spacecraft operating in a radiation safe orbit. Peculiarities of automatic loading and unloading, as well as manual loading and unloading by cosmonauts are examined, and possible radiation doses the cosmonauts could be exposed to are estimated. Remote power supply of industrial spacecraft will eliminate the radiation risk for the cosmonauts, and at the same time completely eliminate the NEPU effect on residual overloads. The analysis showed that if certain practically realizable conditions are observed thermal emission NEPUs can provide the required power supply for industrial spacecraft. References 4.
