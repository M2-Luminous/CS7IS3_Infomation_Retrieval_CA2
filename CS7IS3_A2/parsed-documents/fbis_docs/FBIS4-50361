As the pioneer of the high-speed rail technology with its shinkansen "bullet train," Japan is a prime candidate to provide the necessary equipment but it faces strong competition from France's TGV and Germany's ICE. Shen Zhijie, chief engineer of the Ministry of Railways, said China has a strong capability in building railways but it needs to import some key technologies and equipment, including the rolling stock, communications and automatic train control systems. Japan, France and Germany all offered certain advantages and China would choose the model that best suited its conditions, Shen said, stressing, however, that it is still too early to predict which country will win the race. Also still under consideration is the way the railway will be financed, given that the cost of the line is currently estimated at more than 8 billion dollars. According to Shen, the possibilities include raising money from local and central government sources and business sources, as well as issuing stocks or borrowing internationally. The existing Beijing-Shanghai railway, connecting five large cities each with a population of over two million, is the busiest in the country, with its trains handling an estimated five times more passengers and cargo than the national average. The line accounts for 2.8 percent of the country's total track length but carries 14.3 percent of all passengers and freight. Various local and foreign experts have agreed that the best solution is to build a high-speed passengers-only link running parallel to the existing track, which would be devoted entirely to freight haulage. Running at speeds up to 250 kilometers an hour, the bullet train would slash the traveling time between Beijing and Shanghai -- the nation's political and commercial capitals, respectively -- from more than 17 hours at present to about seven hours, Shen said. With rapid economic growth, particularly in the eastern part of the country encompassing the coastal development zones, China faces severe transportation bottlenecks, opening up the prospect for a number of high-speed rail links between key cities. One is already under construction between Xiamen -- one of the five "special economic zones" set up in the 1980s to spearhead market-oriented economic reform -- and the city of Fuzhou some 270 km away, using Japanese technology and a large capital injection. The cost of the project is estimated at 2.1 billion dollars. But China is not only in the market for high-speed railway equipment. There is growing demand for subway networks in various major cities to overcome the surface road congestion that threatens to throttle the country's explosive development. Given the vast distances involved, railways will continue to play a key role in the movement of goods and people -- an estimated 1.04 billion passengers will be carried on the national network this year. Government experts point out that China only has 54,000 km of track at present for a land mass of 9.6 million square kilometers with a population of 1.2 billion people. By comparison, India has 60,000 km of track for a country of 2.9 million sq km, while the United States, with a land mass close to that of China, has more than 200,000 km of railway. The present system can cope with only an estimated two-thirds of the goods requiring shipment. The Ministry of Railways chief economist, Zhang Youmin, estimates that "rail gridlock" cost the country more than 57 billion dollars last year. China needs at least 100,000 km of track, Zhang said, and current plans call for expansion to 70,000 km by the end of the century. The creation of separate high-speed passenger lines to leave the way free for freight on existing major lines would be an important contribution to easing the strain. In the major cities, meanwhile, the emphasis increasingly is on going underground. Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai have extensive subway systems which are being expanded, providing increasing opportunities for foreign involvement. French and German companies have done very well out of the Guangzhou subway development, but Hitachi and Mitsubishi of Japan have managed to get their foot in the door. Shenzhen, the most successful of the special economic zones, situated close to Hong Kong, is now seeking central government approval for construction to begin next year on the first phase of its subway system, involving just over 25 km of track linking the local airport with the city center. And moving inland, Chengdu and Chongqing in Sichuan Province are both seeking foreign technology and capital for their own underground railway systems.
