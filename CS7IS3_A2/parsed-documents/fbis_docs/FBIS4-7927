Pludek said the SU considered the fact it had not been invited to the Slav congress held in Moscow early April a wrong. As a result, next week it will send a letter to the Union of the Slav Nations informing about its activities. The Slav Union should become an important member of this international organization, he added. The Slav Union, which unites some 3,000 members, is a non- political organization designed to promote Slav solidarity, said Pludek, a writer highly praised by the former communist regime. The idea of the Slav solidarity is part of the struggle for the Czech national existence, threatened by the "Pan-German Drang nach Osten," (Drive to the East) said Pludek, author of a novel called "Vabank" (1974) considered by some observers anti-semitic.
