[Ghawshah] [passage omitted] This strike is going to further Hamas's determination, will, and strength. Everyone knows that Hamas's fighters, 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam groups, are well educated in the Islamic doctrine, which excels the Torah's doctrine. Therefore, the battle is now between the followers of the Torah and the followers of the Koran. We believe that victory will be for the followers of the Koran. [passage omitted] [Salihah] Is there any specific plan to carry out operations in the near future? [Ghawshah] The way Hamas acts is a difficult one, and it is also difficult to understand its organization. However, there is room for movement. Hamas will certainly deal blows to the Zionist enemy, including the settlers. [passage omitted] [Salihah] Do you plan to assassinate those responsible for the massacre? [Ghawshah] You know that the killing of individuals does not lead to the required results. We want to strike at and damage a major center of the Zionist enemy. The mujahidin will choose proper targets, God willing. [Salihah] Do you not believe that it is time for all factions to launch an armed struggle? [Ghawshah] The blessed march, which was staged in Amman and in which we took part, proposed that and also called for a final withdrawal, rather than a halt or a suspension of the negotiations, and for the resumption of armed struggle. This is a hard road, but it is the only way to preserve the whole nation's dignity. [Salihah] How do you view President 'Arafat's decision to continue negotiations despite all that has happened? [Ghawshah] We urged him through the media and stressed that this is his last chance and that this was our last call. If he does not return to his people and resume armed struggle, he will be viewed by his people as part of the Zionists and he will pay the price. We also said that if he and his clique continued to pursue their current path, the curses of God, the people, and history will befall him. He accepted Clinton's invitation before the martyrs' blood was even dry. No nationalist would ever do that. However, it seems that due to a widespread popular protest, he began to retreat bit by bit and to set some conditions. [Salihah] You said this was your last warning to 'Arafat. Does this mean that you will liquidate him if he does not respond? [Ghawshah] No. Hamas does not believe in political assassination. The last warning comes from the Palestinian people themselves. The people will distinguish between what is legitimate and what is illegitimate and between what is wrong and what is right. [passage omitted]
