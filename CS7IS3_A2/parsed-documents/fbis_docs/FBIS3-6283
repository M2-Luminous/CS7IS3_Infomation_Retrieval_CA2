Winai called for Chamlong, the party founder who is known to have the final say on party policies, to make a decision once and for all as to whether the Phalang Tham would remain within the coalition or not. In an interview with THE NATION on Saturday, Winai did not mention Chamlong by name but he was apparently referring to the party founder, who has come out to attack the coalition on several issues and occasions. "If (Chamlong and the religious wing) feel that the Phalang Tham stands to lose from remaining in the coalition, they should discuss it inside the party," Winai said. "It's okay if they announce a pullout from the government. I won't object to it. But we should not be a cry baby in public." Winai said the Phalang Tham members who were not happy working with the government should have proposed a pull-out to a party meeting. "So far, no one has proposed it to any party meeting. You can check with any deputy party leader...had this proposal been made in a party meeting, everything would have ended," Winai said. Winai's comments indicated serious rifts in the Phalang Tham between the religious wing and those who hold Cabinet posts. Earlier reports had it that the religious wing would like to pull out of the coalition, but Phalang Tham's Cabinet members resisted. Several Phalang Tham leaders have denied the reports. Winai was being interviewed by THE NATION shortly after a member of the religious wing, Chaiwat Sinsuwong, quit as deputy Bangkok governor. Chaiwat, known to be loyal to Chamlong, called on the party to review its role as a coalition partner after Phalang Tham lost local elections in Bangkok on March 6. "Don't shout outside the party. Don't act as somebody's follower or somebody else's mouthpiece," Winai said, apparently referring to Chaiwat and Chamlong. The communications minister said it would be "justified" for the Phalang Tham to criticize the government if it was an opposition party. "I worry that what has happened will affect the government('s stability). One party should not be allowed to sink a boat that's being rowed by five parties." Winai said the Phalang Tham was acting like it was rocking the coalition boat instead of trying to learn to work with other government partners. "To work in a five-partner coalition, we must not put our foot in the water while others are rowing. "I am sure that we and our friends in the government feel uneasy about our criticizing our own coalition every night and day. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai must be very frustrated to see the coalition criticized by its own members." Winai said he feared "internal enemies", not rivals from the outside. He said Phalang Tham secretaries general had always been "battered, chased, harassed," by the religious wing.
