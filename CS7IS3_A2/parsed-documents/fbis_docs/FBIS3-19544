This is simply because the EU has a military arm called the WEU [Western European Union]. If we become a member of this organization, then there will be military changes only." This statement was made by Lt. Gen. Gustav Haegglund, future commander in chief of the Finnish Armed Forces. He was promoted to the post of Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces by President of the Republic Martti Ahtisaari during Friday's presidential presentation. His mandate will run from 1 November, when Admiral Jan Klenberg, the current commander in chief, is due to retire. Haegglund will be promoted to the rank of general on the same day. In Haegglund's view, however, membership in the EU does have a political significance, as we will then be committed to the EU's common foreign and security policy. This can also be expanded to encompass defense policy, even a common defense system: "But that we do not yet know; that issue will be decided in 1996. And, as members of the EU, we will then participate in the decisionmaking and political process. But actual defense matters and their implementation are in the hands of the WEU. If we become members of the EU, we shall also be invited to become members of the WEU. ``After that, things depend on the decisions we make, on whether we join as observers or members. If we go in as observers, there will no changes in defense policy. But if we become members, we will have obligations and guarantees: guarantees if we are attacked and obligations to help member countries if they are attacked.'' If Finland becomes a member of the EU, it will be the first time any EU member state shares a border with Russia. Gustav Haegglund does not see this as a problem. Because the EU surely has no reason to start a war with Russia, Haegglund added with a broad smile. They Have To Be Stationed Somewhere Russia is deploying an increasing number of troops close to the Finnish border. According to Lt. Gen. Haegglund it is important to note that they are not being deployed near Finland because of Finland itself, or in order to attack Finland, or even to fend off an attack from this country: "The reason is that hundreds of thousands of troops are being withdrawn from Europe, Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states. They have to be stationed somewhere. And there are barracks in the areas around St. Petersburg with the infrastructure for additional troops, barracks that can support them. ``That is one of the reasons. The other is that, as they pull back from the Baltic area, they must also be able to defend that sector. I get the impressiion -- and I have some information from the Russians themselves -- that the major part of these troops is being stationed south of St. Petersburg. But some are also stationed north of the city.'' Haegglund thinks it is important to make this statement while relations between the countries are as good and cordial as they are now and as long as the troops are controlled by the central administration in Moscow: "As long as order and control prevail among them, this can be a stabilizing factor in the face of rising crime. But if the situation changes, they are a potential threat. So we must hope that the situation stays as it is." Military Background Edvin Birger Gustav Haegglund's background is truly military: His father, Johan Woldemar, was a lieutenant general, although he wanted Gustav to become a businessman. After graduating from Norsen [Swedish Normal Lyceum of Helsinki] in 1957, he joined the Army as a conscript at the age of 18 and, after summer service as second lieutenant at Dragsvik, he decided to follow in his father's footsteps. He graduated from the Military College in 1960 and completed his studies at the Military Academy in 1969-71. He also obtained a master's degree in political science in 1969 and studied in the United States from 1972 to 1973 and from 1981 to 1982. His career so far includes responsibilities as platoon leader and company commander in the Nyland Brigade; teacher at the Military College and the Military Academy; chief secretary of the Second and Third Parliamentary Defense Committees; commander on UN missions in the Middle East, Syria, and Lebanon; commander of the Nyland Brigade; commander of the Military District of South East Finland; and chief of the general staff since 1990. He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1988. Gustav Haegglund has been at the center of many a storm, but he has always pulled through honorably. In 1986 he was criticized by the then French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac for being on leave in his home country when a French UN soldier was killed in Lebanon. Haegglund interrupted his leave and the dispute was settled. He has been criticized for his views by both Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn and Foreign Minister Pertti Paasio. Here too, he has managed to weather the storm. In Gustav Haegglund's view, the military also has the right to have an opinion.
