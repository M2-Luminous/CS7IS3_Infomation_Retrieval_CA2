The modern center which houses the large satellite communications network is not only a successful pioneering undertaking in Pudong's construction but also in the history of international communications construction. Erected at the southern end of the principal satellite communications network building is a magnificent parabolic antenna 12 meters in diameter, pointing directly to the blue skies and aiming precisely at the No. 5 Zhongxing communications satellite at 115.5 degrees east longitude over the equator. The Pudong VSAT satellite communications network can provide such communications services as data, speech, image, and facsimile transmission. Among the first group of subscribers to the network are the Eastern Airlines' booking system, XINMIN WANGBAO's layout transmission system, and the Shanghai Grain and Oil Exchange's quotations broadcast and transactions return systems. The grain and oil exchange's quotations and transactions returns can be transmitted within 0.5 second and are being used widely in various parts of the country. The VSAT satellite communications center provides two options of network grouping: a star-shaped PES [expansion unknown] network which transmits mainly data and can also be used for transmitting speech, and a net-shaped TES [expansion unknown] network which transmits mainly speech and can also be used for transmitting data. It is understood that the center is the first in the world to have the configuration of such comprehensive, multi-purpose equipment, which has reached the world's advanced level in terms of both technology and equipment. The Pudong VSAT satellite communications network was built with funds jointly raised by the Shanghai Science and Technology Investment Company, Jinqiao Export Processing Zone, and three other development zones.
