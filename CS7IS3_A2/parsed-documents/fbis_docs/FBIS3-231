The criticisms are contained in the resolution the participants adopted in Libreville on the last day of the meeting held under the auspices of the UN Economic Commission for Africa. During the public examination of the draft resolution, only Cote d'Ivoire's delegation intervened for the removal of the portion saying that "sudden, substantial, and uncoordinated devaluations are inefficient solutions in the African context." Also, Cote d'Ivoire did not want the resolution to say that the devaluation of the CFA franc was "caused by external and internal pressures on African countries." In the text that was adopted, the ministers and their representatives called on the IMF and the World Bank to henceforth take "a critical look at the issue of efficiency of substantial devaluations in African countries. This is mainly in view of the inflexible structures of the continent's economies and, in particular, the steady fall in the prices of basic cash crops." The resolution also stressed the "negative effects of substantial and non-coordinated devaluations on interregional cooperation and integration" when describing the 50-percent devaluation of the CFA franc decided on 11 January.
