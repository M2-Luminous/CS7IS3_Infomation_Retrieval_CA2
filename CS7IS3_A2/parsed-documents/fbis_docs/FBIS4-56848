The delegation, headed by British economist Martin Hardy, will almost entirely concentrate on persuading the economic leadership to further reduce its spending in order to achieve an increased fiscal surplus. The IMF delegates' goal is clear: Argentina must reduce its spending by at least 10 percent of the 1994 budget allocations. This is equivalent to about 1.5 percent of the GDP. Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo has already said unofficially that it is impossible, with the current administrative structure, to further reduce spending. The economy minister asked his team of assistants to be extremely careful and convince the IMF auditors of the fact that a budget cut similar to the one implemented in 1993 is not viable now because the entire administrative structure would be affected. During a meeting with his closest officials, Cavallo expressed a worrisome omen: "If we implement the IMF petitions, we run the risk of throwing our entire efforts in the field of collection, public sector reform, and state streamlining overboard. We cannot reduce spending any further now. They cannot expect us to cut back on retiree, Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan, and hospital funds." [passage omitted]
