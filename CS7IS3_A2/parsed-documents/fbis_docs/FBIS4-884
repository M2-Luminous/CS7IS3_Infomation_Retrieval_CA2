It should be recalled that this issue has remained a thorny point of disagreement between the two sides. In the opinion of observers in Tamanrasset, Algerian diplomatic intervention has allowed the proceedings of the committee to follow up implementation of the Bamako agreement, which is currently taking place in Tamanrasset in the far south of Algeria, to get under way.
