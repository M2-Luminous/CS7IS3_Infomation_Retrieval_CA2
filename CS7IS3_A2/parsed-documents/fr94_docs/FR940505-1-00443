The enhanced in-use standards apply to at least 75 percent of 1999 model year sales of MDVs and to all 2000 and later model year sales of MDVs. (iii) Composite NMHC and NO X emissions are determined according to paragraphs (c)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section. (iv) The exhaust HC and NO X emissions standards for 1999 and later model year MDVs (excluding those MDVs powered by engines certified under the heavy-duty engine emissions standards contained in §52.2966) as measured over the IM240 transient mass emissions test specified in §52.2963(i)(5) are as follows: ␣ 1Test weight (pounds) 1Category 1Full life total hydrocarbons (grams/mile) 1Oxides of nitrogen (grams/mile) 2Half life 2Full life 0&hyph;3750 Enhanced .24 .30 .45 0&hyph;3750 Transitional .40 .60 .90 3751&hyph;5750 Enhanced .31 .60 .75 3751&hyph;5750 Transitional .51 1.05 1.50 5751&hyph;8500 Enhanced .37 .90 1.20 5751&hyph;8500 Transitional .62 1.65 2.25 8501&hyph;10000 Enhanced .43 1.05 1.35 8501&hyph;10000 Transitional .73 1.95 2.70 10001&hyph;14000 Enhanced .57 1.50 2.10 10001&hyph;14000 Transitional .95 3.00 4.20 (v) For the 1999 model year only, the transitional standards specified in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section apply to those sales of MDVs to which the transitional standards specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section apply. The enhanced in-use standards specified in this paragraph apply to all other 2000 and later model year sales of MDVs. (3) Canister access requirement. All 1999 and later model year LDV, LDTs, and MDVs (excluding those MDVs powered by engines certified under the heavy-duty engine emissions standards contained in §52.2966) shall be designed and manufacturered such that enhanced I/M evaporative pressure and purge functional tests can be readily conducted (i.e., the evaporative vapor storage canister(s) can be easily and quickly accessed and the pressure and purge test equipment (described in §52.2963(t) and (u)) can be easily and quickly attached without damaging the post-test integrity of the evaporative emission control system.
