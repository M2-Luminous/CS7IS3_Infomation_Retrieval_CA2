FR940314-2-00040 FR940314-2-00018 [Docket No. 940256&hyph;4055; I.D. 011494A] Information Relating to Bowhead Whales; U.S. Implementation of Bowhead Whale Strike Quota for 1994 AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), NOAA, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of information and request for public comment. SUMMARY: Information is published by NOAA for use in the development of the U.S. position before the International Whaling Commission (IWC) on the aboriginal/subsistence take of bowhead whales and in the domestic allocation of the existing IWC quota for bowhead whales to U.S. natives. NOAA is soliciting public comment on the proposed allocation of the IWC bowhead whale catch limit in 1994. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before April 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments may be mailed to the Office of International Affairs, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910. A list of documents reviewed for this action may be obtained on request, and the documents examined during business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) at this address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kevin Chu, (301) 713&hyph;2276. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NOAA is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1361&hyph;1407), the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C 1531&hyph;1543) and the Whaling Convention Act 16 U.S.C. 916&hyph;916l). In addition, it provides staff support to the U.S. Commissioner to the IWC and to the IWC Interagency Committee. Consistent with these responsibilities, NOAA develops positions for implementation of the aboriginal/subsistence harvest of bowhead whales under Paragraph 13 of the Schedule to the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling, December 2, 1946, 62 Stat. 1716, T.I.A.S. No. 1849 (entered into force, November 10, 1948). In order to provide for review and comment by the public of the data upon which the U.S. positions are based, the following information is provided: (1) The IWC catch level available for the U.S. aboriginal/subsistence bowhead whale harvest for 1992&hyph;1994; (2) a summary of available bowhead scientific information, including estimates of current population level and annual recruitment rates; (3) a summary of information on the nature and extent of aboriginal/subsistence need; (4) the level of aboriginal/subsistence harvest limits which could be implemented domestically; and (5) notice of the availability of those documents reviewed by NOAA and relied on by the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere in making his finding on the range of harvest limits. NOAA is soliciting public comment on the proposed domestic implementation of the IWC bowhead whale catch limit for 1994. 1. Catch Level At the 43rd Annual Meeting of the IWC, Reykjavik, Iceland, May 27&hyph;31, 1991, the following catch limit was established for aboriginal/subsistence whaling: ``The taking of bowhead whales from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock by aborigines is permitted, but only when the meat and products of such whales are to be used exclusively for local consumption by the aborigines and further provided that: For each of the years 1992, 1993, and 1994 combined, the total number of whales struck shall not exceed 141, except that: (A) Any unused strikes up to ten percent of the total strikes allowed in the years 1989, 1990, and 1991 combined shall be carried forward from those years and added to the combined total of strikes for the years 1992, 1993, and 1994; and (B) in any one year no more than 54 whales shall be struck and no more than 41 shall be landed. (Schedule to the Convention, Paragraph 13(b)(1)(i).) 2. Scientific Information At the 1991 IWC meeting, the Scientific Committee agreed that the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Sea population of bowhead whales is between 6,400 and 9,200 animals, with a most likely estimate of 7,500 whales. A minimum estimate of the replacement yield (RY) was calculated to be 92 whales per year, and the most likely replacement yield for the population size of 7,500 is 254 whales per year. The replacement yield defines the number of new whales annually joining the adult population, and it is assumed that, all other things being constant, up to this number could be taken from the population without causing it to decline. 3. Aboriginal/Subsistence Need The Department of the Interior (DOI) conducted its analysis of the nature and extent of aboriginal/subsistence need for bowhead whales and whaling in 1983, and the IWC adopted this method for quantifying need in 1986. DOI contracted for a new study on the quantification of subsistence and cultural need for bowhead whales in 1987, which was presented at the 1988 meeting. The new study presented the cultural and subsistence need of nine Alaska Eskimo whaling villages to take 41 landed bowhead whales. This quantification of need used the same method of calculation accepted by the IWC in 1986. This method derives the mean annual number of bowhead whales landed per capita during a specified historical period and multiplies this mean by the current Eskimo population of nine Alaska Eskimo whaling villages. The result of this calculation is the total number of bowhead whales these Eskimo whaling villages need to land each year in order to meet their cultural and subsistence need.
