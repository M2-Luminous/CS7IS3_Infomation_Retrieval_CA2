PLO Executive Committee Member Samir Ghawshah told a MENA correspondent in Tunis that at its meeting last night, the Palestinian leadership also requested an urgent Arab League meeting to discuss the massacre and take the necessary measures. The PLO asked its Arab League representative to present the request. The PLO will also follow up efforts to convene an urgent UN Security Council meeting to adopt a positive stance on the events. Ghawshah said the Palestinian leadership had decided to call the PLO Executive Committee into a full urgent meeting in Tunis to follow developments. On the Palestinian leadership's position on U.S. President Bill Clinton's invitation for the PLO and Israel to send delegations to Washington to hold prompt talks to advance the peace process, Dr. Samir Ghawshah said the Palestinian leadership has not yet determined its position on the invitation. He added: The purpose of the talks, the level of attendance, and the date must be known. So far, the PLO has received no details about the call. Dr. Ghawshah denied reports that President Clinton had invited 'Arafat for a meeting with Rabin in Washington. He said the Palestinian leadership will follow the results of the massacre on all levels, especially the developments in the occupied territories. He added: We are awaiting the decisions Israel is going to make regarding the massacre, and we will determine our position accordingly. We want to know whether Rabin wants to achieve peace and security or to keep the territory and sponsor the settlers. Ghawshah said the recall of the Palestinian negotiators is in preparation for the adoption of a clear position on the negotiations--suspending them, withdrawing from them, or boycotting them. He said the situation is very serious in the occupied territories. We are discussing all aspects of the issue and will make the decision that preserves our people, he said. Ghawshah stressed that the peace process is in a crisis after the massacre, which showed the world that it is the Palestinians, not the Israeli settlers, who need security.
