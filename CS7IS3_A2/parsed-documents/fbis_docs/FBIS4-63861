On the agenda are cooperation between Baltic Sea countries and the European Union, the work of the council, establishment of a secretariat at the council, environmental issues, nuclear safety, illegal migration, and organized crime. The session is also expected to approve the mandate of a Baltic Sea countries commissioner for national minorities and fill the post. The only candidate so far is former Danish Justice Minister Ole Espersen. The session ends with the election of the council's new president to replace Estonia, who currently holds the body's rotating presidency, and adoption of a joint communique. Luik said at a press conference yesterday that the general opinion of the Baltic Sea Council member states is the council has over the last 14 months "made big strides forward." Luik cited as the body's successes the opening of Eurofaculties at the Vilnius, Riga, and Tartu universities, the work of the council's economics group on the Via Baltica project, and achievements in the sphere of nuclear safety. He said the implementation of the Via Baltica plan is one of the top priorities of the council. Commenting on the mandate of the Baltic Sea countries commissioner for human rights and ethnic minorities, the Estonian foreign minister emphasized that its primary objective is to defend democratic institutions and the rights of individuals. Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev has previously announced Russia intends to raise at the meeting the question of the Baltic states' territorial claims on Russia. Luik said at the press conference yesterday the issue hasn't as yet been put on the agenda. Luik will have during the session private meetings with his Russian, Swedish, German and Norwegian counterparts. The meeting between Luik and Kozyrev today is regarded as a historical event. Luik told reporters the meeting will probably focus on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia. The Russian foreign minister plans also to return to the issuance of residence and work permits to Russian military retirees. Moscow insists that Estonia should give permanent residence permits to all retired officers living here, whereas the Estonian Government and delegation for talks with Russia haven't to date acceded to Russia's demand. Russia's chief negotiator, Ambassador Vasily Svirin, in an interview with BNS yesterday declined to comment on the importance of the meeting between Kozyrev and Luik for the Estonian-Russian relations. "I hope the meeting will have a positive effect on the course of the Estonian-Russian negotiations," Svirin told BNS.
