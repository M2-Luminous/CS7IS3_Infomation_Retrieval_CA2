This time it is the case of two older people, whom even the doctors unfortunately could not help. They died from starvation. Let me remind you: The last convoy with humanitarian aid that reached this region was exactly seven months ago. Starvation and exhaustion have also claimed dozens of lives on the free Doboj territories. Almost 20,000 elderly, women, and children are facing death. The situation is particularly hard in Matuzici, Ularice, Alibegovci, Mravici, [word indistinct], Mala Brijesnica and Velika Brijesnica, Kokotnica, and other places on the free territory. Over the last seven months, only two kilograms of flour per household have been distributed here. There is a real humanitarian catastrophe on the Maglaj territory, too. Tesanj, with 20,000 refugees from Doboj and Teslic, has also been for a long time been without food, electricity, fuel, and warm clothes.
