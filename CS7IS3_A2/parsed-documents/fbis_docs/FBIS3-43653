Faced with Ciskei's decision to join the TEC [Transitional Executive Council], contribute 250 troops to the National Peacekeeping Force and participate unconditionally in the election, he insists that this does not presage a split in the Freedom Alliance." Since the alliance was formed to consolidate opposition to the TEC and to make participation in the election conditional on fulfillment of demands for amendments to the Interim Constitution, "commonsense exposes Viljoen's stance as futile and stonewalling." The AVF is warned that opinion polls conducted under the auspices of the Institute for Multiparty Democracy show that "white support for the CP [Conservative Party] -- the cornerstone of the Volksfront -- has dropped from 30 to 20 percent in recent months." The CP's decline shows that "whites are becoming increasingly resigned to the pending changes. Unless the Volksfront makes a major tactical shift towards participation in the next few weeks, it will lose further support and be pushed ineluctably to the sidelines." BUSINESS DAY Options for Freedom Alliance Partners -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 12 January in a page 6 editorial believes it would "be wrong" to interpret Ciskei's decision to join the TEC as "a signal that the other components of the Freedom Alliance are also about to yield to the pressures to join the political mainstream" since Ciskei is "the weakest and least significant member of the alliance." However, the other Freedom Alliance members' options "are dwindling." "As the poll conducted by the Human Sciences Research Council and the Institute for Multiparty Democracy shows, SA's electorate has not taken kindly to the boycotting of negotiations or extremist policies. Despite the messy and violent political process of the past few years, the white right wing has stagnated -- in electoral terms if not in volubility. Even more dramatic is the news for Buthelezi -- the poll shows he has lost some 40 percent of his black support in Natal over the past year as he increasingly withdrew into isolation in Ulundi." But should Buthelezi discard his "'spoiler'" reputation and commit himself and his party to contesting the election, "a top post in a coalition regional government, either with the NP [National Party] alone or with the ANC too, is well within the realms of possibility. That decision will determine whether history judges him as an important regional leader, or the Savimbi of South Africa." BEELD IFP Urged To Join Negotiations -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 10 January in its page 8 editorial hopes "common sense will prevail" and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] will decide to return to negotiations despite the recent decision by its Central Committee that Inkatha would not join in the election, nor participate in any structures of the TEC. "The IFP has perfected the art to sound hopeful and then destructive in quick succession. As part of the Freedom Alliance, it is still part of the negotiations. Its statement should be therefore seen as negotiation rhetoric." It should be clear within the next few days whether the process can reach finality without the IFP. One can only hope that "healthy minds and compromise will be the victors." The step not to obey Transitional Executive Council structures has serious implications. The IFP will be directly challenging the authority and powers of a structure instituted by Parliament should it offer resistance. "This could lead to serious confrontation with tragic consequences." ANC Candidates -- A second editorial on the same page criticizes the ANC for placing names on its election candidates' list without prior consultation with, and obtaining permission from the candidates involved. "The ANC, which aspires to assume a leading role in the country's government, will have to cut out such impetuosity and opportunism in future."
