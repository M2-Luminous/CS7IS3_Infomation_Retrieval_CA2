"I do not foresee a reduction in future," he told Asia Airlines and Aerospace, a new trade magazine based in Kuala Lumpur. Since soon after independence in 1965, Singapore had spent 6 percent of GDP on defence every year to "compensate for its limited manpower and small economy", Dr Yeo said. "We consider our defence expenditure as an investment for peace and security. Maintaining a high level of preparedness and operational readiness is essential to the stability and strength of our nation and enhances our attractiveness for investment and business." Dr Yeo also said that Singapore would not rule out buying Russian arms, which have been marketed only recently. While Singapore knew little about Russian weapons, there could be some systems that could meet the Singapore Armed Forces' [SAF] needs, he said. "Singapore is prepared, where feasible, to explore non-traditional arms suppliers, including the Russian defence industries," Dr Yeo said. "This will increase the range of advanced systems available for consideration by the SAF." Dr Yeo also said that Singapore would do its part to help uphold international law and order. "In line with this, the SAF will continue to participate in UN-led international operations." But he said that due to manpower constraints, Singapore's contribution would always be limited.
