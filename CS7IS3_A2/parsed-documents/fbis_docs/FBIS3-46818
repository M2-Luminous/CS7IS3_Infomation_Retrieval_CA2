Could you please elaborate on some of them? [Nguyen Manh Cam] Last year, we made great achievements in our nation's diplomatic activities. We have entered a new stage of development in our relations with neighboring Southeast Asian nations, thus opening up a new era of cooperation with these countries on a larger scale, especially in the trade and economic domains. The most important event was party General Secretary Do Muoi's official visit to Singapore and Thailand. On this occasion, Vietnam declared a four-point policy toward the region, asserting Vietnam's firm policy of strengthening its multifaceted relations with each and every ASEAN member. Vietnam also stressed its willingness to join ASEAN at an appropriate date. ASEAN members have become our trading partners. As of mid-1993, investment in Vietnam by ASEAN members had reached $483.4 million, while their trade with Vietnam was valued at $1.8 billion in 1992. As for the People's Republic of China, Vietnam highly treasures its relations with this country. It has consistently consolidated its friendship and strengthened bilateral cooperation with China to resolve all outstanding problems step by step through peaceful negotiations. In this context, in October 1993 both sides signed an agreement on fundamental principles for resolving the issue of land and sea borders between the two countries, especially the land border and areas in the Gulf of Tonkin. Both sides agreed to continue talks on issues related to the sea in order to reach a fundamental and long-lasting solution. This is in the interests of the two peoples and of regional peace, stability, and cooperation. President Le Duc Anh's friendly official visit to China last November was a new step in accelerating and developing relations between the two countries. With Prime Minister's Vo Van Kiet official visit to Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, we completed the process of establishing and normalizing relations with all the countries from Northeast Asia to the South Pacific region. This creates favorable conditions for Vietnam to solicit capital and technology from these countries and promote trade and economic relations. Japan has become Vietnam's top trading partner. The country increased its development aid to Vietnam from $360 million during the 1992-93 fiscal year to more than $550 million in 1993-94. Relations between Vietnam and the EC, the world's foremost politico-economic center, have developed remarkably. The European countries have highly appraised Vietnam's achievements in renovation and foreign policy. They attach importance to Vietnam's position in Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. As a result, they have reached agreements with Vietnam to carry out long-term cooperation projects and have pledged to continue increasing development aid to Vietnam. Having signed an agreement on textile production with Vietnam in late 1992, the EC is making preparations to sign an agreement with our country on economic, trade, and scientific-technological cooperation. Vietnam and Laos exchanged visits by high-level party and state delegations to consolidate and strengthen the traditional friendship and special solidarity between the two peoples as well as to accelerate bilateral cooperation in line with the new situation. Vietnam's neighborly and friendly relations with Cambodia have been strengthened to a new level. Both sides have agreed to settle bilateral issues step by step through peaceful negotiations and on the basis of respecting each other's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and legitimate interests in line with international law and practices and in accordance with each country's law and customs. The Cuban people face acute difficulties. Vietnam provided material aid to our Cuban friends and positively supported the Cuban people's struggle against the U.S. embargo. Our party and government delegation's official visit to Cuba in July 1993 was a vivid manifestation of the traditional relations and solidarity between the two peoples. A prominent result of last year's activities was the normalization of our relations with international financial and monetary organizations. On that basis, the IMF, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank agreed to lend us more than $700 million in 1993, and promised bigger loans in the coming years to improve, upgrade, and construct Vietnam's infrastructure. The first international conference to provide financial assistance to Vietnam convened in Paris in November 1993, with the participation of 22 countries and 17 international organizations. They agreed to provide us $1.86 billion in grant aid and concessional loans during the 1993-1994 financial year. Recently, sympathetic to our difficulties, the members of the Paris credit club decided to reduce 50 percent of our debt, extend our loan repayment period, and reduce the interest rates on the remaining loans. These things testify to a clear change in the world community's attitude toward Vietnam, a country that is enjoying success in its renovation policy and foreign policy of openness and is moving ahead with promising steps. [Correspondent] Vietnamese-U.S. relations have not been completely normalized. There have been some significant changes, however. Could you evaluate the progress and its effects? [Nguyen Manh Cam] America is the only big and developed country that has not normalized relations with Vietnam. It still maintains a trade embargo against Vietnam. The development of Vietnam's relations with regional nations, developed countries, and major politico-economic centers, however, clearly shows that the U.S. trade embargo runs counter to the common trend. Nevertheless, there was certain progress in the normalization process last year. Many meetings were held at different levels to exchange views on issues of mutual concern and accelerate normalization, especially the meetings between Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Khai and American politicians, including high-level American officials in Washington; and the meeting between our foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state in Singapore. The normalization of Vietnam's relations with international financial and monetary organizations was effected by U.S. President Bill Clinton's 2 July statement ending opposition to other countries providing loans to Vietnam for the repayment of its debt to IMF, and the 13 September statement and 23 December decision by the U.S. Treasury allowing American companies to participate in projects carried out in Vietnam by international financial and monetary organizations. These moves also helped encourage other countries to develop relations with Vietnam. [Correspondent] Do you have any comments and predictions regarding our foreign affairs activities in 1994? [Nguyen Manh Cam] In 1993, our active, vivid, and diversified foreign affairs activities were carried out with a positive and active spirit and with the participation of all echelons and levels of the party, government, National Assembly, and mass organizations. These activities achieved important results and improved Vietnam's reputation and position in the international community. This creates an environment of peace and stability and favorable international conditions for Vietnam to attract more foreign capital and technology for our economic development and national construction and protection. This is also the foundation for the implementation of our foreign affairs duties, including foreign economic affairs, in 1994 and subsequent years. Our important victory in foreign affairs confirms the correctness of the line set forth by the Seventh National Party Congress, concretized by the Third Plenum Resolution of the Seventh Party Central Committee in June 1992. From this line and from the vivid activities in past years, especially 1993, a prominent feature of Vietnam's new diplomatic policy has been formed. This is the policy of treasuring harmonious and friendly relations for mutual benefit with neighboring and regional countries. This is also the policy of diversifying multilateral relations with all nations in the world community. This harmonious combination is a special feature of Vietnamese diplomacy in the renovation era that meets the rapid and complicated changes in the world situation and regional political and economic forces. This diplomatic policy is also suitable to the common trend in the world following the Cold War era. In the new international environment, our open-door foreign policy is integrating our country with the world community on the basis of our chosen path and on the principles of independence, sovereignty, international unity, and preservation of national characteristics and interests.
