Yemuzov, by Z. Malbakhova: "A. Yemuzov: There Is No Alternative to Goodneighborliness, Friendship, and Cooperation"] [Text] In April of last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was created in Kabardino-Balkaria. The formation of that foreign-policy department was not only a step in the development of the republic's state system, but also a vital necessity that was dictated by the new political realities. The role and importance of the ministry are difficult to overevaluate. It has been given the functions of using diplomatic and political means to defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, security, inviolability of the republic's borders, and its political and economic-trade and other interests, both within the framework of the Russian Federation and on the international scene, and of creating favorable conditions for carrying out the reforms that the nation needs. We have asked A. G. Yemuzov, KBR [Kabardino-Balkaria Republic] minister of foreign affairs, to discuss the high-priority trends in the work performed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kabardino-Balkaria Republic, its affairs and plans, and to answer a number of other questions. [Yemuzov] Taking into consideration the political situation that has been created in the Caucasus, the KBR MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] considers that one of its most important tasks is the creation of a "goodneighborliness zone" around Kabardino-Balkaria. With this purpose, Treaties of friendship and goodneighborliness have been signed with the Republic of Adygey, the Karachayevo-Cherkess Republic, Stavropol Kray, the Republic of Dagestan, and the Republic of Kalmykia -- Khalmg Tangch. Treaties with Krasnodar Kray and Rostov Oblast have been prepared and coordinated. In order to restore the economic and cultural relations with subjects of the Russian Federation, a Treaty has been signed with Yaroslavl Oblast, and one with Perm Oblast has been extended. Treaties with the Chuvash Republic and with Tambov and Donetsk oblasts are being prepared for signing. Close contact is being maintained with Abkhazia, including contact along the diplomatic channel -- through the permanent representative of that republic in KBR. Any understanding is always taking the first steps toward cooperation. The further development of relations depends on many factors. But what is required of us is that the initial ties are well thought-out and have the potential for growth. If one speaks about concretizing the content of the treaties, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has rendered assistance in concluding an agreement among Adygey, Kabardino-Balkaria, and Karachayevo-Chekesia concerning cooperation in training specialists with higher education, and the Treaty of cooperation between the KBR and Adygey ministries of the press and information in creating a single information space. [Malbakhova] Do you see any difference between politics and diplomacy? [Yemuzov] I would not oppose them to one another, since a country's foreign policy is a continuation of its domestic policy. Politics and diplomacy are two sides of the same coin. Ideally, any politician must be a diplomat, and vice versa. If that is not so, then large mistakes can occur in the work being performed by both of them. [Malbakhova] What role has your ministry been called upon to play in the matter of restoring foreign-economic ties? [Yemuzov] At the present time the KBR Committee on Foreign-Economic Ties is working on these problems. But, inasmuch as the question has already been raised, I can reply. For diplomacy, the normal role is that of an icebreaker that is opening up a sea path in the shoreless ocean of world business. One of the basic tasks assigned to our ministry consists in creating the best conditions for the work of the entrepreneur with a foreign partner. However, the misfortune -- but not the blame -- of the subjects of the Russian Federation consists in the fact that all the foreign-economic activity used to be centralized and used to be carried out by way of Moscow. As a result of this policy, the outlying areas lack various capabilities, experience, and a sense of business organization. Today our initiative finds support and understanding in Moscow --it is precisely here that one can see the pledge of success and stability in the business and other spheres. [Malbakhova] Could you discuss the path along which our republic should proceed in restoring foreign-economic relations? What can we offer our foreign partners? [Yemuzov] When restoring business relations it is necessary to act not spontaneously, but in a "normal sequence," that is, in accordance with the traditional scheme that is well known in international practice -- "trade-- tourism -- investments." In this question it is not only our republic, but all of Russia, that is displaying impatience, wanting to begin "at the end" --with investments. Actually, the normal sequence probably would not be successful. If only because we are facing an abnormal situation. Even in order to begin to develop trade and tourism seriously, it is necessary to have investments in a system of hotels, sanitoriums, rest homes, tourist centers, transportation, communications, supporting production entities, etc. Consequently, we could propose to our foreign partners that they take out long-term leases for some of our sanitoriums and recreational centers, and that we operate others jointly. In both instances it would be on mutually advantageous terms. We could propose to our foreign partners the output from a number of our industrial enterprises, for example, the Tyrnyauz Combine, the diamond cutting-tool plant, the synthetic leather combine, as well as everything that nature has lavishly bestowed on us -- the therapeutic factors of our health resort. [Malbakhova] You are a doctor of sciences and a professor, you have been in many countries, and you have a large amount of work experience abroad. Last year, nevertheless, you attended classes in Moscow. Could you discuss that? [Yemuzov] It's never too late for anyone to get an education. Therefore, actually, in 1993 I took special training at the one-year refresher courses for managerial diplomatic cadres at the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where the subjects taught were questions of international law, diplomatic protocol, the concept of the Russian Federation's foreign policy, the philosophy of politics and diplomacy, foreign languages, and other disciplines. I completed the courses three months ahead of time, with distinction. [Malbakhova] What are the realistic possibilities that the KBR will appear on the world scene? [Yemuzov] Last year the KBR Ministry of Foreign Affairs did a definite amount of work to establish relations and strengthen the existing ones with the distant foreign countries and their subjects. In March 1993 a KBR delegation made an official visit to the Turkish Republic. The delegation was received by Minister of Foreign Affairs (Hikmet Cetin). He was given a message from KBR President V. M. Kokov to the President of the Turkish Republic. In the course of the visit, Agreements were signed -- between the Union of Chambers of Commerce and Industry and Exchanges of Turkey, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, and the KBR. There were meetings with activists from associations of people of Cherkess nationality in Ankara and Istanbul. As a result of the preliminary negotiations between the Kabardino-Balkaria government and the Alberta (Canada) commissioner for culture and tourism, a Treaty of friendship and cooperation was signed. Agreements concerning the formation of sister cities Nalchik and Kaiseri (Turkey), as well as a Treaty of friendship and cooperation between them, were signed. Ministry employees were part of delegations that went to Turkey, Syria, and Jordan to carry out work to expand ties in the area of economics, culture, and education. Meetings were held with a delegation of the International Islamic "Salvation" organization from Saudi Arabia, headed by Imam Abdul-Hamid Jafar Dagestani. Three meetings were held with secretaries of the American Embassy and embassy employees. We were visited by a French delegation from the French Ministry of Defense, workers from the Israeli Embassy, and a plenipotentiary from the "Sokhnut" organization in the North Caucasus, as well as the commissioner for culture and tourism from the province of Alberta, Canada. Assistance was provided in the creation of six commercial-production firms by compatriots. As a result, equipment with a total value of more than $200,000 (U.S.) was shipped into the republic. We feel that there is no alternative to goodneighborliness, friendship, and cooperation. Otherwise we shall not succeed in getting out of the crisis and guaranteeing the normal socioeconomic development of our republic. Therefore we shall continue to increase the work in this area. [Malbakhova] So far as we know, the KBR Ministry of Foreign Affairs engages in problems of repatriating our compatriots. What do you consider to be the chief factor in that work? [Yemuzov] In order to render realistic assistance to compatriots who are returning to their homeland, information pertaining to the restoration or acquisition of citizenship has been systematized. That is one of the important factors in our work, since it is precisely in this matter that difficulties have arisen. Our ministry prepared 285 findings at the OVIR [Visa and Registration Department] of the KBR Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide permits for residency in the republic; received more than 150 foreign citizens with various questions; and legalized 69 documents. The Commission on Questions of Citizenship, under the republic's President, considered 104 appropriate cases. That means that the fates of those individuals were determined. [Malbakhova] Could you discuss briefly the basic areas of your work during the new year? [Yemuzov] If we are to speak about the program for our work during the current year, it is extremely broad. I shall not enumerate the measures that have been planned. That would take up too much newspaper space. We shall continue the work of restoring and strengthening the traditional relations of goodneighborliness, friendship, and cooperation with the peoples of the North Caucasus and the other regions of Russia. We are taking specific steps to establish new ties and to strengthen the already existing ones with the nearby and distant foreign countries, and have planned the preparation and carrying out of political actions aimed at resolving conflicts and moot questions and at stabilizing the sociopolitical situation in our region. We intend to direct special attention to analytical work, to studying the domestic political situation in KBR, and to the placement of forces in the region. Our recommendations to the republic government will be formulated on that basis. In a word, the main task of the KBR Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the protection of the republic's national interests by diplomatic means and methods.
