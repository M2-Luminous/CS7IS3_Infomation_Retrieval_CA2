The CCHEN will this Friday enthusiastically celebrate its 30th birthday under such positive circumstances. Engineer German Piderit, the dynamic CCHEN president, told LA TERCERA that "we are optimizing the system, and our immediate goals aim at improving public service, a task that we will efficiently perform." Summarizing the three decades during which Chile has been using nuclear energy, Piderit emphasized the development of a series of complex techniques related to the manipulation of nuclear fuel and the fuel cycle. "The fact that we can have and use this technology at a national level has allowed us to develop areas that are important for the rest of the country's productive system," he explained. He was also pleased to refer to an agreement that CCHEN signed with authorities of the Second Region last week, "based on our policy of support for the sector that produces services and for socioeconomic development." This type of agreement will undoubtedly be signed with other regions, too. [passage omitted] Reactors Chile has no nuclear power plants, but research reactors, Piderit explained. "It is worth noting the size of those reactors, as there is no comparison whatsoever -- as far as power, size, and the possibility of accidents are concerned -- between research reactors and a nuclear power plant." (There are two nuclear reactors in our country: one in La Reina, and the other in Lo Aguirre, near the Lo Prado tunnel). Piderit added: "One of them has reached its critical point with 5 megawatts, while the other operates at 2 megawatts. The smallest nuclear power plant in existence operates at more than 300 megawatts." He noted that "as far as their operation or the possibility of any accidents are concerned, our reactors are practically harmless." The research reactors benefit the industrial, food, and medicine sectors. Medicine and Food Surgical and medical equipment, hypodermic syringes, gloves, and other elements have for several years been sterilized through gamma radiation at the Lo Aguirre plant. In the specific nuclear medicine area, the CCHEN is now supplying "around 90 percent of the radioisotopes and radioactive medicines that are needed in Chile." [passage omitted]
