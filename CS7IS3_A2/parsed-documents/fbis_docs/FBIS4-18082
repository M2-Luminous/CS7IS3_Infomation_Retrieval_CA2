"I do not retract one word here and now," Schoenhuber stated in Bonn on Tuesday [29 March] and added, "I am calmly expecting a lawsuit." Schoenhuber justified his accusations by pointing to statements by Bubis at the beginning of March, when the latter, in the view of the Republikaner chairman, blamed followers of his party for being coresponsible for arson attacks. As a result, Schoenhuber filed a criminal complaint with the Bonn Land Court on 4 March, accusing Bubis of instigating people and slander. The proceedings are underway but it was passed on to the Mainz public prosecutor's office, obviously because of competence. After the attack on the synagogue in Luebeck Schoenhuber had repeated the accusation and called Bubis one "of the worst instigators of people in Germany," after Bubis, for his part, had called right-wing extremist parties "intellectual arsonists" and blamed them for the attack on the synagogue.
