The highest rate of increases in food prices were registered in the Urals region (5.2 percent), and the lowest in the Northwestern and East Siberian regions (1.3 percent). Increases in prices for nonfood items ranged from 1 percent in the Northwestern region to 2.6 percent in the Urals region. The cost of for-fee services for the population went up by more than 5 percent in the West Siberian, Far Eastern, and Northwestern regions, but remained practically unchanged in East Siberia. Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in the consumer market were as follows (as a percentage of the preceding date): 05/04 05/10 05/17 Average daily price rise May April Consumer goods 102.2 101.6 102.5 0.28 0.30 and services including: foodstuffs 101.9 101.9 102.3 0.27 0.23 nonfood items 102.3 101.2 102.3 0.28 0.25 for-fee 103.8 101.9 104.7 0.45 1.27 services for the population Since the beginning of the month, the current consumer price index measured 105.0 percent, including that for foodstuffs--104.7 percent, nonfood items--105.0 percent, and for-fee services for the population--108.0 percent. If the current rate of price increases remains at the same level, prices for consumer goods and services in May will rise overall by 8-9 percent. Foodstuffs. Over the period of 10 to 17 May, prices in organized and nonorganized trade rose by 1.9 percent and 4.3 percent. Price changes by main categories of food products are shown below (as a percentage of the preceding date): Total Including: in organized in nonorganized trade trade All food products 102.3 101.9 104.3 including: Meat and meat 102.3 102.4 102.0 products Fish and fish 100.3 100.4 96.3 products Milk and milk 100.9 101.1 99.9 products Eggs 99.9 99.9 100.5 Sugar 100.6 100.6 101.2 Bread and bakery 102.9 102.9 - products Cereals and 101.7 101.7 101.7 macaroni items Vodka 100.0 100.0 100.2 Potatoes and 105.3 104.4 106.1 vegetables Fruit 117.4 116.9 117.7 In organized trade over the elapsed week fresh produce prices continued to rise at an anticipatory rate: cabbage and onions by 10-14 percent, and apples by 23 percent. As compared to the preceding week, prices for meat, bread, and bakery items rose at a perceptibly higher rate--2.6-4.4 percent. There was no significant change in prices for certain dairy products, sugar, tea, eggs, butter, vegetable oil, vodka, and potatoes. Since the beginning of the month, prices rose the most with respect to vegetables and fruit--by 10-26 percent. Since the beginning of the year, their prices increased 2.3-fold and 1.7-fold, respectively; milk prices increased 2.1-fold, and meat prices--1.5-fold. Similar to organized trade, the greatest price rises in nonorganized trade were registered with respect to fresh produce. Prices for apples rose by 20.5 percent; cabbage, beets, and carrots--by 10-14 percent; and onions and garlic--by 4-5 percent. Since the beginning of the month, prices for vegetables increased by 17 percent, and for fruit--1.4-fold; since the beginning of the year, these prices increased 2.7-fold and 2.6-fold, respectively. The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic foodstuffs increased over the week by 3 percent and as of 17 May amounted to R51,100, calculated on a monthly basis. Since the middle of March, the price differential between monitored cities had been increasing gradually and measured a factor of 4.7 on 17 May as compared to 3.6 on 15 March of this year. The highest cost of the basket was registered in Magadan (R141,300) and the lowest in Ulyanovsk (R30,000). In terms of the cost of the consumer basket, Moscow and St. Petersburg ranked 34th and 46th among 132 monitored cities (R55,400 and R51,500 on a monthly basis). The practice of price controls with respect to food products persisted in April. While there were no price controls on the federal level, in 104 of 132 monitored cities (100 in December 1993) regional administration influenced the process of price formation. At the same time, the extent to which various forms of price control were applied to the consumer market varied. For instance, in the cities of the Volgo-Vyatka and North Caucasus regions, prices on practically all food staples are controlled, while in the Northern and Northwestern regions, price control with respect to basic food staples is limited to several cities (mainly the cities in Komi Republic, Cherepovets, and Pskov). The data on the scale of price controls with respect to basic food staples in December 1993-April 1994 are presented below: As % of the total number of monitored cities 1993 1994 December January February March April Beef 49 53 46 45 45 Bologna 48 50 41 41 42 Butter 42 38 34 42 39 Vegetable 28 30 33 32 32 oil Milk 67 71 74 68 69 Baby food 33 32 29 31 37 Eggs 40 40 43 41 42 Sugar 39 33 28 32 29 Salt 29 27 30 28 28 Flour 35 39 30 33 37 Bread 74 77 78 73 75 The most commonly used kind of price control is putting a limit on trade organization's mark-up (about 50 percent of all instances of price control). In approximately 5 percent of the cities, limits are set on profitability of food processing industry enterprises. Much more rarely, subsidies from local budgets were used to keep prices at a certain level; the practice of setting a maximum limit on prices is still used in Voronezh (meat products, butter, and milk) and Lipetsk (butter, eggs, and vodka). In some cities of Russia (Syktyvkar, Orel, Kazan, Ulyanovsk, Nalchik, Ufa, and Omsk) several kinds of price control were used simultaneously. By the end of April of this year, prices for products subject to price control and for those sold at market prices rose at practically the same rate. At the same time, the level of regulated and market prices did differ. For instance, regulated prices for wheat bread made from category I and II flour ranged from R213 per kg in Ulyanovsk to R750 in Tomsk, while market prices ranged from R641 in Arkhangelsk to R1,274 per kg in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. With respect to milk, on the contrary, market prices in Ivanovo (R419 per liter) were lower than controlled prices in Kostroma (R484). Nonfood Items Over the period from 10 to 17 May prices for nonfood items rose at a moderate rate. There was practically no change in prices for personal and household goods or tobacco. At the same time, there was a considerable increase in prices for natural silk fabrics, synthetic detergents, wallpaper, and certain categories of medical supplies (by 4-10 percent). For-Fee Services for the Population Over the elapsed week, rates and fees for for-fee services for the population increased on average in Russia by almost 5 percent. There was a substantial increase in the cost of fares in suburban trains (by 18.2 percent) and city buses (by 8.6 percent); among municipal services, electric power rates increased by 12.6 percent. The cost of suburban train fares in Tomsk and the cities of Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast increased twofold or more, and in St. Petersburg--fivefold. Electric power rates doubled over the elapsed week in Nizhniy Tagil, Orenburg, Syktyvkar, Vorkuta, Ukhta, and St. Petersburg. Industry. Over 15 days of May 1994, of 163 categories of products counted in periodic reports, the average daily production, as compared to the corresponding period of May 1993: --increased with respect to 6 items, (including diesel generators, city telephone cables, front-wheel drive passenger cars, high fat-content cheeses and feta cheese), or 4 percent of the total number; --decreased with respect to 148 items, or 91 percent of the total number; as compared to the corresponding period of April 1994: --increased with respect to 31 items, (among them oil, including gas condensate, automotive gasoline, iron ore, pig iron, coke, caustic soda, synthetic ammonia, potassium fertilizer, polyvynilchloride resin, drop forges, traveling electric cranes and self-propelled cranes, trolley buses, grain harvesting combines, cardboard, motorcycles, commercial edible fish products, butter, canned milk products, confectionery items, and salt), or 19 percent of the total number; --decreased with respect to 123 items, or 76 percent of the total number. The output of main categories of industrial products over 15 days of May 1994 is shown below: Produced over As % of the corresponding period 15 days of May of (in terms of average daily 1994 production) May 1993 April 1994 Electric power--billion 29.5 93 82 kW/hr Oil, including gas 11.9 85 103 condensate, million tonnes Natural gas, billion 24.2 96 91 cubic meters Coal, million tonnes 8.3 81 79 Steel, million tonnes 1.9 77 98 Finished rolled metal, 1.4 77 90 including semi-finished product for export--million tonnes Steel pipe, thousand 68.7 30 90 tonnes Large electric machinery, 23 18 28 units Metal-cutting machine 60 18 56 tools, units Passenger cars, thousand 21.5 68 93 units Tractors, thousand units 429 13 86 Chemical filament and 5.9 40 84 fiber, thousand tonnes Mineral fertilizer 332 70 92 (recalculated as 100-percent nutrients), thousand tonnes Automotive tires for 194 18 31 agricultural vehicles, motorcycles, and motorollers, million units Commercial timber, 1.3 64 77 million cubic meters Lumber, thousand cubic 236 60 85 meters Paper, thousand tonnes 83.7 74 85 Cement, million tonnes 1.2 63 91 Roof slate, million 17.1 14 47 standard tiles Construction brick, 208 52 74 million units of standard brick Rolled roofing and 14.6 70 91 insulation materials, million square meters Fabrics, total, million 32.9 38 54 square meters Hosiery, million pairs 5.9 48 65 Knitwear, million units 2.6 43 55 Footwear, million pairs 1.3 36 82 Television sets, thousand 20.4 24 40 units Radio receiving devices, 6.5 14 42 thousand units Refrigerators and 44.4 43 64 freezers, thousand units Electric vacuum cleaners, 16.6 27 90 thousand units Washing machines, 22.8 26 47 thousand units Meat, including 43.5 70 97 byproducts, category I, total, thousand tonnes Whole-milk products, 240 82 97 recalculated as milk, total, thousand tonnes Butter, total, thousand 15.6 65 118 tonnes Granulated sugar, total, 18.9 18 49 including from customer-supplied material--thousand tonnes Over the elapsed period of May 1994, there has been no production of forge presses with a numeric program control, processing centers, bulldozers, automotive graders, tower cranes with the lifting capacity of eight or more tonnes, truck trailers and semi-trailers, tractor hitches, passenger railcars, and magnetic tape. The Agro-Industrial Complex By the middle of May, in the country as a whole, spring crops were planted on 29.6 million hectares, including 10.4 million hectares over the past week. The lag as compared to proceeding years so far persists. Last year by this time, spring crops were planted on 32.7 million hectares, and in 1992--38.1 million hectares. The progress of the spring planting campaign at agricultural enterprises as of 16 May is characterized by the following data (in thousands hectares): 1992 1993 1994 1994 as % of 1993 All spring crops, 38.1 32.7 29.6 91 million hectares of that: Grain and legume 23.5 21.1 20.8 99 crops (without corn), million hectares Corn--total 3,924 2,841 1,542 54 including for grain 631 575 449 78 Sugar beet 1,285 1,125 916 81 (industrial) Long-fiber flax 207 211 79 38 Sunflower for seed 2,386 1,980 1,745 88 Potatoes 436 349 131 38 Vegetables 172 130 104 80 Annual grasses, 4.2 3.5 3.0 88 million hectares The data is available now on the extent of ruin of winter crops sown for the current year harvest. As of 16 May of this year winter crops at Russian Federation farms were ruined on 2.9 million hectares (19 percent of the total area sown), including grain crops--2.8 million hectares (20 percent). Last year winter crops were ruined on 1,7 million hectares (8 percent). The remaining 1994 harvest winter grain crop area at agricultural enterprises comprises about 12 million hectares as compared to 15 million hectares sown for last year's harvest. The total area of grain crops sown, counting the surviving winter crops, is smaller by approximately 4 million hectares (11 percent) than that as of the same date a year ago. Spring planting is almost completed on the territories of the Central Chernozem region, Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays, Rostov, Orel, Tula, Volgograd, Penza, and Ulyanovsk Oblasts, Mordovia, and Tatarstan, where spring grain planting areas exceed those of last year. Spring grain crops were planted on a substantially smaller area in Kirov, Nizhniy Novgorod, and Saratov Oblast, and the Republic of Mari El (by 20-40 percent); the same is also true of winter grain crops planted here last fall. Construction In keeping with the federal investment program, in the current year it is envisaged to commission 128 facilities financed from the budget, and 332 facilities financed by credit investment resources. By and large, the developers plan to commission the facilities in the fourth quarter (96 percent). The utilized volume of capital investment in budget-financed facilities amounted to R114 billion, with the annual limit of R772 billion as set by the Russian Ministry of Economics, and those financed through credit resources--R256 billion and R872 billion, respectively. No construction was under way at one in six facilities in January-February of this year. The progress of construction work on the facilities in the federal 1994 start-up program by national-economic complex is characterized by the following data (units): At objects financed through: budget means credit resources planned to be commissioned capital planned to be commissioned capital commissioned (including investment commissioned (including investment this year commissioned utilized, this year commissioned utilized, in part billions of in part billions of rubles rubles Total for Russia 128 1 114.3 322 2 256.4 including by economic complex: Fuel and energy 22 - 43.3 21 - 59.4 Machine-building 5 - 38.9 67 - 59.2 Metallurgical 1 - 0.4 52 1 60.8 Chemical and 72 1 16.1 71 - 48.9 timber Construction - - - 54 1 22.7 Transportation 26 - 14.5 8 - 0.6 and communications Past-Due Back Pay Liabilities The number of enterprises having liabilities with respect to back pay and other labor remuneration-related pay-outs dropped somewhat in the beginning of May as compared to the beginning of April; the ratio of past-due liabilities in relation to enterprises' payroll also dropped. In absolute terms, past-due back pay liabilities increased insignificantly over April. The data on the number of enterprises having past-due back pay liabilities and the volume of liabilities are represented in the following table: As of As of 05/01/94 For 04/01/94 05/01/94 as % of reference: 04/01/94 as of 05/01/93 Number of enterprises 32.2 30.3 94 10.9 with back-pay and other pay-out liabilities--total, thousands including: in industry 6.9 6.6 96 3.2 in construction 6.2 5.9 97 2.4 in agriculture 19.4 17.8 93 5.3 Volume of past-due 2,341.5 2,435.0 104 51.4 back pay and other pay-out liabilities to enterprise employees--total, billions of rubles including: in industry 1,311.1 1,405.5 107 27.5 in construction 414.1 459.1 111 11.3 in agriculture 616.3 570.4 93 12.7 Past-due back pay and 130.1 121.9 52.2 other pay-out liabilities as a percentage of total payroll calculated for the month at enterprises having such liabilities--total including: in industry 108.7 112.9 46.1 in construction 145.5 107.5 61.4 in agriculture 199.5 175.0 61.5 The bulk of past-due back pay liabilities was owed by state-owned enterprises and organizations--41 percent, mixed ownership (without foreign participation)--32 percent, and privately-owned--32 percent; enterprises and organizations in municipal ownership and those owned by public associations and organizations accounted for less than 1 percent of it. A considerable part of past-due back pay liabilities was owed by enterprises in machine-building and metalworking (30 percent of the total volume of liabilities owed in industry), fuels (24 percent), timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industries (11 percent), and in ferrous metallurgy (8 percent). Back pay owed for more than one month as of 1 May 1994 in all three economic sectors amounted to R1.1015 trillion, or 45 percent of all back pay liability, including in industry--R546.6 billion (39 percent), construction--R212.7 (46 percent), and agriculture--R342.2 billion (60 percent). The main cause of past-due back pay and other pay-out liabilities is insufficient funds, or lack thereof, in operating accounts of enterprises and organizations. The greatest amounts not paid out in time have been registered at enterprises and organizations in industry, construction, and agriculture in Tyumen Oblast (R252.5 billion), Krasnoyarsk Kray (R118.9 percent), Kemerovo Oblast (R113.9 billion), Chelyabinsk Oblast (R99.6 billion), Republics of Tataria (R88.3 billion) and Bashkiria (R66.4 billion), Altay Kray (R54.5 billion), Rostov Oblast (R50.2 billion), and the Komi Republic (R49.5 billion). Fulfillment of Inter-Government Agreement With CIS Countries Russia's foreign trade turnover with CIS countries in the first quarter of the current year amounted to an estimated R6.8 trillion (in current prices). Exports accounted for R4.2 trillion, or 62 percent of the goods turnover (63 percent in the first quarter of 1993), and imports--R2.6 trillion, or 38 percent (37 percent). The volume of shipments of most important categories of producer goods from Russia under inter-government agreements in the first quarter of 1994 was as follows: Delivered As % of fulfillment of As % of the annual first quarter inter-government of 1993 agreements Finished rolled 98 12 25 ferrous metals, thousand tonnes Steel pipe, 17 6.7 21 thousand tonnes Polyethylene, 9.2 54 46 thousand tonnes Caustic soda, 15 30 57 100-percent, thousand tonnes Synthetic rubber, 21 40 29 thousand tonnes Commercial timber, 186 6.3 34 thousand cubic meters Lumber, thousand 110 9.8 39 cubic meters The main consumers of material resources are Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, which account for 86 percent of the total rolled ferrous metal delivered to CIS countries, 64 percent of steel pipe, 76 percent of commercial wood, and 56 percent of lumber. Deliveries of certain goods to the Russian market in the first quarter of 1994 are characterized by the following data: Received As % of fulfillment of As % of the annual first quarter inter-government of 1993 agreements Meat and meat 17.6 12 47 products recalculated as meat, thousand tonnes Milk and milk 35.9 14 49 products recalculated as milk, thousand tonnes Hosiery, million 1.4 12 116 pairs Carpeting and 153.4 153 0.1 rugs, thousand square meters In the first quarter of this year, Ukraine delivered 8 percent of the annual agreed-upon volume of meat and meat products; Belarus--31 percent of meat and meat products, and 14 percent of milk and milk products; and Kazakhstan--2 percent of meat and meat products. In 1994, in keeping with inter-government agreements, in the category of consumer goods Russia is to deliver only household and facial soap and synthetic detergents. In the first quarter of this year, their deliveries to CIS countries comprised 1 percent, 2 percent, and 25 percent, respectively, of the total agreed-upon volume for the year. This report was prepared on the basis of materials of the Russian State Committee on Statistics.
