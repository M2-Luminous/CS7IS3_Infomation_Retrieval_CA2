On the eve of his departure, he visited the journal's editorial office and answered the questions of editor in chief Vladimir Krestyaninov. [Krestyaninov] You, Nikolay Grigoryevich, are a doctor of sciences and an economist who has worked in the Academy of Sciences system and is suddenly leaving for the foreign trade sphere. What is the reason? [Zaytsev] Mr. editor in chief, there is no secret here and it can seem strange only superficially. Now is generally a time of surprise appointments, but as for me, up to now I have considered myself a cadre foreign trade employee: my first job was the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Specifically I was involved in the problems of Cuba and Latin America. My work in Switzerland was also connected to foreign trade. I do not think that I am leaving academic activity, and academic regalia will not be an obstacle. I am simply returning to what I began with, and I am traveling to work in Mexico with a good, business-like attitude. [Krestyaninov] In your opinion, what is the level of Russia's trade-economic ties with Mexico as of today? [Zaytsev] I cannot answer that question unequivocally. Traditionally the flow of goods in the two directions was relatively small. The situation has been the same in recent years. The volumes of trade are no more than 40-50 million dollars, which is not much for countries like Mexico and Russia. But it is noteworthy that in recent years very interesting contracts have been signed to supply sets of equipment from the former Soviet Union, from Russia now, and from a number of other CIS republics, above all Ukraine. These deliveries are concentrated in the power engineering sphere. Russian companies are exporting equipment for large GES's [hydroelectric power station] which are being built in Mexico. There are also deliveries for other energy installations. We have good prospects for the incursion of other types of equipment; among others Khimmasheksport [Chemical Machine Export] is actively working on this market. A contract for exporting equipment to produce prussic acid has been signed and is being realized. A contract for assembling tractors produced at the Lipetsk and Vladimir plants continues to be realized, though not at as rapid a rate as before. These machines are the same ones which were in demand in Mexico back in the 1970s, although the market, I repeat, is complex and practically no operations to ship components to assemble them have been carried out this year. There is also some progress in such directions as deliveries of aviation equipment--above all helicopters--and Ural trucks, which may also arouse the interest of Mexican buyers. Although it must be admitted that this was done in previous years. As for imports, instead of a number of the traditional Mexican goods, we continue to buy large batches of pipe. The import of particular types of consumer goods like coffee, above all instant, cigarettes, and certain other goods is being expanded. And characteristically, this is being done to a significant degree by independent commercial structures. [Krestyaninov] Will the signing of NAFTA in some way help or, on the contrary, hinder the development of our ties? [Zaytsev] That is a very interesting question. You know, I think that 17 November, that is, the day when American legislators in fact responded positively to the North American Free Trade Agreement, will determine the development of economics and politics in the northern part of America for the long-term perspective. And, of course, NAFTA will both directly and indirectly affect Russia's interests, and I may be wrong, but it is more likely to be negatively. Serious additional competition may appear for us in the United States and Canada for a number of those goods which we can still move and are moving onto those markets. In the medium term, as our economy is normalized and becomes more competitive in terms of realizing international deals, I think that NAFTA must be treated as a kind of given. Undoubtedly this bloc is not closed but half open, and I assume that in the future one could in fact conceive of categories for setting up particular competitive production facilities, say, on Mexico's territory, like the "maquiladoras," in order later to move this output onto the markets of the United States and Canada. And there are already some concrete proposals in this direction. Among others, those small production facilities which we have, in Canada for example, I think could in time be more profitable in Mexico and could support commercial interests in the entire subregion. I repeat that this question has not yet been raised on the practical level. So one of the first tasks for me right away will be to figure out seriously and in detail what this means for Russia's foreign economic interests. [Krestyaninov] But in addition to that, what in your opinion hinders the more serious development of our trade-economic ties today? [Zaytsev] I think there are traditional obstacles of an objective nature and some new difficulties. As for the traditional factors, I think that all the same I must unequivocally say that Mexico and the Soviet Union and Mexico and Russia have essentially never opened their doors to one another and have not even tried to. Mexico is traditionally oriented to the northern market, that is understandable. But its policy of diversification of foreign-economic ties is notable, even with the signing of NAFTA, and I think that even Russia will sooner or later but inevitably be included in it. And on our part, the new entrepreneurial circles have not yet marked the position which Mexico will take in their export and import strategy or in the movement and attraction of foreign investments. In my understanding, this country is no longer a traditional developing state. In the past 5-6 years, in conditions of very great economic difficulties, Mexico was able to realize an exceptionally powerful set of structural transformations. Today Mexico has a modern infrastructure and competitive industry and has every possibility of another leap into the future. I do not think that a Latin American "tiger" such as Mexico should escape our attention. Among the difficulties of a traditional nature I would add distance, since what can be saved or lost on freight is quite important. I will also mention the circumstance that by no means do we always have adequate potential to finance export-import transactions. As for difficulties related directly to the present stage, the instability of our economic situation must be singled out of course. I mean those problems which we still have and sometimes are even accelerating on the level of realizing foreign economic operations, including a weak legislative base and the inexperience of some new commercial organizations, which for now are not always qualified to work on the new markets. But I believe it is unproductive to speak only of difficulties. I would raise the question above all of the possibility of and need to assist Russian and Mexican entrepreneurs find one another, since up to now a certain number of trade operations have not been conducted directly but through third countries. [Krestyaninov] But apparently our legislation does not allow us to establish serious cooperation either? [Zaytsev] Absolutely, although we are more viable and our foreign trade organizations now are in the process of preparing to work in the new conditions. I have had meetings and contacts with 35-40 Russian foreign trade associations and banks, not to mention talks in the Ministry itself. And it seems to me that foreign economic enthusiasm is fairly strong among entrepreneurs. If domestic matters are arranged, I think the Russian mind will lay and already is laying a unique path. [Krestyaninov] Our entrepreneurs have very little information on what Mexico is like and what Mexican goods are like. [Zaytsev] I agree with that absolutely. [Krestyaninov] That obviously applies to conditions for importing them too. [Zaytsev] And both the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and the trade representation are to blame for that, I believe. Tuning up information channels should be one of the most important tasks. But on the other hand, it seems to me that for now Russia's entrepreneurial circles are still unaware of the unique possibilities for realizing their own interests they can obtain by cooperating closely with the trade representatives' apparat. To be honest, that disturbs me, since very often they go right out and find unreliable firms and frequently get "burned," while the trade representations were in fact created for that very reason, to find reliable partners and provide information on markets. Trade representatives send an enormous flow of information to Russia but, unfortunately, it by no means always finds the consumer.
