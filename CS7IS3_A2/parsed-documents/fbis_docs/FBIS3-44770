Procedures and provisions governing the accounts of consumption tax follow: Article 1. For business accounting purposes, consumption tax- paying enterprises should add another subsidiary entry on "consumption tax payable" to the "tax payable" entry. Article 2. An enterprise -- that needs to pay consumption tax on consumer goods it produces -- should, when selling the product, debit and list the amount of consumption tax payable under an entry on "products' consumption tax and others;" whereas it should credit the same amount to another entry on "tax payable/consumption tax payable." Upon actually paying the consumption tax, it should debit the amount from the entry on "tax payable/consumption tax payable," and should credit the same amount to an entry on "bank deposit." It should reverse the debiting and crediting processes when goods sold are returned and when taxes paid are rebated. An enterprise exporting taxable consumer goods that receive no tax exemption or rebate according to regulations, shall be regarded as selling domestically, and it should carry out accounting entries in accordance with the above stipulation. Article 3. According to the "provisions," the amount of consumption tax payable by an enterprise that regards taxable consumer goods it produces as investments, should be listed and debited under an entry on "long-term investment," while the same amount is credited to another entry on "tax payable/consumption tax payable." An enterprise -- that produces taxable consumer goods in exchange for means of production and consumer goods, or for offsetting debts or settling fees of purchasing agents -- shall be regarded as conducting sales, and its accounting entries should be handled accordingly. According to the "provisions," it should pay consumption tax, and it should handle its accounting entries in accordance with Article 2 of the "provisions." According to the "provisions," an enterprise -- that produces taxable consumer goods and uses them in other areas including ongoing construction projects and non-production organizations -- should pay consumption tax. The amount of consumption tax payable should be listed and debited under entries on "fixed assets," "ongoing construction projects," "non-business expenses," or "product-marketing expenses," while the same amount is credited to another entry on "tax payable/consumption tax payable." According to the "provisions," consumption tax shall be levied on packaging materials that are sold with the products, but that are charged separately. The amount of consumption tax payable should be listed and debited under an entry on "other business expenses," while the same amount is credited to another entry on "tax payable/consumption tax payable." According to the "provisions," consumption tax shall be levied on the deposit or security on packaging materials that are overdue and that are not returned to buyers. The tax payable should be debited under entries on "other business expenses" and "other payments due," while the same amount is credited to another entry on "tax payable/consumption tax payable." Upon actually paying the consumption tax, the enterprise should debit the amount from the entry on "tax payable/consumption tax payable," and should credit the same amount to an entry on "bank deposit." Article 4. Contract processing on taxable consumer goods is liable for consumption tax. When the consignor comes to pick up his processed goods, the consignee shall withhold and pay later on his behalf the amount of consumption tax payable. The consignee should debit the withheld consumption tax under entries on "accounts receivable" and "bank deposit," while crediting the same amount to another entry on "tax payable/consumption tax payable." If the consignor is to sell the processed taxable consumer goods immediately after repossessing them, he should list the withheld consumption tax as part of the processed taxable consumer goods' costs to be debited under entries on "contract processing materials," "production costs," and "independently-manufactured semifinished products," while crediting the same amount to other entries on "accounts payable" and "bank deposit." According to the "provisions," the withheld consumption tax shall be deductible if the consignor repossesses and uses the processed taxable consumer goods to reproduce other taxable consumer goods.

It should be listed and debited under entries on "fixed assets," "purchase of commodities," and "purchase of materials," while being credited to the entry on "bank deposit." Article 6. Various taxable consumer goods for exports that are exempted from consumption tax should be categorized under different accounting methods: 1. Consumption tax payable need not be calculated if the "provisions" have directly granted tax exemption to a production enterprise that directly exports taxable consumer goods or that indirectly exports them through other foreign trade enterprises. 2. If an enterprise -- that indirectly exports taxable consumer goods through other foreign trade enterprises -- adopts the method of paying the tax first and then reclaiming it later in accordance with the "provisions'" stipulations, the following accounting methods shall apply: a. A production enterprise -- that entrusts another foreign trade enterprise to export on its behalf taxable consumer goods -- should list and debit the amount of consumption tax payable under an entry on "accounts receivable," while crediting the same amount to another entry on "tax payable/consumption tax payable." Upon actually paying the consumption tax, it should debit the amount from the entry on "tax payable/consumption tax payable," and should credit the same amount to an entry on "bank deposit." When the tax paid is rebated from the foreign trade enterprise agency that exported the taxable consumer goods, the production enterprise should debit the amount from the "bank deposit" entry, while crediting the same amount to another entry on "accounts receivable." It should reverse the debiting and crediting processes when exported goods are returned whereby taxes rebated have to be repaid once again. After exporting the taxable consumer goods and upon receiving from the taxation administration department the consumption tax previously paid by the production enterprise, the foreign trade enterprise agency should list and debit the amount under an entry on "bank deposit," while crediting the same amount to another entry on "accounts payable." On returning the same rebated tax amount to the production enterprise, the foreign trade enterprise agency should debit the amount from the "accounts payable" entry, while crediting the same amount to the "bank deposit" entry. When exported goods are returned whereby taxes rebated have to be repaid once again, it should debit the amount from the entry on "tax payable/consumption tax payable," while crediting the same amount to the "bank deposit" entry. Upon receiving from the production enterprise the consumption tax rebated previously, the foreign trade enterprise agency should reverse the debiting and crediting processes. b. If an enterprise sells its taxable consumer goods to another foreign trade enterprise which will export the goods on its own, the production enterprise shall handle the accounts concerning consumption tax payable in accordance with the stipulations of Article 2 of the "provisions." After exporting the taxable consumer goods with customs declaration forms and upon applying for exports tax rebate, the foreign trade enterprise exporting taxable consumer goods on its own should debit the amount from an entry on "exports tax rebate receivable," while crediting the same amount to another entry on "sales costs of commodities." Upon actually receiving the tax rebate on the exported taxable consumer goods, the enterprise should debit the amount from an entry on "bank deposit," while crediting the same amount to another entry on "exports tax rebate receivable." It should reverse the debiting and crediting processes when exported goods are returned whereby consumption taxes rebated have to be repaid once again.
