The demonstration was organized in Prague's Old Town square by the Bohemian and Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS). Journalists estimated it was attended by 40,000 people. He said he believed negotiations between the government and the unions were held in a manner that was completely correct. The government had accepted many of the points made by the unions concerning the amendment to the employment code, and so to say it had not consulted the unions on the matter was "utter lies and falsehood." However, he said, the government did not have to accept all the unions' comments, "as some of the union leaders seem to wish." Klaus said he had been receiving reports from all over the country concerning pressure placed on union members, who were offered a free ride to Prague in order to take part in some kind of demonstration for a bit. This action by unions was being revealed by "telephones, faxes and letters by people from all over the Republic," he said.
