Gen. (Retd) Nasirullah Babar said Thursday that activists of Al-Zulfiqar Organisation (AZO) did get terrorist training from the Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). "Training camps were set up in Rajasthan and other areas of India, where many AZO activists were brain-washed and thus, they became RAW agents," he said during on informal chat with newsmen at a lunch hosted by the Senate chairman, Wasim Sajjad. The minister said that RAW agents were active in Sindh. "I have read a report which showed that Jam Sadiq was a RAW agent." "The mere fact that a political worker was lashed or underwent imprisonment is not a certificate for patriotism," the minister said when his comments were sought on the credentials of Suraish Kumar, a supporter of Mir Murtaza Bhutto, who was dubbed as a RAW agent by the government the other day, and who was known as a "[word indistinct] of Bhutto" in Sindh. He told a questioner that Murtaza Bhutto was not involved in the 1961 hijacking of the PIA passenger plane and this was mentioned in a report prepared by the Army during the martial law period. "His name was then put in "Khana [list] number two (meant for suspects) in the FIR [first information report]." "Let the time come," was his reply when asked whether the government would arrest Begum Nusrat Bhutto in connection with Wednesday's incident in Larkana. "We are looking into the matter," he said when asked how did the RAW agents enter into Al-Murtaza, Larkana. He said he would ask the Sindh government why it did not take the necessary measures before hand to stop their entry in the residence. The minister said the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] would not split and described Begum Bhutto's statement in this regard as just a "hubble". He said Makhdoom Khaleequzzaman and Ihtramul Haq had left the PPP long time back. He said that the Murtaza factor would have no impact on the PPP in the Punjab. "When there is a change of generation there is a change of leadership too, but nobody can be imposed on workers as their leader." The interior minister said the Judicial probe into the Larkana incident was in progress. "It will establish who opened the firing first. It cannot be said at this stage whether the provincial government failed to handle the situation." He said that he received the report of the incident at 11 a.m. on Wednesday from the Sindh government. "We were prepared to send reinforcement but the provincial administration did not ask for assistance." To another question, the minister said it was the flawed policy of Ziaul Haq which led to the influx of foreigners in Pakistan. At that time, 8,000 visas were issued to the Indian nationals to visit Pakistan but, now, the figure has been restricted to 40 and the police verification has been made mandatory, he said.
