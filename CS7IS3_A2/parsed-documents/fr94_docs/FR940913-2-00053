FR940913-2-00053 FR940913-2-00038 [OPP&hyph;00389; FRL&hyph;4911&hyph;1] Statement of Policy for Pesticide Products Used Together or Sequentially; Notice of Availability and Request for Comments AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA is soliciting comments on a proposed policy for labeling of pesticide products used together or sequentially. That policy has been developed in a draft Pesticide Regulation (PR) Notice entitled, ``Labeling Limitations for Products Used Together or Sequentially'' which is available upon request. Interested parties may request a copy of the Agency's proposed policy as set forth in the ADDRESSES unit of this notice. DATES: Written comments, identified by the docket number [OPP&hyph;00389], must be received on or before October 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: The PR Notice is available from Jeff Kempter, By mail: Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Jeff Kempter (7505C), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 713, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, (703) 305&hyph;5448. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pesticide products may be mixed or used after other pesticides according to label directions. However, sometimes products bear labeling statements which prohibit or advise against using certain products together or after each other to prevent crop phytotoxicity, incompatibility, reduction of efficacy or adverse effects to humans or the environment. The Agency is proposing guidance on when such labeling statements will be approved. The proposed policy is that the Agency will require or approve mandatory labeling statements prohibiting or limiting use of one product with or after another only if data are submitted which demonstrate that unreasonable adverse effects will occur without such statements. If EPA is not persuaded by the data or no data are submitted, the Agency will approve advisory statements which recommend that a product not be used with or after another. This Federal Register notice announces the availability of the draft PR Notice and solicits comment on the proposed policy. If, after reviewing any comments, EPA determines that changes to the policy are warranted, the Agency will revise the draft PR Notice prior to release. List of Subjects Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests. Dated: September 6, 1994. Stephen L. Johnson, Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22588 Filed 9&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
