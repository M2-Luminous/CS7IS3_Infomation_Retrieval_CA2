Finance Minister Saifur Rahman presented the budget for 1994-95 and the supplementary budget for the outgoing 1993-94 in the Jatiya Sangsad [parliament] this afternoon. The total outlay of the budget for the next fiscal year divided into revenue and development budgets amounted to 24,637 core taka. The revenue budget shows a surplus of 3,689 crore taka. Revenue receipts for the next fiscal year are estimated at 13,637 crore taka; this is about 11 percent higher than the revised estimate of the current year. Tax revenue will contribute 10,625 crore taka. Nontax revenue is expected to show a healthy rise of 25.5 percent over the revised estimate for the outgoing fiscal year to 3,012 crore taka. Revenue expenditure for 1994-95 is estimated at 9,948 crore taka, which is 8.7 percent higher than the revised figure for 1993-94. Allocations to priority sectors such as education, health and family welfare, irrigation, and flood control have been increased significantly. After adjusting for capital and food accounts, net contribution to the ADP [annual development program] from the revenue budget is expected to be 3,996 crore taka. The voluntary separation program will continue in the next fiscal year, for which 300 crore taka has been provided for. An ADP of 11,000 crore taka has been proposed for 1994-95; this is an increase of 14.5 percent over the revised ADP for the current fiscal year. Taking into account the projects proposed under the Food for Work Program outside the ADP, the total public sector investment will stand at 11,513 crore taka. Thirty-eight percent of the fiscal year's ADP is estimated to be financed from the country's own resources. This clearly demonstrates the present government's success in reducing aid dependency to promote our cherished goal of a self-reliant Bangladesh. Pursuing the government's policy of allocating resources to priority sectors that directly or indirectly contribute to poverty alleviation and human resources development, the proposed budget provided larger funds to several sectors. Of them, education will get 1,556 crore taka, the highest allocation. It is an increase of nearly 60 percent over the current fiscal year. Health and family welfare will receive 20 percent increase over 1993-94 of 893 crore taka. Rural electrification, rural infrastructure, livestock, and fisheries -- the sectors which can fast contribute to economic growth and simultaneously alleviate poverty -- will all get higher allocations compared to the outgoing fiscal year. Social welfare, women, and youth will also have significant increase. The budget has provided 183 crore taka for this sector. The finance minister also placed in parliament the revised and supplementary budget for the outgoing 1993-94 fiscal year. In the revised budget, revenue receipts have been estimated at 12,280 crore taka and the revenue expenditure is 9,150 crore taka. The restraint upon the current expenditure has yielded higher surplus to finance the ADP. The size of the revised ADP has been kept at 9,600 crore taka, which is 18 percent higher than the previous year's revised ADP. The sectors that received additional allocations in the revised ADP are education, 275 crore taka; rural infrastructure, 125 crore taka; rural electrification, 100 crore taka; and roads and highways, 220 crore taka. Besides, an additional amount of 444 crore taka has been provided for the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge. It is important to note that domestic resources are contributing 35.8 percent of the revised ADP, a major step toward economic self-reliance. Spelling the main objectives of the budget, the finance minister said the integral components of the government's broader strategy for the medium term is to achieve a GDP growth rate of around 6 percent, to contain inflation and fiscal deficit, and reduce aid dependence. Other objectives included enhancing mobilization of domestic savings, investments, and promoting self- reliance. He said the government plans to raise the growth rate of GDP to 6-7 percent in the near term while aiming at a double-digit growth before the turn of the century. This would require raising the aggregate level of investment from the present level of 14.5 to 16 percent in the immediate future, eventually reaching 20 percent of the GDP. Mr. Saifur Rahman said the cornerstone of the government's development strategy is to improve the quality and productivity of public investments with emphasis on social sectors. He said the BNP [Bangladesh Nationalist Party] government has entered the fourth year of its term and it is appropriate to take an objective look at the government's performances during these three years. The finance minister said growth rate of GDP has improved; the country is expected to show a modest level of 5 percent growth this year. Turning to the rural economy, he said a quiet revolution is under way and it is not only generating economic growth from new sources but also transforming the composition of production, consumption, and employment. Mr. Saifur Rahman said housing is an important growth sector and the House Building Finance Corporation has been made fully operational to cater to the needs of the people. It is expected to sanction 500 crore taka for house building loans next year. The finance minister announced further incentives for agricultural growth by reducing the prices of kerosene and diesel by one taka per liter and furnace oil by about 3,000 taka per metric ton. The government has further decided to lower the urea fertilizer price by 350 taka per metric ton. The finance minister, while giving details of the fiscal measures proposed in the new budget, said these are primarily aimed at giving relief to the people as well as infuse dynamism in the national economy. He said due care has also been taken to bring about specific structural changes in the taxation system and make it more scientific to (?cope) with the changing global economic scenario. Mr. Saifur Rahman proposed reduction of existing taxes and duties on a large number of essential items, including edible oil, sugar, cotton, and cotton yarn. Taxes were reduced on 148 basic raw materials and 1,024 industrial raw materials, hides and skins, crockery, low-lift pumps, power tillers, medical equipment and appliances, wood and wood products, TV, locally produced construction material, scientific instruments, sports gear, bicycles, telephone equipment, stamp charge on registration of land, and materials used in dairy farms. He also announced a total abolition of duties on the import of improved breed of cattle from abroad. The finance minister has also proposed increase of duties and taxes on a few items to help encourage their increased production in the country. In this connection, he proposed 7.5 percent duty on globe and atlas, 15 percent increase on cut flower, and 15 percent supplementary duty on gray portland cement. He also proposed to raise duty on MS [mild steel] billet from 15 to 30 percent and duty rate on certain tobacco and tobacco products will also be increased, depending on their prices. Passengers traveling abroad would be required to pay 50 taka per head in addition to the existing travel tax. However, all surcharges and levies for Jamuna Bridge have been withdrawn. The finance minister said the new fiscal measures are in the line of the present democratic government's commitment to ensure welfare of the people through the adoption of various pragmatic measures. The new measures will also go a long way in further strengthening of the national economy. He said due to the reduction in taxes and duties in a large number of daily-use [items], the total loss to the national exchequer will stand at 437 crore taka while the new fiscal measures will fetch only 55 crore taka. The finance minister said the shortfall thus created will be met through appropriate administrative measures including intensified drive to realize arrear revenues, curb the propensity of avoidance and evasion through enforcing the existing provisions of law, introduction of computer processing in Dhaka and Chittagong Customs Houses and the income tax offices. Mr. Saifur Rahman, giving an account of the present-day world economic order, said we will have to complete the reform process initiated by the present government. We must also build a political consciousness in favor of these reformative measures which will help the country achieve self-reliance through increased mobilization of domestic resources. The finance minister later introduced the Finance Bill 1994 in an amended form. The bill envisages enforcement of the government's fiscal proposals and amends certain laws. Our parliamentary representatives says President Abdur Rahman Biswas, the chief of the Army and the Navy, diplomats, elites, members of the diplomatic corps, and high civil and military officials were among those present in the Sangsad during the presentation of the new budget by the finance minister. The members of the opposition were, however, absent. The house will meet again on Sunday next [12 June] at 1630 in the afternoon.
