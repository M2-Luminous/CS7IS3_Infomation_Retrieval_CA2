The test will be made on 100,000 volunteers younger than six. The test possibly will concentrate in La Pampa, the province in which the disease has caused more deaths so far. The tests will begin in a few days after the arrival of the vaccine shipments from Cuba. The vaccines already have been approved in other countries like Chile. Moises Spitz, director of the Malbran Institute, which is in charge of making the tests, told CLARIN: "Blood samples will be taken first from those who will be vaccinated, who will be children younger than six for the most part, who are the most badly affected group. There are more doubts about the efficiency of the vaccine at this age. Youths up to 14 years old also will be vaccinated." [passage omitted]
