FBIS4-12508 "drnes069dd_94012" FBIS-NES-94-069 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Islamic Jihad Leader Rules Out Palestinian In-Fighting Islamic Jihad Leader Rules Out Palestinian In-Fighting JN0804191394 Paris Radio Monte Carlo in Arabic 1739 GMT 8 Apr 94 JN0804191394 Paris Radio Monte Carlo Arabic BFN [Interview with Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad Organization, by Sana' al-Imam in Damascus; date not given; from the weekly "The Event" program -- recorded] [Text] [Al-Shaqaqi] First, this military act [the 7 April Ashdod attack] falls in the context of our continuous jihad and struggle against the Zionist occupation. It also falls in the context of our response to the massacres of our Palestinian people, especially the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. It is unreasonable for us to see our people being slaughtered in front of our very eyes and to remain idle. This act of jihad by us also falls in the context of responding to the Oslo agreement. We do not agree that it is a plot to liquidate the Palestine question. We do not hide our objection to this agreement. We do not conceal that we are doing our best to thwart this agreement. [Al-Imam] Mr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, Israel may withdraw from Gaza and Jericho and hand the authority there to the Palestinians or the PLO. In case of your continued resistance and military operations, do you not fear that inter-Palestinian confrontations may take place? [Al-Shaqaqi] First, if it [Israel] really wants to withdraw from Gaza, as you are saying, then there will be no need for confrontations in the Gaza Strip. This is because there will be no Israelis. But if Israelis remain there--army and settlements--this means they will not withdraw. Actually, the Israelis are redeploying their troops in the Gaza Strip. In fact, the future in the Gaza Strip is vague. Nobody, neither Rabin nor 'Arafat, can define the picture in Gaza after one or two months. However, in any case, the Gaza Strip and Jericho do not constitute more than 2 percent of the size of Palestine. This leaves 98 percent of Palestine. We will have the right to confront the occupation anywhere there. Our jihad and struggle will continue in the land occupied in 1948, the West Bank, and Jerusalem. We will do our best to escalate this jihad and struggle. As for the Gaza Strip, as I said, the situation is vague. If there is a real withdrawal, there will be no need for our continued fighting. But if there is no real withdrawal, then it will be our right to chase the remaining occupation--troops and settlers alike. However, I would like to emphasize that our struggle and jihad against the Zionist occupation does not in any way mean that it will collide with any segment of our people. We will not collide with any other Palestinian force. We will do our best to avoid being driven to such a point. I believe that many options are available to us. Such options can spare us such a collision.
