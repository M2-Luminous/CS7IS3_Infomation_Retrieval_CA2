Then the war upset everything and people changed careers. Now 61-year-old Vladimir is the prime minister of the Srpska republic of Bosnia, whose armed forces control 70 percent of the martyrized former republic of Yugoslavia. He agreed to grant L'INDIPENDENTE an exclusive interview in his office, where several telephones with numerous science-fiction-like lines -- a symbol of power in this region -- occupied a conspicuous place. [Beloslavo] Today (yesterday for the reader -- L'INDIPENDENTE editor's note) your militias have entered Gorazde after several months of siege, in open defiance of the UN resolutions which declared the enclave a "safe area"... [Lukic] We do not consider Gorazde a United Nations-protected area, because it was never demilitarized. There are some 12,000 to 15,000 Muslim soldiers over there. What we are involved in is merely a counteroffensive. Our generals have asked the Bosnians to surrender, telling them that their lives will be spared. We want no more massacres. [Beloslavo] What will now happen, following NATO's air raids? [Lukic] If the attacks continue, the Balkans will explode, but I would rather not even think of such a possibility. This is not like the Gulf War. This conflict is different from, and worse than, previous ones. There are many dangerous weapons in Europe, some of which are under control, whereas others are not... [Beloslavo] Are you referring to ultranationalist Russian leader Zhirinovskiy's threats? [Lukic] We cannot take his statements too seriously, but we are not underestimating them either. [Beloslavo] What do you think of Italy's role in making its bases available for NATO's attacks on your positions? [Lukic] Your country took part in the aggression against Serbia, but I see no reason why we should prolong this conflict. We respect your minority in the former Yugoslavia, and some Italians are fighting by our side... [Beloslavo] Italians? Do you mean those trained in Krajina? [Lukic] I am not speaking only of the Garibaldi Battalion, but of many who lived and worked in Trieste or other Italian towns, and who have returned to fight where they were born. [Beloslavo] So, no missiles will be launched against Italy? [Lukic] If it were not for the bases, we would not even send a carrier pigeon in your direction, you would have nothing to fear. But you know very well that there are hardly any nations by now that do not have aircraft or missiles which can be used against neighboring countries, without distance being any problem. [Beloslavo] Is it true that you also bear the Vatican a grudge? [Lukic] We have made our criticism known for the Vatican's support of sanctions against Serbia, and also for having favored the former Yugoslavia's dissolution in several ways. Recently we have received a number of different signals, which make us hope that relations will improve. [Beloslavo] Are you asking for the head of UN troops commander in Bosnia General Rose? [Lukic] It is true that we can no longer sit at the same negotiating table as the person who ordered the air attacks. [Beloslavo] Are therefore hopes of peace becoming flimsier? [Lukic] The result of the adventure attempted by the United States, which aimed to create a Croatian-Muslim federation in Bosnia excluding the Serbs, was to eventually pave the way for NATO's aggression. In such a situation, we cannot talk of peace.
