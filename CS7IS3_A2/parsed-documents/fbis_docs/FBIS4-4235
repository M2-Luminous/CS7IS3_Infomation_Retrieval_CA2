"We have achieved initial success in curbing price rises, mainly as a result of the greater controls over prices and the market at the central and local level," the State Statistics Bureau's spokesman Ye Zhen said. He said the momentum of rising prices had been effectively curbed in March and the rate of increase in prices of services, industrial raw materials and consumer products had gone down "remarkably". Official figures showed that retail price inflation in China's 35 major cities was 24.5 per cent in March, compared with 25.9 per cent m February. Rural inflation dropped by a 10th of a percentage point from 20.9 per cent recorded in February, Mr Ye said. However, a Western diplomat said it "was too early" to declare victory, pointing out that a slight drop in prices could be attributed to a number of factors, even minor seasonal differences. "Inflation is still a major problem in China this year. We are keeping a close watch on it. "It remains unclear whether prices will continue to go down in April," he said. A mainland economist argued that bringing inflation under control was an "uphill battle". "It's been clear that many localities are unable to keep inflation within the levels set by the central Government. The only positive indication is that the central Government has really attached significance to tackling the problem and is determined to control it. The crux will still be the tightening of money supply. It depends on whether China can curb fixed-assets investments and stop bailing out those state firms who are facing heavy losses," he said. The retail price index rose by 20.1 per cent across the nation in the first quarter of this year. Last year's annual inflation was 13 per cent. Mr Ye said the rate of increase was still far ahead of the official target of keeping annual inflation within 10 per cent this year. He blamed the rapid rise of prices at the beginning of this year on the lack of effective macro-economic control and supervision over prices. Others had taken advantage of new tax reforms to increase prices illegally, said the official. He called on all sectors to maintain strict control over prices, adding that there should never be complacency. The price surge in food, clothing and other necessities had already provoked fierce reaction from the public, he said. Mr Ye's optimism was shared in a forecast by the China Materials Information Centre, carried in yesterday's China Business Daily. It cited reasons such as a balance in supply and demand of most goods as well as curbs on hoarding and speculative activities.
