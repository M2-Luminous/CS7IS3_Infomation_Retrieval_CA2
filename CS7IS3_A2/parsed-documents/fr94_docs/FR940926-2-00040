FR940926-2-00040 FR940926-2-00036 GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Federal Government Intercity Telecommunications Services; FTS2000 Contracts; Notice The Federal government currently satisfies its intercity telecommunications services through the Federal Telecommunications System 2000 (FTS2000) contracts. The existing FTS2000 contracts will expire in 1998. As a part of the continuing, open discussion related to the post-FTS2000 provision of telecommunications services to Federal government users, the government hereby advises interested parties of the following opportunities to participate in this discussion. The government will release a report entitled, ``Analysis of Post-FTS2000 Acquisition Alternatives'' on or about September 26, 1994. The report states the goals of the Post-FTS2000 acquisitions; provides a preliminary definition of the scope of the Post-FTS2000 acquisitions; describes the acquisition strategies being considered; summarizes the status of the government's analysis; and solicits views and comments from all interested parties, such as public, industry, academia, and other government agencies, that will assist the government in determining the Post-FTS2000 acquisition strategy most advantageous to the government. This report was prepared, as a framework for further study, by the Acquisition Working Group, a subcommittee of the Interagency Management Council. At present, the government plans to make the report available for public viewing in the General Services Administration Bid Room, located at 7th and D Streets, SW, Room 1701, Washington, DC 20407 on or about September 26, 1994. The report will be electronically accessible via the Internet in one of two methods. Files may be downloaded electronically via anonymous FTP from post.fts2k.gsa.gov under the /pub directory. Files may also be pursued (and downloaded) and full-text searches may be made via a World Wide Web client (such as Mosaic) by accessing our home page, whose URL is http:/ /post.fts2k.gsa.gov/. The government will accept written comments on the report, through October 17, 1994. Comments may be submitted to the General Services Administration, Attention: Concept Development Record, c/o The MITRE Corporation, 7525 Colshire Drive (STOP Z397), McLean, VA 22102.
