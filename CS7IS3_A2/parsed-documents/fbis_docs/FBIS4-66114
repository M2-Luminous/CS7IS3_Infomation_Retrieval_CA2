He did not elaborate. After a series of meetings with his European counterparts here, Previti told reporters the foreign policy of the new Rome government is aimed at having Italy "catch up" on all fronts, "diplomatic and military-humanitarian." He said Italy is still "available" should the UN decide to ask for Italian peace-keepers in Bosnia and claimed that Italian Armed Forces "are capable of responding to calls for peace-keeping operations" around the world, as they have in Somalia, Mozambique and Lebanon. Following in the footsteps of his three predecessors, Previti, too, announced that the Italian Armed Forces will be modernized and trimmed down, becoming smaller and more efficient.
