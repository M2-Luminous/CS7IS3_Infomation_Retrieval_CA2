FR941206-0-00041 FR941206-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement 30 CFR Part 906 Colorado Regulatory Program AGENCY: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior. ACTION: Final rule, approval of amendment. SUMMARY: OSM is approving, with one exception and additional requirement, a proposed amendment to the Colorado regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Colorado program''), as administered by the Colorado Division of Minerals and Geology (hereinafter referred to as the ``Division'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment pertains to bonding and revegetation success standards. The amendment revises the Colorado program (1) to be consistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations and (2) to improve operational efficiency. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas E. Ehmett, Telephone (505) 766&hyph;1486. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background on the Colorado Program On December 15, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Colorado program. General background information on the Colorado program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval can be found in the December 15, 1980, Federal Register (45 FR 82173). Subsequent actions concerning Colorado's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 906.15, 906.16, and 906.30. II. Proposed Amendment By letter dated April 18, 1994, Colorado submitted to OSM a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative record No. CO&hyph;611). Colorado submitted the proposed amendment in partial response to a March 22, 1990, letter (administrative record No. CO&hyph;496) that OSM sent to Colorado in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(c), and at its own initiative. The provisions of the rules of the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Board at 2 Code of Colorado Regulations 407&hyph;2 that Colorado proposed to revise were: Rule 1.04, definitions; Rule 3.02, performance bond requirements for surface coal mining and reclamation operations; Rule 3.03, release of performance bonds; Rule 3.06, special bonding requirements for construction of mine drainage control facilities; and Rule 4.15.10, revegetation success criteria for areas to be developed for industrial, commercial, or residential use. OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the May 13, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 24998), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. CO&hyph;617). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended June 13, 1994. During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns or requested clarification regarding Colorado's (1) Rule 3.03.1(2)(b), concerning requirements for the demonstration of productivity on prime farmlands prior to phase II bond release, and (2) Rule 4.15.10(3), concerning a variance from the requirement for living ground cover the control erosion for mine support facilities located within areas where the premining and postmining land uses are industrial or commercial. OSM notified Colorado of the concerns by letter dated July 12, 1994 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;631). Colorado responded in a letter dated July 28, 1994, by submitting a revised amendment and additional explanatory information (administrative record No. CO&hyph;635). Colorado proposed revisions to and additional explanatory information for Rules 3.02.1(3)(b) and 4.25.5(3)(a), concerning the criteria for bonds released on prime farmlands, and Rule 4.15.10(3), concerning a variance from compliance with the requirement for living ground cover to control erosion specifically for mine support facilities located within areas where the premining and postmining land uses are industrial or commercial. Based upon the revisions to and additional explanatory information for the proposed program amendment submitted by Colorado, OSM reopened the public comment period in the September 1, 1994 Federal Register (59 FR 45250; administrative record No. CO&hyph;643). The public comment period ended on September 16, 1994. III. Director's Findings
