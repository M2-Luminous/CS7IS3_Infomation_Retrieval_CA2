The report by the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Japan said that while 22.5 percent of Japanese overseas investment in the previous survey period, which covered 14 months, went to Europe -- including Turkey and the successor states to the former Soviet Union -- Europe's share this time shrank to 20.7 percent. Europe will remain an important investment market, however, the survey forecasts. "The drop in investments is not caused by a declining interest (in Europe) or lesser competitive pressure among Japanese enterprises, but reflects a certain investment saturation and the current economic slump," it said. As in previous years, Britain received the lion's share of Japan's European investment, some 2.95 billion dollars, followed by the Netherlands with 1.45 billion dollars, Germany with 769 million dollars, and France with 456 million dollars. Of a total of 538 investments, some 378 or 70.8 percent were in the manufacturing industry. Car production ranked top with 92 investments, followed by the electronics industry with 89 projects, and the chemical and pharmaceutical industries with 54. Japanese companies concentrate their investment activities on those sectors where the Europeans hold a substantial market share, such as environmental technology, chemicals and pharmaceuticals as well as car manufacturing, the survey says. In response to an increasing international pressure on Japan to cut its trade surplus, the high yen and stricter regulations on local content, Japan's internationalization will continue, the survey predicts. "Taking into account that a relatively low 7 percent of Japan's production occurs abroad compared with 25 percent for the United States, another investment offensive might just be a matter of time," it said.
