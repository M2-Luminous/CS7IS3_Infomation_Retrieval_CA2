The Council of Ministers also debated a bill that amends the Central Bank Law by reducing the amount of credit the bank can extend to the Treasury and to the public sector. The Council of Ministers met under Prime Minister Tansu Ciller for two and a half hours last night. After the meeting, State Minister Aykon Dogan made a statement on the issues discussed. He pointed out that the Council of Ministers debated a bill drafted by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security amending the law on civil servants unions and on their right to sign collective wage agreements and stage strikes. He said that the Council of Ministers decided to give the bill its final form at the next meeting and to conclude the work on the bill. Dogan said that the Council of Ministers also discussed a bill that amends the Central Bank Law by reducing the amount of short- term advance loans the bank can extend to the Treasury, as well as the amount of credit it can extend to the public sector. He stressed that this bill is a very serious step toward a situation in which public financing is conducted by secure sources outside the Central Bank. In this way, he said, the Turkish lira will eventually become a currency that is sought after once again. Dogan stated that the Council of Ministers also debated decrees aiming at increasing exports and increasing foreign exchange revenues and opened them to signature. He explained that the decrees invoke measures by which exports will be supported more strongly and systematically within the general rules of GATT and international trade. The state minister pointed out that the Council of Ministers also decided that the new financial sources needed by the commercial sector will be allotted to Eximbank. With this decision, Dogan said, exports are expected to gain a new dynamism in the coming season. Aykon Dogan stated that $17.5 billion are expected in export revenues in 1994. Next year, he added, this will cover the current accounts deficit, which is more than $5 billion this year. The state minister also announced that the Council of Ministers decided to reduce the value added tax on hotel and restaurant services in tourist installations, except for nightclubs and bars, from 23 percent to 15 percent.
