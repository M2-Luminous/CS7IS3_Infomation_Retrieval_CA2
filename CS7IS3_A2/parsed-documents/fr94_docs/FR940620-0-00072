FR940620-0-00072 FR940620-0-00026 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Parts 73 and 74 [MM Docket No. 93&hyph;114, FCC 94&hyph;120] Radio Broadcast Services; Low Power Television Service; Application Acceptance Standard; Four-Letter Call Signs AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission amended its rules governing the low power television (LPTV) service in three respects. First, the Commission relaxed its strict acceptance standard for new and major change applications. Second, the Commission expanded the waiver policy regarding terrain shielding. Third, the Commission will now permit LPTV operators to request four-letter call signs with the suffix ``LP'' rather than the current five-character call signs consisting of letters and numbers. The Commission declined to adopt a proposal to narrow the definition of what constitutes a major LPTV station modification, stating that this issue requires further consideration and will be resolved at a later date. A summary of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking initiating this proceeding may be found at 58 FR 25,794 (April 28, 1993). EFFECTIVE DATES: The revisions to §§73.3564 and 73.3591 relieve existing restrictions and as such, they are exempt from the effective date requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1), and will become effective June 20, 1994. The revisions to §73.3522 will become effective August 19, 1994. The revisions to §§73.3550, 74.780, 74.783 and to the Commission's terrain shielding policy in the LPTV service will become effective August 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Keith A.

On April 22, 1993, the Commission released its Notice of Proposed Rule Making in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;114, 8 FCC Rcd 2770 (1993). In the Notice , the Commission proposed to amend the rules and policies governing the low power television (LPTV) service, which includes LPTV stations and television translator stations. Specifically, we proposed to modify our current standard for acceptance of applications and to expand our waiver policy regarding terrain shielding. We also proposed to permit LPTV operators to use four-letter call signs rather than the current five-character call signs consisting of letters and numbers. These proposals raised little disagreement among commenters and are adopted in this First Report and Order . In addition, the Notice proposed to narrow the definition of what constitutes a major LPTV station modification. That issue generated significantly more diverse comment and requires further consideration. It will be resolved at a later date so as not to delay implementation of the changes we adopt herein. Application Acceptance Standards 2. In the Notice , the Commission noted that the volume of LPTV applications has decreased and the quality of those submissions has improved as a result of the strict standard requiring that an LPTV applicant be ``complete and sufficient'' ( i.e ., ``letter perfect'') at the close of an LPTV filing window. 1 We pointed out that currently, applications that are not letter perfect are returned, forcing applicants to wait until the Commission opens a subsequent filing window to correct their submissions. See 47 CFR 73.3564(a)(2). The Notice concluded that the strict standard has achieved its purpose of encouraging applicants to submit complete and carefully prepared applications, so as to alleviate the LPTV application backlog with which the Commission was faced. We therefore proposed that applications be judged on a ``substantially complete'' basis similar to that used in processing full-power television applications, whereby applications are considered acceptance if they are not patently defective. As an alternative to the substantially complete standard, the Notice suggested a mid-level acceptance standard requiring the application to be more than substantially complete but less than letter perfect. 1 Applications for LPTV construction permits and major changes to existing LPTV facilities are accepted during finite filing windows by the Commission. 3. The commenters in this proceeding, who include LPTV licensees, consulting engineers, other broadcasters, law firms and educational institutions, overwhelmingly support adoption of a relaxed standard for acceptance of applications. They agree with the Notice that the letter perfect standard is no longer necessary due to the decreased volume of LPTV applications. They also assert that the letter perfect requirement unfairly forces LPTV applicants filing defective applications to wait to refile in the next filing window, which sometimes does not open for a year. Further, commenters assert that a relaxed standard is more appropriate in light of the limited resources of most LPTV applicants.
