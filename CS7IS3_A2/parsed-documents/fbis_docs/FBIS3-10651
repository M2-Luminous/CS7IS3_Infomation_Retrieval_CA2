In his second race for president of the Republic, Brizola is preparing himself to leave the governorship on 2 April and take up what he describes as "the most overwhelming discourse since 1964." Interviewed by JORNAL DO BRASIL, Brizola for the first time acknowledged that he is a candidate, admitted the PDT's [Democratic Labor Party] isolation in the field of national political alliances, and explained that his reserve is part of a strategy: "My candidacy represents a duty to the party. We will not follow the conventional rules. We will seek to unite all Brazilians against everything there is." Brizola added: "I even believe it will be possible for a candidate to challenge everything, win in an unconventional way, and still achieve a majority in Congress. So you can see what kind of plans I am making." In Brizola's opinion, "the people united, without politicians," could repeat the upset victory of the presidential system during the plebiscite, when most party leaderships favored a parliamentary system. Brizola thinks that for the PDT to run with its own candidate as a third option -- after the PT [Workers Party] and the anti-PT faction -- it is more important to assemble "strong and austere tickets in all states" than to seek leadership alliances. The governor said that the economic plan and the movement around Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy have encouraged him to run and show voters that everything "is just one more manipulation of the economy for electoral purposes." "The plan did not attack the most important causes of inflation, the financial system or banks, which need to be better supervised," Brizola attacked, giving advance notice of one of his hottest campaign issues. He denied any concern over the high rejection rate of a Brizola government. "The stronger the wind, the higher the eagle can fly," he answers. At 72 and in his third term as governor, Brizola still believes he can run as a candidate of renewal. He bets that this time the people will learn about and compare the candidate's backgrounds. "Brazil is like a ship that has sprung a leak and cannot be handled by an inexperienced sailor," Brizola said. "In order to overcome the crisis we need renewal, the promotion of new people. That can be accomplished only by a candidate from outside, a candidate who is not moving in the contaminated climate of politicians of which the people are tired," the governor said, trying to justify his isolation. He was discouraged about the possibility of getting support from the small PC-B [Communist Party of Brazil] and the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party] of Miguel Arraes, with which the PDT is trying to form an alliance. "We would like that, but it seems that the PC-B will join the PT. Arraes is also leaning that way to strengthen his candidacy in Pernambuco." Brizola said he was not surprised. He compared himself with Getulio Vargas, recalling that "Communists were against Vargas in 1954 but changed their minds following his suicide, when they saw the people burning communist newspapers and attacking the multinationals." Brizola characterized his candidacy as "a duty to the party" and promised to dedicate more time to it than he did 1989. "In 1989 I did not run to win. It was just training." Brizola ruled out the possibility of joining the PT at some point during the presidential campaign. He treated Lula [Luis Inacio Lula da Silva] with the virulence of a person attacking his number one enemy. "The euphoria of the past elections did not permit us to see that neither one of the two candidates were fit to rule. I will tell Lula to his face, the first time I see him, that only an ignorant person would vote for someone who does not have the minimum administrative experience, and who has spent four years without working, traveling at the party's expense. Why doesn't he go back to his lathe? Perhaps he finds that demeaning," Brizola fired. Asked about his activities during the period he was out of public office, between 1986 and 1990, he said that he spent that time working as "a rural producer" at his Uruguayan ranch. If Lula is his number one enemy, Fernando Henrique Cardoso seems to be number two. Brizola characterized the minister's possible presidential candidacy as "a color balloon, not of the kind that people let go of during the Sao Joao celebration, but of the kind that only exist on television screens." "Cardoso is a toucan [nickname for Cardoso's party, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, PSDB] with a lot of feathers, a ballroom bird who will not withstand the campaign heat."
