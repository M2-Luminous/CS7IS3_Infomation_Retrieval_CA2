Sun said that the Taiwan businessmen were impressed by their prospects in the Hungarian market, mainly because of the low rate of inflation here. But he admitted that the Hungarians were reticent to do more business because of their concerns about the relatively high cost of Taiwan products and the time it takes for them to be delivered, which can be up to three months. He said that until the Taiwan companies feel assured of the reliability of doing business with the Hungarian importers through Hungarian banks, the time of delivery would be a sticking point between the two sides. Another group of Taiwan business representatives will visit Hungary in June, Sun said. That delegation will include Taiwan importers as well as exporters, he stressed. In reciprocation, Hungarian manufacturers will have a chance to sell their wares in Taiwan when they participate in the Taipei International Trade Fair in October.
