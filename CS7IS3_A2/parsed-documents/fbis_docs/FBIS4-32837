Monica Baltodano, after being elected a member of the National Directorate, said that "some decisions regarding the operation of the Sandinist bloc will be made." Baltodano, who is characterized by maintaining radical positions, added that the congress did not discuss a motion making "the Sandinist Assembly the body responsible for appointing the head of the Sandinist bloc." Baltodano said that "the head of the Sandinist bloc should be a member of the National Directorate [DN]." Ramirez, the current bloc leader, was purged from the DN. Rumors that the removal of Ramirez from the DN could be just another Sandinist trick to "clean his image" to be a presidential candidate intensified today. If he wins, Daniel Ortega and his people would join Ramirez in sharing power as in the eighties. The two Sandinist newspapers today redoubled their support for Dr. Ramirez despite his defeat in the party's internal elections, and this seems to be a significant development. Dr. Ramirez, who headed a current that opposed Ortega, tendered his resignation yesterday to the plenary of the Sandinist parliamentarian bloc, but it was not accepted. "We rejected Ramirez' resignation and ratified him unanimously," said Dora Maria Tellez during a news conference. Sandinist sociologist and economist Oscar Rene Vargas told BARRICADA yesterday that there will reportedly be purges within the FSLN. Vargas quoted "Democratic Left" spokesman Julio Lopez as saying that the following will be purged: BARRICADA Director Carlos Fernando Chamorro, EL NUEVO DIARIO Deputy Director Dr. Danilo Aguirre Solis, and Sandinist bloc leader Dr. Sergio Ramirez. Alejandro Serrano Caldera, rector of the UNAN [National Autonomous University of Nicaragua], will reportedly be replaced by Javier Pichardo. "The appointment of the Sandinist bloc leader has so far been an internal election," Baltadano said, suggesting that the Sandinist Assembly will intervene in the affairs of her party's parliamentarian bloc. "If the Sandinist Assembly has received the mandate of electing, from among DN members, the secretary for organization and the secretary for international relations and propaganda, with much added reason the Sandinist Assembly will have a much greater role in the leadership of the Sandinist bloc," she added. William Ramirez said yesterday, during a news conference in which Sergio Ramirez was ratified as bloc leader, that the bloc has its own internal rules. "There is no need to be a member of the DN or member of the Sandinist Assembly to become bloc chief, deputy chief, or member of a bloc committee," William Ramirez added. He pointed out that Dr. Sergio Ramirez was not a DN member when he became leader of the parliamentarian bloc. At the special congress, Sergio Ramirez followers obtained 30 percent of the Congress delegates' votes compared to an overwhelming 70 percent obtained by Ortega's supporters.
