The Ukrainian delegation headed by Vice-Premier Valentin Liandik reaffirmed the intention here on Tuesday during its meeting with officials from Russian gas giant Gazprom. At present the debt amounts to more than 600 million dollars. The bulk of it is for supplies in 1993. Liandik said it will be paid off in accordance with a scheme worked out in March 1994. 50 per cent of it will be paid off with financies and 50 per cent with equipment, mainly pipes and compressors. During the negotiations, the parties signed an accord on storage of 10 billion cubic metres of Russian gas in two underground depots in Ukraine. It will allow to have enough gas reserves for export in winter. Another accord specified that Russian natural gas will be dried on the Ukrainian territory to meet export qualifications. The parties agreed to set up working groups within next months. The groups will work out terms of privatising Ukraine's undeground depots, sections of pipilines and seaport facilities. The next meeting of the delegations is scheduled for 10 May in Kiev.
