Among other things, it was said that the politician lost consciousness in the accident last night and he does not remember what happened. His cervical vertebra and one of his wrists are broken. His mind is clear, and neurological changes still cannot be found. Peter Juhasz's interview follows. [Begin recording] [Juhasz] Dr. Zoltan Katona, director of the county hospital. How is Mr. Horn at the moment? [Katona] His condition is satisfactory and reassuring, thank you very much. He spent last night peacefully. The broken bones were fixed during the night. No complications have occurred. According to our expectations, he might get up on Wednesday [11 May], or so. [Juhasz] It means that he might even leave the hospital, does not it? [Katona] Yes. However, the question of whether he will return straight to his home or, perhaps, to an institute in Budapest for a few-day observation, has to be discussed with him and doctors who will carry out the check-ups later. [Juhasz] How are his two colleagues? [Katona] His companion had to be operated last night, because a part of his skull was crushed, therefore some bits of the fractured scull had to be removed. The occurance of his indisposition accompanied by fainting has become less frequent. His condition is satisfactory. The car driver has broken his arm, which is currently being operated on. He and Horn's companion can presumably leave the hospital by the end of next week. [end recording]
