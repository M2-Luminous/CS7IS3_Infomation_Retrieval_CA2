FR940627-0-00021 FR940627-0-00008 Section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) 3 generally requires that a rule is to be effective not less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register unless good cause is shown to shorten the time period. Because the final rule continues some of the reporting requirements from the existing rule, a gap between the termination of the old requirements and the implementation of the new could result in a loss of information. 4 Rather than preventing this regulatory gap by requiring pipelines to undertake expedited implementation of the final rule in Docket No. RM94&hyph;6&hyph;000, the Commission finds it preferable to extend the current reporting requirements for only one month, until July 31, 1994, which will correlate with the August 1, 1994 effective date of the new regulations. 3 5 U.S.C. 553(d). 4 In a motion filed May 20, 1994, Indicated Companies (Conoco, Inc., Amoco Production Company, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, GPM Gas Corporation, Marathon Oil Company, Meridian Oil, Inc., Natural Gas Clearinghouse, Pennzoil Exploration and Production Company, Pennzoil Petroleum Company, Pennzoil Gas Marketing Company, Phillips Petroleum Company, Shell Gas Trading Company, Union Pacific Fuels, Inc., Vastar Resources, Inc., and Vastar Gas Marketing, Inc.) noted the potential for a regulatory gap and requested that the Commission act to prevent it. Hadson Gas Systems, Inc. filed an answer in support and the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America opposed the motion. IV. Environmental Analysis The Commission is required to prepare an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement for any action that may have a significant adverse effect on the human environment. 5 The Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from these requirements as not having a significant effect on the human environment. 6 The action taken here falls within the categorical exclusions provided in the Commission's regulations. 7 Therefore, an environmental assessment is unnecessary and has not been prepared in this rulemaking. 5 Order No. 486, Regulations Implementing the National Environmental Policy Act, 52 FR 47897 (Dec. 17, 1987), FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles 1986&hyph;1990 Â¶30,783 (1987). 6 18 CFR 380.4. 7 See 18 CFR 380.4(a)(2)(ii), 380.4(a)(5). V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) 8 generally requires a description and analysis of final rules that will have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The regulations extend the reporting requirements on interstate natural gas pipelines. Since these pipelines are not small entities, the regulations will not have significant economic impact on small entities. Thus, pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, the Commission hereby certifies that the regulations proposed herein will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 8 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612.
