The appeal said that in March 1994 the situation in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict had worsened sharply and continued to deteriorate. The Ingush leadership blames the Ossetian side and believes that the work to "heighten tension in the region is well organised and guided." A crowd twice stopped an Ingush funeral procession which headed for the cemetery in the village of Krasta in the Prigorod district of North Ossetia on Wednesday. The arrival of Vladimir Lozovoy, head of the temporary administration, and four generals did not stop them from attacking the procession with stones. Many were injured, several cars were damaged. Meanwhile, the North Ossetian parliament extended on Thursday the state of emergency in the Prigorod, Pravoberezhniy and Mozdok districts for another two months. No decision to this effect has been adopted by the Russian president or the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's parliament, so far.
