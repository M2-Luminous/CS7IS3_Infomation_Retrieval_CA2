After carpet fibers and yarns, followed by textile yarns, Rhone-Poulenc and the Italian company SNIA (Fiat group) are pooling their efforts in the field of advanced polyamide plastics. Their 50-50 subsidiary, Nyltech (800 people, sales of 1.2 billion francs [Fr]) will rank third in Europe, behind BASF [Baden Aniline and Soda Factory] and DuPont. The European advanced plastics market represents 700,000 tons, and polyamides account for one half of that. Their characteristics (resistance to impact and high temperatures) favor their use in automobile (underhood parts) and electrical (circuit-breakers, switches) engineering. These are weighty sectors where large manufacturers--like Valeo (automobile equipment) or Legrand (electrical equipment)--look for suppliers of a size commensurate with theirs and offering products suitable for their specific applications. The product lines of SNIA and Rhone-Poulenc complement each other (one offers polyamide 6, the other polyamide 66), which precisely will enable them to broaden their offers to automobile equipment manufacturers. No Rationalization in Sight The creation of a joint-venture with a bare-bones structure should also reduce overheads and improve the profitability of this activity, which suffered from the slump affecting the European automobile industry. On the other hand, no rationalization is expected for the time being. The new entity will have four production plants: those of SNIA at Ceriano Laghetto, Italy, and Manchester, New Hampshire (United States); those of Rhone-Poulenc at Saint-Fons (Rhone) and in Taiwan. It will also inherit Longma, a joint-venture that the French group just set up in China, near Shangai: a bridgehead for future expansion in Asia. It will also have two development centers, at Saint-Fons and at Freiburg (Germany). The two companies have already formed two joint-ventures: Novalis for polyamide carpet fibers and yarns, and Nylstar for textile fibers. This third partnership proves that collaboration goes on satisfactorily. Another sign is Fiat's (symbolic) acquisition of an interest in Rhone-Poulenc. Polyamides account for one half of the sales of Rhone-Poulenc's fibers and polymers branch (which amounted to Fr11.2 billion last year). The three partnerships cover about 50 percent of its polyamide activities. The two companies, however, may not be able to carry their collaboration any further! Rhone-Poulenc also produces industrial yarns and is integrated upstream, which is not the case of SNIA.
