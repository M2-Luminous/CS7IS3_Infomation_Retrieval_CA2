"In order to cut the funds for defense factories, the government-approved state defense contracts would have to be revised," he said. Kokoshin said that the Defense Ministry needed nearly Rbs 28 trillion for purchases of military hardware in 1994 while the Finance Ministry was prepared to allocate one fifth of that amount. He said that the Defense Ministry would press for its needs, in particular through the State Duma. He added that the ministry "had appropriate instructions on this score from the president and the prime minister." Kokoshin listed numerous reasons for the shortage of funds in his ministry, notably slow restructuring of Russian industry, the need for it to maintain a large social role for its employees and low demand for the civilian production of converted defense factories. He said that defense production proper accounted for as little as 20 percent of the defense industry's output and there were no customers for the remaining 80 percent. "For this reason aircraft, ships, locomotives so needed by the railroad ministry and tank-trucks are stockpiling," he emphasized.
