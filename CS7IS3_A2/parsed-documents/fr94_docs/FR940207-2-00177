FR940207-2-00177 FR940207-2-00080 2. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement will better enable the Fund to meet the competitive demands of today's financial services industry. Under the multi-class arrangement, an investor will be able to choose the method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial given the amount of his or her purchase, the length of time the investor expects to hold his or her shares, and other relevant circumstances. The proposed arrangement would permit the Fund to facilitate both the distribution of its securities and provide investors with a broader choice as to the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment risks. 3. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the rule 12b&hyph;1 plans (and any Shareholder Services Plans adopted in the future) in the manner described is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. In addition, applicants assert that such arrangements should not give rise to any conflicts of interest because the rights and privileges of each class of shares are substantially identical. 4. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement does not present the concerns that section 18 of the Act was designed to address. The multi-class arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares of the Fund. The multi-class arrangement does not involve borrowing, nor will it affect the Fund's existing assets or reserves, and does not involve a complex capital structure. Nothing in the multi-class arrangement suggests that it will facilitate control by holders of any class of shares. Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of the Series, and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of a Series will relate solely to: (a) The impact of the disproportionate payments made under the distribution plans and any Shareholder Services Plans; (b) the method of allocating certain Class Expenses which are limited to (i) transfer and shareholder servicing agent fees and shareholder servicing costs, (ii) professional fees relating solely to one class, (iii) trustees fees, including independent counsel fees, relating solely to one class, (iv) printing and postage expenses for materials distributed to current shareholders, (v) Blue Sky and SEC registration fees, (vi) shareholder meeting expenses, and (vii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order; (c) the fact that the class will vote separately with respect to any matter specifically affecting that class, including without limitation rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plans and Shareholder Services Plans, except as provided in condition 16; (d) the different exchange privileges of the classes of shares; (e) designation of each class of shares of the Series; and (f) certain classes that impose a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee may be able to convert to a class with a lower rule 12b&hyph;1 fee.
