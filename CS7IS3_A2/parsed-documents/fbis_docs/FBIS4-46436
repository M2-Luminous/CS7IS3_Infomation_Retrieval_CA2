[passage omitted] "This is not an isolated incident. It is just a link in the chain which started with the death of Vedat Aydin and continued with the killing of Muhsin Melik, the founder of the People's Democracy Party," HADEP Chairman Murat Bozlak said Monday. "The government is under an obligation to find the murderers, especially since it was reported to officials that the three men had gone missing," he added. "The state is under suspicion until it finds those responsible." Buldan and his two companions were allegedly taken into custody by a group of policemen outside Istanbul's Cinar Hotel. The persons who apprehended them reportedly showed their police identification cards and then took the three men away in unmarked cars, according to the personnel of the Cinar Hotel who witnessed the incident. DEP Acting Chairman Remzi Kartal, meanwhile, appealed to President Suleyman Demirel "to find those who are responsible for the killings." "The government, the Parliament and the media are insensitive. We do not have anywhere to turn," Kartal said.
