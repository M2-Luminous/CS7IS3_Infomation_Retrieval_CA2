FR941227-2-00118 FR941227-2-00082 Appendix A to This Document_Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206 I. Introduction On December 31, 1992, Mr. Paul M. Blanch (the Petitioner) filed a Petition with the Executive Director for Operations, pursuant to Section 2.206 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR 2.206), in which he requested that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) impose immediate enforcement action against Rosemount for a knowing and intentional failure to submit, as required by 10 CFR Part 21, a notice to the Commission that ``basic components supplied'' to its customers ``contained defects,'' as defined by 10 CFR 21.3. On March 2, 1993, the Petitioner sent a letter to the NRC in which he stated, in part, that he ``was requesting enforcement action against Rosemount for failing to report defects as required by 10 CFR 21,'' and making ``a simple request that [the NRC] investigate a potential cover-up and a failure to report a defect in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 21.'' On March 28, 1994, the Petitioner filed a second Petition in which he requested that the NRC inform all users of Rosemount 1150-series pressure transmitters and series 510 and 710 DU trip devices of ``significant safety problems'' identified in NRC Inspection Report 99900271/93&hyph;01 (which addressed principally the NRC staff inspection of Rosemount's 10 CFR Part 21 and Appendix B to 10 CFR Part 50 established programs), and that the NRC take ``prompt and vigorous'' enforcement action against Rosemount for careless disregard of the reporting requirements of 10 CFR Part 21. In a letter dated May 2, 1994, the Petitioner reiterated his request that the NRC take action to inform all users of Rosemount 1150-series pressure transmitters and series 510 and 710 DU trip devices of the ``significant safety problems'' identified in NRC Inspection Report 99900271/93&hyph;01, By letters dated February 2 and April 7, 1993, in response to the Petition of December 31, 1992, and letter of March 2, 1993, the NRC staff stated that the request for immediate action was denied because the actions it had already taken to address the problems with Rosemount transmitters were sufficient to ensure that the problems did not constitute an immediate safety concern for any nuclear power plant. The NRC staff also stated in those letters that, as provided by 10 CFR 2.206, action would be taken on the Petition within reasonable time. By letters dated April 25 and June 3, 1994, in response to the Petitioner's letters of March 28 and May 2, 1994, the NRC staff stated that the NRC inspection report was included in the April 1994 publication of NUREG&hyph;0040, 1 ``which is sent to all nuclear power plant licensees,'' 2 and that none of the identified issues were considered significant enough to warrant immediate notification of the nuclear industry. 1 NUREG&hyph;0040, ``Licensee Contractor and Vendor Inspection Status Report,'' is distributed to NRC licensed facilities, manufacturers, suppliers, architect engineer firms, nuclear steam supply system suppliers and is publicly available at NRC public document rooms, National Technical Information Services (NTIS) and through the Government Printing Office (GPO) sales office. 2 Subsequently, NRC staff identified the NUREG&hyph;0040 was not distributed to ``all nuclear power plant licensees'' as stated to the Petitioner by letter dated April 25, 1994, because of an NRC staff error that was made concerning the NUREG&hyph;0040 distribution process. Therefore, the NRC staff directed in October 1994 that Inspection Report 99900271/93&hyph;01 be sent to all power reactor licensees and construction permit holders. NRC staff has verified that the distribution of the inspection reports was completed. In regard to the Petitioner's second request,``to take prompt and vigorous enforcement action against Rosemount for careless disregard of 10 CFR Part 21 requirements,'' the Petitioner was informed in the April 25, 1994, letter, that ``[t]he NRC will make its determination as to enforcement action, [against Rosemount] should such enforcement action be warranted, following the enforcement conference.'' The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) has granted these Petitions in part. Specifically, pursuant to the ``General Statement of Policy and Procedure for NRC Enforcement Actions'' (Enforcement Policy), 10 CFR Part 2, Appendix C, a Severity Level II notice of violation was issued to Rosemount on November 15, 1994. On the basis of the conclusions and findings in NRC Office of Investigations (OI) Investigation Report 4&hyph;90&hyph;009, dated November 12, 1993, in NRC Inspection Report 99900271/93&hyph;01, and NRC staff deliberations on a Rosemount presentation of its relevant information regarding the Rosemount pressure transmitter sensor cell oil-loss problem during the enforcement conference on June 23, 1994, the NRC staff concluded that Rosemount acted in careless disregard of 10 CFR Part 21 requirements and its own procedures by failing to adequately evaluate or to inform its customers of the potential for degraded transmitter operation as a result of the oil-loss problem.
