Saudi Arabia would like to correct the trade imbalance, expand scientific cooperation, and increase the number of joint ventures. The thorny issue of prices of pharmaceutical goods is still a subject of discussion. The two delegations consisted not only of representatives of various ministries, but also members of chambers of trade. On the Swiss side, there were also representatives of those industrial branches interested in entering the Saudi market. Saudi Arabia has emerged as a very keen consumer of Swiss products in recent years. Swiss exports to Saudi Arabia have increased from 859 million Swiss francs in 1990 to 1,491 million in 1993. Forty percent of these exports consist of jewelry, or 50 percent when one includes watches. Chemical products and machines are also major Swiss exports to this country. On the other hand, imports from Saudi Arabia have sunk dramatically. In 1990 they still amounted to 540 million francs, but in 1993 they only reached a level of 275 million. Ninety percent of Saudi Arabia's exports to Switzerland consist of gold and crude oil. Delamuraz expressed Switzerland's concern for more Saudi imports, and gave an assurance that there were no quantitative restrictions on exports outside the agricultural sphere. The Saudis mentioned the possibility of increased exports of petrochemical products to Switzerland, but Delamuraz said that Switzerland's market potential for such goods was rather small. At the end of 1993 there were 21 industrial joint ventures involving Swiss capital in Saudi Arabia, plus another 19 joint ventures in the services sector. The Saudi delegation expressed its interest in an expansion of this cooperation, and suggested possible projects in the food, chemical, and plastics sectors, and in the production of instruments. These cooperation possibilities are to be discussed in greater depth at a special seminar in Geneva attended by representatives of Swiss private industry. In this connection, Federal Councilor Delamuraz recalled the usefulness of concluding an agreement on the protection of investments and on avoiding double taxation, and invited his guests to commence appropriate negotiations with Switzerland. The Saudis were interested in scientific cooperation in, among other things, the electrical industry and in railroads. The ongoing difficult debate on the subject of prices of pharmaceutical goods was summarized, and referred to a separate commission for further talks. Until now, the Swiss factory prices of these goods, without the profit margins of pharmacies and wholesalers, have been used when setting prices in Saudi Arabia. In the future, the Saudis want to work out an average price on the basis of prices in 42 different countries, and apply this average price in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis explained this intention last year at a meeting in Basel. The Swiss pharmaceutical industry representatives criticized this method as administratively cumbersome and insufficiently representative, because the list of drugs involves too many countries and provides too little information. On its part, the Swiss delegation suggested that instead of calculating prices of drugs on the basis of the prices in 42 countries, these prices should be calculated on the basis of prices in just seven countries whose economic performance is similar to Saudi Arabia's. Swiss drug manufacturers want to be certain that the prices of pharmaceutical goods exported to and sold in Saudi Arabia are sufficient to contribute to the costs of the manufacturer's research to an extent that befits the economy of an oil-producing country.
