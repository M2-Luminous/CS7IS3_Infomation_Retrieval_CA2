"The Khmer Rouge are making further inroads into government areas". "The Royal Cambodian Armed Forces are demoralised after two heavy defeats". These are some of the headlines on news items churned out by the international press. Hence, the question on everyone's lips is: Is Cambodia safe? Is it wise to travel to Phnom Penh? Is it not a dangerous place where banditry is rampant and security is virtually nonexistent? The answer lies very much on what the media reports. In this case, sadly, it is the negative aspects of life in Cambodia. As the adage goes, it is news when man bites dog but it isn't when dog bites man. In this Kingdom, sensationalism is the key word as far as most journalists are concerned. Journalists, largely western and even some locals, just thrive on the negative aspects of news reporting. There is no bright side as this either is not worth the paper it is typed on or will not be used by the international media. Each day, private business deals are being clinched, both with the government or with major local business houses. Road restoration projects are seen while some form of sanity is slowly but surely returning to the city. Given this situation, it may seem wise for the international media to harp on fighting which is taking place three to four hundred kilometres away. They give innuendos that the city itself and the Royal Government might come under siege as a result of recent battlefield victories by the recalcitrant Khmer Rouge guerilla faction. The same incident, for example a mortar attack on Heathrow airport, only managed a single column in some newspapers. Negative news on this nation is blazed on the front page of newspapers, particularly in a neighbouring country. However, the positive side is seldom reported or heard of. Week after week, press conferences at the Ministry of Information is often monopolised by certain journalists intent only on getting more details on the Khmer Rouge. Questions evolve around this guerilla faction so much, it has even been said that press briefings are for an insight into the Khmer Rouge, not other aspects of this nation as the press conference is intended for. For the nation to shrug off this negative image, attitudes must change, both within the government machinery, the public and in neighbouring countries. If one were to recall, a neighbouring nation which had faced the same situation as this nation approximately 30 years ago, roped in the media to wage a psychological battle against the terrorists. The media, the common people and the government were one in this battle. The government propaganda machinery went on the offensive to win the hearts and minds of the masses. Negative reporting about terrorists attacks were played down while business, investment and government projects and activities were highlighted. This should be a useful lesson for the Royal Government and the powers that are in this nation. The masses restored democracy with the assistance of the international community. The Government owes it to the masses and with the undivided assistance and co-operation of the masses, it can certainly reverse the negative battlefield disasters and highlight the increasing number of businesses waiting to kick off. This would be the start of better things.
