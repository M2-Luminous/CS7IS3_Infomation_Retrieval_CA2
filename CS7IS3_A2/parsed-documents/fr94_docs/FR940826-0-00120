FR940826-0-00120 FR940826-0-00020 I. Introduction 1. By this action, we respond to petitions for reconsideration or clarification of the rules and policies adopted in the Second Report and Order in this proceeding, which sets forth general rules for the use of competitive bidding to award licenses. 1 Twenty-one such petitions were received, as well as eight oppositions and five replies. 1 Second Report and Order, PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, 9 FCC Rcd 2348, 59 FR 22980, May 4, 1994 (Second Report and Order). 2. On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the Budget Act) added Section 309(j) to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. ยง309(j). 2 Section 309(j) gives the Commission express authority to employ competitive bidding procedures to choose among mutually exclusive applications for initial licenses. The Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding on September 23, 1993. 3 The Second Report and Order prescribing the required regulations was adopted on March 8, 1994. The Commission has subsequently adopted specific rules for auction of narrowband Personal Communications Service (PCS) licenses, 4 Interactive Video and Data Service (IVDS) licenses, 5 and broadband PCS licenses. 6 2 See, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, 47 U.S.C. 309(j)(3)(B). 3 Notice of Proposed Rule Making in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, 8 FCC Rcd 7635, 58 FR 53489 (Oct 15, 1993), ( NPRM ). In the First Report and Order in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;32, released February 4, 1994, 59 FR 09100 (Feb 25, 1994), ( First Report and Order ), the Commission prescribed transfer disclosure requirements with respect to licenses awarded by random selection. 4 Third Report and Order in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, 9 FCC Rcd 2941, 59 FR 26741, May 24, 1994 ( Third Report and Order ). 5 Fourth Report and Order in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, 59 FR 24947, May 13, 1994 ( Fourth Report and Order ). 6 Fifth Report and Order in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;178, 59 FR 37566, July 29, 1994, adopted June 29, 1994, released July 15, 1994 ( Fifth Report and Order ). 3. The Second Report and Order established rules for determining what types of services and licenses may be subject to auctions. The Second Report and Order also set forth a range of auction designs and procedures, from which the Commission stated it would choose in establishing procedures for awarding licenses in specific services. The Second Report and Order addressed a variety of procedural issues regarding announcement of auctions, filing of applications, bidder and licensee qualifications, payment requirements, and penalties for default or disqualification, as well as safeguards to deter possible abuses of the bidding and licensing process. In response to statutory directive, the Second Report and Order also identified provisions designed to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by women or members of minority groups (designated entities) are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services. 4. In many cases, the appropriate auction procedures and rules vary from service to service. In the Second Report and Order we retained the flexibility to choose, from within a defined range, the appropriate procedures for particular services, depending on characteristics of the service such as the likely value and interdependence of the licenses being auctioned and the capital required to construct a system. We also retained the flexibility to alter our procedures in response to our experience with different auction techniques. 5. We dispose of all but two of the petitions for reconsideration of the Second Report and Order in this Order. We defer consideration of Brown and Schwaninger's petition concerning Finder's Preferences. We plan to issue a Further Notice addressing the applicability of Finder's Preferences to auctionable services in the near future, and we will consider Brown and Schwaninger's petition in the context of that Notice. We also defer to a future Order consideration of MCI's petition concerning auctioning of BETRS licenses. 6. The issues raised in the petitions for reconsideration fall into three categories: those dealing with the applicability of competitive bidding to specific services and particular circumstances, those dealing with auction design and procedures, and those dealing with the definition of the groups eligible for special provisions (the ``designated entities'') and the nature of these provisions. We consider issues raised by these petitions below. II. Applicability of Competitive Bidding A. Cellular Unserved Areas 7. Two cellular systems operate on separate frequency blocks in each cellular market. 7 The geographic areas not covered after five years by the initial licensees are considered cellular ``unserved areas'' that are licensed separately. In 1991, we adopted random selection procedures to govern licensing of the cellular unserved areas, 8 and stated that we would revisit this decision to use lotteries if Congress authorized Commission use of competitive bidding procedures. 9 As noted above, competitive bidding authority was in fact enacted in 1993. 10 7 The Domestic Public Cellular Service is governed by Part 22 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR Part 22. 8 See First Report and Order and Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration , CC Docket No. 90&hyph;6, 6 FCC Rcd 6185, 56 FR 58503, Nov 20, 1991. 9 Id. at 6217. 10 See Budget Act, 107 Stat. 387&hyph;392.
