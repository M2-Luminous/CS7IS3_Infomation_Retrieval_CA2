Differences on five out of the 12 points were settled by the Constitutional Act Commission. The plenary session later added the finishing touches and accepted the decisions. Oscar Kambamba Kasungu has details on the proceedings. [Begin recording] [Kasungu] [Words indistinct] constitutional draft texts are being debated upon one by one in line with the wish expressed by the commission on 7 March. Thus, the High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT] settled five out of the outstanding 12 points at the 8 March plenary session. They include Article 107 on the Bank of Zaire, which stipulates that the Bank of Zaire is the country's Central Bank. It is the issuing bank and monetary body, the state's cash controller, and the government's economic, financial, and monetary adviser. Another issue discussed was Article 113b on the revision of the Constitutional Act, which must be approved by more than half the members of the HCR-PT and the government. With regard to the appointment of regional governors and deputy governors, Article 46, which has been amended, stipulates that they will be appointed and dismissed by the head of state through a system of balanced power sharing. Article 47, which stipulated that governors and deputy governors were appointed by decree has therefore been scrapped. The gendarmerie, the civilian guard, and the security services come directly under the government's jurisdiction. The government is also in charge of state management but is accountable to the High Council of the Republic on that. There will be cooperation with the head of state on national defense and the diplomatic sector. Appeals and contentions should be regulated by decree as stipulated in Article 83. Some councillors were displeased with the postponement of the 7 March session, so the HCR- PT chairman gave reasons for the postponement. [Monsengwo] We are making an effort to proceed by consensus if possible. There are certain issues which can be solved through majority or minority votes, but there are, indeed, others which cannot be solved that way. This is why I would like to appeal to councillors to let us try and understand one another as much as possible, avoid frustrating each other, and avoid blunders which could jeopardize not only the serenity of our debates, but also the progress of the HCR-PT. Above all, let us avoid those things in the interest of the nation. [end recording]
