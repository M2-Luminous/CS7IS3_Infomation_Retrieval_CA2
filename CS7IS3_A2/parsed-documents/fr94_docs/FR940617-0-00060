FR940617-0-00060 FR940617-0-00011 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner 24 CFR Parts 207, 213, 221, and 242 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1723; FR&hyph;3603&hyph;F&hyph;01] RIN 2502&hyph;AG19 Disposition of Fire and Hazard Insurance Proceeds AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule revises certain provisions in HUD regulations covering multifamily mortgage insurance which have the effect of requiring prior HUD endorsement before the expenditure of any fire and hazard insurance loss proceeds by mortgagees. Instead of this requirement the regulations would be revised to allow loss proceeds to be expended to restore or repair the property without prior HUD approval. The proceeds may not however, be used for any other purposes without prior HUD approval. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Tahash, Planning and Procedures Division, Office of Multifamily Housing Management, Room 6182, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410, voice (202) 708&hyph;3944, TDD (202) 708&hyph;4594. (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under existing HUD regulations (24 CFR 207.260) in the event a loss occurs to the mortgaged property under any policy of fire or other hazard insurance and the mortgagee has received the proceeds therefrom, it shall not exercise its option under the mortgage to use the proceeds of the insurance for the repairing, replacing, or rebuilding of the premises, or apply them to the mortgage indebtedness, or make any other disposition of the proceeds without the prior written approval of the Commissioner. Through cross-referencing this requirement is also made applicable to other FHA multifamily programs i.e. Part 213 Cooperative Housing Mortgage Insurance, Part 220 Mortgage Insurance and Insured Improvement Loans for Urban Renewal and Concentrated Development Areas, Part 221 Low Cost and Moderate Income Mortgage Insurance, Part 231 Housing Mortgage Insurance for the Elderly, Part 232 Mortgage Insurance for Nursing Homes, Intermediate Care Facilities, and Board and Care Homes, Part 234 Condominium Ownership Mortgage Insurance, Part 236 Mortgage Insurance and Interest Reduction Payments for Rental Projects, Part 241 Supplementary Financing for Insured Project Mortgages and Part 242 Mortgage Insurance for Hospitals. This rule revises current regulatory requirements to provide that the mortgagee may exercise its option to use the insurance proceeds for the repairing, replacing or rebuilding of the premises without prior HUD approval. It may not however make any other disposition of insurance proceeds without prior approval. The Department has found that its Field Office staff resources can be more effectively allocated to tasks other than the endorsing of property insurance loss drafts where the proceeds, in any event, are going to be used to restore or repair the property. We estimate that from $10,000 to $20,000 per year in staff resources could be saved by making this change. Mortgagees could have similar savings (from reduction of paperwork and check cashing steps) of from $5,000 to $10,000 per year. Project owners also could have savings. Approximately 20,000 project owners, their mortgagees and their insurance agents and companies should benefit by eliminating this unnecessary procedural step.
