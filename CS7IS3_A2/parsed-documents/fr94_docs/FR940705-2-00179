Certification of Host-Vector Systems A host-vector system may be proposed for certification by the NIH Director in accordance with the procedures set forth in Appendix I-II. In order to ensure protection for proprietary data, any public notice regarding a host-vector system which is designated by the institution as proprietary under Section IV&hyph;E&hyph;5-a will be issued only after consultation with the institution as to the content of the notice. Section IV&hyph;E&hyph;4. Requests for Exemptions and Approvals Requests for exemptions or other approvals as required by the NIH Guidelines should be submitted based on the procedures set forth in Sections I through IV.

Section IV&hyph;E&hyph;5. Protection of Proprietary Data Section IV&hyph;E&hyph;5-a. General In general, the Freedom of Information Act requires Federal agencies to make their records available to the public upon request. However, this requirement does not apply to, among other things, ``trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is obtained from a person and that is privileged or confidential.'' Under 18 U.S.C. 1905, it is a criminal offense for an officer or employee of the U.S. or any Federal department or agency to publish, divulge, disclose, or make known ``in any manner or to any extent not authorized by law any information coming to him in the course of his employment or official duties or by reason of any examination or investigation made by, or return, report or record made to or filed with, such department or agency or officer or employee thereof, which information concerns or relates to the trade secrets, (or) processes_of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association.'' This provision applies to all employees of the Federal Government, including special Government employees. Members of the RAC are ``special Government employees.'' In submitting to NIH for purposes of voluntary compliance with the NIH Guidelines, an institution may designate those items of information which the institution believes constitute trade secrets, privileged, confidential, commercial, or financial information. If NIH receives a request under the Freedom of Information Act for information so designated, NIH will promptly contact the institution to secure its views as to whether the information (or some portion) should be released. If the NIH decides to release this information (or some portion) in response to a Freedom of Information request or otherwise, the institution will be advised; and the actual release will not be made until the expiration of 15 days after the institution is so advised except to the extent that earlier release in the judgment of the NIH Director is necessary to protect against an imminent hazard to the public or the environment. Section IV&hyph;E&hyph;5-b. Presubmission Review Any institution not otherwise covered by the NIH Guidelines, which is considering submission of data or information voluntarily to NIH, may request presubmission review of the records involved to determine if NIH will make all or part of the records available upon request under the Freedom of Information Act. A request for presubmission review should be submitted to NIH/ORDA along with the records involved to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. These records shall be clearly marked as being the property of the institution on loan to NIH solely for the purpose of making a determination under the Freedom of Information Act. NIH/ORDA will seek a determination from the responsible official under DHHS regulations (45 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 5) as to whether the records involved, (or some portion) will be made available to members of the public under the Freedom of Information Act. Pending such a determination, the records will be kept separate from NIH/ORDA files, will be considered records of the institution and not NIH/ORDA, and will not be received as part of NIH/ORDA files. No copies will be made of such records.
