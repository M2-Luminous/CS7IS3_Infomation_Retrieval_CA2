Consul-General Withdrawn BK2303063494 Quezon City Radio Filipinas in English 0230 GMT 23 Mar 94 BK2303063494 Quezon City Radio Filipinas Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] President Fidel V. Ramos on Tuesday directed Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. to formally withdraw from the Commission on Appointment the nomination of Tomas Gomez III as consul-general to Los Angeles (L.A.), California. The president issued the instruction after Gomez, former press secretary of ex-President Corazon C. Aquino, asked him to withdraw his nomination during a 30-minute meeting with the president. Gomez said in a letter he gave to President Ramos, and I [broadcaster] quote, the Commission on Appointments developments concerning my going to Los Angeles have become untenable and it appears that I may have become a liability to you when the least I could do is not to add to the burden that the president already has. It was evident that the foreign affairs community is not at all bothered that its very own constitutional process has been knowingly mocked and abused by a witness who lied under solemn affirmation, unquote, or Gomez, at the second statement, was referring to Dr. Carlos Manlapaz who accused Gomez of making anti-Ilocano statements. The former press secretary stressed he has not asked to be posted to Los Angeles. It was Secretary Roberto Romulo's suggestion, the foreign affairs secretary, that he accepted his posting which he [Romulo] recommended to the president.
