These new trends among `Taiwan independence' elements are attracting the attention of the CPC, and high-level CPC officals are taking strong positions. If the situation gradually spins out of control, many people say that there is the possibility that Beijing might ultimately use force to resolve the `Taiwan independence' issue. Unification of China has been the CPC's intent all along. After 1949, for more than 20 years, the slogan `We must definitely liberate Taiwan' was shouted; however, out of concern for various factors such as the international situation, military strength, weaponry, public cooperation, and economic strength for support of a war, Beijing was continuously unable to achieve this goal. After 1979, the CPC, using a posture of peace to conduct the war of unification, did not again resurrect the `Liberate Taiwan' slogan, but rather advocated `One Country, Two Systems,' allowing the Kuomintang [KMT] to retain its army; however, the CPC did not move toward renouncing the use of military force against Taiwan. CPC senior statesmen all hope to be able to see China unified during their lifetime, and it is reported that Deng Xiaoping has ordered Jiang Zemin to pay attention to `Taiwan independence' activities and not take them lightly, so if `Taiwan independence' succeeds, it could become an excuse for the CPC to use military force against Taiwan. CPC Military Capabilities Reorganized and Improved In recent years, the PLA has undergone `reduction and reorganization,' in which troop strength has been reduced somewhat; however, due to the introduction and use of new types of weapons, combat effectiveness has increased. Development of the PLA Navy is what the leadership is focusing on: Functionalizing nuclear submarines, mass production and constant improvement of guided missile destroyers and escorts, equipping of units with new anti-ship and ship-to-air guided missiles, organizing and establishing a marine corps, and construction of a research platform and military outpost far off the mainland in the Spratly Islands. All of this reflects the CPC's intention to completely develop its navy. New Trends in the PLA Navy, Army and Air Force Units are already being equipped with 35-Series conventionally powered torpedo submarines, the successor to the 33-Series submarine (a copy of the Soviet Romeo-class sub). This submarine is slightly larger (2407 tons submerged displacement) than the 33-Series, submerged speed is slightly faster (18 knots), and can possibly carry onboard Chinese-built Sturgeon-1 or -2 acoustic homing torpedoes. The successor to the 051-Series (Luda-class) guided missle destroyer has also been built and distributed to units. The new destroyer's displacement is approximately 4,000 tons and it is equipped with eight YJ-8 surface-to-surface guided missiles, a point defense surface-to-air missile, shipboard artillery, 75-Series 12-tube 204 mm anti-submarine depth-charge launching rocket gun, is equipped with a helicopter launch/recovery deck and hangar, and may carry Z-9 helicopters. The Navy air force possesses H-6D bombers that can carry YJ-6 air-to-surface missiles and Q-5 attack planes that can launch YJ-8 air-to-surface missiles. Air Force equipment has also been updated, but it is said that, overall, compared to Western nations, it lags 20 years behind. After the sweeping changes in the Soviet Union, Russia is already fulfilling the CPC's early 1991 order for the purchase of Su-27 Flanker heavy-duty fighter aircraft. It is reported that the CPC purchased, and as of early 1992, was accepting delivery of, a total between 28 and 70 Su-27's. The Army suffered a personnel cutback during the `reduce and reorganize' campaign, but only a portion of those affected were from important newly-fielded units, so the result was an increase in efficiency; in addition, many units were equipped with technologically advanced weapons. For example, the 79-Series main battle tank, the 85-II main battle tank which is in the midst of production, the 501-Series (copy of the Soviet BMP) infantry fighting vehicle, the 523-Series wheeled armored personnel carrier, many new types of artillery, multiple rocket launchers, and engineering equipment. In particular, the establishment of an Army air corps, along with the rest has greatly enhanced the mobility and combat effectiveness of the ground forces. New Developments in the Combat Strength of Taiwan's Armed Forces This past year, Taiwan has concentrated on improving the capability of the weapons and equipment of its armed forces. In particular, on the Navy side, with the technological assistance of the United States, Taiwan has already built its first Perry-class improved model guided missile escort (known in Taiwan as a `frigate'), purchased 16 Lafayette-class frigates from France (only purchasing the hulls, with the Taiwanese themselves outfitting the vessels with weaponry), purchased mine sweepers from Germany, and in addition, with the recent acquisition of Netherlands-built `Gailiang Qiyu' (Improved Flagfish)-class submarines and `Yang' destroyers, the Taiwanese Navy's ability to wage war on the seas has not decreased at all. Speculation Over the Chinese Communists' Use of Force Against Taiwan If the Chinese Communists really use force against Taiwan, it is estimated that they will first blockade Taiwan by sea and air. Because the Russian military threat against the Chinese Communists has been greatly lessened, most of the main body of the Chinese navy can be withdrawn to execute the task of blockading Taiwan. How will the United States react to this possibility? This will attract much attention. Perhaps diplomatically the U.S. Congress will impose political and economic sanctions against the Chinese Communists. However, even during the armed confrontations between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits in the 1950s and 1960s, the United States did not interfere by sending troops. It is estimated that today's United States would not interfere either, by sending troops. Once the Chinese Communists send troops, Taiwan can only fight against the blockade single-handedly. Submarine Mines Are the Weapons That Cause Headaches to Taiwan Military If compared in the quality of weapons and the qualifications of personnel, the navy and air force of Taiwan are in a slightly advantageous position. In the area of anti-submarine warfare, though the Chinese Communist navy has more than 100 submarines, it is estimated that only about one half of them can be put into use during the initial stage of fighting while the rest will remain in a state of maintenance or refitting. Moreover, among the usable submarines of the Chinese Communist navy, the Type 33 are the mainstay. This kind of submarine emits loud noise which can be easily detected by the other side's anti-submarine sonar. For some of the submarines, the original advantage of "surprise attack" has been lost. Weapons used by Type 33 submarines are torpedoes and mines. The torpedoes' range is 10,000 meters and most of them are direct charge and do not have directional guidance. The mines, however, are the weapons that cause headaches to the other side, and can play a big role in destroying the other side's shipping, and in blockading ports. Taiwan's navy has only four submarines, namely the Sea Dragon, Sea Tiger, Sea Lion, and Seal. But two of them are much improved and they voyage quietly with little noise. In addition, they are equipped with excellent sonar systems and guided torpedoes. Their overall performance is far above the Type 33 submarines, and also superior to the Type 35 submarines. However, it is impossible for only two advanced submarines to cope with the general situation. Before Perry and Lafayette destroyers can be put into service, the Yang destroyer will have to single-handedly shoulder the main naval tasks. Though the destroyer has advanced weapons and equipment, it is too old, and in anti-blockade confrontations it will have to deal with both submarines and numerous warships on the sea. It will not have the capability. The Chinese Communists' Fighting Force on the Sea In the area of sea warfare, the Chinese Communists can probably use 12 of their 20 destroyers (while at least two of the rest will patrol the Spratly Islands, two will stay in the Yellow Sea, and the other three Type 7 Anshan class will undertake blockading tasks). Forces that will collaborate with the destroyers will include all the forces of the East Sea Fleet, some of the South Sea Fleet, and a convoy ship of the North Sea Fleet. The total number may reach 20. The Chinese Communists' destroyers and convoy ships have powerful sea warfare capabilities. They are equipped with cruise missiles including the Seagull I-A (HY-IJ on Type 51 ships, and Shangyou I-A SY-IJ on Type 53 Jianghu class ships), and Seagull Attack 8 (YJ-8/C-801 on the Type 53H2 Huangshi frigate). Both the Seagull I-A and the Shangyou I-A belong to the Soviet Minghe [phonetic] missile type. They can easily be subject to intervention and prone to being off-target, or even to being shot down. But "Seagull Attack 8" is similar to the French "Flying Fish," and is the kind of missile that flies over the water and is hard to detect and stop. The warships of the Chinese Communists are very likely to be deployed with Type 21 type Yellow Bee [Huang Feng] missiles. The Chinese Communists possess more than 100 fast attack craft, each equipped with 4 Shangyou missiles. But, due to the short range of this type of ship, the Chinese Communists may use warships to haul fast attack crafts out to the sea to fight when the opportunity arises. This will reinforce the sea combat capability of the Chinese Communists. On the other hand, Taiwan's Yang destroyer group and Mountain convoy ship group will have to face sufficient attacks from many types of missiles, and damages suffered will certainly be enormous. Contending for Air Domination The air force of the Chinese Communists lacks long range capabilities and also lacks air refueling capabilities. Therefore, it may not be able to effectively dominate Taiwan's skies, the east coast in particular. So, the Chinese Communists may use submarine mines to blockade Taiwan's east coast, and use the air force to blockade the south, north, and west coasts. The Chinese Communist fighter planes that can endure relatively long flights are the J-8 I (only a few J-8 IIs are in service). But their performance is not very good. In general, the quality of Taiwan pilots is superior to that of the Chinese Communist air force. Furthermore, Taiwan's F-5E fighters presently in service have been developed with the Soviet Mig-21 as the enemy (while the main force of the Chinese Communist fighters is still the J-7, an imitation of the Mig-21, and the J-6, an imitation of the Mig-19. However, the number of fighter planes of the Chinese Communists is far greater than that of Taiwan. Moreover, the production capability of the Chinese Communist aviation industry is far greater than that of Taiwan. If an air war breaks out between the two sides, even if the air force of the Chinese Communists has to sacrifice three to four fighters to destroy one of Taiwan's, by the time Taiwan has lost all of its air force, the Chinese Communists will still have plenty that can be used. At that time the planes of the Chinese Communists can even join forces against warships and land troops. At that time Taiwan will have no air force at all. Taiwan Relies on Imports for Raw Materials and Oil, It Is Hard for Its Economic Lifeline To Survive Long-Term Blockading The native land of Taiwan is short of resources. Most of its raw materials for production and oil are imported. Its economic lifeline also depends upon export trading. If Taiwan is to be blockaded for some time, Taiwan's survival will be threatened, and the military personnel and the ordinary people in Taiwan will waver. Of course, it is extremely unfortunate if a civil war breaks out in a country. In recent years, relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits have been relaxed. There have been frequent exchanges of commerce, investment, and visits. If Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong can be united, their actual strength and achievements will attract attention world-wide. If a civil war breaks out again between the Kuomintang and the Communists, it will be a big tragedy. The idea of "Taiwan Independence" is absolutely unacceptable and unfeasible. We hope that the Taiwan government will not be keen on Taiwan independence and will resolutely deal with the activities to split national territory by the Democratic Progressive Party. We also hope that Beijing will cherish peace as most important and let a situation continue in which peace develops between the two sides.
