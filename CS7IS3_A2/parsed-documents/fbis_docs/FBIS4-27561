The ministry will soon offer a compromise proposal to the Home Affairs Ministry, which, along with local governments, has urged the introduction of a local consumption tax. Currently, the state government collects all consumption tax revenues and distributes 20 percent of revenues to autonomies. Under the Finance Ministry proposal, the same proportion of income from the consumption tax will be collected by municipalities and then pooled and distributed according to population and consumption levels. Introduction of a local consumption tax is one of the focuses in the planned tax system overhaul the government plans to work out by late June. The Finance Ministry initially opposed the idea but has conceded in the face of mounting calls for the need to boost the financial base of local governments. Its proposal is slightly different from that of the Home Affairs Ministry, which requested that Japan's 47 prefectures collect the tax and the money gathered be distributed in accordance with the number of workers in each prefecture. If the Finance Ministry's plan is accepted, the share of revenues for such major cities as Tokyo and Osaka will be much smaller than the original plan because many people who work in the major cities live outside city limits.
