FR940304-2-00163 FR940304-2-00085 [Release No. 32698A; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;10] Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change; Correction February 28, 1994. In FR Document No. 93&hyph;18600, beginning on page 41539 for Wednesday, August 4, 1993, several sentences were incorrectly stated. The sentences below should be changed to clarify that the Series 7A Examination is applicable to floor members whose public business is limited to accepting orders from professional customers for execution on the trading floor. The first change below, however, should be made so that the sentence correctly cites the language deleted from the proposal. The first sentence of footnote 3 in Column 1 on page 41540 is corrected to read `` The NYSE deleted ``generally'' from Rule 345, Interpretation .02 in order to clarify that the intent of the proposed interpretation is that the Series 7(a) Examination is applicable to floor members engaged in public business with professional customers.'' Column 1, page 41540, 8th line after the heading ``I. Proposal'' insert the word ``public'' after the word ``accept''. Column 2, page 41540, the 13th line add the word ``public'' to the end of the line after the word ``whose''. Column 1, page 41541, 23rd of line of the second full paragraph remove the word ``solely'' from the last sentence before the heading ``IV. Conclusion''. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
