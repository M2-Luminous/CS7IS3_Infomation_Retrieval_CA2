According to her latest remarks, after returning from Shanghai to Beijing, Deng Xiaoping, 90, is "a bit fatter" than before. He still plays bridge three or four times a week. He also reads newspapers for over two hours. Deng Rong stressed that Deng Xiaoping need not rely on others when reading newspapers, neither does he have to use any supplemental tools, such as a magnifier. Deng Rong said: "His eyes are always very good. He is not myopic and he is particularly good when looking at things far away. However, he has to wear presbyopic glasses. He has worn glasses for more than a decade. My father watches television programs every night, but he is not so good in hearing what others say, so we have to act as his `hearing aid'." Deng Rong said: My father has a very regular diet and he normally will not eat too much or too little. Now, he is also concerned about our family's food. If he eats more, he will be "praised" by our family members. He is a bit fatter after his return to Beijing. In Beijing, he mainly eats cooked wheaten food, whereas in Shanghai, he mainly ate rice. When asked about Deng Xiaoping's hobbies, Deng Rong said: "My father is fond of playing bridge and he can play three or four times a week. He always plays with my sisters, my elder brother, and some old bridge partners who have already retired." Summing up her father's secret of longevity, she said that apart from leading a regular life, there was also an important factor, that is, "he is particularly sanguine and is always cheerful." She said: "Someone described him as taking serious things lightly. Without this characteristic, it would have been very difficult to get over the decade of the Cultural Revolution." Deng Rong, who claimed to stay with her father everyday, said that she did not sense any change in her father's health and that she always felt that her father was very healthy. She said: The most important point is that he is healthy, and right now, he does not catch any disease." When asked about her progress in writing the second part of her book, My Father, Deng Xiaoping, she said that the table of contents had been fixed. She did not agree that it must be more difficult to write the second part than the first part "because I am writing about my father from a daughter's viewpoint."
