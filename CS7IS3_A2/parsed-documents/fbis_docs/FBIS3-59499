[WEULE] That is incorrect. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] But the rumor is still not off the mark. Small cars were taboo at Mercedes Benz previously. [WEULE] Still, it is not possible to slip the development of a complete automobile past upper management. But there have already been similar instances in the history of our firm. For example, the designers once created a second design paralleling their official job and they caught upper management by surprise with it. But today that is no longer necessary. Since then we have gotten a management culture that is receptive enough to innovation. If the employees are innovative, they are encouraged. Back to the small car. Our research has been constantly at work on small cars over the past 15 years. Basically, it is not a novel subject for us. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Not infrequently, companies stifle creativity forcing employees to cobble together innovations clandestinely. What is going wrong at the core of German innovation? [WEULE] We are not starving. Essentially, we have an excellent basis with well-educated personnel. Few industrial countries in the world enjoy this to the same extent. Even compared with the Americans and the Japanese we need not worry that we do not have enough clever, knowledgeable, and capable individuals. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] But innovative products bring others on the market. [WEULE] There is a general problem underlying that. Not only researchers, but we Germans have grown lethargic about our successes. Developments take too long. They are too expensive and often they are not market-oriented. We lack the unqualified resolve and readiness to take on the risk to very rapidly transform our know-how into products that offer an opportunity to succeed. We also lack the will for both internal and all encompassing dialog to manage the transformation as efficiently as possible. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] So, as you see it, the Germany economy's waning innovativeness is not a matter of resources but primarily a mental and cultural problem? [WEULE] Exactly. Here is just one example. In the Daimler company, the difficulty confronting us is that the researchers of the individual corporate sectors have developed their own world. The result was a not-invented-here syndrome. No one felt duly responsible. In order to do away with that, we have come up with something we call integrated R&D management. If our researchers and developers are pondering a new car, they straightaway call in marketing personnel and product experts. In this way, the researcher becomes acquainted with market requirements and stumbling-blocks to production. After the get-together they return to their divisions with definite objectives and work together through goal-oriented networking. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Has there not been any resistance to this cultural revolution? [WEULE] Sure. In fact, we had to exert pressure with definite formulations and a new form of budgeting. But now, those directly impacted are enthusiastic. Only middle management still has problems with it off and on. But bottom-up and top-down pressure will also solve this problem. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] You are pretty much out on a limb with this integrated approach. According to a current poll, only four percent of German companies make use of simultaneous management tools. [WEULE] Then that study is portraying yesterday's world of industrial research. I know very many colleagues in research and they are all in the same processes as ourselves. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] So then, it is not all that bad. [WEULE] Wrong. Nothing is accomplished with a new orientation just in industry. We have to accomplish the same in the large government sectors. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] So the government again gets the blame? [WEULE] In our country, the problem is that we lean back greatly relieved and always with very smug looks on our faces when we attend to the ratio of R&D spending to gross social product that is approximately 2.7 percent. My quarrel then is continuously with economists and politicians. Of the total DM80 billion going to the R&D sector, only a small portion is actual research. The lion's share goes for development, that is, towards safeguarding markets, now and in the immediate future. We do not give much thought to the larger future. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] How much do you estimate that share to be? [WEULE] No one knows for sure. I estimate that altogether in industry fewer than DM5 billion go for actual research. This is where we fundamentally diverge from the Japanese and the Americans who give considerably more attention to this sector. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] So then, the problem is of a pecuniary nature. Industry and government allocate too little money for research. [WEULE] Not really too little, but frequently misdirected. There are outstanding scientists occupying positions in the Max-Planck or Fraunhofer Societies and in large research facilities. The government invests exorbitantly large amounts in them, about DM26 billion each year. It is my opinion that the resources that federal and state governments allocate to them have to be focused more intensively on the interests of industry. I dare question whether, absent a clear commitment with industry, for example at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center, DM40 million should be allocated for a hard x-ray source. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] There is no one at all in Karlsruhe who questions it. [WEULE] See, the cultural dilemma of faulty communication reveals itself again in this case. Everyone in our country should be expected to wonder who your customer is, why you are doing that. In industry we work hard at such customer orientation and I expect the same of a researcher of the Max-Planck Society or of a large research facility. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] As the saying goes: who really is interested in the work I do? [WEULE] More so: who profits from it? If the researcher sees that he is working in a void, I would expect him to reorient himself. I am quite willing to admit that industry also has to open up to this more earnestly. This is a source of reproach for it. In the past, there was a great temptation to misuse government funding in many different way. For instance, for political influence peddling, for satisfying regional interests, for nurturing personal research hobbies. We can no longer afford any such use of funding. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Would central coordination modeled on Japan's MITI help? [WEULE] I doubt it. It does not square with our way of thinking. We need three things in this situation: first, a consensus on the common goals of research; second, operational networks in which such goals can be tackled; and, third, quality assurance for research. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Is not that a bit much all at once? [WEULE] Actually, radical change is already under way. For example, in Germany, in the production engineering sector, we occupy a prominent position. To safeguard this position, we have encouraged Daimler-Benz to get specialists across all disciplines thinking about the shape of the future in this field so as to bring relevant research to bear on it. In the spring we held an initial workshop on this at the federal research ministry. This was the first time such deliberations are being conducted not in isolation but in coordination wit the Federal Ministry for Research and Technology [BMFT] and academia. It is a process with a well-defined timetable and precise milestones. The industry group will meet in early November for a concluding vote. In the spring, at the research minister's, there will then be a national workshop on production engineering, at which a common guideline for national research is supposed to be hammered out and given concrete expression. The crucial question then will be: will government, academia and industry keep to it? Will selfish interests prevail or will the guideline assume a binding character? The next two years will tell the tale.
