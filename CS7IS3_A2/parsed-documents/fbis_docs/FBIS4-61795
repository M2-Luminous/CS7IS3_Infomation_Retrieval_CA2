The statement reads: Now comes Estonia's turn, after Latvia had been overtaxed. Open blackmail is used by the Russian minister of defense, who threatens that if the conditions of his country are not accepted, the remaining 2,500 foreign servicemen will not be withdrawn from Estonian territory; even an additional invasion [as heard] could not be excluded. This is a challenge to the West, and at the same time is a test of how Russia would be allowed to treat Estonia -- and before long, Lithuania. Our nearest neighbors should come to the aid of Estonia while reminding the Russian militarists and the world that these troops have to withdraw from Estonia unconditionally. If the troops remain deployed against Estonia's will, then it will prove once again that these troops remain occupational troops and are being used for the preparation of a new aggression. In turn, a big country threatening a small neighbor with armed force should not even apply for acceptance into the Council of Europe. All this strangely coincides with the anniversary of the end of World War II. It would be beneficial for the world to be aware that this war has not yet ended everywhere. In Estonia, the foreign troops that entered Estonia 50 years ago continue to be deployed there against Estonia's will. In some capital cities of Europe, embassy buildings of the Baltic states continue to be seized by Russia," Landsbergis' statement reads.
