FR940831-2-00143 FR940831-2-00106 Executive Summary This report culminates the fifth living-cost comparison study undertaken by Runzheimer International for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) under contract OPM&hyph;90&hyph;0705. The contract requires Runzheimer to: (1) survey living costs in 4 cost-of-living allowance (COLA) areas and the Washington, D.C., area, and (2) compare living costs between the areas and the D.C. area. To determine living costs in the identified areas and build this report, Runzheimer researched over 1,000 outlets and gathered more than 6,000 price quotes. This report presents the results of the living-cost surveys conducted during the winter of 1994. The results of the summer 1993 surveys were presented in a report provided to OPM earlier this year. To ease interpretation of the research results, we display the outcome of the comparisons as living-cost indexes in the table below. In addition, the table shows living-cost indexes for federal employees who have unlimited access to commissary and exchange facilities because of their employment. The index for the Washington, D.C., area (not shown) is 100.00 because it is, by definition, the reference area. ␣ Final Cost Comparison Indexes 1Allowance area 1Local pricing 1Commissary & exchange Anchorage, Alaska 103.94 101.32 Fairbanks, Alaska 106.03 103.41 Juneau, Alaska 108.10 NA Other Areas in Alaska* 127.56 NA * As represented by Nome, AK. NA = Not Applicable One of the changes OPM requested this year was to separate the reporting of the summer and winter living-cost surveys. The purpose of this change was to allow OPM to adjust COLA where warranted in a more timely manner. Other changes included: •A moving average approach to introduce new federal employment weights, •A new methodology for collecting and analyzing automotive maintenance cost, and •Minor changes in pricing sources for certain items to refine the comparisons of D.C. and allowance area prices. We discuss these and other adjustments in appropriate sections throughout this report. In addition, to monitor, fine-tune, and maintain effective control of the data-gathering efforts in Alaska, Runzheimer sent a full-time research professional to Alaska to visit retail outlets, Runzheimer research associates, housing data sources, and living communities.
