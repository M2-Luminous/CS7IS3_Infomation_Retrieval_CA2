Applicant, a Maryland corporation, is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end, non-diversified management investment company. 2. On September 7, 1990, Applicant filed a notification of registration under Section 8(a) of the 1940 Act and a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 8(b) of the 1940 Act registering an indefinite amount of common stock, all of one class (File No. 33&hyph;36568). The registration statement became effective on November 30, 1990, the date the initial public offering commenced. 3. On November 4, 1993, Applicant's Board of Directors unanimously approved an agreement and plan or reorganization (``Plan'') between Applicant and Northwestern Mutual Series Fund, Inc. (``Series Fund''), a registered, open-end management investment company. 1 The Plan was approved by the Trustees of Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company (``Northwestern Life''), Applicant's sole shareholder, on September 22, 1993. The Plan provides for Applicant to exchange all of its assets for shares of the Index 500 Stock Portfolio (``Portfolio''), a corresponding portfolio of the Series Fund.
