A Russian border guard was shot dead and two wounded on April 1 in a skirmish near the Pechory (Petseri) railway station on the Russian side of the temporary borderline. The two assailants fled. The tracker dog brought to the scene failed to pick up the assailants' trail, so it is not known whether they came from or fled to Estonia. The two wounded border guards said the assailants spoke Russian without a foreign accent and claimed to be former Russian servicemen. The shots were fired from a TT pistol. Kouts said Estonia has done everything it could and everything "Russia asked for" to find the assailants. "Russia hasn't lately informed us about the results of their investigations, although we know they continue looking for the men," Kouts told BNS. "We've been checking out our own theories, and we've established a certain circle of people we'll go over with a fine-tooth comb."
