The Treasury is easily losing nearly 1 trillion pesos in uncollected taxes per year due to contraband, which represents a little more than 25 percent of the country's total annual imports. Cigarettes are the leading contraband product.

A huge reduction in the export of coffee, oil, fuels, and other traditional products are to blame for the poor showing. A 13.5-percent increase in nontraditional exports saved the situation, keeping the export percentages from falling into the negative side.
