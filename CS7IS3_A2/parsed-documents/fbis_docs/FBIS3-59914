One deputy was opposed and others abstained. U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, visiting Almaty, had given a positive reaction to the news saying the treaty would serve to promote the cause of peace and economic development in Central Asia as a whole. He also spoke of signs of progress in nuclear disarmament talks with Ukraine which instilled optimism. The Vice President had also praised the Kazakh-U.S. agreement on dismantling nuclear weapons of the former Soviet Union deployed in Kazakhstan. A bilateral working commission is due to sit to work out an appropriate schedule soon. The ratification of the treaty, said Gore, marks an entirely new stage of relations between Kazakhstan and the United States. He said strategic cooperation was based not only on shared positions in respect of nuclear weapons but also in many economic agreements designed to help promote the private sector in Kazakhstan. Gore announced that the Central Asian Business Fund was due to open its office in Almaty whose main task would be to provide aid to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan as countries which embrace more consistent economic reforms than others. For his part, President Nursultan Nazarbayev said his country was "honoring its obligations in respect of nuclear weapons." However, he said Kazakhstan had set its own conditions for dismantling them. The main one is Kazakhstan wants to hold back to [as received] electronic and other equipment for subsequent use in the economy before missile-containing silos are destroyed. Gore said the Kazakh leader had accepted President Clinton's invitation to visit the U.S. on February 14.
