[passage omitted] Greens politicians Angelika Beer and Claudia Roth said that a possible agreement between the FRG and Turkey on the deportation of violent Kurdish demonstrators is "fatal": Such an agreement is "inconceivable" for constitutional reasons and because of German commitments from the Geneva Refugee Convention and the European Human Rights Convention. Pro Asylum spokesman Herbert Leuninger stated that negotiations on the "return" of Kurds are the "official admission that human rights are being disregarded at the Bosporus." On Wednesday [30 March] the Bonn Interior Ministry rejected a report of FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU that, within the framework of an agreement with Ankara, it is planning to establish "special prisons" for violent Kurdish criminals to be deported. Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) neither proposed this nor has such plans, a spokesman stressed. Moreover, the "formation of opinion" on opportunities for the speedy deportation of Kurds has not yet been concluded within the Federal Government, it was stated. Hesse Interior Minister Herbert Guenther (Social Democratic Party of Germany) and Ferse, director of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, called on the Kurds living in Germany not to leave the public definition of the image of the Kurdish people to the extremist Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). In the past few months, PKK adherents have proved themselves to be a group with "extraordinary aggressiveness." However, Ferse also accused the Turkish intelligence service of illegal activities on German soil in connection with investigations into the surroundings of the PKK. "Therefore, we have to be careful that our employees are not working for the Turks at the same time," Ferse said. [passage omitted]
