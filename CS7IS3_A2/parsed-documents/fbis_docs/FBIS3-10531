"I am out of this contest," Sarney said on 28 February after returning to his house on Calhau Beach to recover from a tachycardia crisis that forced him to go to the hospital during the weekend. Surrounded by his relatives and wearing a safari shirt and leather sandals, the former president decided to extend his rest for a few more days and postpone his return to Brasilia until 1 March. The former president did not attribute to his heart problem the decision to give up the presidential campaign. Sarney is a Brazilian Democratic Movement Party senator for Amapa State. He said he has "never" wanted to return to Planalto Palace. Justifying the fact that his name is always in evidence, he said: "Politicians talk too much." Sarney's decision not to run for the presidency, however, was ignored even by the newspaper he owns. Before the former president was hospitalized, the ESTADO DO MARANHAO daily published in big letters a note stating that the Liberal Front Party governors believed Sarney would be "the strongest and most talked about" presidential candidate.
