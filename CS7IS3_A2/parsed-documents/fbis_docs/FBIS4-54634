Is the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] behind this? Are UNPROFOR generals preventing the Croatian president's visit to Sarajevo and the forming of the Croat-Bosnian federation? The question is not entirely unfounded, and here is why. During a recent interview for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and Television, in the course of a private, very engaging conversation, and in response to my question why he still has not visited Sarajevo, the Croatian president literally said: You have to ask UNPROFOR why I still have not been to Sarajevo -- therefore, firsthand information from the highest place in Croatia. Moreover, it is also possible to hear the following on the Croatian political scene: Now that they have tragically solved the fate of Gorazde, UNPROFOR generals may be [words indistinct] and we can expect all kinds of things from them, even the prevention of a normalization of relations between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, there is yet another question to which it is currently impossible to get an answer in Zagreb. Why has the Croatian media published an AFP report on President Izetbegovic's latest letter once again inviting President Tudjman to visit Sarajevo? Why was there no public statement from the presidential palace, which is the usual procedure? Was the letter intended only for Dr. Tudjman's private perusal, which is how a Croatian opposition member picturesquely commented on this. Is it really only UNPROFOR that is preventing Tudjman's visit to Sarajevo, or is there a lack of goodwill in the presidential palace?
