Provincial party Secretary Pu Chaozhu spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that since the Second Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the provincial party committee and government have unremittingly persisted in doing two types of work simultaneously and have conscientiously carried out the three anticorruption tasks set by the party Central Committee and the State Council. Procuratorial and judicial institutions at all levels have closely coordinated with each other in cracking major and important cases. [passage omitted] The provincial government has held an executive meeting to encourage all functional departments to severely curb the arbitrary collection of charges and imposition of fines. The general situation in anticorruption work is good and its development is healthy. Pu Chaozhu stressed: We should understand that the fight against corruption is a protracted and difficult task running through the entire process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should not overestimate the achievements in the current fight against corruption or remain contented with the initial results in this fight. Instead, we should carry out this combat unswervingly. [passage omitted] All levels of party committees, discipline inspection departments, supervisory departments, procuratorial departments, and courts should have a clear idea of their responsibilities, organize their personnel, and take measures to fulfill the three tasks. The current anticorruption work should focus on solving major and important cases and on curbing malpractices. The circular on strictly prohibiting the use of public money for extravagant eating and drinking must be put into effect. He Zhanjun, chief procurator of the provincial people's procuratorate, briefed the meeting on the results since the beginning of last year in examining some corruption and bribery cases throughout the province. He said: Last year procuratorial institutions throughout the province put 1,348 corruption and bribery cases on file for investigation; of these, 749 were major and important cases, 55.6 percent of the total cases put on file; and 1,285 cases had been examined. [passage omitted] Qiu Chuangjiao, president of the provincial higher people's court, reported to the meeting on the relevant situation. He said: Since the beginning of last year, people's courts at all levels in the province have examined 1,078 economic crimes of all kinds, including corruption, bribery, speculation, smuggling, deception, and tax evasion cases. They have sentenced 1,080 economic criminals. The meeting was presided over by provincial party Deputy Secretary Ling Huan.
