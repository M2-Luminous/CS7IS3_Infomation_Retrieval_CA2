The idea of inevitability of the frustration of the imperialists' anti-socialist moves and necessity of the victory of socialism, which was elucidated by the great leader in his New Year address, serves as an inspiring banner in smashing the manoeuvres of the imperialists and vigorously struggling for the accomplishment of the socialist cause, NODONG SINMUN today in a by-lined article says, and goes on: As in the past, so in the future, too, the anti-socialist moves of the imperialists are bound to go bankrupt. This is because the old cannot defeat the new, first of all. The imperialists' moves to arrest the development of socialism and obliterate it are an anti-historic scheme contrary to the law governing historic development and, accordingly, it is axiomatic that it cannot be realized. In view of the course of the development of human history, capitalism, the old one going against historic development, is bound to give way to an advanced socialism as a slave society gave way to a feudal society and the latter to a capitalist society. The moves of the imperialists to block the development of socialism and stifle it cannot but meet a strong counter-attack of the popular masses as they are anti-popular and against history. The struggle for socialism is the cause to realise the aspirations and demand of the popular masses to live and develop independently as full-fledged masters of the state and society freed from all manner of exploitation and oppression. The plot of the imperialists to block the development of socialism and restore capitalism is bound to fail in face of the rejection and protest of the popular masses. The more viciously the imperialists pursue anti-socialist strategy, the more vigorously the popular masses will struggle against them, strengthening unity and solidarity. Socialism is sure to win victory in the struggle against capitalism thanks to the active support and struggle of the popular masses. It is because socialism, an idea conforming with the independent nature of the popular masses and the requirement of social development, is daily growing in strength with the positive support of the popular masses who are an overwhelming majority of society.
