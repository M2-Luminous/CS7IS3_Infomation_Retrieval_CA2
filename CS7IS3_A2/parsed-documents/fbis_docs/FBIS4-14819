Vladimir Konyaev, was accredited April 1 at the country's Defense Ministry. The event was "a substantial step toward normalization of relations between Latvia and Russia," Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis told reporters after the accreditation. Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh agreed to the minister's words saying that the appointment of Russian military attache to Latvia would promote contacts between both countries' defense structures. The activities of the newly accredited attache would not be directly connected with the process of Russian troop withdrawal but he is expected to engage the Russian embassy in tackling withdrawal problems.
