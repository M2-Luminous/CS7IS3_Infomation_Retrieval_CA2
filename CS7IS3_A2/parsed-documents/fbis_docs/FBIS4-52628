The companies blamed the scheduled price hikes on a rise in crude oil prices, which they said more than offset the appreciation of the yen against major foreign currencies last month. Cosmo Oil Co. and three other companies said they will raise their prices by 0.80 yen, while Idemitsu and three other companies said they will hike theirs by 0.90 yen. All companies, except Mitsubishi Oil Co., will implement the raises for deliveries beginning May 16. Mitsubishi will do so on June 1.
