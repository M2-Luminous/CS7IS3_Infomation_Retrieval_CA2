FBIS3-51199 "drlat010_l_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-010 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Jan 1994 Bolivia Subversive Group, Armed Forces Links Viewed PY1301191694 Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS in Spanish 7 Jan 94 pp A1, A2 PY1301191694 Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] The Intelligence Service of the Ministry of Government has stated that "Vivo Rojo" -- a self-styled extreme left group -- is a "clandestine activist partner" within the Revolutionary Workers Party (POR). This information was disclosed today by Colonel German Linares, chief of the National Intelligence Service of the Bolivian Police. During an exclusive interview with LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz, Linares asserted that the "Vivo Rojo" subversive group is not a disorganized faction within the Armed Forces but -- on the contrary -- "it bases its actions on the ideology of the trotskyist POR-Lora [whose leader is Guillermo Lora]." Linares added: "Our investigations in various parts of the Republic reveal serious evidence that this subversive group, which is of a socialist tendency, plans its terrorist actions following the dissemination of bibliographic material that contains its doctrine. This is directed toward previously selected sectors of Bolivian society." Linares said that "Vivo Rojo" has links "which, although unimportant, are particularly notorious among the small groups within the Bolivian Armed Forces that supply information on acts of corruption and irregularities to the clandestine group." Linares explained: "`Vivo Rojo' takes advantage of these cases to write slogans against the democratic system, the government, and the high military command." This statement somewhat explains the active presence of the group in La Paz, Oruro, El Alto, and Cochabamba, where its members have painted "graffiti" criticizing the current government and the Armed Forces high command, which they call "accomplices of the country's shortcomings." The Intelligence Service chief disclosed that the investigations which started last year to definitely establish the presence of the extremist "Vivo Rojo" group, is classified as "B-2 Information." Linares said that for national security reasons, and to protect the investigations, the State Intelligence Directorate is unable to supply more information on what is being done to "dismantle this clandestine organization" which he called "incipient and unharmful to our democratic stability." The controversial police official asserted on 6 January, however, that the POR "is a latent threat to our democratic stability." He said the methods used by the group to indoctrinate, to implement its partisan activities, and to disseminate its ideology explicitly reveal that "it is a political group which seeks by any means to discredit the institutions and their legally established authorities" and thus destabilize the democratic system in Bolivia.
