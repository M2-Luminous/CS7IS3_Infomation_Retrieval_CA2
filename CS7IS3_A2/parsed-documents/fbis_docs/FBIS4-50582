When pursuing the the socialist market economy system, we should pay special attention to both the law of value and the law of reproduction. Here, the law of reproduction refers to the objective inevitability of distributing the quantity of labor in society according to a certain proportion. In ordinary language, that is, economic development requires a balance between gross supply and demand, and a well-balanced structure. If this balance and harmonious relationship are upset, the law of reproduction is being violated and the benign cycle of social reproduction inevitably will be disrupted. Therefore, we should make clear the relationship between the law of value and the law of reproduction. Importance Should Be Attached to Both the Law of Value and the Law of Reproduction The law of value plays a role in regulating the distribution of the production factors in the production of different commodities. This regulatory mechanism functions through changes in the market price signals. Under the conditions of a market economy, commodity prices are determined by two basic factors: First, the necessary quantity of labor in society for the production of a certain commodity; second, the condition of supply and demand with regard to this commodity. Provided the necessary quantity of labor in society for the production of a certain commodity remains unchanged, what determines the changes in the commodity's price is the condition of supply and demand in the market. In general, if the supply of a certain commodity increases to a degree exceeding market demand, the price of the commodity will fall to the level below its value. According to this market signal, enterprises will redistribute production factors and shift part of their resources from the production of the oversupplied commodity to the production of other commodities. On the contrary, if the demand for a certain commodity increases and the commodity becomes in short supply, its price will rise to a level above its value. Enterprises then will redistribute production factors according to this market signal and will shift more resources to the production of the commodity in short supply. From the simplified example, we may clearly see three points: 1) It is the objective proportion in the law of reproduction that determines whether a certain commodity is oversupplied or is in short supply, and this is not determined simply by the law of value. 2) It is the objective proportion in the law of reproduction that determines how much and to where the production factors will be shifted, and this is not determined simply by the law of value, either. 3) Being determined by the law of reproduction, the law of value is turned into a market regulation mechanism for adjusting the distribution of production factors among different commodities (enterprises and departments). Under the conditions of large-scale social conditions, without the invisible hand of market regulation, it is hard to smoothly meet the objective requirements of the law of reproduction. Therefore, we must attach great importance to the regulatory role of the law of value, thus ensuring that the market mechanism plays a basic role in the distribution of resources. Opinion once held that the law of value did not play any regulatory role in the realm of production. I think this is an erroneous theoretical generalization, but we also should notice the blindness of the law of value. Therefore, the adjustment of resource distribution cannot rely merely on the invisible hand of the market force; it requires another, visible hand: The macro-control mechanism based on social interests. Maintain the Benign Cycle of Social Reproduction This is a historical subject in the study of Western economics over the past nearly 100 years. In the past, Western economists stressed simple reliance on the invisible hand in order to adjust the distribution of production factors, to perfect the realization of the law of reproduction, and to avoid economic and unemployment crises caused by overproduction. The outbreak of the Great Depression in the capitalist world in the 1930's proved the thorough failure of this theory. The replacement was the academic school represented by Keynes, who advocated the market economy with the state's macroeconomic intervention. It admitted that without the macro-intervention of the state, the invisible hand alone would not be able to adjust the distribution of the production factors reasonably, would not be able to perfect the realization of the law of reproduction, and would not be able to avoid economic and unemployment crises. However, the stag-flation in the capitalist countries in the 1970's posed a new challenge to Keynesian theory. Facts show that the primary precondition for maintaining the benign cycle of reproduction is a reasonable economic system. The greatest obstacle to the realization of the law of reproduction under the capitalist system is the lack of effective market demand. This is not a contradiction that can be solved by any economic structure. The contradiction is a product of the capitalist system, and is a phenomenon derived from the law of surplus value of capital. When the capitalist class is pursuing the exploitation of surplus value, on one hand, it deprives the working class of part of their consumption demand; on the other hand, it accumulates a huge quantity of capital. When the capital is used to expand reproduction, it encounters the contradiction caused by the relatively insufficient consumption demand of the working class. This is the inherent antagonistic contradiction in the capitalist system. Even the most ideal model of the market economy can bring about only some stopgap measures to mitigate the contradiction, but can never remove it. The effort to realize the law of reproduction under the socialist system will encounter no obstacle caused by the system, but will encounter theoretical and structural obstacles. In the development of the socialist system over the past more than 70 years, there were a number of theoretical and structural errors. In the 1930's, for example, socialist construction gave priority to the development of heavy industry, and the production of consumer goods developed very slowly and lagged behind the increase in purchasing power. This gave rise to the phenomenon of disproportion. Some people regarded this as an objective law. This then gave rise to the demand-inflationary economy in the form of value and the supply-shortage economy in the form of real materials. Both the inflationary economy and the shortage economy were specific demonstrations of violations of the law of reproduction. The erroneous theory had a prevailing impact over a fairly long period of time. Another more serious error was the viewpoint that regarded the commodity economy as incompatible with the socialist system, holding that only the highly centralized planned economy was representative of the essential requirement of the socialist system and that only such an economic structure could ensure the planned and proportionate development of the national economy. According to this viewpoint, under the socialist system, only if economic regulation was done artificially by the planning mechanism, would the law of reproduction be invoked smoothly, and there was no need for any regulation by the market mechanism. Moreover, the structure of the planned economy was oriented to and served state interests only, and ignored or negated enterprise, local, and other interests. Economic management was highly centralized in the hands of the state authorities. Localities, departments, and enterprises could only "eat from the big pot" of the state, and they all stretched out their hands to scrabble resources from the state. Corresponding to this excessively centralized economic structure was the administrative control mechanism in the process of macroeconomic management. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses was dampened, and the state also failed to guarantee the harmonious and stable development of the national economy. In the course of invoking the law of reproduction, a socialist country does not encounter the contradiction caused by the insufficiency of effective demand; on the contrary, it is repeatedly faced with the contradiction caused by the swelling effective demand. This is not a problem caused by the system, but a structural problem. To solve this contradiction, it is necessary to carry out economic structural reform, through which state-owned enterprises are changed from government affiliates into commodity producers bearing sole responsibility for their own profits and losses, and the modern enterprise system can be established. At the same time, it is necessary to use the market mechanism to conduct economic regulation. However, such macroeconomic adjustment must be put in place mainly by economic means. Thus, invisible and visible hands will function jointly to regulate the operation of the economy, and the development of the socialist market economy will meet the requirements of law of reproduction and effect a benign cycle of social reproduction.
