Clashes took place in the city on 13 April, after Eduardo dos Santos' aircraft parachuted war materiel on the defense lines of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA]. This scenario was repeated yesterday. According to our reporter Jardim Sikito Prata, a Ilyushin-76 aircraft belonging to the Luanda Air Force on two occasions, at 0900 and 1500, dropped war materiel, fuel, backpacks, and other equipment. A total of 10 parachutes once again fell on the FALA's defense lines. Military sources contacted by Sikito Prata, say these constant operations are part of a deliberate plan by Eduardo dos Santos to resume clashes in Bie in order to delay peace which is being negotiated in Lusaka. The FALA military command in Bie has warned, however, that it will not tolerate any act of provocation and all those who insist will be severely punished. Military operations by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] continue to be the center of attention inside Angola where Eduardo dos Santos' men have not learned from their defeats. In Cuanza Norte Province, the UNITA armed forces pushed to Lucala-2 River region the Luanda regime troops who had in vain tried to take N'Dalatando, the capital of Cuanza Norte Province. Lieutenant Colonel Sexto Sachi, chief of FALA operations in the province, gave assurances that the city will never fall into the hands of the MPLA-PT by the force of arms. [passage omitted]
