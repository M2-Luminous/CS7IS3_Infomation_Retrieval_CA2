FR940325-0-00070 FR940325-0-00016 The natural resource damage assessment regulations provide an administrative process for conducting assessments as well as technical methods for the actual identification of injuries and calculation of damages. Under the regulations, both type A and type B, assessments consist of four major phases. The first phase of an assessment conducted under the regulations involves the activities that precede the actual assessment. For example, upon detecting or receiving notification of a discharge or release, trustee officials perform a preassessment screen to ascertain whether further assessment actions are warranted. The second phase involves the preparation of an Assessment Plan. The Assessment Plan, which is subject to public review and comment, assists the involvement of potentially responsible parties (PRPs), other trustee officials, the general public, and any other interested parties. The Assessment Plan also ensures that assessments are performed at a reasonable cost. In the third phase, trustee officials conduct the work described in the Assessment Plan. The work involves three steps: Injury Determination; Quantification; and Damage Determination. In Injury Determination, trustee officials determine whether any natural resources have been injured. If trustee officials determine that resources have been injured, they proceed to Quantification, in which they quantify the resulting reduction in services provided by the resources. Finally, in Damage Determination, trustee officials calculate the monetary compensation to be sought as damages for the natural resource injuries. In a type A assessment, trustee officials perform Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination through the use of standardized procedures involving minimal field work. The Department has adopted a phased approach to developing type A procedures for different environments. Only one type A rule has been developed to date. The existing type A rule provides for the use of a computer model to assess damages from small releases or discharges in coastal or marine environments. For other releases or discharges, trustee officials conduct a type B assessment, in which Injury Determination, Quantification, and Damage Determination are performed through the use of a range of alternative scientific and economic methodologies. The fourth phase of every natural resource damage assessment, whether the type A or type B rule is followed, consists of post-assessment activities such as: Preparation of a Report of Assessment; establishment of an account for damage assessment awards; and development of a Restoration Plan for use of the awards. C. Judicial Review A party may petition the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review any regulation issued under CERCLA. CERCLA sec. 113(a). A number of parties filed such petitions for review of the natural resource damage assessment regulations. The type A rule was challenged in State of Colorado v. United States Department of the Interior , 880 F.2d 481 (D.C. Cir. 1989) ( Colorado v. Interior ). The type B rule was challenged in State of Ohio v. United States Department of the Interior , 880 F.2d 432 (D.C. Cir. 1989) ( Ohio v. Interior ). The court in Ohio v. Interior upheld various challenged aspects of the type B rule but did remand three issues. The court ordered the Department to revise the rule to reflect the statutory preference for using restoration costs as the measure of natural resource damages. The court used the term ``restoration costs'' to encompass the cost of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured natural resources. The court also ordered the Department to revise the rule to allow for the recovery of all reliably calculated lost values of injured natural resources, including both lost use values and lost nonuse values, with no specific hierarchy of methodologies required of trustee officials in estimating those values. Use values are derived through activities such as hiking or fishing. Nonuse values are not dependent on use of the resource. Nonuse values include existence value, which is the value of knowing that a resource exists, and bequest value, which is the value of knowing that a resource will be available for future generations. Finally, the court asked the Department to clarify whether the natural resource damage assessment regulations apply to natural resources that are not actually owned by the government. D. Implementation of the Court Order The Department published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on September 22, 1989, to announce its intent to revise the type B rule to comply with Ohio v. Interior . 54 FR 39016. The Department issued a proposed rule on April 29, 1991, with comments requested by June 28, 1991. 56 FR 19752. On July 2, 1991, the Department extended the comment period to July 16, 1991. 56 FR 30367. On July 22, 1993, the Department reopened the comment period to allow consideration of additional comments, including newly developed information on the contingent valuation methodology (CV), the only method currently available for the express purpose of estimating nonuse values. 58 FR 39328. The comment period was originally reopened until September 7, 1993, and then extended until September 22, 1993. 58 FR 45877 (Aug. 31, 1993).
