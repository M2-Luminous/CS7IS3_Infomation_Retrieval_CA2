Members of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee--Yin Kesheng, Cai Zhulin, Sang Jiejia, Tang Zhengren, Doba, Wang Hanmin, and Yao Xiangcheng--attended the meeting. Leading cadres from the provincial people's congress, the provincial government, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference provincial committee, the provincial military district, the provincial court, and the provincial procuratorate attended the meeting as nonvoting delegates. At the meeting, everyone studied the important instructions issued by the Central Commission of Politics and Law on paying attention to the work of maintaining political stability and conscientiously exchanged views with one another. Comrade Yin Kesheng made an important speech. According to the meeting, the current situation of our province is good, and we have achieved economic development, political stability, unity among nationalities, and social progress. Behind the positive situation, however, there are still some unstable elements. In particular, although a faction of evildoers who stirred up trouble were punished in accordance with the law last October, small numbers of evildoers are still carrying out acts of sabotage. They are fabricating rumors to confuse and poison people's minds and are using all sorts of dirty tricks in a vain attempt to sabotage the stable and united political situation, in which people of various nationalities throughout the province are engaged in a united struggle which is not easily won. Regarding these situations, leaders at all levels, the vast numbers of party members and cadres, and the broad masses must maintain sharp vigilance and have a clear understanding. We must firmly and decisively deal with all acts which disrupt stability. The meeting stressed that we must uphold the working principle of following the mass line and must proceed in all cases from the interests of the people. We must have faith in the masses, must rely on them, and must arouse their enthusiasm, which is the basic guarantee for the success of our undertaking. We must educate the broad masses, enhance the awareness of maintaining political stability, and educate the public to make contributions to maintaining stability. Regarding the masses who were hoodwinked last year when a handful of evildoers stirred up trouble, we must unswervingly implement the policy of not laying blame on them, not discriminating against them, and not investigating or affixing responsibility for the trouble on them so as to unite the overwhelming majority of the masses. People of various nationalities must unite and cooperate with one another, live in harmony, and make joint efforts to maintain and develop the stable and united political situation, thus achieving joint development and progress for various nationalities. As stressed by the meeting, the key to maintaining political stability lies in leadership. Leaders at all levels must further enhance their understanding of the important meaning of maintaining political stability, must try to reach a common understanding and pace, must firmly implement all kinds of work in a down-to-earth manner, and must make unremitting efforts to work for the perpetual stability of Xining and of the entire province and for the joint prosperity and progress of various nationalities.
