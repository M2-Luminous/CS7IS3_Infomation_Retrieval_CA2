Bobylev, candidate of historical sciences and docent; Captain 1st Rank (Ret) P.M. Shabardin, candidate of philosophical sciences; and Major-General S.I. Syedin, doctor of psychological sciences and professor: "A Conceptual Breakdown or Defamation the Past (On the Development and Problems of Russian Military Science)"] [Text] Major changes in the world also largely affect military affairs, including problems of military history and practice. Above all, I want to express concern over the decrease in interest of leaders of the Armed Forces and many officers in methodological problems of military science. Something is also being developed now. Fresh ideas are also being born. But a not entirely good tendency of isolating scientific thought from practical activities is emerging. This also happened in the past, when much was determined a priori by political guidelines and the demand for new knowledge and ideas was rejected. However, today, unfortunately, this no longer involves only big leaders. At a recent conference of historians, we did not see even representatives of the editorial staff of the Military Encyclopedia, who more than others should be interested in a professional discussion of their problems. Such an arrogant self-isolation will in time make itself felt by a decrease in the quality of their labor and can be reflected in the accomplishment of tasks facing the Armed Forces of Russia. A conclusion suggests itself. It is necessary, in my view, to attract more decisively the attention of the public and leading military personnel to this problem; constantly and on a high professional level show what specifically is being overlooked now due to underestimation of new ideas; and more thoroughly develop new scientific ideas and submit them for discussion by experts and the public. A second problem that bothers me concerns sciences studying defense problems and war as a whole. Seemingly, scientific thought has convincingly proven that military science alone cannot study war as a complex socio-political phenomenon. By studying armed struggle alone, one cannot understand the essence and origin of wars. To do this, one must comprehend such matters as a society's economic system, processes of the birth of classes, the causes of contradictions between states, and so forth. But this, as we know, is not the subject of military science. Before, in socialist countries it was customary to believe that general problems of war were revealed in the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on war and the army; other doctrines on war were ignored. Thus, the object and subject of knowledge narrowed substantially, and many very complex phenomena had to fit into the methodological framework of one doctrine alone. I am confident that war, like any other phenomenon, can be studied objectively by studying all doctrines and theories directly or indirectly concerning it, adopting the best that is in them. In Western countries, the science studying the general problems of war (its essence, origin, socio-political and economic fundamentals of military might, the army's role and place in society, and so forth) is called the study of war. In discussing these problems at the conference of historians, O.A. Belkov said that they could study military politology. It was planned to legitimize the concept of "philosophy of war" or "general theory of war." But these terms, in my view, do not fully express the essence of the problems. Military politology is legitimate only as a component part of general politology. But in the cognition of war one encounters not only political but also philosophical, economic, and social problems. Thus, general knowledge about war can be known based on comprehensive studies of various sciences. The term "general doctrine on war and the army" is more accurate. Now about the topic of military science. Recently, people have appeared who have poor knowledge about the essence of the question they are trying to interpret in their own way. There are opinions about the need to include in the topic of military science political and economic problems and knowledge of other sciences (physics, cybernetics, geography, and others). The article "What Is Military Science?" was published in the journal VOYENNAYA MYSL. In particular, the author writes that to solve the "entire set of problems facing military science, it is necessary to know...economic, social, ecological, demographic, and other aspects of war, and the corresponding sections of military science engage in this." It further emphasizes: "It is known that whereas a field of knowledge has an object and subject for cognition and its own laws, this is a science according to all parameters, and the social order for knowledge of this science determines its affiliation--in this case military."[.sup]1[/] It must be said that we have not encountered for a long time now any examples of a more dense ignorance in our military press. If you assume that such an approach would be adopted by science, this would give rise to complete confusion in classification of scientific knowledge. Indeed, it is necessary to know and take into account the economic, ecological, and other aspects of war. The Ministry of Defense needs knowledge gleaned from various sciences, and military science uses it. This is the essence of interaction and mutual penetration of sciences. But it is impossible and illegitimate to include physics, mathematics, and other fields of knowledge in military science just because they are used in military affairs. People who react so frivolously to resolving methodological problems do not understand that sciences must not be classified arbitrarily. They differ primarily according to the subject for cognition and those objective phenomena and laws which they are able to experience. Warfare, armed forces, methods of preparing and conducting combat operations by them in modern conditions, taking into account prospects of development, are the subject of military science. War and armed struggle are a two-sided phenomenon in which both sides deal with common laws, principles, and objective phenomena. Therefore, military science is unified, and its previous division into "Soviet" or "bourgeois" is artificial. Openness of military science, military cooperation with other countries, and exchange of knowledge are important today. Unfortunately, recently we have stopped publishing military literature in general, and books by foreign authors are not being translated or published, although even during the "stagnant" years we had the opportunity to read Manstein, Guderian, Eisenhower, and others. We need to know foreign military literature. Without this we cannot acquire full-fledged military knowledge. I would also like to express the desire that questions of methodology of military theory and practice be studied more thoroughly at military academies and thus increase the overall culture of the officer corps. Moreover, it is impossible to plan and organize military-scientific work and scientifically compile training programs without precisely defining the subject and content of military science and the military problems of other sciences. Finally, not only are the methodological reference points changing. Many new problems of military science are arising which require the soonest possible study. For example, at the conference, all the historians agreed that nuclear war is impossible. The viewpoint on the unlikelihood of a conventional world war in the near future is also well-founded. Achieving political objectives by using military force will now be accomplished basically by three methods: setting limited objectives and accomplishing them successively in local wars; subversive operations against other countries; indirect strategic operations. All our military theory, field manuals, and training literature are oversaturated with developments of waging nuclear and conventional world wars. Obviously, the fundamentals of nuclear planning should also change. In our view, it will have to be limited to the elaboration of the fundamentals of nuclear deterrence and methods of armed struggle calling for the use of armed forces in local wars and in a major conventional war, but taking into account the threat of possible use of nuclear weapons. In this regard, many new questions arise in the area of organizational development and training of armed forces, on which, in our view, the main efforts in military-scientific work should be concentrated. General of the Army M.A. Gareyev, doctor of military sciences, professor Military-historical science (like all historical science in our country) is in a deep crisis. The problem of cadres of military historians and also of military-historical work among personnel of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation also remains acute. The tasks placed before military-historical science by life are intense, serious, and diverse. Many of them cannot be accomplished in a few months, but they must not be put off. The most difficult problem at this stage is eliminating "blank spaces" in military history, particularly of the Soviet period. We also do not now have a complete picture of their amount, although in recent years quite a bit was said in articles on historical topics. One of the immediate practical tasks, in our opinion, is a historiographic assessment of all that has been done in the area of military history, particularly recently. Now, when many previously inaccessible documents have become known, it turned out that the "official history" was truncated according to a number of parameters, far from reality. Historians were authorized to work with those documents and publish those works which "worked" for the society's political system that existed until recently and increased its prestige. Everything negative in the life of the country and army was carefully metered out in doses, and everything unfavorable was covered up, hushed up. When something secret suddenly became open, it was denied with persistence deserving of better use (as was the case with the secret protocol to the Soviet-German Non-aggression Treaty of 23 August 1939). So, almost everything new in scientific-historical publications of recent years is the "negative" that was hidden earlier, which (it is important to emphasize this) is also a part of our history. Unfortunately, publication of such facts and documents earlier unknown to science often resulted in their authors being labeled as "slanderers" by those who wanted to know only that history which was presented to us all the preceding years. It should be noted that today, too, researchers are not confident that they are writing "the entire truth," since access to many fundamentally important documents has been made difficult up to now. As we know, a whole set of facts is often required in order to prove something, but only one fact or document is enough to refute this same thing (for example, in the case of the above-mentioned secret protocol). Therefore, the likelihood is great that the historical concepts developed today may prove to be unsound in the near future after the appearance of new information about which we do not yet know and about whose scientific importance we cannot even guess. However, this does not mean that historians have to wait until "everything is known." An urgent practical task, in our view, is the creation of such works which would outline the current vision of problems of the country's military history, particularly its Soviet period, based on already accessible documents and materials. Accomplishing this task, to our regret, is made extremely complicated by the state of publishing in our country. But this is the topic for a special conversation. Of course, the search for new archival documents and materials with their subsequent publication must be stepped up to create new works. A beginning has been set for this: the publishing center TERRA published a transcript of the December (1940) meeting of the top command personnel of the Red Army. It was prepared for press by associates of the Institute of Military History and the Russian State Military Archives. Next was a publication of collections of documents of the State Defense Committee, the General Headquarters of the Supreme High Command, the people's defense commissar, and other leadership bodies of the USSR Armed Forces during the Great Patriotic War. These collections will include declassified documents and materials not published before. Their publication will make it possible to take a new look at problems which seemed solved long ago, eliminate many "blank spaces," and help create objective scientific works about the Great Patriotic War. Certainly, introducing a huge mass of new documents into scientific circulation will mean a real breakthrough in elaborating such works. As far as military history instruction at military academies and schools is concerned, the requirements of training programs to provide students (officer cadets) with "in-depth and sound knowledge of military history" will remain a good desire. The number of training hours allotted to a subject (up to 50 hours in schools and up to 150 hours in academies) does not permit this. In addition, the unending process of "shortening" the subject continues. The unsound practice existing at some military educational institutions, when up to 75 percent of the training time is allocated to group types of classes, is faulty. With a lack of new textbooks, they do not produce the desired results. In these conditions, more time must be allotted to lectures. For only in this way can we effectively summarize new material on the military history on Russia and convey it to the students. Finally, it is necessary to analyze military history as a science. For the time being, it is only declared that military history includes the history of wars, the history of military art, the history of organizational development of the armed forces, the history of military equipment, and the history of military thought, as well as a number of auxiliary disciplines. However, none of these component parts (other than the history of military art) so far has been elaborated in scientific terms and presented not only in the form of a book but even a good scientific-theoretical article. I think that, in this regard, an extensive field of activity is opening up for those who are involved with general problems of military history and its methodology. Colonel (Ret) P.N. Bobylev, candidate of historical sciences, docent One of the most important component parts of organizational development of the Russian Armed Forces--military education--is in need of a scientifically sound concept today. Successful resolution of this problem is impossible without combining the efforts of representatives of various fields of military knowledge. In working up a concept of education, it is necessary, above all, to take into account the radical nature and depth of army reforms being conducted and planned as a whole. In these conditions, the novelty, complexity, and responsibility of resolving educational problems lie in the fact that the efficient and actively operating system of ideological-political, moral, and psychological training of servicemen that was developed over decades in the USSR Armed Forces had actually collapsed. A rejection of many once-unwavering theoretical and ideological dogmas followed. Many traditional forms and methods of educational work have been significantly constricted. Re-creation of the education system has begun and is being accomplished with a search for the corresponding spiritual and moral reference points that are acceptable for the new Russia and its practically new army. Much from the historical past, especially the Soviet past, has to be rejected in this process. At the same time, much inevitably will have to be preserved, something forced to "remove anew," and enrich the current system of spiritual values with something. In terms of content, the spiritual and moral values and reference points are to draw in, on the one hand, all the natural and historical experience of education and, on the other, everything new emerging from modern public life evolving in the direction of democratization and humanization of public relations in the country and the world as a whole. The system of spiritual and moral values and reference points of military service have always included moral norms and ideals. Today, honesty, a high degree of patriotism, heroism, discipline, and so forth remain the moral norms of the defender of the fatherland. In preserving the in-depth fundamentals, the ideals of military service today need to be freed from archaisms, pseudo-values, and utopianism. Above all, the patriotic idea of serving the homeland, enriched with democratic ideals, universal values, and the principle of the supremacy of human rights must emerge in a naturally primordial form. Faith. It is more complicated. But since the human psyche, including the psyche of a solder, is impossible without faith, here a very broad field of activity is opening up for military psychologists. Pluralism of religion is to enrich a soldier's spiritual and moral ideals. By no means does the process of freeing a soldier's consciousness from the syndrome of "class struggle," "class morality," "image of an enemy," and other ideological guidelines of communist-totalitarian thinking mean that the emphasis in educational work with servicemen can be placed only on fostering loving feelings for everything and a peaceful nature merging with the worst variants of pacifism. A soldier is called upon to know, understand, and sharply sense the watershed between good and evil, nobility and meanness, true and false patriotism, and identify and understand such anti-democratic, anti-humane social phenomena as racism, fascism, terrorism, aggression, and so forth. Acquiring and assimilating moral norms and ideals by soldiers in the process of education can become the basis not only of their truly patriotic activities but also spiritual immunity with respect to any irrational misanthropic ideas which may be in use in the military environment in conditions of the often vulgar understanding of pluralism of ideas, views, and opinions. A system of specialized bodies in the Army and Navy, putting into practice new forms and methods of individual and group (collective) education, is called upon to serve the new content of the spiritual and moral makeup of the Army. In doing so, military researchers have grounds for a most attentive attitude toward structural elements of educational work already created or being created or, as it is now called, work with personnel in the Russian Armed Forces. It seems to me there is a real danger of a mechanical inheritance of many organizational principles, forms, and methods of this work from the recent past, the negative results of which are obvious. In particular, the primitive didactic principle of education widely used in the recent past is not very effective and does not reach the heart of today's young person. It must be replaced by rich pluralistic information activities and promotion of self-education. I am confident that practical resolution of such important problems of education needs a revival of the progressive Russian military-pedagogical school and true reform of training military educators at all levels. Recent political workers in the Army and Navy from the Marxist-Leninist and communist school were not notable for their educational ability, since both in schools and academies they were trained according to the "jack-of-all-trades" principle. Experts of the human soul of this sort during the course of reforms must make room for true professionals of spiritual and moral education of servicemen. In turn, special educational institutions, faculties, and departments of a military-pedagogical, military-psychological, and military-historical orientation are called upon to engage in training them. At the same time, taking into account the steadfastness of the principle of one-man command in the armed forces, commanders of all ranks are to possess military-psychological and military-pedagogical knowledge and skills. The fundamental and multiple-aspect nature of problems of military education require an initial conceptual basis. The concept of education in turn cannot but take into account such factors as the scientific-theoretical substantiation of value reference points of education, the sum total of spiritual and moral norms and ideals being cultivated, and, finally, the qualitative state of the specific object of education. Its development is possible only on the scale of the state through the collective efforts of researchers and practical workers. The basis for this, it seems to us, has been created. Above all, the new Constitution of the Russian Federation and Russia's military doctrine must become the legal reference points of military education as a whole. Captain 1st Rank (Ret) P.M. Shabardin, candidate of philosophical sciences Military psychology is not among the generally recognized social-humanities disciplines comprising the methodological basis of organizational development of the armed forces. But at the same time, it is generally known that a modern army and navy cannot be built without psychology. The experience of the Russian Army is evidence of this. It is recorded in the Military Encyclopedia, published in 1912 in St. Petersburg and edited by I.D. Sytin, that in view of the complexities of military affairs, the study of it is broken down into a whole series of studies comprising the task of specific sciences. This should include, above all, tactics and military psychology. Military education "on the one hand, should rely on conclusions of a person's psychology and physiology and, on the other, a study of the internal and external nature of war."[.sup]2[/] A department of military psychology was formed in the Russian Army in 1908 under a society of ardent supporters of military knowledge. It had the task of developing military psychology as a branch of general and military sciences studying the best training and use of the psychic aspect--forces, means, and methods of armed struggle.[.sup]3[/] At the same time, I would like to note the paradoxical aspect in the development of military psychology in recent years. Before reforming the political bodies in the armed forces into military-political bodies and then into structures for work with personnel at the Military Political Academy (today the Academy of the Humanities), three educational psychological disciplines were taught: military psychology--for officer political workers; military psychology and methods of its instruction--for officer instructors of military psychology; psychology of higher military school--for instructors in other humanities disciplines. Today, the cycle of educational and psychological disciplines being taught at the academy includes such subjects as the history of psychology, general psychology, social psychology, military psychology, psycho-physiology, age psychology, psycho-hygiene and psycho-therapy of military service, experimental psychology, psychology of pedagogical activities, professiology, and methods of teaching psychology. A number of special courses have been introduced (psychology of conflicts, medical psychology, psychology and interrelations, and others). Skilled training programs and subject plans have been compiled for all educational disciplines. But here is what is surprising: at the military academy, the training program and subject plan were particularly poorly developed for the "military psychology" discipline. This was the result of the fact that many topics of a historical-psychological, general psychological, social-psychological, and other nature "went" into related educational disciplines, where they also were to be "registered" according to content. That is, the person "went" with his psychic phenomena, the collective "went" with the socio-psychological characteristics, and the content of military psychology faded. Such a situation even further increased the need to resolve the question on the subject of military psychology. Is there a need for military psychology to include all the topics of general, social, and other divisions of psychology, having made only a corresponding verbal balancing act? Experience shows that the answer is no. Military psychology today as a scientific discipline is increasingly developing into the psychology of stress situations. It includes three main divisions: preparing for the behavior and actions of servicemen in stress (combat) situations; control and self-control of the mental state of servicemen, their behavior, and actions in stress situations; psychological rehabilitation of servicemen after coming out of stress situations (after stress-causing pressure). In the course of these directions, a number of original and interesting studies have been conducted at the department of psychology at the Academy of the Humanities. Thus, B.I. Khoziyev, candidate of psychological sciences and docent, performed work to increase the quality of training (combat training) of military specialists of various fields. Colonel S.M. Zakharik defended a dissertation on the theme "Forming Psychological Stability of Paratroopers to the Influence of Factors of Modern Combat." Lieutenant Colonel V.Ye. Popov is successfully studying the problem of psychological orientation of servicemen after extreme pressure. A number of other works can also be cited that merit attention. In conclusion, I would like to note that, in our view, military psychology is on the verge of a stage of qualitative development, summarization of earlier results, and breaking up its content during the course of modern research into a new scientific discipline--military psychology of stress situations.
