The committee supervising the harvest and marketing campaign in Dhi Qar held an expanded meeting to discuss the campaign and the stages which have been covered so far. During this meeting, which was attended by Governor Salah 'Abbud Mahmud and heads of the administrative areas, the conferees affirmed the role of the subcommittees in following up the work of harvesters throughout the day and to urge and compel peasants and farmers to market all their crop and to take firm measures against those who fail to do so. The campaign for harvesting wheat and barley began in the plantations of al-Suwayyib, Saddamiyat al-Qurnah, and al-Nashwah in al-Basrah Governorate yesterday. During his supervision of the farmers, Governor Lutayyif Mahal Humud called for the best and maximum use of agricultural machines and for manual harvest of smaller areas.
