Cavallo met the Chilean president at La Moneda Palace, the Chilean government house. They reviewed the implementation of a number of bilateral projects including the construction of a tunnel, 2 km below the current one. After meeting with Frei, Cavallo emphasized that companies with the required equipment are interested in this project. Cavallo noted that these companies constructed the tunnel under the English Channel, linking France with England. The minister indicated that this project would be implemented through "an investment system involving tolls and contributions by both countries." A feasibility survey for constructing a border pass in the north is planned within the framework of integration. This project may begin in the city of Jama in Salta Province or the city of Sico in Jujuy Province. The chosen city will be linked with the Chilean city of Antofagasta. Chile is very interested in receiving Argentine gas supplies while our country is especially interested in increasing the volume of national products through ports on the Pacific Ocean. Cavallo announced that formal negotiations on the latest economic cooperation agreement will be held by the Argentine and Chilean Foreign Ministries within 30 days. Concerning the possibility of Chile joining Mercosur [Common Market of the South], Cavallo said Frei "did not express a final response," but "reacted favorably to the idea." Chile is fully concentrating its energies on joining NAFTA and still has strong reserves on some Mercosur points. Chile believes there must be a gradual advancement toward free trade because it has problems adjusting its agriculture, especially grains and meat. Cavallo accepted this idea, noting that "any advancement must be gradual because it is not possible to achieve zero tariffs in intraregional trade overnight." Cavallo emphasized that it is necessary to remove nontariff barriers which could "affect free trade." He noted that "realistic hygienic standards for vegetables and animals" alone should suffice. The minister said he trusts the free-trade zone will be achieved on 1 January 1995, as established in the Treaty of Asuncion, and expressed hopes that a final decision on a common tariff system will be well advanced by then.
