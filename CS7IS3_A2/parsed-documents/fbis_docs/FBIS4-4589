"A Russian Embassy official rang up the police department today to communicate its displeasure that police supplied information about third secretary Igor Makeev's flight to the United States,'' he said. "This created a negative image of Russia," the source quoted the embassy official as saying. The source said police responsible for finding Makeev also took Metropolitan Police Commissioner Chaisit Kanchanakit to task for releasing the unconfirmed information. "This is sensitive information, and in addition is still unconfirmed," the source said. Makeev, 39, left his apartment in Bangkok's Soi Saladaeng with a laptop computer believed to contain secret embassy information on March 22. Deputy police chief Pol. Gen. Phong-amat Amattayakun yesterday said the Russian Embassy had written to banking institutions and business concerns asking they cancel Makeev's credit card from March 25. Phong-amat deplored the embassy's action: "The Russian Embassy is withholding information that we need, making it hard for us to locate Makeev." Suspension of the credit card "makes it impossible for us to find out where Makeev makes payments using his card."
