Ye. Obukhov; UDC 535.37+621.373] [Abstract] Photophysical properties of a new complex active molecule 1.4-phenylen-2.2'bisoxazol (OPO) were examined. This molecule is capable of fluorescence and light generation in the wavelength region _l_=340 - 420 nm with a high quantum efficiency of fluorescence _g_=0.45-0.93 and low threshold pumping density in different solvents. It was demonstrated that the solvent affects the localization of the electron density of the atoms and fragments of the complex OPO molecule in the fundamental state. Because of changes in the distribution of the length of linkages in the cycles of the OPO molecules, when the hydrogen atom attacks the individual pair of electrons of the nitrogen atoms, the structure of excited electron singlet (S[.sup]*[/][.sup]i[/]) and triplet (T[.sub]i[/]) states and transitions, determining the photophysical characteristics of the complex compounds is changing. Spectral- fluorescence and generation characteristics of the complex heteroatomic molecule OPO in different solvents and in a gas phase were measured and computed. It was also demonstrated that increasing or decreasing of the pumping density in vapors, or changing the solvent properties, is related to a dynamic separation or overlapping of the light generation bands on transitions. A feasibility is demonstrated that the a priori- structural modeling method can be used for controlling the properties of the excited states and junctions.
