In the past four years, the overall state of the judiciary, the prosecutors' offices and of the prison service has not changed much, and representatives of the former regime continue to exercise their influence in these areas, VONS says in an open letter sent to Novak today, the content of which they revealed at a press conference. Representatives said they had been asking Novak to purge the judiciary in accordance with the law. They gave him their notes on 42 judges who had life appointments but who before November 1989 had "seriously and often more than once breached basic human rights by unjustly giving them unconditional prison sentences." The list was then reduced to 24 because some of the judges have left the judiciary. After negotiations with Novak ten more were removed from the list, but VONS insists that the remaining 14 should leave the judiciary. VONS is an organization founded by 16 charter 77 signatories in 1978 to protest against political imprisonments. Among them was Vaclav Havel, who has since 1989 asked for his membership to be revoked. In 1989 the organization had 32 members, now it has 23. VONS representative and Vice Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) Vaclav Benda said that he had told Premier Vaclav Klaus several days ago about VONS' demand that Novak be removed. Klaus is chairman of the Civic Democratic Party, the party which on the basis of coalition agreements was given the position of justice minister to fill. Klaus had not commented on his proposal, Benda said. VONS committee members said that Interior Minister Jiri Ruml, a VONS member, had also been informed of the organization's request.
