The average number of valence electrons N[.sub]eff[/] dependences of the spontaneous magnetostriction _o_[.sub]S[/] and the average magnetic moment �[.sub]FeCo[/] have been obtained, and it has been found that the _o_[.sub]S[/] takes a maximum at N[.sub]eff[/] = 8.1-8.2 where the �[.sub]FeCo[/] begins to decrease drastically. The generalized phonon densities of states (PDOS) were deduced from inelastic neutron scattering experiments, and the phonon softening phenomenon in amorphous Invar alloy was observed from phonon spectra.
