The appeal dated March 29 called on the Koreans in the North, South and overseas to turn out in the struggle to remove the danger of nuclear war and pave the way for peace and reunification of the country. Han Tok-su in a statement March 31 said if the nuclear war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique are tolerated, the whole territory of Korea will be laid waste and the Korean nation with a long history of five thousand years will suffer an irrevocable nuclear disaster in the present era. He urged the Japanese authorities to refrain from joining in the war provocation moves of the United States and the anti-national acts of the South Korean authorities, renounce the hostile policy toward the DPRK and immediately give up the repressive scheme against Chongnyon and the Koreans in Japan. He called on the compatriots under the influence of the "ROK Residents Association in Japan" to reject the treacherous forces and outside forces and join Chongnyon on the patriotic road, irrespective of ism and affiliation. "We will firmly unite with the compatriots in the North, South and overseas under the banner of `10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country', a great charter of national unity, and more vigorously fight to remove the danger of war and pave the way for peace and reunification of the country," Han Tok-su stated.
