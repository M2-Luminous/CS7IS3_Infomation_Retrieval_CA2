FR940927-0-00043 FR940927-0-00007 The Federal Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund (Federal Fund), which is administered by the Secretary through OSM, is financed by a reclamation fee assessed on every ton of mined coal. Expenditures from the Federal Fund are subject to appropriation by Congress. The Federal Fund is divided into Tribal or State and Federal shares with each Indian tribe or State under a federally approved reclamation program entitled to 50 percent of the reclamation fees collected from coal operations on Indian lands or within the State. Annually, the Indian tribes or States receive reclamation project construction grants and administrative grants from their share of the Federal Fund. Subject to OSM approval, Tribes and States are also authorized to create special interest-bearing Tribe or State trust accounts into which up to 10 percent of their annual grants can be deposited. These ``set-aside'' accounts may be used to achieve the priorities of section 403(a) of SMCRA after September 30, 1995, or be deposited into an acid mine drainage abatement and treatment fund. Noncoal AMLR projects can be undertaken by a Tribe or State under two scenarios, both of which are subject to OSM approval in the grants process. Prior to a Tribe or State certifying in accordance with section 411(a) of SMCRA that it has completed the reclamation of all eligible abandoned coal projects, it can expend Tribal or State share monies for those noncoal projects that are a hazard to public health and safety. After a Tribe or State has certified that it has completed reclamation of all eligible abandoned coal projects, it can then use the full amount of its Tribal or State share for abandoned noncoal mine land reclamation projects. Such noncoal projects include the construction of public facilities related to the coal or minerals industry. II. Background on the Navajo Nation Plan On May 16, 1988, the Secretary of the Interior approved, with one exception, the Navajo Nation plan as originally submitted in June 1983, resubmitted on September 6, 1983, and amended in February 1988. General background information on the Navajo Nation plan, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, the decision deferring any action on the Navajo Nation's proposal to assume the emergency response authority, and the approval of the Navajo Nation plan can be found in the May 16, 1988, Federal Register (53 FR 17186). Approval of the Navajo Nation plan is codified at 30 CFR 756.13. III. Proposed Amendment and Request for Concurrence With Certification of Completion of Coal Reclamation By letters dated April 7 and 22, 1994, the Navajo Nation submitted a proposed amendment to its AMLR plan pursuant to SMCRA (administrative record Nos. NA&hyph;207, NA&hyph;208, and NA&hyph;212). The Navajo Nation submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative with the intent of revising its AMLR plan so it could use AMR funds to reclaim remaining interim program coal sites and for noncoal reclamation purposes, including the construction of public facilities. Interim program coal sites are eligible lands and water mined after August 3, 1977, but prior to September 28, 1984 (the date the permanent Federal regulatory program took effect on Navajo Nation lands), for which available funds for reclamation or abatement pursuant to a bond or other form of financial guarantee or from any other source are not sufficient to provide for adequate abatement or reclamation at a site. The Navajo Nation proposed revisions to its AMLR Code of 1987 at (1) the introduction to the Navajo AMLR Code; (2) Title I, section 101, findings, and section 102, purposes; (3) Title II, sections 201(a), (b), (c) and (d), duties of the Navajo Abandoned Mine Lands Reclamation Department (NAMLRD); and (4) Title IV, sections 401(a), (b)(5), (b)(6), (c)(5) and (c)(8), Navajo AMR fund and purposes; section 402, reclamation fee; sections 403(a) and (b), objectives of the fund; section 404, eligible lands and water; sections 405(a), (b), (c), and (f), Tribal reclamation program; section 407, acquisition and reclamation of lands within the Navajo Nation adversely affected by past mining practices; section 408, liens; section 409, filling voids and sealing tunnels; section 410, emergency powers; section 411, certification of completion of coal reclamation; section 412, fund report; section 413, miscellaneous powers; and section 414, interagency cooperation.
