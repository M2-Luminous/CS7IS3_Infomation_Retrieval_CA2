The purpose of this committee will be to promote joint coordination and spell out, in detail, the frameworks, form, and extent of joint cooperation. In a statement to AL-DUSTUR, Dr. al-'Anani said His Majesty King Husayn and the Jordanian Government have constantly been calling for continued Jordanian-Palestinian coordination. He pointed out that the Jordanian-Palestinian committees formed earlier should be in permanent session to coordinate stands between the two sides, especially with regard to the question of Jerusalem. He added: We are waiting for the Palestinian side to name the members of the committee called for by Faysal al-Husayni. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry has also welcomed the formation of this committee. A responsible source said the formation of a permanent committee is very important for continued, fruitful Jordanian-Palestinian coordination in the face of Israeli policy and negotiators. He added that coordination should not be limited to the Jordanian and Palestinian sides, but should extend to all the Arab parties taking part in the peace process.
