The official made the comment in connection with the problems involving North Korea's alleged development of nuclear weapons. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Japan would be unable to evacuate an estimated 8,000 Japanese nationals living in South Korea if hostilities broke out there, unless SDF ships were made available in addition to government planes. Private planes or ships will not go to places where hostilities are occurring, he said.

Offering his personal view, the official added Japan should also be able to evacuate South Koreans who have permanent resident status in Japan.
