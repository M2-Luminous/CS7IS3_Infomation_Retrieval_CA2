Voznesenskiy and V. Domovidov, identified by caption] [Text] [170848] [Voznesenskiy over video of Kozyrev arrival at Vladivostok airport] The Maritime Kray Administration had a special stake in the meeting of the heads of the Russian and U.S. foreign policy deparments at Vladivostok airport. The point is that the situation around the construction of installations for reprocessing liquid nuclear waste from our nuclear submarines has become deadlocked: On the one hand the Japanese are ready to share this problem with us, and provide us with both money and equipment. But on one condition only.... [Ye. Nozdratenko, head of Maritime Kray Administration, identified by caption] Namely that this installation is built in Maritime Kray and that the money goes to the Maritime Kray Administration without the involvement of any central organs. That is to say that all work is carried out directly, without any middlemen, under Japanese supervision. [Voznesenskiy] Well, he who pays the piper calls the tune. Maritime Kray Governor Yevgeniy Nozdratenko said that he has secured Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's support and that the construction of the first such installation, offered by the Japanese company Nissho Iwai, at Bolshoy Kamen's "Zvezda" nuclear submarine repair plant is an entirely realistic proposition. Another installation of this kind is to be built at a Pacific Fleet nuclear waste storage facility.
