The primary task of the newly-founded body, called "China Phonographic Association" (CPA), is to protect phonographic product copyrights, Liu Guowei, chairman of the association, told XINHUA. He said that in the protection of copyrights, it will firmly adhere to both the relevant Chinese laws and international conventions and fight against any activities of piracy and infringement. All copyrights, membership or non-membership, domestic or overseas, should be protected by his association, he said. He noted that piracy is a complicated problem. And most of the master compact discs are coming from overseas, but China hopes to make joint efforts with all foreign countries to crack down on piracy, he said. But, he pointed out, China will not keep silent at any groundless attacks regarding the matter, referring to the denunciation by the British FINANCIAL TIMES on June 2 saying, "worldwide sales of pirate compact discs doubled to 75 million units last year, almost exclusively as a result of unauthorized production in China." He said that the fact is overstated and distorted by the British newspaper. The chairman said that the latest statistics compiled by the CPA show that although China has 30 compact disc production lines, the total output has so far been no more than 20 million yearly. "We hope the British newspaper makes corrections of the error in a responsible way," he said. The chairman concluded that his association is taking part in a nationwide campaign launched by the central government against infringement and piracy.
