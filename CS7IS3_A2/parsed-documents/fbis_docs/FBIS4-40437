Vyacheslav Belous, the union chairman, made this statement in Kiev Wednesday. Kiev wants Crimea to rescind the original wording of its 6 May 1992 Constitution that calls for a treaty-based relationships between Crimea and Ukraine and enables the Crimean residents to have dual citizenship. Belous said that his organization would support Leonid Kravchuk in the 26 June elections. The Officers' Union, he said, opposes the attempts that anti-state forces inside and outside the Supreme Soviet mount to eliminate or disable the presidency in Ukraine. It regards the president as the guarantor of the country's unity and independence. The Ukrainian Officers' Union has a membership of about 10,000.
