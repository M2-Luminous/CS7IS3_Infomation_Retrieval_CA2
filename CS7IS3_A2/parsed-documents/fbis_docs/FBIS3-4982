The South decided earlier to propose to the North that they jointly apply to host the World Cup, but has not yet conveyed its intention because of their frozen relations resulting from the North Korean nuclear problem. South and North Korea on Thursday met at the truce village of Panmunjom for a working-level contact on exchanging special envoys. As soon as South Korea succeeded in qualifying for its third consecutive World Cup last October -- a first in Asia -- it launched a full-fledged drive to host the 2002 soccer World Cup. The preparatory committee seeking to host the World Cup tournament plans to contact several international sports organizations including FIFA, soccer's world governing body, and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ask them to help South and North Korea win the right. The government also plans to propose the creation of a unified Korean team for this year's Hiroshima Asian Games slated for October, and resumption of the unification soccer matches between South and North Korea, when full-fledged inter-Korean talks begin.
