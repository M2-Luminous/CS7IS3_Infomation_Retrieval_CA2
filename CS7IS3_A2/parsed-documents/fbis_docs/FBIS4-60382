Because, very often big power interests influence the issuance and implementation of these resolutions. Perhaps, Iraq is foremost among world states that have responded positively by fulfilling its obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 687, as admitted by UN Special Commission Chairman Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, who acknowledged Iraq's full cooperation with the council. The question now is: Since the United States pressured the council to pass that resolution in order to impose an unfair blockade on the Iraqi people, and it has kept demanding for several years that Iraq must first implement that resolution, which links the lifting of the blockade to Iraqi fulfillment of its obligations under the resolution, and since the United States has spoken clearly in those terms, why is it now raising political issues and aims that have nothing to do with Resolution 687, whose Paragraph (22) permits Iraq to export oil once it has fulfilled its obligations? This clearly shows that Washington is pursuing a double standard policy and that it will not hesitate to commit the most hideous crimes, such as the unfair blockade it has imposed on the Iraqi people, in order to achieve its aggressive designs against peoples that struggle for their freedom and dignity. It is now clear to the whole world that two standards are being followed with regard to UN resolutions: First, an objective standard that calls for strict implementation of a clear resolution, and this is the standard upheld by the majority of world nations and most UN Security Council member states. Second, a standard based on a hostile and biased attitude toward Resolution 687 in order to harm the Iraqi people, and this is the dirty standard followed by the United States, the Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers, and other pro-U.S. regimes. These vile people do not care about anything in the world other than devising the most hideous ways in order to harm the Iraqi people and to commit crimes against them. Resolution 687 is clear and frank. It places certain obligations on Iraq as well as on the Security Council. Now that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations, justice, fairness, and international legitimacy and legality, which Washington often brags about, oblige the Security Council to honor its obligations toward Iraq by lifting the unfair blockade, which is no longer justifiable following the removal of all the causes which are supposed to have led to the passing of Resolution 687. Washington's procrastination and attempts to circumvent the resolution in order to bar the council from honoring its obligations toward Iraq by lifting the unfair blockade, and its claim about "a constant Iraqi threat" in order to blackmail Saudi and Kuwaiti rulers and to plunder the wealth of the Arab people, who have been afflicted by those traitorous rulers, are poor and ridiculous excuses which cannot maintain any form of stability and security in the region, and they will certainly not guarantee the legitimate interests of Washington and other powers in the region. The wall of the blockade will certainly collapse through the solid will of the Iraqis and their great leader Saddam Husayn. The unfair ones will only reap failure and disappointment.
