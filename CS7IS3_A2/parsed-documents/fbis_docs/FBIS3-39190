In Brussels, NATO is looking into the issue of air strikes against Serbian positions in the hills around Sarajevo. As these reports flooded into the news room it was hard to suppress a feeling of "deja vu." Exactly six months ago yesterday, on 9 August 1993, the 16 ambassadors to the North Atlantic Treaty Association (NATO) sat around a table to talk about possible military action against the Serbs besieging Sarajevo. There are two reasons why a real ultimatum was never issued. First, internal disagreement in NATO, namely resistance from the French, meant that action was impossible. Second, at the eleventh hour the Serbs resolved to pull out of Mount Igman and Mount Bjelasnica from where they had their guns trained on Sarajevo. And so history repeats itself, more or less. Yesterday the NATO ambassadors were debating once again possible air strikes, and once again the summit was not immediately a picture of unanimity. However, this time NATO did manage to issue a clear ultimatum. The Serbs, with the international community breathing down their necks, yesterday sought, just as they had last year, to quickly pour oil on troubled waters by demonstrating their willingness to withdraw their heavy artillery and by signing a hasty cease-fire with the Muslim Forces defending Sarajevo. The question now is whether the West will again let itself be wrapped up in a series of empty Serbian promises. After all, in August of last year Serbian Leader Radovan Karadzic promised a stage-by-stage handover of the hills to the United Nations. Half a year later they are still encamped in the hills and are responsible for daily deaths on the streets of Sarajevo. NATO is now asking the Serbs to stick to their promises. They must tie the Serbian proposals to a concrete deadline -- preferably as short as possible -- and make it crystal clear to the Serbs what the military sanctions will be should they break their promises. An ultimatum can help in this, but it must not be the umpteenth deadline that passes with no action being taken. That would be a fatal blow for the credibility of NATO and the international community. NATO must be prepared to accept the military consequences of its ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs. Separate from the issue of the military rights and wrongs of air strikes, there is no getting away from the fact that NATO's tougher stance has come extremely late in the day. The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is, after all, precisely two years old. If, in the spring of 1992, NATO, the United Nations, and the European Union had bared their teeth and made it clear that they were serious, then maybe the conflict in Bosnia would not have escalated to the point it has today. After all, NATO's action is now restricted merely to dousing the flames instead of preventing the fire.
