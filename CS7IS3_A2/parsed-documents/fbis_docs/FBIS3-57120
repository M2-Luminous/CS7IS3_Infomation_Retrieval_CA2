The plan was endorsed by the ruling Latvia's Way - Farmers' Union coalition, the Concord for Latvia faction, the Democratic Party faction and the Equality of Rights (Lidztiesiba) faction. The Latvian National Independence Movement faction, the Homeland and Freedom, and the Christian Democrats Union factions, however, proposed to postpone the approvement until the draft's "conceptual re-arrangement." The budget lacks clearcut concepts for the defense sphere and the local administration, said Alexander Kirsteins of the Independence Movement. The government adjusted the planned incomes to the chaotically developing economy, said Equality of Rights' Larisa Lavina, who objected to the plan's economic motivation. On the other hand, the budget plan duly reflects "the budget of a small, economically haphazard country" that earns almost nothing from industry and foreign investments, said Concord's leader Edvins Kide. The debate corresponded to the general world practice -- the ruling coalition tried to persuade the critical opposition into approving a project, said Andrejs Pantelejevs, the head of the Latvia's Way faction.
