In congratulating the reporters on the occasion of the new year, Press Secretary Aram Abrahamyan said: [Begin Abrahamyan recording] As is already known to you, an unprecedented escalation of military operations has been taking place in Nagorno--Karabakh since 18 December. Having rejected every peace plan, Azerbaijan is launching fierce offensives all along the Karabakh-Azerbaijan front. The Azerbaijani infringements have taken place against our Republic in recent days. The political assessment of these operations has already been made in the statements issued by the Republic's president and government. Azerbaijan is again entertaining the illusion that the problem could be solved by military means. The neighboring country is always paying dearly to be convinced that such illusions do not conform with reality. Regarding our position, Armenia has always realized that there is no military solution to the problem. Therefore, the Armenian leadership will use all the possibilities, even the infinitesimal ones, at its disposal to make the problem a political one. [end recording] Regarding Armenian-Russian relations, the press secretary said that they are stable and practical. As you know, the Armenian prime minister was in Moscow at the beginning of this year. The result was positive on the three main issues under discussion: the nuclear power plant, unfreezing of credits, and trade-economic relations between the countries in 1994. Mr. Abrahamyan referred to the reoperation of the gas pipeline entering Armenia through Georgia. It is obvious that in this case also we are dealing with one of the worst manifestations of the Azerbaijani militaristic policy. The neighboring republic is sending terrorist and sabotage groups to another country, in this case Georgia, and is blowing up the only gas pipeline entering Armenia and is mining the area around the pipeline. The Armenian Government is taking various measures to resolve the gas pipeline issue. Following the meeting between the three deputy prime ministers of Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, there was a possibility that mine cleaning work would begin. However, certain problems have arisen between the bordering Armenian and Azerbaijani villages, delaying the mine cleaning work. Mr. Abrahamyan informed reporters of the difficulties of obtaining fuel by the Georgian railway. Stable state structures have not yet taken shape in Georgia and the state is not in full control of the situation. Talks with the Georgian Government are continuing at various levels, and there is positive movement on the issues under discussion. The press secretary noted that U.S. colleagues have not yet succeeded in bringing heating oil to Armenia as part of humanitarian assistance. As you also know, the Armenian president called for a Supreme Council meeting on 12 January to discuss the 1994 program for privatization. This program, as well as the 1994 socio-economic plan submitted to the parliament, arise from the situation prevailing in our Republic. There are plans to private a total of 15 percent of the industrial enterprises. Abrahamyan said: We hope that this will stimulate the development of industry. The press secretary also said that Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan will leave for Zangezur [southern Armenia] on 11 January. The next day, an extraordinary session of the Coordination Council on Armenian-Iranian ties will be held in Megri. In addition to the members of the council, representatives from all the interested organizations, local authorities, customs posts, border guards, and business circles in both countries have also been invited to the meeting. It is expected that [Iranian charge d'affaires in Yerevan] Ahmad Sobhani and [Armenian charge d'affaires in Tehran] Vahan Bayburdyan will also take part in the meeting. The entire complex of Armenian-Iranian economic-trade ties will be examined, such as the construction of the bridge, transit transportation, border trade, the normal functioning of customs posts, and so on.
