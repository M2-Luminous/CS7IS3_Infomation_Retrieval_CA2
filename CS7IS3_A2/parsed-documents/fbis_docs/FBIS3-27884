He added that it is the United States that led to a stalemate in the Uruguay Round financial services negotiations. Yim said Washington threatened to take the exemption from the most favored nation (MFN) status, an act which is a violation of a universal principle of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. "The United States declared in the Uruguay Round negotiations that it will adopt a two-tier approach to deny MFN status to countries that Washington argues reject full national treatment and market access to U.S. financial services companies," Yim said. If the United States had stuck to the MFN principle, the multilateral financial services agreement would have been reached in Geneva last December, Yim said. In an apparent displeasure over the US trade representative's [USTR] comment on Korea and Japan as "free riders" in financial services, Yim said the purpose of the USTR is to open foreign markets. Kantor made a special reference to Korea and Japan as free riders out of attempt to maximize "announcement effect" in prodding these countries into opening further their financial markets. He said it is regrettable for the USTR to complain over the Korean financial market while the U.S. Treasury Department does not make any comment. Korea is one of a few countries where a large number of U.S. financial firms are operating. As the Korean and Japanese markets are attractive, the USTR seeks to open their financial markets wider, he said. Yim said the USTR is not interested in African countries where few or no American firms are operating. Why does the United States complain that Korea is unwilling to open its financial market at a time when the nation has been accelerating the implementation of the financial reform plan? Yim said it is because American firms can find "attractive business opportunities" here. Yim acknowledged that Seoul has not accommodated part of the U.S. requests because some of its proposals are "out of tune with international practices." For example, the United States wants American bank branches here to use head office capital as their branch capital. But even Germany and France do not accept this request. "As Korea has no power to inspect head offices of foreign banks here, it can not check the credit worthiness of each bank. Thus it is unreasonable for American banks to try to link their head office capital to Korean operations," he said. Asked to comment on what action Seoul will take if Washington takes a retaliatory step against Korea, Yim said "it is the last thing we want". But "we do not want a situation where the United States retains the right to restrict operations of Korean firms in the United States while American financial firms are expanding business here." In the Uruguay Round, "We made it clear that if any country restricts the overseas activities of Korean financial firms, we will take a similar reciprocal retaliatory action against the financial firms from the specific country, Yim said. [no end quotation mark as published] If Washington seeks to take an exemption from the MFN standing to discriminate against specific countries, other GATT member countries will take similar actions, adding that the United States will face international criticism for violating the basic principle of the GATT, Yim said.
