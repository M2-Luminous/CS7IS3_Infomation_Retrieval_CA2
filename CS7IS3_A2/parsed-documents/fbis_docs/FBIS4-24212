He was referring to the conclusion of discussions on housing. Joao Lourenco said, however, that we cannot expect the peace talks to conclude anytime soon. Regarding mediators and observers who approached South African President Nelson Mandela for assistance, Joao Lourenco said all this can be summed in one sentence: Things are complicated in Lusaka. [Begin Lourenco recording] I interpret the decision to approach South African President Nelson Mandela for assistance as a sign that things in Lusaka are complicated. Things are complicated. Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola, feels that talks are dragging on. An agreement should have been reached long ago. Before being sworn in as the president of South Africa, Dr. Nelson Mandela expressed interest in assisting the Angolan people in the best way possible. I believe it was on the basis of that interest that Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye approached President Mandela in order to help reach a successful conclusion of the Angolan peace talks as soon as possible. [end recording] Nelson Mandela is a well-known figure worldwide, and South Africa is a regional power. Joao Lourenco said these two factors can help to pressure Jonas Savimbi to lay down arms. President Nelson Mandela agreed to cooperate. He will not come in with new diplomatic initiatives. He will only reinforce the ongoing process. The ruling party is happy with Nelson Mandela's readiness. His readiness was welcomed by the MPLA. [Begin Lourenco recording] We welcomed his readiness to assist. We think -- we have always said this -- every form of assistance, every step that can truly contribute to the Angolan people finding a lasting peace as soon as possible is welcome. [end recording] Speaking about the Lusaka peace talks, Joao Lourenco said that at present there is a positive sign. He said there is no information about the accord at the present, however.
