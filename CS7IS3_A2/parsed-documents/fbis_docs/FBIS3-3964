Please tell me about the status of this effort. [Wu] Faced with the constantly developing reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, everybody has a sense of urgency, and the CPPCC is no exception. How to duly give play to its role as an organization of the most extensive patriotic united front of the Chinese people and an important organ of multiparty cooperation under the leadership of the CPC and political consultation in developing the socialist market economy, promoting the building of socialist democracy, deepening reform, and safeguarding social stability is an important task before the CPPCC. In the past year, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, the CPPCC National Committee has seriously summed up the past work of several CPPCC National Committees and, on this basis, has energetically explored a new path for the work of the CPPCC under the new situation. As pointed out by Chairman Li Ruihuan: The new situation and the new tasks have set new demands on the CPPCC. The new CPPCC National Committee should always take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guideline, should gain a thorough understanding of the important position and role of the CPPCC in the new period, should keep abreast of the new situation, should explore a new path, and should make new contributions. [RENMIN RIBAO] How do you, as a vice chairman of the CPPCC, assess the work of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee over the past year? [Wu] The Eighth CPPCC National Committee has made a good start in this first year. New progress has been made in all kinds of work. Many personalities at home and in the international community have gained a fresh understanding of the CPPCC, and people have begun to attach importance to and pay attention to the activities and role of the current CPPCC National Committee. All this has created favorable conditions for the further development of the CPPCC. It should be said that this is the outcome of the concerted efforts of all CPPCC units involved and all CPPCC members. [RENMIN RIBAO] Please detail the new characteristics of the CPPCC's work over the past year. [Wu] First of all, the understanding and activities of the Standing Committee in discussing and taking part in state affairs have been strengthened. Meetings of the CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee are the main form for fulfilling the duties of political consultation and democratic supervision during the adjournment of the plenary sessions and represent an important channel for various democratic parties, non-party democrats, various people's organizations, and personalities of various nationalities and circles to discuss and take part in state affairs. Over the past year, the CPPCC National Committee held five Standing Committee meetings for consultation and discussion about the economic situation of the country and the measures to be taken, the international situation, establishing the socialist market economic structure, strengthening the building of honest administration in state organs, punishing corruption, and so on. Zhu Rongji, Qian Qichen, Wen Jiabao, Wei Jianxing, and other leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council attended the meetings, made reports, and took part in the consultations. With a patriotic heart toward the state and the people, the members of the Standing Committee opened their minds, frankly aired their views, contributed excellent measures, and put forward good suggestions and proposals. We seriously put these suggestions and proposals in order and reported to the relevant departments in good time. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council attached importance to the suggestions and proposals. Second, the role of the special committees have been strengthened further. The CPPCC special committees are working organs for organizing the CPPCC members to carry out regular activities and are basic links for fulfilling the duties of political consultation and democratic supervision and for doing a good job in discussing and participating in state affairs. Over the past year, the planning, standardization, timeliness, and effectiveness of the work of various special committees have been markedly improved, and the initiative and enthusiasm of CPPCC members have been further brought into play. Many investigation reports provided by the special committees have produced good economic results and social benefits. Third, guidance to and cooperation with local CPPCC organs have been strengthened to a certain extent. There are altogether 3,041 local CPPCC organs with 460,000 members at various levels. Closing ties between the CPPCC National Committee and the local CPPCC organs is conducive to giving play to the strong points of the CPPCC as a whole in jointly promoting the development of the CPPCC's cause. Over the past year, the CPPCC National Committee has attached importance to its ties and cooperation with local CPPCC organs. For example, in making study tours of various localities, main leaders of the CPPCC National Committee have, without exception, "visited CPPCC organs, met CPPCC members, and discussed matters concerning the CPPCC"; some special committees have held informal discussions on common issues in work and have carried out joint investigations and study on some important issues. Fourth, the work of improving organs has been strengthened. Over the past year, we have paid attention to strengthening work to improve the ideology and work style of the CPPCC organs. Everybody has worked hard to bring about the good common practice of energetically making progress, stressing efficiency, unity, cooperation, honesty, and of being realistic. [RENMIN RIBAO] Over the past year, the CPPCC National Committee has carried out relatively active friendly exchanges with foreign countries. Can you tell me something about this situation? [Wu] The CPPCC National Committee's exchanges with foreign countries are an important part of China's diplomacy. In exchanges with foreign countries, the National Committee can give play to its special strength of being both "an official and a popular" organization. It can have high-level contacts with parliaments of various countries and can also establish ties with popular organizations. Since the First Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, the CPPCC National Committee has energetically widened the scope of its exchanges with foreign countries and has developed activities with foreign countries. From the end of November to the beginning of last December, Chairman Li Ruihuan made an official friendly visit to three Southeast Asian countries and achieved complete success. Besides, Vice Chairmen Ye Xuanping, Seypidin Aze, Hong Xuezhi, Hu Sheng, Qian Weichang, Sun Fuling, and myself also visited some countries one after another. In the past year, the CPPCC National Committee has also played host to delegations from some countries.
