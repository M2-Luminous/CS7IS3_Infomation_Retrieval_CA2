The leader said: The central authorities' policy decision on strengthening and improving macroregulation and control is entirely necessary and correct. Nevertheless, the task of solving outstanding contradictions and problems is still quite arduous. Some advances have been made in controlling the scale of investment in fixed assets and readjusting the investment structure in the previous stage. However, overall, the action we have taken in this regard is very limited. Those projects which ought to be suspended or postponed have not been suspended or postponed. Problems such as an overexpanded scale of production and an overextended construction front still exist. If this situation continues to develop, this will be detrimental to both the local and overall situations. This being the case, all localities and departments must genuinely unify their thinking and actions on the central authorities' major policy decision on strengthening and improving macroregulation and control; take resolute and powerful measures to solve problems in fixed assets investment; seriously examine, check, and prioritize the projects under construction; and effectively ensure that funds are concentrated on key projects. The leader said: It is necessary to put newly launched projects under strict control, effectively strengthen the macro management of real estate and development zones, earnestly and comprehensively screen real estate companies of all types, and stipulate that the government will withdraw land from real estate companies whose development capital is less than 25 percent of their land purchase funds or sell their land within a year, they are prohibited from selling their land if their development capital is less than 20 percent of the land purchase funds, and, in future, in commercial developments by real estate companies, the proportion of residential housing units with minimal profits should not be less than 20 percent of the total. Efforts should be made to standardize the source of independently raised investment funds and strengthen supervision of the use of foreign loans. At present, a considerable amount of independently raised funds has exceeded the ceiling set by previous stipulations concerning the source of independently raised funds. A strict definition should be made to standardize the source of independently raised funds. Taking on foreign loans should be approved, and it is necessary to expedite reform of the investment structure and pay close attention to investment legislation. According to another news report, the State Council recently made clear that the power to make industrial policy is that of the State Council, and the State Planning Commission is the relevant industrial policy management department specifically in charge of the study, formulation, and implementation of industrial polices. Other relevant departments in charge of comprehensive economic management and specialized departments also shoulder corresponding responsibilities, and departments concerned and localities should coordinate with them in many ways. A State Council leader said: In the new situation, to do a good job of industrial policy, it is first of all necessary to have a firm grasp of the overall situation and stress the main points. Efforts should be made to comprehensively develop agriculture, strengthen the construction of infrastructure and basic industries, and invigorate the four pillar industries of machinery and electronics, the petrochemical industry, auto manufacturing, and the building industry. Next, it is necessary to have a clear picture of the market, meet the needs of the market, guide the market, and regulate and control the market. All sides concerned should coordinate with each other in this regard under unified policy decisions. Finally, it is necessary to strengthen standard basic rules and regulations.
