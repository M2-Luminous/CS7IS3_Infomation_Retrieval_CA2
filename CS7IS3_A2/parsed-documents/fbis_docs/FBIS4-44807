This is the basic problem with which the computer builder has been wrestling ever since the privatization decree was signed. What the company needs to demonstrate more than anything else is stability, but just recently it has closed out the 1993 accounting year with net losses of Fr5.07 billion (including Fr1.65 billion in provisions for restructuring) on turnover that had dropped 6.4 percent to Fr28.25 billion. Although the minister for industry has discussed the French company with NEC, the Japanese manufacturer's response has been cautious. One of its spokespersons said on Wednesday that Bull had not presented any specific offer. NEC also prefers to refrain from comment on the interest that was expressed (in LA TRIBUNE) by Peter Bonfield, CEO of ICL (whose principal shareholder is Fujitsu), in Bull's systems integration and facilities management divisions. In addition to other steps taken by management to put the company back into the black, Bull is banking heavily on Pegasus, which Armand Malka, director of Bull's Unix division, describes as "a major project." This new Unix multiprocessor, based on the PowerPC 601 and scheduled to go on the market in early June, should quickly boost the builder's profit margins. Made possible by an accord reached in early 1992 with IBM but designed almost entirely by Bull, Pegasus represents the company's biggest R&D project. Absorbing close to Fr600 million per year (or 25 percent of the total R&D budget), it also provides jobs to 250 people involved in the project--on the hardware side, at the research centers in Pregnana, Italy; and on the software side, for design of the future AIX 4.1 operating system, at the Echirolles center near Grenoble. Bull hopes to develop a chain of OEM [original equipment manufacturer] resellers, principally American firms, to sell these computers built in Angers. "With Pegasus, we are finally going to be able to met 80 percent of the needs," explains Armand Malka. Bull is still counting on the next-generation PowerPC 604 and 620 to satisfy needs in the high-end market.
