On the one hand, communards are persistently anathematized, while on the other hand factories are being stolen, whereby the former serves to ensure that no one objects to the latter. The recently announced unification of the Social Democratic Party [Stranka] of Croatia [SDSH or SDH] and the Social Democratic Party [Partija] of Croatia [SDPH; formerly SDP, Party of Democratic Changes] has been a frequent subject of newspaper articles and commentaries in recent days. Regardless of the connotations of the more or less well-intentioned articles, it is a fact that the unification of the local right, and then of the left as well, means that the Croatian political scene is experiencing the beginnings of a process of fermentation and crystallization of the numerous representatives of the political will of the nation into a few basic parties that are recognizable in civic democracies. We discussed the unification of the SDH and SDP with Antun Vujic, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia, during his recent visit to Osijek. [Kraml] What does the unification with Racan's party mean for the SDH and for you personally? [Vujic] The unification of the SDH and SDP is a constructive act which should finally give Croatia a democratic left and a democratic right. There is no center. For example, the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] is not the center, but rather a way of organizing power. In addition, the unification has made a reality out our expectations, meaning that the former League of Communists of Croatia has been social-democratized and the preconditions for much broader activity have been created, whereby the SDSH contributes an additional, authentic, social democratic image, while the SDPH contributes the best features that "settled out" from the last multiparty elections. [Kraml] What are the essential and organizational points of reference under which the partially united Croatian left will act, and who all can become a member of it? [Vujic] Our essential task is to represent labor and workers, because we are in fact all united on the question of the state. If the aspiration for greater social justice and broader democracy means that you are a communard, then that is what I am, but so is the vast majority of people. On the one hand, communards are persistently anathematized, while on the other hand factories are being stolen, whereby the former serves to ensure that no one objects to the latter. Our doors are open to everyone, except those who have not yet cleared up the issue of an independent Croatia and who think that social democracy is some other form of ideological labeling. To be more precise, there is no room in the unified left for Horvat's SDU [Social Democratic Union] and Suvar until they fully separate social democracy from Yugoslav orthodoxy and old-style communism. [Kraml] What does the recent announcement of a confederation with Bosnia-Herzegovina mean for the SDH? [Vujic] The problem is not the confederation, but rather the question of why we have not fought for that, together with the Muslims, over the past two years. Naturally, part of the blame rests with the Muslim side, but also with many people on our side. We are now getting a trimmed-back version of what we should have gotten together as a whole. Someone is to blame for one of the most tragic political mistakes in Croatian history. It is the people to whom destroying bridges is more important than moving forward across them, together. Everyone should have known that Bosnia-Herzegovina is older than the idea of its partition. [Kraml] What does a unified Croatian left offer Croatia? [Vujic] It offers the notion that everything will be different, i.e., normal. That workers will have workers' rights, businessmen businessmen's rights, that science will be autonomous, that people will not be evicted from their apartments, that farmers will finally get the land that belongs to them, not to Hapsburgs and to people who fled Croatia, only for their patriotism to awaken at a moment when they thought that they could acquire something quickly. The left can also resolve all national issues on a higher-quality basis so that the Croatian state remains whole and internationally recognized. [Kraml] What human resources is the Croatian left counting on in the future in executing its program goals? [Vujic] Once the left finally gets going, it will be joined by half of the HDZ members and half of the HSP [Croatian Rights Party] members, because they too are Croatian workers--in larger numbers than all those who are currently regarded as majority Croats.
