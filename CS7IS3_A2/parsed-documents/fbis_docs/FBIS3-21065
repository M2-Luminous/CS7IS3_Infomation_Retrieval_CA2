They break down a variety of undesirable compounds like ammonia and highly toxic problem materials. The simulation of growth processes in the tanks is necessary in the investigation of decomposition processes. Wolfgang Tappe of the Forschungszentrum Juelich GmbH (Institute for Biotechnology IBT 3, 52425 Juelich) has now developed a bioreactor system which is suitable for these tasks. As Tappe reported in Juelich, bacteria have a very low growth rate in the soil and in the water as well as in purification plants. The supply of nutrients is often so low that it allows bacteria only to survive but not to grow. The investigation of these processes in important in view of the role of bacteria in decomposing toxic materials. But with conventional bioreactor systems the simulation of such growth conditions is either impossible or possible only to a very limited degree. In a continuouly operating laboratory bioreactor a certain amount of fresh nutrient solution is added per unit of time and the corresponding amount of used medium removed. In the process biomass is lost which must be replaced by the growth of bacteria in the reactor. But if the maximal growth rate of the organisms is very low the danger exists that the lost biomass cannot be replaced. In activated sludge plants the medium generation spans are between 150 and 500 hours, and thus are relatively long. Conventional bioreactor systems are often overextended in simulating these growth conditions. Since the addition of nutrient solution in this case is very low, it sometimes happens that an even distribution in the reactor is not achieved. The result is that the bacterial population is no longer homogeneous. Some bacteria grow more rapidly than others. In the Juelich reactor the solution of this problem involves reservation of the biomass. The main difference in comparison to conventional, continuously running reactors is the separately arranged filtration module. That is where the used medium is filtered while retaining the bacteria. The filtration is not simple, since the round filter tends to become clogged. Tappe solved this problem with a cross-flow technique. Close over the membrane is a revolving magnetic stirring rod, which creates a current moving diagonally to the direction of filtration (cross-flow). With this device clogging can be successfully prevented. The module is surrounded by a refined steel housing and is connected to the reactor container by means of tubing and pumps. In this way a continuous addition of nutrients can be achieved without loss of biomass, and bacteria with very low growth rates can be investigated. These growth conditions are very close to the actual conditions in activated sludge tanks. The filtration module of the Juelich system can also be used for on-line supervision of purification plants. It provides a sample free of biomass from which chemical parameters can be determined.
