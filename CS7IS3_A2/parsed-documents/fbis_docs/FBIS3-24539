Certain epoxides -- ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, in particular -- serve as the raw material for the synthesis of many polymer- chemistry materials. An active enzyme system that catalyzes the reaction of formation of those epoxides is found solely in microorganisms that use gaseous alkanes as the carbon source. Microorganisms that use propane and butane as the carbon source, however, are little studied, although papers devoted to propane- utilizing microorganisms first appeared in the early 1980s and, in the last two years, have focused on the study of the metabolism of propane and various enzymes. Interest in the distinctive properties of an enzyme system that effects a reaction of hydrooxidation prompted the researchers here to isolate strains of microorganisms that grow on propane, describe the strains, and study the conditions underlying the cultivation of the microorganisms to produce a biomass that can be used in the reaction associated with the epoxidation of propylene into propylene oxide. Out of 85 cultures studied, they managed to produce a culture -- Rhodococcus erythropolis 3/89 -- that, when grown in an atmosphere of propane, evidenced an active monooxygenase enzyme system in the cells of the microorganisms, the system being capable of catalyzing the sought-after epoxidation. The culture uses alcohols (C[.sup]2[/]-C[.sub]4[/]), the monosaccharide C[.sup]6[/], and disaccharides, as well as the salts of certain organic acids. References 22: 2 Russian, 20 Western.
