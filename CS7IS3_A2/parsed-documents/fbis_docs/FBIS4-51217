"This has paved the way for the rapid regional economic development," said a regional official. Nowadays, it is easy to find a telephone either on a street or in a hotel. Mobile phones and radio pagers are commonly seen in this capital of the region. According to Xu Dingyuan, deputy director of the city telecommunications bureau, the region has telephone exchanges with a combined capacity of about 30,000 lines at present, up from only 50 lines in the 1950s and 300 lines in the 1970s. "The telephone capacity will surpass 40,000 lines next year," he said. At present, the telephone capacity in Lhasa tops 15,000 lines. That means every 10 people can have a telephone. Located on the "roof of the world", Tibet plans to expand its satellite ground stations from the present 56 to 80 to further link its remote areas with other parts of the country and the rest of the world. Xu attributed the rapid development of telecommunications in the region to the support of the state, other provinces and overseas. He explained that the state has allocated 200 million yuan to Tibet in this field in the 1991-1995 period, and Lhasa's first 5,000-line program-controlled telephone exchange has been sent by the Belgian Government as a gift.
