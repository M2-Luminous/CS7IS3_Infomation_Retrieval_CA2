FBIS3-11105 "drlat051__a94005" FBIS-LAT-94-051-A Document Type:Daily Report 10 Mar 1994 ANNEX Argentina Trade Partnerships With Mercosur, NAFTA Viewed PY1003220294 Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish 10 Mar 94 Economic Section p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY1003220294 Buenos Aires LA NACION Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Article by Paz Tejerina] [Text] Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella on 9 March forecast that if Argentina is on the list of countries chosen by the United States to join NAFTA, "we would not be able to join it until 1987." Bilateral negotiations with Washington to join NAFTA will not harm Mercosur [Common Market of the South], he added. The Argentine position, however, is still undefined. The economic plan launched by Brazil in the past few days created expectations among the negotiators and even a political position in Brazil in the face of its new international situation. The truth is that Argentina continues to strongly defend Mercosur even though the other member countries turn their back on the agreement. The importation of subsidized wheat from the United States and Canada is an example of this. Foreign Trade Under Secretary Carlos Kesman said he will again ask the Brazilian Government to apply compensatory rights for the measure. Since 9 March, Argentine and Brazilian negotiators have put on the table in the Argentine Foreign Ministry the policies they must follow during the next 10 or 20 years. Now that Brazil finds itself supported by an economic plan, it will attempt to turn away from its previous policies. In principle, there are two subjects that must be discussed: On the one hand, whether Argentina should join NAFTA together with the rest of the Mercosur member countries. On the other hand, whether to establish a more flexible system by which each country could individually negotiate its membership. How will this mechanism be applied? The Argentine negotiators answered this with complete silence. Now, what is the position chosen by Argentina? Kesman answered: "For the time being we will join NAFTA together with Mercosur." Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo believes the last word has not been spoken yet and the position expressed by Kesman could be modified in hours. In turn, the United States believes that if Brazil joins NAFTA it would represent a trade exchange of $800 million, while it would only amount to $46.6 million with Argentina, Kesman said. It is clear that the United States does not care whether Mercosur can join NAFTA in bloc or partially because its interest is centered mainly on Brazil. The best move for Brazil now is to consolidate its position in South America, and Argentina plays an essential role in this strategy. In order to attain this, the Brazilian economic plan should work. Argentina, which still holds some doubts, has chosen to play it safe in case of a failure. It has opted to side with Mexico, which currently is at a disadvantage for not meeting ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] norms. Cavallo's aides earnestly defended Mexico's position in case the Brazilian economic plan fails, in order to be able to join NAFTA. What if Mexico then does not act in favor of Argentina? According to Kesman, it could be deprived of all the preferential treatment it currently has with other countries. During a news conference, Kesman acknowledged the Argentine strategy of increasing trade with Brazil, Colombia, and Chile and to making a strong move toward the United States. He said the agenda established in Colonia, Uruguay, to implement a common external tariff within Mercosur will be respected. Kesman said that in April he will meet with the Mercosur evaluating group to analyze the accomplishments of the agreement's terms as well as the tariffs for capital goods, trade, customs, and macroeconomic subjects. So far, Argentina has lost the first round, that is, to stop its trade partners from importing subsidized products.
