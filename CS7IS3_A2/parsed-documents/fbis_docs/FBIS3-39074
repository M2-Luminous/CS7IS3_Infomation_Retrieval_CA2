They, too, are divided on both the effectiveness of air strikes and the seriousness of any reprisals they may provoke. The Gulf War has no doubt demonstrated the possibility of so-called surgical strikes, effected with sufficient precision to reduce to a minimum the risk of "collateral damage" caused to persons and property outside the target. But, as an officer back from Yugoslavia is quick to point out, "the situation in Sarajevo is very different: Here we are not in a situation of a conflict between regular armies, and civilians are present everywhere, as are the blue helmets and international volunteers. The probability of error is thus considerable." Human Error Furthermore, continues a specialist in artillery matters, "two factors determine strike precision: The precision with which the target is identified and the precision of the firing system used to attack it. In both these cases, today's technology allows exceptional performances, virtually down to the very last centimeter. But despite this, you cannot exclude a technical fault, and even less human error. Remember how U.S. helicopters mistakenly fired on British tanks in the Gulf War." Allowing for these reservations, experts agree that strikes limited to the hills around Sarajevo, where the Serbs have concentrated their artillery, "would produce good results," whether against dug-in pieces or mobile arms. "It is just as mistaken to claim that the former are indestructible as to assert that the latter are much less vulnerable," states General Robert Close, citing the precedents of the war in Algeria and the Second World War. This judgment is shared by experts from the former Yugoslav Army. "The Serbs are using old equipment," one of them observes. "They are often towed pieces which take time to be moved. The major Western armies have radar which make it possible to locate artillery batteries immediately after the first shell is fired. So it only takes a few minutes, if not seconds, to destroy them. If the equipment and competent men are at hand." Reprisals That is no doubt the main problem. It seems that the use of air strikes requires a strengthening of UN forces in Bosnia and more comprehensive weaponry, both to ensure the success of the military operations envisaged and to protect the blue helmets from any reprisals which -- without necessary going as far as a pitched battle -- could use the most murderous terrorist practices. But to go down this road is to prepare for an escalation which the West clearly does not want. An officer pointed out that -- while the subject of air strikes has been fiercely debated -- NATO has never dared shoot down a single one of the helicopters which are constantly violating the air exclusion zone over Bosnia.
