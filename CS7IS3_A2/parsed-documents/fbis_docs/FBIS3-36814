Security Council. The Yabloko group adopted a statement saying that "the drawing of the NATO military-political bloc into an armed conflict outside the NATO boundaries is fraught with the upsetting of a military-political balance in Europe." They stressed that such involvement in the Yugoslav crisis "runs counter to the national and state interests of Russia." The Yabloko group is sure that the search for a peaceful way of settling the Yugoslav conflict should be supported and continued. The Yabloko group urged Russia to play a more active political role in that conflict and, at the same time, warned against being drawn into it. In the opinion of its members, "a gradual peaceful settlement may be reached by the tested methods, suggested by the London Conference."
