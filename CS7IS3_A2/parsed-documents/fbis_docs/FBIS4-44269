Present for this morning's talks with leaders of the big three unions CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor], CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] and UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions] were Cabinet Undersecretary Gianni Letta, and the industry, budget and labour ministers, Vito Gnutti, Giancarlo Pagliarini and Clemente Mastella. The discussions, part of a series of follow-up talks to last July's [1993] cost of labour accord, focussed on public demand and industrial policy, and culminated with an agreement to set up the transport and health authorities. Another authority, which keeps a check on spending in the computer industry, will be beefed up. "We stressed that by coordinating spending in two such important sectors as health and transport you add to industrial policy," said CISL Secretary General Sergio D'Antoni. According to Sergio Cofferati of the CGIL, "the July accord contained no precise indications on industrial policy. There can be no doubt, however, that this is a decisive issue for dealing with the employment crisis." Cofferati had words of praise for the new government in this first session of talks on the July accord, saying "we can only appreciate the government's willingness to delve deeper into all these issues." The unionists will return to the premier's office at 1600 (1400 GMT) this afternoon to discuss renewal of the public sector contract which expired three years ago and has not been renegotiated due to lack of funds. The question of the poorer southern Mezzogiorno region will be studied at a special meeting to be held June 30. A suggestion yesterday from Industry Minister Gnutti that southern workers might be paid proportionally lower wages than their central and northern colleagues prompted criticism from unions and the opposition.
