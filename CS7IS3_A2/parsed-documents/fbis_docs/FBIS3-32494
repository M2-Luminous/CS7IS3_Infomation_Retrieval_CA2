The Nikkem report was presented at the UN Human Rights Commission, which is currently meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, to analyze the situation in different countries. The Nikkem report criticizes the lack of respect for human rights in El Salvador, and notes that compliance with the peace accord has decreased in recent months. According to Oscar Santamaria, the report was prepared abroad and does not correspond to the country's reality. He also rejected claims of a decrease in compliance with the peace process. The official expressed regret Pedro Nikkem had not visited El Salvador to conclude his report, and he said the UN rapporteur's role is to support the government in human rights affairs. In his report, Pedro Nikkem criticizes the Salvadoran Government's lack of cooperation. He said immigration obstacles had been created to prevent his visit, which was scheduled for the end of last year.
