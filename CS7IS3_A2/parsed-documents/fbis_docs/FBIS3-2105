A local official said the tree belt, 97 km in length and 500 m in width, will cover parks, recreational and sports facilities, thus offering more green land for people to enjoy themselves. The tree belt has been listed as one of the key projects to be undertaken by the municipal government this year. The whole project will be completed early in the next century. According to the plan, this populous city is striving to cover at least 15 percent of its space with green this year, averaging 1.4 sq m per capita.
