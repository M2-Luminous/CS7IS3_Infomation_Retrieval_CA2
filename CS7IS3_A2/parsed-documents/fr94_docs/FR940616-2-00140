SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. Overall authority for these programs is contained in the Mutual Education and Cultural Exchanges Act of 1961, as amended, Public Law 87&hyph;256 (Fulbright-Hays Act). Overview Grant funding is intended to promote the exchange of young people 21 years of age or younger between the U.S. and the Newly Independent States (NIS) or Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, and the Central and Eastern European countries of Albania, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Proposals may address more than one country in each area, for example, a project with Bulgaria, Latvia, and Slovenia, or Belarus, Moldova, and Kyrgyzstan. Proposals cannot combine NIS countries with those of Central and Eastern Europe. The Agency's main objective is to foster interaction between American and foreign youth. Consequently, extensive interaction is a requirement. Proposals should demonstrate how American and foreign youth will interact in a way that encourages the exchange of ideas, values, culture, and information. This competition will give priority consideration to projects taking place in Russia in areas other than Moscow and St. Petersburg, and to projects taking place outside of capital cities in all the eligible countries.
