Announcing this, the party leaders addressing a press conference here today said the main work of the party would be to protect the socioeconomic and political interest of the backward tribals and other ethnic groups. A 10-member committee has been formed with the senior most CPI(M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] leader, Mr. Ashok Debbarma, as its convenor. They said that the Tripura National Volunteers [TNV], ruling Left Front's partner, Tripura Hill People's party, Tripura Upajati Juba Samity's youth wing, Tribal Students' Federation and the Tripura Upajati Karmachhari Samity would be the partners of the new body. Mr. Debbarma, a founder member of the Communist Party in Tripura in the late 40s, along with the present Chief Minister, Mr. Dasaratha Deb, the former Chief Minister, Mr. Nripen Chakraborty, and the veteran Communist leader and former Minister, Mr. Biren Datta, alleged that the Left Front had failed to protect the interests of the tribals. Mr. Debbarma announced that the URPT would launch a statewide movement in support of the genuine demands of the tribals from this month-end. It would also support the TNV's raasta roko agitation, slated to begin from March 3 in protest against non-implementation of the tripartite TNV peace accord, signed on August 12, 1988. Mr. Debbarma and the other leaders further alleged that all the political parties, including the ruling Left Front, had bluffed the tribals and were not sincere for the all-round development of the tribals.
