UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman Major Bill Aikman told a press conference late Sunday (13 February] that 13 Serb and five Bosnian Army weapons had been handed over to UNPROFOR during the day after a 24-hour break in the disarmament process. The Serbs handed over two 100 mm cannon, two 155 mm cannon, a 122 mm mortar, six 82 mm mortars and two multiple rocket-launchers, Aikman said. The mainly-Moslem Bosnian army for its part dismantled and placed under UN control a 75 mm anti-aircraft gun, two others of 75 and 37 mm, and two 82 mm mortars.

[passage omitted] Meanwhile in Zagreb Yasushi Akashi, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's special representative in Bosnia, stressed the air strike threat applied to all three of Bosnia's warring parties. Speaking after meeting Sunday with UN and NATO commanders to coordinate possible implementation of air strikes, Akashi said that, in the event of bombardments being ordered, NATO would carry them out "against whichever party was violating the ceasefire." UNPROFOR's Bosnia commander General Sir Michael Rose, who attended the meeting, added that many of the truce violations registered in Sarajevo had been carried out by Bosnian government troops.
