Because many more loans were granted in the third and fourth quarters last year, the situation of enterprises being short of funds was eased. In December, the growth rate of industrial production across the country increased considerably, showing an increase by 29.8 percent as compared with the same month in the previous year and close to the highest point before the work of macro regulation and control was strengthened. Sales were brisk in the domestic market. In December, the total volume of social commodity retail sales was 35.3 percent higher than the same month in the previous year and was up 29.7 percent over November last year. The volume of grain, edible oil, and household electric appliance sales increased sharply. That month, the sale of grain was 1.41 million tonnes over the same month of the previous year, constituting a sharp contrast with the accumulated decline of 18 percent in the volume of sales during the first 11 months. Sales of color television sets were up 82.1 percent over the same month of the previous year. The volume of sales of cassette recorders and refrigerators also increased by a relatively large margin. The sales of the means of agricultural production began to increase, and sales of commodities such as chemical fertilizer, pesticides, and plastic for agricultural use also increased greatly. The range of the rise of commodity prices in December was on the high side. Daily living expenses in 35 large and medium cities rose by 23.9 percent, of which the prices of consumer goods rose by 17.2 percent and service charges by 38.6 percent. Inflationary pressure increased further. On the whole, the situation of economic operations is basically normal at present. In the next stage, it will be necessary to do a good job in work to give explanation to reform, improve the operation of reform, and make efforts to guard against marked inflation while ensuring the smooth progress of reform in various aspects.
