He added that shortcomings in the issuance of voter registration cards have been overcome and that the nationwide distribution of electoral materials is already under way. [Begin recording] [Zaldivar] As of midnight last night, more than 800,000 voter registration cards had been issued; in other words, we exceeded the goal we set for ourselves. This is very satisfying for the TSE and its staff. We commend those voters who came to the TSE offices to obtain voter registration cards. [Unidentified reporter] Could you give us an estimate? [Zaldivar] Of the cards issued? Remember, registration ended at midnight last night. We still do not have exact figures, but I can tell you that we exceeded 800,000 cards. [Reporter] [words indistinct] take the election materials to all places in the country? [Zaldivar] The nationwide delivery of election materials began yesterday. They will arrive at departmental and municipal electoral boards, and as the law stipulates, and they will eventually arrive at the voting table boards. [end recording] Zaldivar also talked about the role of the international observers who are already in El Salvador to verify the outcome of the elections. [Begin recording] [Zaldivar] There are more than 3,000 observers. We have (?registered) more than 2,000 visiting observers. Also, there are 900 UN observers and 25 TSE special guests who are members of the Inter-American Union of Electoral Organizations. [Reporter] When will the results be released? [Zaldivar] The vote count will include two parts -- a preliminary count and a final count. At the very latest, the final count should begin 48 hours after the polls close. During this process, the law requires us to report partial results. This is why we created the National Vote Counting Center, where we will hold a [word indistinct] involving the media to allow them to inform the nation and the world about the election results as they become available. These results will be based on data we collect through the logistical plan we devised -- a plan that involves the counting of votes and the dissemination of the results. [end recording] International observers will be assigned throughout the country to cover all municipalities. The full authority of the Salvadoran state will be at stake in the 20 March elections.
