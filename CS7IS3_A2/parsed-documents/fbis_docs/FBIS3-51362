The information was reported by Father Jesus Delgado, who issued an appeal during yesterday's homily on ending the violence as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Camelia Cartagena, member of the Human Rights Commission's directorate board, today endorsed the Catholic Church's report, adding that various people who have been assassinated and found without their documents were victims of paramilitary groups. [Begin recording] [Cartagena] As far as we are concerned, all those who are found without their documents, with their hands tied, and with signs of torture are victims of the death squads. Hence, we agree with the Catholic Church's statements. [Alvarenga] How many reports have you received so far? [Cartagena] I cannot give you figures because I do not have the year-end statistics on hand. The ideal thing would be to give you that information. However, I can tell you we have a large number of cases and the figure coincides with those given by the Catholic Church. [end recording] Camelia Cartagena said the Human Rights Commission this week will issue a detailed report on human rights violations. Moreover, the humanitarian leader urged that the agreements concerning the Civilian Police installation and justice management have failed to achieve enough progress. Camelia Cartagena reported that members of the much criticized Commission for Criminal Affairs and the Antidrug Trafficking Unit joined the Civilian Police without a proper evaluation.
