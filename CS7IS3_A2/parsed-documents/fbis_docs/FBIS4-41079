The checkpoints will probably start operating soon. Work has been going on since dawn to set them up. Also today, work resumed on repairing the 25 meter-long bridge across the Inguri. It will be used by military formations of Russia's Transcaucasus group of troops to enter the Gali areas of Abkhazia. This is precisely the peacekeeping contingent that will create conditions for the safe return of refugees to Abkhazia in the near future. Now that the issue of the introduction of the Russian peacekeepers into the area of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict has been completely resolved, these forced immigrants have a real chance of returning home. [Correspondent] Vladislav Georgiyevich, how do you assess today's decision by the Federation Council that Russian troops can be used in the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia? [Ardzinba] In Abkhazia the decisions of the Federation Council and the president's decree have been received with satisfaction. We hope that the deployment of the troops on the border between the Abkhaz and the Georgian states will create the necessary conditions to prevent a new war, to stabilize the situation in the region, and to continue talks on a full-scale settlement of relations between Abkhazia and Georgia. After the troops are deployed, we will be ready to consider questions connected with the resumption of work by communication lines linking Russia with the republics of the Transcaucasus, and generally we hope that Russia's economic policy in relation to Abkhazia, whose population has shouldered all the hardships of war, will change.
