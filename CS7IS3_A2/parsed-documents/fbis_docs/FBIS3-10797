Assen, that they talk about the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) for the economy in New York on 19 March. Paramaribo accepted the invitation and has approached the Warwick Research Institute (British university) to act as adviser. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) will be there for the Netherlands. Pronk's invitation is a reaction to the Surinamese proposal of 24 February to begin talks as quickly as possible on a solution to the lingering question of external guidance for the SAP. In Paramaribo, emotions were running high this week following the sharp criticism levelled by Pronk at the Surinamese approach to the economic crisis. However, with the indignant statement made by Assen on the matter, the question would appear to be over. The Netherlands is still demanding that Suriname takes on the IMF as an external adviser for the SAP before there can be any talk of resuming economic aid. However, Paramaribo wants to throw in its lot with Warwick. Warwick, however, only wants to give technical assistance and is "not prepared nor in a position" to coercively enforce the required measures, nor to advise The Hague on resuming aid.
