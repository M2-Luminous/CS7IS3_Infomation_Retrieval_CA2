Surin said he did not know where the agency got its information. The National Security Council is checking the report. If this is true, it will give Thailand a bad reputation. The Foreign Ministry will make clarifications later. [Begin Surin recording, in progress] ...U.S. Government authorities in Thailand have confirmed to me that they have no information on this matter -- no proof; no evidence. They themselves know nothing about it. They do not know who the source of the report is or how reliable it is. Therefore, we will have to check on it. We cannot remain idle; still, we cannot take the report at face value because there has been no confirmation. We have only read this in newspapers that quote sources and make headlines about it.
