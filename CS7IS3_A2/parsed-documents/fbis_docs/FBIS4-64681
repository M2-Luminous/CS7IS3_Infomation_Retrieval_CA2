"I had a sleepless night about it," he admitted yesterday. In the end, he decided to stay and yesterday afternoon received the support of his parliamentary party, which elected him to be its chairman. Yesterday, after the first meeting of the new, much reduced parliamentary party, Brinkman did not want to go into the question of what sort of cabinet should emerge, in the view of the CDA. According to sources in the CDA, the parliamentary party feels that the two big winners in the election, the D66 [Democrats 66] and the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], must be the first ones to investigate which parties could work together in a new cabinet. The VVD is also thinking along these lines. PvdA [Labor Party] leader Kok did not want to make any comment about the "color" of the new cabinet. In his view, it was obvious that the "biggest party and the biggest winner in the elections," respectively his party and the D66, should form the basis for the new cabinet. Kok: Tempo Behind Formation "The `color' of the coalition is very important," Kok said. "But the key question is: With which parties we can make the best agreements on the basis of our program." The PvdA leader said it was "dangerous to first express a preference for parties and only then see whether you can agree." According to the PvdA, the formation process should be completed as quickly as possible. "We must join speed with carefulness, otherwise 1995 will be a year lacking in policies," Kok said. Despite differences over program with other parties, Kok appeared reasonably optimistic. "Of course, there are complications and a willing attitude is needed to reach compromises, but I am positive in the main," he said. Kok did not want to answer the question of whether it was necessary to appoint someone to investigate whether a coalition could be achieved, or appoint someone to actually form a cabinet. He is to advise Queen Beatrix on this issue tomorrow. "It seems more sensible to me that Her Majesty is the first person to hear that from me," he said. Outgoing minister Van Thijn, who is not a member of the PvdA parliamentary party, found it hard to imagine that the current coalition partners, the CDA and PvdA, could both continue to govern in the new cabinet. "It would be very strange if the present coalition came out of the formation process a winner," he said. "It is obvious that one of the two will give way in the cabinet formation process." Van Thijn made his comments in an interview with ELSEVIER magazine about the election results. Van Thijn regarded a "purple" coalition comprising the PvdA, the VVD, and the D66 as closer than ever, all the more so given the CDA's campaign style. "The CDA set up its campaign in a way that leaves you cold. They monopolized values and standards," Van Thijn said. If it came down to a cabinet comprising the PvdA, the CDA, and the D66, then in his view it was not reasonable for Brinkman, leader of the CDA parliamentary party, to be part of it. "It is not self-evident that Brinkman will take part in a progressive majority cabinet," the PvdA politician said. The PvdA parliamentary party elected Kok as its chairman, Wallage as first deputy chairman and former parliamentary chairman Wltgens as second deputy chairman. The much larger VVD parliamentary party needed little time to decide on what advice it would give the Queen. It decided to leave a free hand to the leader of the parliamentary party, Bolkestein. Bolkestein made it clear in the debate of leading candidates that in his eyes the CDA/PvdA coalition, supplemented by the D66, could not continue to govern. "That would come down to a continuation of the policies of the last four years," he said. "That is not what the voters want." In the VVD parliamentary party, there have been calls for a liberal duo (comprising the VVD and the D66) to be appointed to investigate whether a coalition could succeed. But because [D66] Van Mierlo's advice is uncertain (the D66 will meet today), it was decided to give Bolkestein a free hand. "He will act as he sees fit," one member of the parliamentary party said. Yesterday, the CDA parliamentary party started "in an oppressed mood" to look into the causes of the heavy election defeat. "Criticism was made of those who played a leading role in the election campaign," Brinkman said. The parliamentary party also came to the conclusion that it would have to take a more independent attitude toward the cabinet and give less support to the government. The parliamentary party will continue its discussions next Wednesday. The CDA executive committee also wants an "in-depth analysis" of what went wrong. A proposal to this effect will be on the agenda of a party executive meeting tomorrow.
