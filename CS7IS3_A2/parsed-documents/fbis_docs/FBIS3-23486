His admission coincided with a police announcement that a warrant will be issued tomorrow for the arrest of a suspected international terrorist, and that other warrants may follow. Police said at least four people collaborated in assembling the truckbomb. It was likely Thais were involved since it was difficult for foreigners to buy all the components locally. "I have learned that some Thais joined the gang. The crackdown must be made at their grassroots," Chavalit said. [passage omitted] Police yesterday produced a sketch of a second suspect in the sabotage attempt. An artist's sketch of the first suspect, drawn from details given by the owner of the motorcycle hit by the truck, had already been sent to all police stations. Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Pol Maj Gen, Thawi Thippharat yesterday said the two suspects are from the Middle East, but he would not specify their nationality.
