But the ministry already has "know-how" to follow any U.N. Security Council resolutions on stopping bank remittance, as it did toward Iraq during the Persian Gulf war in 1990, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular news meeting. Saito otherwise refused to comment, saying, "things have yet not progressed as far as imposing economic sanctions."
