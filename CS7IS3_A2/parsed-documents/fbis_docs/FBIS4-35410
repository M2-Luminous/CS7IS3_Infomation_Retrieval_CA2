He said in the statement: We had been expecting such an offensive, which reveals the despair of the rulers of Sanaa, in that they are making an attempt to draw the attention of the world to battles and destruction, instead of to peace. The brother deputy chairman of the Presidential Council expressed confidence that this barbarous offensive against peaceful villages must fail and collapse, noting that the rulers of Sanaa would fail to realize their aims. Brother al-Jifri noted that the attackers had mounted a broad offensive on all fronts, using in their vanguard the good sons of Yemen, whom they have misled. He said: We were expecting this attack -- our forces had been waiting for it and are heroically repulsing it, inflicting great losses of life and material on the enemy. The brother deputy chairman of the Presidential Council reassured the sons of our people that the enemy had not, and would not, achieve the aims of his attack. Our forces, with their air, naval, and ground arms, are capable of protecting the territory and sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. The brother deputy chairman of the Presidential Council said that, during the past two days, a number of false claims had been put about, to the effect that Aden airport had been shelled and destroyed by artillery. The sons of our people all know that this is just an empty claim. He said he thought that the allegations would persist for another couple of days or longer, but that victory is our ally and God is on our side, because we are the victims of aggression.
