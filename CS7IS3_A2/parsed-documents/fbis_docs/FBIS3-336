In the booklet entitled "The 1994 Constituent Assembly Elections," the UPC position is claimed to portray the National Resistance Movement, NRM, of President Yoweri Museveni as a foreign occupation government and dominated by foreigners. Wagulo, who was arrested this morning by police officers at the UPC headquarters in Kampala, was due to appear in court this afternoon, but Chief Magistrate Jorokamu Bamwine, who was to hear the case, refused to hear it because Wegulo was brought in after office hours. The charge sheet says Wegulo and others still at large in February in Kampala did utter, print, publish for sale and caused the booklet to be distributed.
