FR940504-0-00002 FR940504-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Farmers Home Administration 7 CFR Parts 1941, 1943, and 1945 RIN 0575&hyph;AB30 Final Implementation of Appraisal of Farms and Leasehold Interests AGENCY: Farmers Home Administration, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its farm tract appraisal regulations in order to implement and conform to the provisions of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) of 1989. The intended effect of this rule is to meet the provisions of title XI of FIRREA and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) as directed from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Bulletin A&hyph;129). EFFECTIVE DATE: May 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ronald T. Thelen, Senior Loan Officer, Program Development Staff, USDA, FmHA, room 4918&hyph;S, South Building, Washington, DC 20250, telephone: (202) 720&hyph;0830. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Classification We are issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and we have determined that it is not a ``significant regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this final rule: (1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (4) would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations or recipients thereof; and (5) would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. Intergovernmental Consultation For the reasons set forth in the final rule related to Notice, 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983), this program/activity is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. Programs Affected This program/activity affects the following FmHA programs as listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance: 10.406_Farm Operating Loans, 10.407_Farm Ownership Loans, and 10.416_Soil and Water Loans. Environmental Impact Statement This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91&hyph;190, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. Discussion of Final Rule On August 25, 1993, FmHA published an interim rule which removed 7 CFR part 1809, subpart A, ``Appraisal of Farms and Leasehold Interests,'' from the Federal Register . It also did the following: (1) Revised and renumbered part 1809 to FmHA Instruction 1922, subpart E_``Appraisal of Farms and Leasehold Interests.''; (2) Issued revised §1922.201 ``General'' (old §1809.1 ``General'') and (3) Issued new §1922.209 ``Easements and appraising property subject to easements.'' Other §§1809.2 through 1809.8 of subpart A were amended to meet USPAP and placed in §§1922.202 through 1922.208 of FmHA Instruction 1922&hyph;E. Sections 1922.202 through 1922.208 were not published in the Federal Register because they involve internal Agency management. These changes were implemented upon publication in the Federal Register in order to provide immediate guidance to FmHA designated farm real estate appraisers and FmHA contract farm real estate appraisers concerning the use of the uniform standards as set out in Sections I, II and III of USPAP. This action was necessary because most States enacted legislation and implemented FIRREA on January 1, 1993, and required farm real estate appraisers to follow uniform appraisal standards or Sections I, II and III of USPAP. Further delays by FmHA would have had an adverse impact on FmHA borrowers and loan applicants due to delays which may have resulted from the continued use of outdated farm appraisal techniques and methods. The comment period ended September 24, 1993. No comments were received. Accordingly, no substantive change is made from the interim rule. Minor editorial changes of an administrative nature have been made. Inadvertently, a few FmHA Instructions were overlooked when revising references from FmHA Instruction 422.1 to FmHA Instruction 1922&hyph;E.
