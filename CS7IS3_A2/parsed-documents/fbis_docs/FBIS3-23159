It believes that this crime is a new link in the chain of Israel's daily acts of aggression against our people in occupied Palestine and south Lebanon. The movement's leadership stresses that the pattern of mass murders is uniquely perfected and practiced by Israel, and what happened a few days ago at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and today in Sayyidat al-Najat Church are the best proof of this.
