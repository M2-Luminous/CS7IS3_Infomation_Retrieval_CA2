The Russian troops stationed in Tajikistan informed INTERFAX, however, that the calm would be temporary. The military link this with the positive results of Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani's visit to Tajikistan at the end of 1993, with the cold and snowy weather in the mountains and with rifts between Afganistan's various political forces. A few days ago, two thirds of the Kazakh battalion operating in the territory of the Khorog border-guard unit in accordance with last year's Minsk agreement, were removed from Tajik territory. However, no replenishments have arrived yet, all of which may weaken this section of the Tajik-Afghan border.
