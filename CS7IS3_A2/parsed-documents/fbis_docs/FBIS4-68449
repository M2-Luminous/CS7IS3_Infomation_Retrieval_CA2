Karamanukyan, head of the Armenian president's administrative staff, called in the five employees of the service headed by the president's chief adviser on national security remaining in the ranks and notified them that the service, which as we know was formerly headed by Ashot Manucharyan and Vaan Avakyan, is to be disbanded in 2 weeks. After their retirement the service was essentially inactive, although the employees reported for work regularly. The head of the administrative staff displayed kindness by not ruling out the possibility of helping the dismissed personnel find new employment. To all appearances, an appropriate edict by the president will be adopted by 15 April. It is on that day that the period for implementation of another edict--on freezing the activity of operations divisions of the GUNB RA [State Directorate of National Security of the Republic of Armenia]--is completed. It is hoped that the new document will at least state the reasons for disbanding the National Security Service as well as the GUNB. Finally, someone should familiarize the public with the new conception of the activity of such services. Otherwise, we must assume that the president is not concerned about national security matters.
