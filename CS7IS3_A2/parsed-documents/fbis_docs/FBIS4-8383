The former six-tier organization of the Army is merging into three levels--General Staff, army corps, and brigades. According to Army Chief of Staff Jiri Nekvasil, the democratic states' representatives could not understand the former multitier organization. The main reason for the ongoing transformation of the Army is to make its structure transparent and harmonize it with the system used in the armies of the democratic states. According to the commander of the 2d Army Corps, Frantisek Podesva, the Olomouc corps will be responsible for the smooth, properly developed general training of the troops and the organization of their daily life. It will also take care of the conscripts and the reserve soldiers in its territory. The previous divisions will be replaced in the lower-level arrangement by three motorized brigades--specifically, the Brno 6th motorized brigade, the Kromeriz 7th motorized brigade, and the Valasske Mezirici 8th motorized brigade. The NCO training centers and courses will start their operation on 1 October. The soldiers of the combat units will begin to train in the brigade structure on 1 January of next year.
