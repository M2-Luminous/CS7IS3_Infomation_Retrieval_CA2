"I am calling on all Slovaks to say a decisive `no' to turning the Slovaks in southern Slovakia into a minority," Slavkovska, SNS first deputy chairwoman, said. She also protested against "the Hungarians' effort to make decisions" on who should hold public administration posts. "Let them go vetting elsewhere, they will not be doing this in Slovakia," she stressed. The SNS is a former coalition government partner of Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). They claim that the new government, appointed on April 16, has concluded a secret agreement with the Hungarian parties trading government support for concessions made to the ethnic minority. About 560,000 ethnic Hungarians live in Slovakia, making up about 11 per cent of the total population. Peter Sokol, adviser to the SNS chairman, said that by its deeds, the present government was running counter to its proclamations that it was calming down the social situation in the country. [passage omitted] Sokol said that "social peace is the fundamental prerequisite of a successful economic transformation in Slovakia." He said his party agreed with the proposal that parties' election expenditures do not exceed 20 million crowns ($606,060). "Our expenditures have never gone beyond five million," he added.
