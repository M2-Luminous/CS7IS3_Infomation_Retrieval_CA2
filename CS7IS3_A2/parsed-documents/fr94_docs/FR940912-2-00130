FR940912-2-00130 FR940912-2-00091 [Release No. 34&hyph;34633; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;21] Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Customer Account Transfer Contracts September 2, 1994. On June 16, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;21) pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). 1 Notice of the proposal was published on June 29, 1994, in the Federal Register to solicit comments on the proposed rule change. 2 Two comment letters were received in favor of the proposal. 3 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s (b)(1) (1988). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34246 (June 22, 1994), 59 FR 33559 [File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;21]. 3 Letter from John E. Nolan, Senior Vice President, Operations and Compliance, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission (July 15, 1994) and letter from Kevin Farragher, Director of Operations, Distribution & Service, The Investment Company Institute, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission (July 11, 1994). The comment letters are discussed in detail in Section B below. I. Description of the Proposal A. Description NYSE is amending its Rule 412, Customer Account Transfer Contracts, and its related interpretations in order to incorporate into its customer account transfer process enhancements the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') has made to its Automated Customer Account Transfer (``ACAT'') service. Presently, the transfer time for transferring customers' cash or margin accounts is ten business days and is fifteen business days for transferring retirement accounts. The proposed amendments will reduce the time period for transferring customers' cash, margin, and retirement accounts to seven business days. This will be accomplished by reducing the five business day validation period for accounts to three business days 4 and by reducing the delivery period from five business days to four business days. 5 The rule change also mandates the use of an automated customer account transfer system for transferring mutual fund positions where both the receiving broker-dealer and the delivering broker-dealer are participants in a registered clearing agency which has such a facility. 6 4 The rule change deletes the interpretation that permitted a ten day validation period for retirement accounts. NYSE Rule 12, Interpretation (f)/01. 5 NYSE Rule 412(b). 6 NYSE Rule 412(e)(2). Where both receiving and delivery member organizations participate in a registered clearing agency with an automated customer account transfer system with residual credit processing capabilities, the rule change requires the members to utilize such facilities to transfer residual credit positions which accrue to an account after transfer. Member organizations already are required to transfer credit balances accruing in a transferred account within ten business days after accrual for a minimum of six months following the transfer. This requirement applies to all member organizations regardless of whether they utilize an automated customer account transfer system. The rule change also permits partial customer account transfers to be accomplished through a registered clearing agency's automated customer account transfer system. Presently, partial transfers are accomplished outside of the system. The time frames required by Rule 412 for transfer of entire customer accounts do not apply to partial transfers. However, the NYSE states in its filing and in existing interpretations to NYSE Rule 412 that member organizations are expected to expedite partial transfers of customer accounts. 7 7 NYSE Rule 412, Interpretation (a)/01. In an effort to facilitate communication between organizations and improve exchange oversight, the NYSE will provide more explicit reason codes for rejection of customer account transfers. 8 However, NYSE's new reason codes will become effective only after NSCC implements system changes which will allow use of such reason codes. 9 Also, member organizations that receive an account transfer related claim letter will be required to resolve the claim within five business days or respond in writing setting forth specific reasons for denying the claim. 10 8 NYSE Rule 412, Interpretation (b)(1)/02. 9 Telephone conversation between Rudy Schrieber, Senior Special Counsel of Rule and Interpretive Standards, NYSE, and Jerry W. Carpenter, Assistant Director, Division, Commission (August 30, 1994). See NYSE Rule 412, Interpretation (b)(1)/02. 10 NYSE Rule 412(d).
