Mettke, Hans Werner Kilz, and Fritjof Meyer in Moscow; date not given: "Ready for Any Struggle"] [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Boris Nikolayevich, Russia has worked for the benefit of the Serbs in the Balkans, and the Serbs broke the agreements with your envoy. Do you feel cheated by the Serbs now? [Yeltsin] I do have this feeling. Russia, the United States, and Germany have exerted their influence where they were listened to -- the Americans on the Muslims, the Germans on the Croats. We were the ones with the stronger influence on the Serbs. In this way we jointly prevented a harsh militant conflict. [DER SPIEGEL] But the Serbs have attacked Gorazde again and have not kept their promise. [Yeltsin] I discussed the matter with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and suggested to convene a summit. Russia, the United States, the European Union, the United Nations, and the other sides should sit down together at a table somewhere in Europe to sign an agreement on a cease-fire and on peace after such an agreement has been prepared by the foreign ministers. Last night I had an extensive conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton. [DER SPIEGEL] And the result was? [Yeltsin] Air raids can only worsen the situation, the war becomes endless. If we all exerted our influence as the guarantors of peace and could look into the eyes of the Yugoslav leaders, then a final agreement could be achieved. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you agree with Clinton or are there differences now? [Yeltsin] Our relations are close, we are good partners. It is normal in the relations between two states that the positions do not fully concur on all issues. [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, you are against bombings? [Yeltsin] We have the experience in our CIS countries that any violence gives rise to counterviolence. The attempt to defuse the situation and to come to an agreement is better. [DER SPIEGEL] But you would like a UN mandate for the CIS states? [Yeltsin] The United Nations has refused to send its peacekeeping forces to the CIS. Therefore, this remains our task. The United Nations can just send observers, but we must send the troops -- to Georgia, Ossetia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh. [DER SPIEGEL] What could the Germans do in the Balkans? Should they also send soldiers? [Yeltsin] We would welcome it very much if the Germans were able to use their soldiers as peacekeeping forces, not only in Yugoslavia. [DER SPIEGEL] For that the FRG would have to amend its constitution. Would you find it good if the Germans were freer in sending troops? [Yeltsin] I would consider this the right path. This year, our army will finally withdraw from German territory. In return, so to speak, the German Army could also be used together with the UN peacekeeping forces in the CIS countries and thus take over an important and noble mission. After all, we are all Europeans. [DER SPIEGEL] Why did you intervene in the Balkans -- to show Russia in the role of the superpower, or did you want to help your Slav brothers? [Yeltsin] We let ourselves be guided by the final goal; we are referring to the UN resolutions and the decision by the Security Council. [DER SPIEGEL] Is the NATO offer of a "Partnership for Peace" still acceptable to you? [Yeltsin] It is a fair offer, but some things still have to be clarified. We have a big army, just as NATO. We are willing to sign a partnership agreement, but, at the same time, we also want to negotiate an additional protocol with NATO about basic issues. Two formerly hostile blocks now want to cooperate militarily. This cannot happen completely without technical problems. We have other weapons systems, which are very different from those of NATO. Now they probably have to be harmonized. [DER SPIEGEL] Recently you have often complained that Russia's size is not sufficiently respected in the world. Where do you see discrimination against your country? [Yeltsin] I can give you a long list. The Cocom Committee [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] has now been dissolved, but the Western countries immediately established other committees, which are to regulate controls of goods exports to the former socialist countries in a new way. Why is Russia not represented in these committees? We were not even invited to the preparations. This is unjust. [DER SPIEGEL] A second example? [Yeltsin] We are part of Europe, we have been a European state for centuries, even though part of our territory is in Asia. We have agreed with the European Union on signing an economic agreement. For our accession we first have to develop an economic model. However, for this purpose we would need a cooperation agreement between the European Union and Russia. We have not made progress in this matter for a year now. [DER SPIEGEL] You and European Union Commission President Jacques Delors signed a declaration in Brussels last December.... [Yeltsin] ....more and more conditions are put up that clearly discriminate against Russia. We do not demand preferential treatment, just the same rights as any other European country, even though Russia is a superpower. [DER SPIEGEL] The Council of Europe does not want to accept Russia as a member because its democratic institutions have not been consolidated. The seven industrial powers do not want to have Russia in its G-7 club as long as the Russian market economy is so little developed. What is the basis of Russia's role as a superpower, apart from nuclear weapons? [Yeltsin] I am for the complete destruction of nuclear powers. A dream of mankind would be fulfilled if we entered the 21st century without nuclear powers. Russia can fully join in that. Russia remains a superpower also without nuclear weapons. Our greatness lies in tradition, in history, in our culture. I do not want to offend the Americans, but their history goes back only 200 years, while ours is millennia old. [DER SPIEGEL] Does this justify the claim of being a superpower? [Yeltsin] There is our gigantic territory of 17 million square kilometers, our population of 150 million. And then the natural resources. Our country has everything that man needs for life. Our natural gas resources of trillions of cubic meters are sufficient of Russia and for all of Europe for a few centuries. [DER SPIEGEL] But the democratic institutions are still underdeveloped. [Yeltsin] Certainly, Russia has to live up to the international standard there, too. It needs a mixed market economy. man's rights and freedoms must be respected and protected. This is the top priority of our Constitution. However, the decisive elements for our weight and our greatness are tradition, history, and culture. [DER SPIEGEL] This weight is largely bearing down on your neighbors in the CIS. Will Russia act as a power of order on the territory of the former Soviet Union also without a UN mandate? [Yeltsin] This lies within the discretion of these states. Georgia wants the United Nations with its peacekeeping forces to bring about order in its conflict with Abkhazia. Russia is to provide some of the blue-helmet soldiers. We would be willing to do that. However, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali told me that this has no chance -- the United Nations can, at best, send observers and is grateful to Russia for its readiness to send soldiers there. According to this model, Russia could also act in other hot spots on the territory of the former Soviet Union. If the CSCE, the United Nations, and NATO joined in, we would simply have fewer problems. [DER SPIEGEL] Many of the troops that have been withdrawn from Germany, are now stationed in Kaliningrad, in the former Koenigsberg. Why does Russia need such a powerful base there? Who is threatening this region? [Yeltsin] No one is threatening this region. There were simply barracks vacant in Kaliningrad. With the help of the German side, apartments for soldiers are now being build in various places. Later on, some troops will be transferred from Kaliningrad further to the east. [DER SPIEGEL] You will come to Germany next month. Potential investors will want to hear something about guarantees -- against bureaucratic harassment, impounding, arbitrary taxing, extortion of protection money. What can you offer in this respect? [Yeltsin] We have founded an insurance company, which is to insure private investors against political risks with government guarantees. [DER SPIEGEL] Like the Hermes insurance company in Germany? [Yeltsin] Exactly. We have studied the experiences of Hermes and believe that we can use much of that. Of course, there are no government guarantees against economic risks anywhere in the world. Incompetent entrepreneurs will fall flat on their faces in our country just as elsewhere. Political risks, however, are to be compensated for. In Germany I will explain this extensively to private investors in mid-May. They must understand that they must not neglect the Russian market. This market is uniquely interesting for them. [DER SPIEGEL] However, production is still going down in Russia and enormous subsidies are being paid to prevent mass unemployment. What about your promise that the economy will experience an upswing now? [Yeltsin] I expect a stabilization this year. For two months the inflation rate has been 8 to 10 percent and thus considerably lower than last year. The production decline has also slowed. The budget deficit is also lower than last year. Armament production is deliberately being reduced. In other fields of production we want to reach a normal level by the end of the year. [DER SPIEGEL] The country will become credit-worthy again? [Yeltsin] A partial loan of $1.5 billion has just been approved by the IMF. In 1995, we want to fulfill the conditions for loans, too, so that we get further means from the G-7 -- perhaps then it will already be called G-8. This would alleviate the situation in our national economy and contribute to the stabilization of the ruble. [DER SPIEGEL] Because they have economic problems, the voters have defected in masses to the nationalist firebrand [Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir] Zhirinovskiy. Do you intend to continue floating above the political groups, or will a presidential party soon be established? [Yeltsin] The president is elected by all the people and is responsible for every citizen, not just for the followers of his own party. However, I can, of course, express more liking for one party than for another or for Zhirinovskiy's party. [DER SPIEGEL] Why is it not possible to form a coalition against the chauvinist Zhirinovskiy? Is the agreement of all groups on a national consensus regarding constitutional good behavior supposed to be a substitute for that? [Yeltsin] This is indeed intended. This agreement has great political importance and we expect that its signing on 28 April by the president, the government, the parliamentary chambers, the political parties, and the regions can form the basis for a consensus among the citizens in Russia. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you understand the concern of many people after Zhirinovskiy's appearances in Western Europe, or do you think that the Western reaction is exaggerated? [Yeltsin] I think that the West greatly overestimates this man. [DER SPIEGEL] Is the impression incorrect that Zhirinovskiy has a chance of becoming Russian president? [Yeltsin] Completely incorrect. [DER SPIEGEL] Among the radical democrats in Moscow the terms "autumn of the patriarchs" and "Yeltsin stagnation" are circulating. Are you tired of your office? [Yeltsin] It is a tough job to be Russia's president in such a period. In my new book "On the Razor's Edge" [as published] I try to describe this. But courage does not desert me. I am always eager for action, I am ready for any struggle. [DER SPIEGEL] Also beyond 1996? [Yeltsin] I have committed myself to not talking about this issue. [DER SPIEGEL] Committed yourself to whom? [Yeltsin] The people from my team tried to persuade me for some time to run again in 1996. I did not want to. Then we agreed on a compromise: We will not talk about this issue for two years. In 1996, the decision will depend on whether the reforms in Russia cannot be reversed anymore. If I see that things are improving in Russia, I can leave this office with a clear conscience and a raised head. If the difficulties have not yet been overcome, then everything has to be reconsidered, depending on the situation. So far, I stick to my previous decision. I expect that, in 1996, Russia will stand on firm legs. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you see younger people in Russia's leadership, who can continue your policy and, at the same time, have enough charisma? [Yeltsin] I see many who want to do that. [DER SPIEGEL] Someone like General Rutskoy cannot become that anymore? [Yeltsin] No, never. He is too narrow-minded. And since he became a criminal, he has lost his political profile. [DER SPIEGEL] Are you worried that a vacuum could develop? [Yeltsin] Very much so. I am now looking for candidates who can make a serious claim to the president's office in 1996. But this will be extremely difficult. The people must get used to someone and gain trust. This is not so easy. [DER SPIEGEL] In your book you write that there are situations in which one should actually have to apply a whip -- so that criminals, but also civil servants, stick to the laws. What other means can be used to establish a rule-of-law state? [Yeltsin] All civilized countries of the world have followed the path of democracy, nothing must be invented anew. We have a Constitution, which has been brought about through a democratic referendum. We have elected our parliament democratically. More than 57 percent of those eligible to vote have elected their president. We have thrown the Communist ideology and the totalitarian state overboard. These are steps on the path toward democracy, even though we have not yet completed this path. [DER SPIEGEL] Very soon the last formerly Soviet troops will leave the former GDR [German Democratic Republic]. German- Russians relations thus gain a new quality. Do you believe that these could be special relations in the future? [Yeltsin] Russians and Germans are the two largest peoples in Europe. There relations with each other are of quite decisive importance for the fate of the entire continent. [DER SPIEGEL] What can the Germans do to support the reforms in Russia? [Yeltsin] The Germans are already doing enough. May God give that other states of the G-7 will act in the same way. [DER SPIEGEL] You have very close, friendly relations with Helmut Kohl -- not only in the sauna. [Yeltsin] He is a very interesting man. One can discuss complicated political topics with him quite easily. We understand each other immediately. [DER SPIEGEL] Are there any differences of opinion? [Yeltsin] This is just natural, but each of us also understands these different positions. He says: In your situation you are doing the right thing. I often have to tell him the same: I would have done the same in your place. He emanates an incredible joie de vivre, optimism, and energy. Yes, I like Helmut Kohl a lot. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you believe that he understands the Russian people? [Yeltsin] This is my impression. In any case, he understands me rather well. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you think he is a typical German? [Yeltsin] I am not quite sure what a typical German is. Who is a typical Russian? [DER SPIEGEL] Boris Yeltsin. [Yeltsin] Any person is a special type, unique. He has his nationality, but also his individuality. Everyone is rooted in the traditions of his people. One can see that Helmut Kohl is a German. [DER SPIEGEL] Boris Nikolayevich, thank you for this interview.
