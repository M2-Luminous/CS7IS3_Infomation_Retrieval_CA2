At first glance, this piece of news gave rise to hope one day after the speech by the President, who is acting rather lucklessly in the sphere of foreign policy, on the situation in Bosnia. Yet the reputations of the United States, of the United Nations, of the European Union, and of NATO are linked to this speech. One may have gotten the impression that Russia has now also adopted a tough stance vis-a-vis the Serbian troops. Yet agreement has only been achieved with the unwilling and would-be superpower on the convening of an international Bosnia conference. It is obvious that it will take some time to ensure the participation of all major politicians and of the Serbian leaders that have been made important by these major politicians. It is equally obvious that Bosnian civilians will die in the meantime. In an initial reaction, the nationalist leader (or seducer) Karadzic was "unimpressed" by Clinton's initiative. After all, the obstacles on the path toward a more massive military strike by NATO have remained the old ones: Blue berets would become hostages -- as recent events have shown on a small scale. Much weightier is the argument of military officials that soldiers have never surrendered to an aircraft, and that the war cannot be won without ground troops. The U.S. leader, who may have been genuinely outraged by the Bosnian atrocities, has reacted to public pressure. However, his initiative can only be effective if the allies really cooperate. Possible consequences that no Western head of state has been prepared to risk so far, would have to be accepted. Clinton's statement that "we must judge the Serbs by their deeds and not by their words" must also apply to the community of states. The Serbs have been using this motto for a long time. When the ultimatum for Sarajevo was adopted -- the only one that was taken seriously by the world -- they were even impressed.
