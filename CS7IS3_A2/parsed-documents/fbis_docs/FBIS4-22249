The first version is promoted by Rossel himself, his supporters, and the residents who actively endorsed the republic's constitution. It goes like this. Unless the issue of regional independence is resolved, Russia will not move forward and the economic situation will remain in a dead end. The main task is to raise the oblast's status, wrangling the necessary economic rights from Moscow. Rossel and his confederates' assumption is that Russia could be managed from Moscow in the environment of a rigid unitary state. Under a free market system, however, all 89 Federation components must be given the necessary degree of freedom to conduct economic reform on their own. Eduard Rossel states categorically that Yeltsin was not told in advance of the decision; as to the creator of the Urals Republic constitution, he had no desire to join Sverdlovsk Oblast with other Urals oblasts. According to the second version, which is supported by the Russian president's representative in the oblast, Vitaliy Mashkov, as well as the intellectual elite not connected to commercial structures, the declaration of the Urals Republic is nothing other than the desire to have decisionmaking power on all matters regarding selling the Urals' riches, bypassing Moscow. This is an easier way to enrich oneself and squander the national wealth. That is why Rossel's idea was so eagerly welcomed by businessmen experienced in setting up join enterprises with foreign companies. There are many facts pointing to the existence of a clan with a stake in this outcome. Members of this clan work not only in Yekaterinburg but also in state and entrepreneurial structures in Russia. Finally, the third version, which many ordinary Yekaterinburg residents are inclined to accept. The Urals Republic was a sacrifice card in Moscow's political game with Russia's ethnic entities. First federal authorities wanted to warn Tatarstan, Tuva, and other former autonomies against becoming too independent. When the situation with the Urals Republic went too far, however, they decided to reshuffle the deck. Rossel got too carried away with the idea and became an irritant for many people. Meanwhile, Eduard Ergartovich himself hopes for success and the support of leaders of other oblasts. As to leaflets with the Urals Republic constitution, they were popular among the Federation Council deputies--heads of oblast and kray administration. One cannot rule out that in the near future there may be a Central Russian, Volgo-Vyatka, Siberian, Far East, and other republics on the map of Russia.
