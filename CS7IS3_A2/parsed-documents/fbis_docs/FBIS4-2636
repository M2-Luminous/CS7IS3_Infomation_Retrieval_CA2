FBIS4-2636 "drchi070_w_94008" FBIS-CHI-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Choice of Advisers Examined Choice of Advisers Examined HK1204053694 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST in English 12 Apr 94 p 1 HK1204053694 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST English BFN [By Chris Yeung] [Text] China has widened the scope of its united-front campaign by enlisting prominent liberals, more professionals and sons and daughters of local billionaires to serve as Hong Kong affairs advisers. Among the 50 advisers announced yesterday were leading banker Sir Quo-wei Lee, veteran legislator Elsie Tu, appointed legislator Vincent Cheng Hoi-chuen and celebrity and writer James Wong. Yesterday's third round of invitations took to 141 the number of Hong Kong affairs advisers to Beijing. The appointment ceremony will be held in Beijing next month. Beijing officials said they would consider inviting even more to give their views on territory affairs. "We are also considering ways to strengthen the participation of advisers in the work of the Preliminary Working Committee," a mainland official said. Eight of the latest batch are Legislative Councillors. They are Mrs Tu, James Tien Pei-chun, Peggy Lam Pei Yu-dja, Hui Yin-fat, Frederick Fung Kin-kee, Henry Tang Ying-yen, Vincent Cheng and Tang Siu-tong. About a quarter of the lawmaking body -- 15 legislators -- now also serve as Beijing advisers. Unlike the previous rounds of appointments, leaders of minor liberal parties have been invited. As expected, the liberal flagship -- the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) -- has been snubbed again. However, Lau Kong-wah, a former core member of the UDHK who later quit the party, is on the list. As well as Mr Fung, Chang Kamun, who is the council chairman of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL), joins the group. Mr Fung is the ADPL's chairman. The Meeting Point's chairman Anthony Cheung Bing-leung and two founding members, Dr Thomas Chan Man-hung and Dr Tsang Shu-ki, accepted invitations. Dr Chan and Dr Tsang are economists at post-secondary institutes. A mainland official said the time was ripe to canvass the views of liberal elements. "They are invited because we want to have a wider spectrum of views," he said. "The closer the changeover of sovereignty, the greater the need for a wide range of views... We have no fundamental difference with the liberals. They just want a faster pace of democracy." The official, who was involved in the selection process, said it would be impossible to bring in members of the UDHK who were connected with "subversive" activities against China. In a move that could undermine the authority of the British administration in the countdown to 1997, Beijing offered seats to some political figures with close ties to the Hong Kong Government in the past. They include Mr Cheng, Hong Kong Bank's chief economist and former member of the Government think-tank; Sir Quo-wei, chairman of Hang Seng Bank; and Nicky Chan Nai-keung, formerly secretary for lands and works. In this round, younger members of the territory's richest families have been offered the opportunity to join politics. Among them are Richard Li Tzar-kuoi, elder son of tycoon Li Ka-shing; Anna Pao Pui-hing, eldest daughter of the late shipping magnate Sir Yue-kong Pao, and Ian Fok Chun-wan, son of Henry Fok Ying-tung. The senior Fok is now vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, ranking as a vice-minister under the Chinese hierarchy. The three are less well-known in the political arena. Asked if their appointment was connected with their family ties, the mainland official said: "It's hard for me to answer this question."
