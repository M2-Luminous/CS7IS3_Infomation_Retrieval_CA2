[Kinkel] I think we are all pleased that it was not necessary to carry out air strikes in and around Sarajevo. Now it will be important to finally stabilize the situation in and around Sarajevo. It will be important to make sure that a cease-fire is achieved also in the other parts of former Yugoslavia if at all possible. We must not forget that Sarajevo is only a very very small part and only a beginning on an important path. It will now be important to make use of the political momentum and achieve a political solution. The chances for this have now become a little bit better. [Schmidt] NATO Secretary General Woerner has said that the success is above all due to determined action by NATO. Was the ultimatum the decisive point? [Kinkel] I believe the ultimatum was a very, very important measure. I personally believe that without the ultimatum the Serb side would not have been prepared to accept the Russian proposal. Several factors had an impact; the involvement of the Russians who were able to influence the Serbs in a way that resulted in their willingness to withdraw was very important. There were also certain diplomatic efforts by the German side, by the Chancellor and myself. Now let's wait and see how things go. I think at the moment there is not yet any reason for joy and euphoria. Again: only a first small step, albeit an important one, has been achieved. [Schmidt] If we look at the ultimatum, after eight days, it lasted ten, there was still no movement yet. At the end of the day the breakthrough came with the Russian initiative from Moscow, Yeltsin's letter to Karadzic and the deployment of 400 Russian soldiers in the Sarajevo region. How should we see the Russians and Russian diplomacy in this situation? Was this eventually the decisive point and what consequences has this in the context of the NATO initiative Partnership for Peace for the states of East and Central Europe? After all Russia had been in danger of becoming isolated on the international scene? [Kinkel] If I can start at the end, the NATO summit with its Partnership for Peace also contained a fundamental offer to Russia for it to move closer to NATO. Partnership for Peace is not just an offer to the countries undergoing radical change in Central and East Europe, but basically also to Russia and Ukraine, although we must differentiate here between de jure and de facto possibilities. It is the case that this Russian participation has shown we certainly cannot achieve peace in the region, in former Yugoslavia, without Russia. This is also quite simply linked to the fact that individual countries have their own relationship with the warring parties -- just think of our relations with the Croats and our relations with the Muslims -- and the good relations between the Russians and Serbs have helped here. But, I repeat, a number of factors have come together here. [Schmidt] In this regard, and you mentioned it yourself earlier, what about the possibility of Germany taking on the role of mediator -- there was a conversation between the chancellor and Boris Yeltsin on Friday and your efforts, your frequent talks with Foreign Minister Kozyrev. How important are Germany's role and Germany's relations with the Croats which you mentioned in this regard? [Kinkel] I do not think that we can talk about taking on the role of mediator, but only about mediatory efforts. If I am right this is a little less than the role of mediator. It is also true that so far we have not been passive toward the whole conflict. French Foreign Minister Juppe and I initiated and pursued the European plan of action. We have shown very great commitment to the humanitarian effort. After the United States, we are probably the country that has given the most in financial support. Germany has taken in most of the refugees from former Yugoslavia and we will be asked by the others the day after tomorrow, sorry tomorrow, at the conference of political leaders to take another step toward granting more aid. I do not know where this will lead at the moment, but I think it is very important that these talks are taking place in Germany. [Schmidt] On what initiative is this conference of political leaders based? What will it discuss mainly and is it perhaps actually a preliminary stage for the summit meeting of heads of government which has been discussed so often? [Kinkel] It was my idea during our troika meeting in Athens with Kozyrev last Friday. I consulted the chancellor about this, and then we both made a lot of phone calls. Let's wait and see. I do not want to be euphoric here either, rather I want to see what comes of these talks tomorrow. Further meetings, for example between foreign ministers, could follow, but this is not yet definite. [Schmidt] If you look at the influence you have, the relations with the Croats, but on the other hand there is criticism from Bonn, from the Bosnian ambassador, that all this was a tactical exercise and generally the West attached too much significance to it. How do you assess this, that the Bosnians are rather sceptical about the developments of the last few hours. [Kinkel] It is certainly true that the Serbs have frequently led us up the garden path before. I have always said that words must be followed by actions. However, this time a concrete result was actually achieved, therefore I think the ambassador's assessment is not quite correct. Now further steps must be taken. Above all we must try to bring the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims, who have drifted quite far apart, closer together. We now also have a much, much stronger commitment by the Americans than before. In about the last fortnight the Americans have joined in a very committed way the efforts to find a political solution. I think this is very important because later it will be necessary to implement a peace plan in practice. For this soldiers are needed, many soldiers, UN soldiers. Without the help of the Americans this would not be possible. Incidentally, we also need them because of their influence on the Bosnian Muslims. [Schmidt] So is it also true that Bill Clinton's determination was decisive? [Kinkel] Yes, one can say that, Clinton has certainly made a decisive contribution with his more resolute action, with the resolute willingness to join in. [Schmidt] To come back to the meetings here on German soil of the Croats and the Muslims, for the second time, in Frankfurt at the weekend. Maybe in Frankfurt also for reasons of location, because it is maybe easier to get to for both sides, but why Germany? So little of the [contents of these] talks gets out. It is only announced that there is a new plan to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina into seven cantons, that is not really all that new. Is it a good sign that so little becomes known about the talks or is it rather a sign that there is no progress? [Kinkel] For me this is a good sign. You know that Tudjman and Izetbegovic wanted to meet of their own accord at the Petersberg [government guest house in Bonn] a few weeks ago. You know that the meeting between the Croats and the Muslims in Frankfurt took place at their request. Germany has good relations with both parties to the conflict and, I'll say it again, we offer our mediatory services. To be a little more modest, I do not want to speak of a mediator role. For me this conference of [political] directors tomorrow is very important because I can imagine that it will be a preliminary stage, a step that will continue the peace process. We still have a very, very long way ahead of us. Even more so because it appears at the moment that some of the Serb weapons may resurface in Tuzla, Bihac, and at other places. We will have to decide how we will react now, but the momentum that the overall process has gained because of the NATO threats, the Russian involvement, our mediatory efforts, the help of the Americans, we must use this momentum. However, again, I personally and we have been disappointed too often in the past. I warn against assuming that we already have the solution in our pocket. That would be too good. [Schmidt] What will you be doing yourself today? You will be having meetings in Bonn. Will you be travelling to Brussels to the foreign ministers' meeting? [Kinkel] No, I will not be going to Brussels today. Ms. Seiler-Albring will be there. The talks which had to be held took place in the last few days. I had a long talk yesterday with Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN's envoy, and with various other foreign ministers. The telephone and other technical aids can be used to communicate with each other to such an extent that it is not so necessary to meet in the same place. We European foreign ministers meet virtually every week and we are almost in daily contact with the U.S. secretary of state. [Schmidt] What about your plans for this week? [Kinkel] First, we shall wait and see what happens at the talks tomorrow. The other countries -- all the important ones will be there -- will wait and see too. They will evaluate the situation and consider what should be done next. Redman, the U.S. special envoy, is here in Europe and he will be there [at the conference of political directors] tomorrow too, as will Mr. Churkin who negotiated the action to be taken by the Serbs on behalf of the Russians. All the critical people will be here and let's see how we get on. I do not want to raise any false hopes here either.
