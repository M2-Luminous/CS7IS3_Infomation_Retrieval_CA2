FBIS4-54821 "dreeu087_i_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-087 Daily Report 4 May 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Croatian Leader Rejects Muslim Demands Croatian Leader Rejects Muslim Demands LD0405162494 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1609 GMT 4 May 94 LD0405162494 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Belgrade, May 4 (TANJUG) -- The Croat side in the ex-Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina (BIH) renounces a Moslem demand that Moslems should hold the offices of president and prime minister of a future Moslem-Croat federation, it was stated Wednesday by Kresimir Zubak, leader of the Croatian community in the BIH. Zubak, in a statement to the Croatian radio which calls him "president of the presidential council of the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna (HRHB)," asserts that the "process of establishing a federation has been delayed by the Bosnian Moslem side which even tries to accuse Croat representatives for buying time." Said Zubak, "the Bosnian Moslem representatives now seek that Moslems should be both president and prime minister of the federation, for what there are no grounds in the constitution, and this demand would not be accepted by the Croatian side." An agreement on a Croat-Moslem federation in the BIH, and on the later entry of this joint state into a confederal union with the neighbouring Croatia, was signed, under strong U.S. pressure, in Washington early March. It ended fierce clashes between Bosnian Moslems and Croats for territories which had lasted since the beginning of last year. Zubak said he did not know when the talks on a Moslem-Croat federation would continue because no invitations were as yet coming in from Sarajevo. He recalled that Bosnian Croat representatives had so far gone to Sarajevo three times for talks, never reaching accord on leaders of a future federation. The Moslem Radio Sarajevo reported that opposition parties in the Republic of Croatia had begun to wonder why Croatian President Franjo Tudjman was now shelving off for a second time his official visit to Sarajevo. The Radio quoted Dobrosav Paraga, leader of the extreme rightist "Croatian Party of Right" (HSP), as telling a news conference in Zagreb Wednesday that Tudjman was delaying his visit to Sarajevo "simply because he does not want the Washington agreement on a Moslem-Croat federation to be implemented." Paraga asserted that Tudjman "does not want either the enforcement of the Washington accord or the renouncement of Herzeg-Bosna as it is termed." Paraga did not believe in any technical problems around Tudjman's visit. He did not accept an assertion that "the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) does not want to secure the Croatian president's travel to Sarajevo," the Moslem radio said. The radio added that what Paraga said was the first public statement on the Croatian political scene concerning Tudjman's deliberate delay of his visit to Sarajevo because of being insincere to the Washington agreement. Unlike Tudjman, Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic was quoted by the HSP as sincerely wanting the implementation of the agreement, and this was why he invited Tudjman to Sarajevo again -- said the Moslem Radio Sarajevo in its report from Zagreb.
