As a result, southwest China is soon to become China's premier hydroelectric power base, according to deputies to the National People's Congress [NPC] now in session here who hail from southwest China's Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces and Guangxi Autonomous Region. Sixty-five giant hydropower stations will form "electric corridors" along the region's main rivers of Jinshajiang, Yalongjiang, Daduhe, Lanchangjiang, Wujiang and Hongshuihe. Their power will be fed to a local grid, which in turn will transmit power to Guangdong in south China and to east China. Southwest China has exploitable hydropower resources of 194 million kw, 572000060100f the national total. According to Wang Zhaobang, an NPC deputy from Guangxi and a hydropower expert, 11 power stations have been completed or are under construction in southwest China, which will generate 51.9 billion kwh [kilowatt-hours] of electricity a year. Another seven giant stations will be built in the area during the last five years of this century, he disclosed. Those stations will have a combined generating capacity of 20 million kw. When all the 65 hydropower stations are completed, they will generate 631 billion kwh of electricity a year. One newly-completed station in Guangxi has already started supplying power to Guangdong Province, according to He Rong, an NPC deputy from Guangxi. "This marks the start of implementing a state plan to transmit power from southwest China to east China," he said. Local electric power authorities have opened the door to overseas investment in hydropower development. The three provinces and one autonomous region have signed a dozen contracts with companies from the United States, Thailand and Hong Kong on the construction of hydropower stations and power grids. They have also received over one billion U.S. dollars in loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, according to the deputies.
