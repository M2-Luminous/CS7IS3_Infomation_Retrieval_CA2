FR940429-2-00020 FR940429-2-00017 Corps of Engineers Intent To Prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Proposed Providence River and Harbor Maintenance Dredging Project AGENCY: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England Division, DOD. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: A draft and final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be prepared for the proposed maintenance dredging in the Providence River and Harbor in Rhode Island and associated disposal of dredged material. Dredging is required because shoaling in the channel has created unsafe conditions for navigation. The proposed project is intended to restore the navigational efficiency and safety of the Providence River and Harbor for the deep draft vessels using the area. The non-Federal sponsor of this project is the State of Rhode Island. Other Federal and non-Federal dredging projects will also be considered in the EIS. ADDRESSES: New England Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Impact Analysis Division, 424 Trapelo Road, Waltham, Massachusetts 02254&hyph;9149. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Larry Oliver, Impact Analysis Division, (617) 647&hyph;8347. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Providence River is formed by the junction of two small streams, the Woonasquatucket and Moshassuck Rivers, which rise in northern Rhode Island. The river flows southerly for one mile to the head of Providence Harbor at Fox Point in Providence, where it is joined by the Seekonk River. The Corps project consists of a 16.8-mile-long channel beginning near the head of Providence Harbor and following the river on a southerly course through the communities of East Providence, Cranston Barrington, Warwick, Bristol, and Portsmouth. Providence River and Harbor together constitute the principal commercial waterway in Rhode Island. Initial work on the river and harbor began in the 19th century with the construction of a nine-foot-deep channel near the head of the harbor. Subsequent improvements involved the construction of a 5.5 mile-long channel, 25 feet deep and generally 600 feet wide, extending from Fox Point to Bullock Point in east Providence; and extending this channel 5.1 miles southward to North Point (Poppasquash Neck) in Bristol and deepening it to 35 feet through its entire length. A modification to the project was completed in 1976. This involved extending the channel 6.2 miles southward to the southeasterly side of Prudence Island, and deepening the entire channel to 40 feet. The channel is generally 600 feet wide, except for the stretch between Fields Point (near the Providence-Cranston city line) and Fox Point, where it has varying widths of up to 1700 feet. Project Description The proposed maintenance dredging project consists of removing about 3.5 million cubic yards of shoal material between Fox Point in Providence and Conimicut Point in Warwick, Rhode Island to restore the Federal channel to its authorized dimensions. An estimated 400,000 cubic yards of material will be removed by non-Federal interests from the berthing areas served by the Federal channel. Various public and private entities in Rhode Island have expressed an interest in meeting other dredging needs concurrently with this project. Thus, the disposal site selected for the Providence River project may also be used for material dredged from areas not directly abutting the Providence River channel. The best current estimate is that an additional 1.5 million cubic yards may be added to the Federal Providence River and Harbor portion of this project by these activities, possibly including material from other Federal projects. Scoping The Corps will conduct an open scoping and public involvement process with scoping meetings in various locations throughout the State. All interested Federal, State, and local agencies are invited to attend one or more scoping meetings. Interested private and public organizations, affected Indian tribes, and individuals are encouraged to attend the scoping meetings. These meetings will be scheduled for the Spring of 1994. The alternatives analysis of dredged material disposal sites is expected to be a significant issue that will be addressed in depth in the EIS. The physical, chemical, biological, and economic effects of disposal will be evaluated in the EIS. Scoping will be used to identify any other issues not identified to date. Other Environmental Review and Consultation Requirements To the fullest extent possible, the EIS will be integrated with analyses and consultation required by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Pub. L. 93&hyph;205; 16 U.S.C. 1531, et seq.); the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (Pub. L. 89&hyph;655; 16 U.S.C. 470, et seq.); the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958, as amended (Pub. L. 85&hyph;624; 16 U.S.C. 661, et seq.) the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended (Pub. L. 92&hyph;583; 16 U.S.C. 1451, et seq.); and the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended (Pub. L. 92&hyph;532; 16 U.S.C. 1431, et seq.). Schedule The DEIS is anticipated to be available for public review in late Summer of 1994. Kenneth L. Denton, Army Federal Register Liaison Officer.
