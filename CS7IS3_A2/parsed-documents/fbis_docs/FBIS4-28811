At the end of the second "Japan-EU Industrial Policy and Cooperation Dialogue" in Tokyo, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the European Commission issued a joint statement calling for industrial cooperation not only in existing areas such as electric home appliances but in new sectors like computers, auto parts and office equipment, the officials said. The statement said both parties will also support dialogue between Japanese and EU business leaders to be held by the end of this year under the newly established "roundtable." Under the manufacturing technology fellowship program, young European engineers will be invited to work in Japanese plants for up to one year, the statement said. The MITI officials said Japan and the EU confirmed the importance of further action in existing cooperative areas, among them the training of European engineers through the Industrial Cooperation Center (ICC). The ICC was created in Tokyo in 1987 as a way to get European companies accustomed to Japanese business practices and market conditions. Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice MITI minister for international affairs, led a Japanese team at Tuesday's meeting while the European side was headed by Riccardo Perissich, chief of the European Commission's Industry Bureau [name and title as received].
