FBIS4-40293 "drsov116_a_94038" FBIS-SOV-94-116 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS No Additional Gas Supplied to Georgia No Additional Gas Supplied to Georgia LD1506135194 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1224 GMT 15 Jun 94 LD1506135194 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Russia is refusing to supply additional Russian gas and raw oil to Georgian oil processing factories. "Extraction of fuel and energy in Russia is falling, investments for the development of the oil and gas industry are being reduced and this cannot but affect our relations with our partners," a top-ranking employee from the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry reported to the Oil Information Agency. He added that "if there is a surplus, gas will be pumped via Ukrainian territory to Western Europe to prevent the disruption of exports." A total of 6.9 billion cubic meters of gas are shipped annually along the Vladikavkaz-Tbilisi pipeline, 2.7 billion cubic meters of which are intended for Armenia. Officials at the Fuel and Energy Ministry recognize that shipments of Russian raw oil to Georgia for re-processing in the republic are not possible due to the fact that Russian oil processing enterprises do not work to their full capacity. Observers believe that this problem can be partially solved thanks to the setting up of joint Russian-Georgian ventures to extract or re-process oil in the Tyumen region. The ministry is ready to render assistance to interested enterprises both in Russia and Georgia. "The issue of Russia's participation in the corporatization of the Georgian port of Poti cannot be solved positively because Russia intends primarily to render its financial support to Russian sea ports for their reconstruction and development," reported the employee.
