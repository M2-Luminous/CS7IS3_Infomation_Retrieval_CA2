Indications of a recovery have begun to appear in the machine tool industry, and even the construction equipment industry has emerged from the long tunnel of recession that has lasted since the latter half of 1990. Demand is appearing for industrial robots based on manpower conservation projects among small and midsized business businesses, and inquiries are increasing in the area of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM), although the prevailing outlook calls for a recessionary trends to continue in the first half of fiscal year 1994. However, shipbuilding has reached a very critical stage and the metal mold industry seems to have hit a double bottom, manifesting mixed trends among industries. This article analyzes current conditions and provides a projection of trends for each sector within the machinery industry. Machine Tools. Director Makoto Umehara, deputy chief of the Precision Machinery Operations Department of Citizen Watch Company speaks of recent trends by saying, "Since entering this year, January was bad, but there was some improvement in February and March. Since the beginning of April, we have averaged over 10 orders per week, indicating an improving trend." The machine tool industry experienced severe recessionary conditions in 1993, but an emerging mood of better times has been seen recently. A source at a major machine tool maker states, "We've seen some modest recovery," in reference to price-cutting promotions which had accelerated the drop in new orders. The competing makers have arrived at a point where financial results will no longer tolerate further price cuts and they are taking definite steps to gradually restore sensible pricing. Based on past experience that indicates "a recovery in prices if the economy improves," we might say that recent developments serve as evidence that we are undergoing a gradual recovery in demand. It appears that domestic appliances will lead the way out of the recession. It seems that rising demand for durable consumer goods such as amusement systems, video tape recorders, large television sets, and white goods is having an impact in the form of stepped-up inquiries for machine tools used to fabricate metal components. Demand should also come from companies engaged in the manufacture of multimedia-related CD-ROM [compact disk, read-only memory] drives and optical communication equipment. On the other hand, even in the automotive-related sectors where little movement is seen, special sectors have been actively placing inquiries. One such sector relates to diesel engine makers, where regulations on nitrogen oxide emissions will require alteration of engine design, leading to new demand for fabricating machinery. Moreover, those companies which in the past called for installation of specialized equipment are now being offered universal machining centers that are capable of responding to rapid changes in requirements related to facilities expansion and specifications. Plant operators are not necessarily satisfied with old machine tools just because demand for their products have risen. Plant operators are endeavoring to convert their operations so that they can lower processing and labor costs, while producing items with higher added value, multiple features, and more precision. Moreover, they are not simply seeking machine tools with a high degree of comprehensive capability, but machines that are responsive to their real needs. Shipbuilding. Shipbuilding was considered to be a comparatively stable industry in the past because the order and delivery cycle for the shipbuilding industry extend over a two-year period and the effects of economic trends lag in their impact on shipbuilding operations. However, vessels ordered in fiscal years 1992 and 1993 were priced cheap, causing substantial deterioration in profits and causing many major shipbuilders to suffer losses. It appears that fiscal years 1994 and 1995 will be a critical period that will test the ability of shipbuilders to survive. The environment for shipbuilders is extremely difficult owing to factors such as recessionary conditions, decline in the value of ships because of the worldwide recession in marine transportation, and a drop in cost competitiveness because of the strong yen. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange values have a major impact on the shipbuilding industry because of its borderless nature. As an example, if the dollar-denominated value of a ship falls 10 percent and the value of the yen advances 20 percent, the yen-denominated value of the ship drops 30 percent. The value of ships has fallen to 60 to 70 percent of their peak. Such conditions led to Japan's surrendering to Korea in 1993 the title of leading shipbuilding nation of the world. However, according to data released on 20 April by the Japan Ship Export Association on contracts for ships built for export in fiscal year 1993, orders for very large crude carriers (VLCC) with capacities in excess of 200,000 tons and container ships were received near the end of the fiscal year at a rate 2.8 times above the previous fiscal year, reaching a volume of 7,471,018 gross tons. Export contracts ran at a rate in excess of 7 million gross tons between fiscal years 1989 and 1991, but fell substantially to 2.67 million gross tons in fiscal year 1992. Contrary to expectations, orders for fiscal year 1993 recovered in volume, translating into adequate workloads for the various shipbuilders for fiscal years 1994 and 1995. Efforts to improve productivity, including purchase of materials and equipment from overseas sources on a dollar-denominated basis, have narrowed cost differences with South Korea and have led to the award of orders. However, the question is, will they be able to maintain profitability after consideration for the contemplated cost reductions? CAD/CAM Sales of CAD/CAM/computer-aided engineering (CAE) systems were not encouraging in fiscal year 1993 because of reductions in capital spending by industry in response to the recession. Demand for peripheral equipment such as digitizers, tablets, and plotters was also slow. Most firms expect slow sales during the first half of fiscal year 1994, but CAD vendors and plotter makers say "inquiries have increased recently." There are also comments that "the rate of decline has narrowed compared to the same month of the previous year," showing signs of brightening prospects in certain sectors. According to industry estimates, the potential market for CAD systems including hardware is 500-600 million yen. Sales in fiscal year 1993 dropped about 20 percent from the preceding year because of falling hardware prices. However, selected CAD vendors have experienced improving order rates since the beginning of fiscal year 1994, indicating that a recovery is imminent. Kiyadamu Systems of Shinagawa ward, Tokyo, recorded a 25-percent increase in orders during the January-March quarter of 1994 over the same period last year. The company indicates increasing replacement of mainframe versions of its CADAM units with the micro computer-aided design and manufacturing (CADAM) MC/X version of its principal work stations can take credit for the improving trends. Vice President Hiroshi Kawaguchi predicts, "Results will depend on an economic recovery, but this year should not be worse than fiscal year 1993." On the other hand, CAE systems sales have been good despite the recession. President Masaru Tateishi of Japan Emuesushi asserts, "We can maintain a 10 -ercent growth rate for the foreseeable future," stressing the significance of underlying demand. The market size for plotters, which are an output device for CAD drawings, is one-tenth of the CAD market. Versions selling well are limited to low-priced monochrome ink-jet plotters. Sales of such plotters also dropped about 25 percent because of slow sales and price wars. However, at Muto Industries and Graphitech where operating results had fallen, hope is being placed on signs of a "real" recovery as expressed in the words, "each month was recording results below those of the prior year, but beginning in November 1993 the rate of decline had narrowed." Makers of input devices known as digitizers and tablets which were previously sold mainly to CAD systems makers have begun to actively seek orders for tablets designed for the computer graphics markets to offset weakness in the CAD systems area. Robotics. "Normally, orders drop in April as a reaction to the closing of financial accounts at the end of March, but this year orders were stronger in April than in March," said the individual in charge of sales at DAIHEN Corp., a welding robot manufacturer. Similarly, President Mikio Yamada of Nejitake Seiko of Kofu city comments, "February signaled a bottoming out, and we have seen some improvement since March. It appears that small and midsized businesses, which could no longer delay manpower-saving actions, have finally begun to take action on the capital investment front." Manufacture of robots in fiscal year 1992 fell sharply by 30 percent from the previous year to 427.5 billion yen. Figures have not been compiled for fiscal year 1993, but it appears that a decline of about 400 billion yen cannot be avoided. In addition to the recession following the bursting of the bubble, the early spring rise in the value of the yen nipped the budding recovery and adversely affected the capital investment will of the automobile and electric machinery industries. However, recently, unprecedented changes have begun to appear in the capital investment stance of various manufacturers. Semiconductor and liquid crystal device makers have sharply increased spending on plant expansions, and the outlook is favorable for the home building and food manufacturing sectors. Further, strong demand persists for manpower-conserving versions of equipment used in sectors involving 3-K [kitanai, kiken, kitsui--dirty, dangerous, and difficult] operations. New types of products offered at the "International Industrial Robotics Fair" held at the Tokyo International Exhibition Hall, Harumi, Tokyo, in November 1993 included Yasukawa Electric Manufacturing Company's dustproof, waterproof "SV-16" and FANUC Ltd.'s "LR-Mate 100, which was priced under 2 million yen." Further, Mitsubishi Electric and Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing are moving aggressively into the robotics business for clean-room operations. Activities of this nature portend a gradual recovery for most robot makers in 1994, although not to the level that prevailed during the peak a few years ago. Moreover, a full-scale recovery is dependent on a return to better times for the automotive and home appliance industries. Although future and underlying potential exists for robots designed for new applications, they are unable to contribute greatly to near-term industry recovery, and their small quantities pose a cost burden. Strong hope is still tied to the automotive and domestic appliance sectors. The U.S. automotive sector recovered before Japan's, and the operating results of Japanese robotics firms whose U.S.-bound shipments are larger than domestic shipments, such as Fujikoshi and FANUC, have already begun to improve. It appears that the key to the future will be sales targeted at the United States, a recovery in the automotive and domestic appliance industries and the exploitation of new applications. Metal Molds. The principal users of metal molds such as the automotive and domestic appliance industries experienced limited improvements in sales since entering 1994, but such changes have not affected the metal molding industry, and many industry sources say that "the slow sales trends will continue at least until summer." According to Ministry of International Trade and Industry machinery statistics, metal mold production including in-house production totaled 32.456 billion yen in January 1994, 19.8 percent below the prior year, and in February totaled 30.623 billion yen, 13.5 percent below the prior year, showing no sign of recovery. In 1991, industry-wide production of metal molds totaled 544.069 billion yen, a historical peak, but a sharp decline in demand by major users such as automotive and domestic appliance makers resulted in a 19.2-percent drop in production in 1992. Production in 1993 fell only 0.5 percent, making it appear as if an improvement were taking place, but production resumed double-digit declines in 1994, giving the appearance of a double bottom. During the same period, major users of metal molds such as the automotive and domestic appliance industries aggressively implemented widespread restructuring, including improvements in production procedures, standardization of parts, and simplification of product design. Such trends had a decisive impact on demand for metal molds, the need for which depends greatly on the variety of designs and parts involved in the manufacture of end products. Even now, when signs of an economic recovery are visible, production simplification projects of this nature continue in the automotive and domestic appliance industries and industry sources say they "will continue into the future." As a result, although an economic recovery is underway, the same industry sources say that "a sharp recovery in the metal molding industry as a whole is not expected." The metal molding industry faces the urgent need to explore ways to survive. The eastern chapter of the Japan Metal Molding Industry Society has applied for a subsidy for the Tokyo-sponsored Local Industry Structural Enhancement Project which in fiscal 1993 worked on concepts in support of the project and is actively engaged in the preparation of future concepts envisioning globalization. It appears that Japan's metal molding industry, which has reached a turning point, is about to launch strategies aimed at globalization. Construction Equipment. Domestic demand for construction equipment is undergoing a full-scale recovery. Orders for hydraulic shovels which are a leading indicator for construction equipment orders, increased in January for the first time in four months and rose more than 10 percent in February and March. As a result, the view is spreading as indicated by Catepillar-Mitsubishi Managing Director Mikio Takeuchi that, "In fiscal year 1993, demand for hydraulic shovels increased less than 1 percent in volume, slightly exceeding the prior fiscal year, showing definite signs of a recovery for construction equipment." Although construction equipment demand has been slow since the latter half of 1990, these signs indicate better times ahead. In the March-May 1993 quarter, orders for hydraulic shovels increased and expectations for a recovery rose, then declined after the general contractor scandals and the long rainy season. Such experience has caused the manufacturers to become cautious, but Ryuichi Tokunaga, head of the Japan Construction Equipment Industry Association Operations Department, comments, "This recovery cycle appears to be solid in that equipment-leasing companies which had been cautious are increasing their orders." Further, orders for mini-shovels, which had declined continuously since June 1991, rose 6.9 percent in January 1994 over the same month in the prior year for the first time in 32 months, serving as evidence of a "full-scale recovery." Komatsu Construction Equipment Sales Director Shigetoshi Kumihashi provides a background analysis of the above developments as he says, "Newly initiated public works projects have increased recently. Utilization rates of rental equipment are up and project backlogs as of the end of fiscal year 1993 are higher than they were at the end of the prior year." Orders for bulldozers and wheel loaders have not recovered as much as for hydraulic shovels, but the rate of decline narrowed from the double-digit drops in the first half of fiscal year 1993 to a drop of about 3 percent in the period since the autumn of last year.
