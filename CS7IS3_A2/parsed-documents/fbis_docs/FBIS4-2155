According to the plan, within the next six years from now to the end of this century, the state will build a number of key projects in regions along the Chang Jiang, and the scale of investment will be huge. According to sources, a relevant department in the State Planning Commission has formulated the main contents of the "Chang Jiang strategy" and concrete procedures for implementing the strategy, and they include: With Shanghai's Pudong as the driving force, establish an economic sphere which includes eight regions and 28 large and medium cities from Chongqing to the Chang Jiang estuary. Expedite construction of infrastructure and key projects in these regions. There will be over 100 core projects each of which will entail investment exceeding 200 million yuan, including Shanghai's 1-million-tonne Jinshan oil refinery project, Pudong International Airport, Shanghai's project to produce 300,000 cars each year, Shanghai's acetic acid project, the second phase of the Qinshan Power Plant, the Panzhihua nonferrous metals project, the Beijing- Shanghai Expressway, Hubei's project to produce 300,000 cars a year, and the world-famous Three Gorges Project. Expedite the utilization of foreign funds by the regions along the Chang Jiang and broaden the scope of the utilization of foreign funds. Except for the state's first-grade communications facilities, which are not open up to the outside world, in principle, other areas may utilize foreign funds, which must not be used however to construct pornographic or gambling businesses. It is estimated that the utilization of foreign funds could reach $10 billion. Open up domestic markets to foreign businessmen and, according to the prevailing international practice, that is through the BOT [build-operate-transfer] [preceding three letters in Roman script] style, utilize foreign funds. Foreign businessmen will be responsible for the investment, construction, and operations for 15 years, and products produced by foreign-invested enterprises can be purchased by the Chinese side. Abolish "restricted areas." On the premise of not hurting the state's interests, foreign businessmen will be allowed to invest in trades which they deem appropriate.
