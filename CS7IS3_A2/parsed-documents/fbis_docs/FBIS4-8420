The letter follows: The April 10 incident in the border point of Peshkepi e Siperme grieved all the employees and readers of this paper. Acts of this kind, wherever they come from, have nothing to do with the sincere feelings of the peoples and the desire of the Greek minority in Albania to play the role of the bridge and factor of friendship between the Albanian people and the Greek one. We believe in the will to clarify this incident to the end in order not vanish hopes for relations of good neighbourliness. On this occasion we also express our profound and most sincere condolences to the families of the victims, who were unjustly killed. Our paper offers the families of the victims a modest sum of 80,000 new leks in support.
