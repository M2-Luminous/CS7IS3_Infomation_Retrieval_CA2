The midterm report was drawn up by a private group commissioned by the head of the ministry's Post Office Life Insurance Bureau. Noting that the current limit of 10 million yen for life insurance policyholders is not enough for high-quality coverage, the report urged the ministry to allow more expensive policies and pointed to a need for the contents of coverage to be improved. The report also urged active marketing of high-quality policies in the area outside of life and standard nonlife insurance. The sector, which includes cancer and nursing care coverage, is dominated by foreign companies and the United States is requesting the sector's liberalization to be put on hold.
