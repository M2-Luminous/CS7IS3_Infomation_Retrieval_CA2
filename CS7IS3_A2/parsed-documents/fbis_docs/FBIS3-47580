Ruling and opposition parties of the upper house committee failed Friday to agree on a timetable for voting on the government's political reform package, which cleared the House of Representatives last November. Senior members of the upper house committee from both ruling coalition and opposition parties will meet again Monday to discuss the schedule after a public hearing on the political reform process is held that day in Tokyo, officials said. Ruling parties threatened Friday to table a motion calling for a committee vote on the political reform bills on January 19, as the January 29 scheduled close of the current extraordinary Diet session is drawing near. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who failed to legislate political reform bills by the end of last year as he pledged last August, has vowed to enact them during the parliamentary extension, staking his position on the renewed pledge. The ruling coalition postponed the closure of the 90-day Diet session for 45 days beyond December 15 in order to achieve Hosokawa's target. In Friday's steering committee wrangling, the coalition for the time being retracted the threat of forcing a vote when agreement was reached to hold public hearings in five cities outside Tokyo on Tuesday, in addition to Monday's hearing in the capital. Public hearings are a prerequisite to putting the bills to a floor vote in an upper house plenary session. In the hearings, knowledgeable persons recommended by the ruling and opposition parties, respectively, express their views on the bills. After Monday's public hearing in Tokyo, the coalition will urge the opposition camp to agree to conclude deliberations on the bills on Wednesday. If the opposition refuses to accept the proposal, committee chief Yubun Ueno will decide on the schedule, exercising his prerogative as chairman, coalition sources said. In such a case, the opposition is expected to table a noconfidence motion against Ueno. The government's political reform bills are designed to replace the current multi-seat constituencies for the more powerful lower house with a combination of single-seat districts and proportional representation, as well as to tighten curbs on political fund-raising activities in a bid to stem repeated corruption. The existing electoral system is believed to be a major cause of lavish campaign spending because of competition among candidates of the same party in single districts, while the current Political Funds Control Law is seen as having loopholes that make it possible for politicians to escape punishment for wrongdoing. In the 252-seat upper house, the ruling coalition has 131 seats, while the Liberal Democratic Party holds 99, the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) 11, the Niin Club five, and independents five. Several upper house members of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest bloc in the alliance, have expressed opposition to the bills and could vote against them or abstain, greatly weakening the coalition's chances of passing the bills in the upper house.
