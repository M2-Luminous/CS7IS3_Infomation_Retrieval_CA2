According to military sources, the U.S. imperialists' Marine Air Corps from overseas bases on 10 March made sorties over the South Korean skies and conducted provocative long-range surprise-attack bombing exercises aimed at a northward invasion. On 10 March, some 12 pursuit planes took off from a base in Japan, refueling in mid air, and ran wild in the surprise bombing exercise of given objects in attack position in the skies over areas near Sangdong and Kunwi, South Korea as well as the exercise of returning to the base. The war exercise, which was conducted with the support of aerial refueling planes, was a dangerous game to enhance the actual-combat capability of the long-range air corps in the surprise bombing of objects inland of the northern half of the Republic. While the war exercise was going on, an RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane, that flew from a base in Okinawa over the South Korean skies, made a long-distance flight over areas near the Military Demarcation Line [DML], took comprehensive pictures of the whole area of the northern half of the Republic, and conducted electronic reconnaissance. In the meantime, the South Korean puppets ran amok with provocative war exercises, which were very agitating to us, near the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ] of the MDL. On 10 March, over 800 puppet Army's armed villains loaded in some 50 armored cars advanced up to the fore areas near Chupa-ri of the South Korean Chorwon County, and worked themselves into a war frenzy openly occupying a battle position in broad daylight. Prior to this, on 9 March, the puppet Army's 105mm artillery groups appeared near Chongja-ri, Paju County and Chungsan, Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province, were filled with northward invasion frenzy and dropped over 90 bombs in areas near the DMZ of the MDL.
