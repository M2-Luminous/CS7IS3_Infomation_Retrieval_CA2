These caravans only can go up to Karachi. India is Pakistan's eternal and ignoble enemy and it has never been lethargic or absentminded in harming Pakistan politically, economically, or diplomatically. Even now, it is punishing the Kashmiri Muslims only because they aspire for Pakistan and chant slogans of Long Live Pakistan. Given this situation, if Kazakhstan asks Pakistan for a transit facility to India, then we can only refuse it. The foreign minister rightly said that no such caravan can proceed to India through Pakistan. The foreign minister and the present government may be asked to justify the agreement they signed with the Iranian Government for gas supply to India with a transit facility through Pakistan, which, according to reports received so far, was granted without any fee. How can an enemy country, and that too with which we do not have any transit agreement, be allowed to have a transit facility? We should reject any proposal, even if there is any possibility of earning some revenue by allowing the transit facility, because it is tantamount to helping the enemy. The nation justifiably is apprehensive and suspicious of this agreement. The opposition is creating an impression that there is something else [word indistinct] in the agreement. We do not think it wise to respect the wishes of a friendly country at the expense of our own interests. Will Iran allow Pakistan or any other country to use Iranian territory for providing any facility to an enemy? Why didn't the foreign minister adopt the same stand, which he did in the case of Kazakhstan, on Iran as well?
