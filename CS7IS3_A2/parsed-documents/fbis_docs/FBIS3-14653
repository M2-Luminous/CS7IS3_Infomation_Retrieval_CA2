The two sides met to hammer out security plans for the West Bank town of Hebron, where a Jewish settler massacred 30 Arabs last month, and clear the way for the last leg of talks on launching autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. The talks went ahead after 'Arafat called an emergency meeting in the PLO's Tunis headquarters to discuss the impact of the killings of six members of the Fatah Hawks by the Israeli army in the occupied Gaza Strip late Monday. The Hawks are the armed wing of 'Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO. The Fatah leader in the Gaza Strip, Zakariya al-Agha, told journalists that he shared the people's "feeling that the talks have to be suspended for a while." Al-Agha asked: "For how long do we have to be subjected to these massacres, even though a peace process is going on." He called for international protection to guarantee the safety of Palestinians and rejected as insufficient military regrets about the incident. The PLO broke off the autonomy negotiations after the February 25 Hebron massacre and has said it will not resume them until it receives proper security guarantees for the occupied territories. Differences exist on the nationality and number of foreign observers to be deployed in Hebron as well as on the number of Palestinian policemen and the type of weapons they should have, according to negotiators.
