Since the signing of the agreement in Cairo, Naftali Sahar and Ilan Sudri have been murdered by terrorists. [Baraq] We must look reality in the eye. In view of the fact that thousands of Palestinians have employee-employer, buyer-seller, or service supplier-receiver relationships within the boundaries of Israel, no police force, security service, or army can technically prevent the physical ability to raise a knife. We will do our best to have good control, and I am sure that the Israel Police and the Shin Bet will do their utmost. Ultimately, nevertheless, some of the responsibility lies with the Israeli people. Today, we are still responsible for providing a livelihood and jobs to the inhabitants of Gaza. That is why we must allow them to enter Israel. I hope not to get into a situation where in the wake of similar incidents we are forced to close off Gaza. Conditions will change once an agreement is reached. In my opinion, if workers from Gaza murder Israelis within the boundaries of Israel, they may very well not be allowed to come in. [Scemama] Are you saying that this could be a sanction? Will we simply bar workers from entering Israel? [Baraq] I am stating my opinion. At the moment, we as a state are responsible for them and we must provide them jobs. If and when an agreement is reached and they become the responsibility of the Palestinian authority -- if some of them take advantage of the right to work in Israel to murder their employers or the right to travel by taxi to murder its driver -- it is my assessment that this could lead us to the conclusion that such a situation can no longer go on. In my opinion, the very realization that such a possibility exists will make them have second thoughts and, perhaps, reduce such incidents. Otherwise, we will have to make some decisions. [Scemama] How about Israelis who live in settlements in Gaza or Israelis driving in the Gaza Strip? Does this agreement satisfy you? In your view, can this agreement provide security for Israelis traveling on the roads or living in the Gaza Strip? [Baraq] A great deal was achieved in the agreement. On the other hand, many points remain to be worked out -- and I suppose will be worked out within the next few weeks in Taba and in Cairo -- before we can sign the final agreement for implementation. A great deal was achieved in that the settlements are recognized as one bloc surrounded by a security circle rather than individually. The agreement recognizes our responsibility for Israeli traffic on the roads, including the right to carry out independent Israeli action on the roads and in their immediate proximity. And, of course, it recognizes our responsibility for external security. These three points, which were recognized in principle by the Palestinians, must now be translated into particulars for implementation. [Scemama] Sir, today there are undercover units, Shin Bet, IDF [Israel Defense Forces], and Border Police troops in the midst of Arab population centers. What will prevent an Arab terrorist from setting out from Khan Yunus, approaching a settlement fence, opening fire, and hurting people, then fleeing back to this Arab town? [Baraq] Within a radius of several hundred meters from a settlement -- that is, within a distance from which he can effectively open fire at the settlement -- he will come up against the IDF which will be in charge of security. Outside this radius, in the area controlled by the Palestinians, we expect the Palestinian police force to act effectively long before terror attacks and long after terror attacks where the perpetrators are not killed or wounded in the course of the attack. [Scemama] Can we place our confidence in such a future Palestinian police force? [Baraq] The agreement we are working on is largely based on a strong and effective Palestinian police force which would cooperate with us. If they fail this test, we will have to reach conclusions about the agreement itself and about extending it to the rest of Judaea and Samaria later on. I think they will have a strong incentive to meet these conditions but, if they do not, we will have to reach some conclusions. [Scemama] Sir, in the course of the political negotiations, did you propose to evacuate certain settlements, such as Netzarim, from the Qatif Bloc, in order to overcome some security problem? [Baraq] We did not make such a proposal and we are not even supposed to adopt a position on any of the issues that were decided on by the government. The government made a decision, which it put into writing and signed in the DOP [Declaration of Principles], to the effect that no settlement will be relocated at this stage. That is why no settlement, including Netzarim with its 27 or 28 families, is being relocated.... [Scemama, interrupting] There have been reports about such a recommendation by military elements. [Baraq, continuing] ....Or smaller locations. We are not evacuating any place and there certainly was not and could not be such a recommendation by the military. [Scemama] Do you estimate that the IDF will evacuate Gaza and Jericho by 13 April? When will the withdrawal actually start now that the agreement has been signed? [Baraq] This is not the agreement which had originally been scheduled to be signed on 13 December. This agreement elaborates in greater detail on the issues I mentioned earlier and passes the torch to the working teams which will now have to sit for weeks -- maybe three or six week, I do not know exactly; it depends on the responsiveness of the other side -- and work out a detailed agreement for implementation. Only when we get such an agreement will we be able to assess when its implementation will be completed. [Scemama] How long will it take to withdraw from these areas the moment such an agreement is concluded? [Baraq] In my opinion, the moment an agreement is concluded a withdrawal can be completed within six weeks or perhaps two months. The DOP originally talks about four months from the signing of the agreement. In practice, we do not need so much time. However, we have not yet signed the agreement we will have to implement. This still lies ahead of us and calls for a lot of work. [Scemama] Gen. Baraq, after the first Oslo agreement senior military sources whose identity I do not know said the Army was not let in on the negotiations and criticized this fact. Now there is harsh criticism about the excessive involvement in the political negotiations of officers dressed up in suits and ties. You must probably be aware of this criticism. [Baraq] In both cases the criticism did not come from within the ranks of the Army. We think the decision not to let the Army in on the details of the negotiations about the Oslo agreement was right. It is not that I or the chief of intelligence did not know that an agreement was in the works or about some of its contents. The prime minister and the foreign minister did the right thing by refraining from sharing with us what clearly are political decisions about which there is a deep and legitimate argument within Israeli society. On the other hand, it becomes vital to include security officials the moment the agreement must be put into practice and discussions begin about security arrangements along the roads, the security circles around the settlements, joint patrols, the role of the Palestinian police force, and the activities of our forces. After all, when all is said and done, we are the ones who will have to move to the other side of the table and proceed to implement it the day after the agreement is signed. Our platoon commander must know what his duties are, what he can and cannot do; the Palestinian policeman and the Israeli settler who is being given protection must know what to do, and I believe the Israeli public also must know.
