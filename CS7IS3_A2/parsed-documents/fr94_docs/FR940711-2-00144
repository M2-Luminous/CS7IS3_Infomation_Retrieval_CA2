FR940711-2-00144 FR940711-2-00057 Consolidated Natural Gas Company (70&hyph;8167) Consolidated Natural Gas Company (``CNG''), CNG Tower, 625 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment under Sections 6 and 7 of the Act and Rule 54 thereunder to its declaration previously filed under Sections 6 and 7 of the Act and Rule 50(a)(5) thereunder. By order dated April 21, 1993 (HCAR No. 25800) (``April Order''), the Commission authorized CNG to issue and sell on or before June 30, 1995 up to $400 million principal amount of debentures (``Debentures'') in one or more series at a price, exclusive of accrued interest, which would be not less than 98% nor more than 101% of the principal amount and at an interest rate which would be a multiple of 1/8, 1/10, or 1/20 of 1%. The Debentures would mature in not more than thirty years and would be issued in accordance with the indenture between CNG and Chemical Bank (successor by merger to Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company), as Trustee, dated May 1, 1971 (``Indenture''). CNG has sold $300 million of Debentures under the April Order, thus $100 million of Debentures remains authorized for issue and sale. CNG now proposes to change its Indenture by adding section 4.02 so that it may reserve the right, without the consent of the holders of future debenture issues sold under the April Order, to amend sections 6.06 and 6.07 of the Indenture. New section 4.02 provides: The Company reserves the right, subject to appropriate corporate action, but without consent, approval or other action by holders of debentures of any series created after May 1, 1994, to make such amendments to the Indenture, as heretofore supplemented and amended, as shall be necessary in order to amend Sections 6.06 and 6.07 thereof so as to modify or eliminate the provisions or requirements of such Sections, or any part thereof and the definition of any term used in either of such Sections or related thereto, as the Company may determine in its sole discretion. Section 6.06 provides that funded debt (as defined) cannot be incurred and subsidiary preferred stock cannot be issued unless: (1) The consolidated income available for interest and subsidiary preferred stock dividends of CNG and its subsidiaries for any 12 consecutive months within 15 months immediately preceding the date additional funded debt is incurred is not less than 21/2 times the sum of the total annual interest charges and the total subsidiary preferred stock dividends, assuming the incurrence of such additional funded debt or issuance of such preferred stock, as the case may be; and (2) after giving effect to the incurring of the additional funded debt and issuance of preferred stock, the sum of the outstanding consolidated debt of CNG and its subsidiaries and the amount of outstanding subsidiary preferred stock shall not be more than 60% of the consolidated net tangible assets of CNG and its subsidiaries. Section 6.07 provides that a subsidiary of CNG cannot incur funded debt or issue preferred stock to a third party unless funded debt and preferred stock of the subsidiary will not exceed 60% of the total capitalization of the subsidiary, and the principal amount of funded debt and amount of preferred stock of all subsidiaries of CNG shall not exceed 15% of consolidated net tangible assets. CNG also requests authorization to extend the expiration date for the issuance and sale of the remaining $100 million principal amount of Debentures under the April Order from June 30, 1995 to June 30, 1996.
