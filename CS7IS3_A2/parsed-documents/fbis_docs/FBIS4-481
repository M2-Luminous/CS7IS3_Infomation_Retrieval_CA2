Addressing a public meeting in Vereeniging, Gen. Viljoen said the first dealt with procedures for counting votes to establish Afrikaner support for a volkstaat [homeland]. It would also make provision for community councils for areas outside the volkstaat to enable Afrikaners who did not live in the volkstaat to keep in touch with the volkstaat government. Gen. Viljoen said it was hoped that the agreement could be signed within days. He said the second agreement would define the term self- determination. Gen. Viljoen said it was necessary to define the term to avoid any misunderstanding after the election. It also enabled people voting for a volkstaat to know exactly what they were voting for. He said he insisted on as many representatives at foreign embassies as possible to be present at the signing of the accords to forestall a turnabout by the ANC after the election .
