Luis Macas, president of the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, said the people are currently asking the government to reconsider the law, which also interests the Indians. That is why we are going to stage a preventive demonstration. Macas pointed out that the Indians will stop their activities, set up blockades, and march during the day to express their dissatisfaction with the 71-percent fuel increase, which has been in effect for more than a week. Macas added that if the government does not heed the Ecuadoran people's protests, they will obviously have to consider stronger measures.
