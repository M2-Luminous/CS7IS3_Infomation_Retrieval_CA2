The Futures Market Is In Its Ascendancy To adapt to the rapid development of the mainland's market economy, [the futures market] is catching up with world trends. The government at the end of 1992 began to gradually relax its restrictions on approval of futures companies. Beginning with Shanghai's metals, coal production, petroleum, and chemical industry exchange; Nanjing's petroleum exchange; Shenzhen's nonferrous metal exchange; Zhengzhou's wholesale grain market; and Hainan's exchange, they opened the first stream of mainland futures exchanges and advanced them to international standards. And in the past year, an even larger number of futures companies have been sprouting up all over. At the end of 1992, the first large, national futures company -- the Chinese International Futures Corporation -- came into being in Beijing. At the beginning of this year, the first state futures broker -- the Guangdong General Futures Brokerage -- was established in Guangzhou. On 18 April, the mainland's largest-scale international futures exchange was opened in Nanjing. The largest comprehensive futures exchange in the country -- the Dalian Commodity Exchange -- also opened. In addition, the first high-level futures markets in west central and south China -- the South China Commodity Futures Exchange and the Chongqing Capital Goods Exchange --will be starting business soon. The first settlement firm in the country -- the Extensive Futures Settlement Firm -- formally went into operation recently. The Hainan International Futures Exchange with 100 million yuan invested has broken ground and begun construction. According to incomplete statistics, not counting the numerous underground brokerages conducting business without a license, the mainland presently has more than 360 licensed futures companies. A great many of these are Chinese-Hong Kong joint ventures, that is, branch organizations of Hong Kong brokerages in the mainland. There are presently more than 40 exchanges at various places throughout the country. Underground Companies Stir Up Trouble As regards the content of the business, mainland futures companies mainly conduct commodity and foreign exchange futures exchanges. The futures market plays an ever more important part in the economic life. The transaction price of the first futures market in the nation -- the Shanghai Metals Exchange -- has become the standard price or the reference price for metals exchange throughout the country. After being open less than a year, its total transactions have reached more than 60 million tons and the value of its transactions has broken 100 billion yuan and has elicited at great deal of respect and interest in the international futures field. Presently, mainland underground futures brokers are extremely active. But current laws and regulations are very unsound. They lack rudimentary supervision and there are obvious corrupt practices in the business. Internal management of underground futures brokers is extremely chaotic. They only care about collecting commissions. Futures is still an unfamiliar term to the vast majority of the people in the country. Even several individual investors who are "speculating" on futures do not have a deep understanding of the method. And underground futures companies keep their mouths shut about the risks. They only play up that "playing" futures can earn a lot of money. Some even engage in business trickery such as delaying reporting the price and secretly overcharging. Because good and bad people are mixed in, there are no rules and regulations, and their accounts do not receive the accounting oversight of relevant departments, it is very easy to falsely report a few figures and mislead investors. Moreover, when there is a dispute with a customer, the department concerned does not pursue it, because they have no legal basis. Private Investors Suffer 90 Percent Losses A broker pointed out that, with the exception of specialized investment organizations, private individuals engaging in commodities and foreign exchange futures exchanges have losses as high as 90 percent or more. A few customers who are expecting excessively high earnings have a hard time accepting [the situation] and public indignation is aroused, which can easily trigger the outbreak of an incident. Several foreign futures specialists early on expressed deep concern about this. Excessive speculation not only can dampen the confidence of Chinese investors, ultimately it will have an impact on the just beginning Chinese futures market. In another respect, the appearance of underground futures companies affects the business of regular licensed futures companies. A regular Guangzhou broker established at the end of last year is presently Guangdong's most standardized company. But in the last two months, their total number of customers has fluctuated around 50 and their daily transactions at around 200, far from the ideal 500. The main reason is that the internal management of regular companies is rather strict compared to lax management of "underground" companies, creating several imperceptible inconveniences for their customers to the point that the customers do not dare to lightly "patronize." To Guard Against Losing Control There Must Be Legislation Several experts have pointed out that despite the general reliability and soundness in the initial development of the mainland futures market, in present-day China, the development of various types of futures brokers is too fast, too numerous, and too indiscriminate, and they are facing the danger of losing control. Moreover, the more than forty futures exchanges are essentially specialized and the scope of their business is very narrow and they are limited in the way that their operations follow international practice. Some have even become forward contract and wholesale markets. Even the Shanghai Metals Exchange and the Shenzhen Metals Exchange, in the view of foreign specialists, are forward merchandise exchanges and are not strictly futures exchanges. Presently, many mainland futures brokers settle with foreign exchange and exchange renminbi for foreign exchange and send it out of the country. But if they do not have permission, this amounts to foreign exchange flight. Because the departments concerned are not in agreement whether futures exchanges are a form of financial instrument or a business activity, regulations on futures exchanges are not distinct, not clear, and not specific. This situation has raised the concern of the state. Somewhat earlier the State Foreign Exchange Control Bureau gave approval for the Guangdong Foreign Exchange Subbureau to grant permits this year to run three or four futures companies, but they must be strictly checked by the department concerned and obtain an operating license before they can operate. If they go into operation on their own without approval, they will be considered in violation of the law and prosecuted. The first Guangzhou futures exchange laws and regulations, and the first in the nation, were formally promulgated a while ago. On 27 April, the State Industry and Commerce Administrative Control Bureau promulgated the Provisional Control Procedures for Futures Brokers and from that day the industry and commerce bureaus of various localities no longer handled futures brokers registrations, generally they are registered by the State Industry and Commerce Bureau. It is understood that the departments concerned are studying how to improve mainland futures markets and standardize futures brokering activities. The specialists concerned are appealing to the government that when they develop the futures market, they should become familiar as quickly as possible with futures and establish standard rules and regulations for the operation of futures markets at an early date and not incite futures fever too early. They must now establish a centralized futures oversight and control organization and they can consider expanding the present National Securities Control Commission to a National Futures and Securities Control Commission. At the same time, they must formulate unified national futures exchange rules and regulations. bold> Caption 1. p. 57 (top left): A Futures Management and Administration Person Sent From Hong Kong Lectures Guangzhou Brokers 13619
