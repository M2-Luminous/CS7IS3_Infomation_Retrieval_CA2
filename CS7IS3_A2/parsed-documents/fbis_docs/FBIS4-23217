Whereas General Constand Viljoen compromised himself by his part in the election, so that he was under obligation to attend Mr. Mandela's inauguration, the HNP still stands aloof. This stance gives it inner strength, with the result that it can now embark on future plans without any prejudice. The political struggle will now be transformed into a people's [volk] movement. The recent election has clearly drawn the dividing lines between right and left, between those that voted and those that did not vote. Those that did not vote are physically and spiritually geared to continue the struggle. Mr. Marais stated in a circular to party members that the veil has been lifted from the future the HNP is facing. This future will be based on the principles of healthy nationalism in which the HNP has firmly embedded itself since its creation. This will now be given new content. The HNP will enter the new phase of the struggle under the motto: "Reconquer, Regain, Repair." Mr. Marais states his case as follows: "The emphasis will henceforth fall more strongly on the sentiments and values of Afrikaner nationalism -- the Afrikaans language, the history of our people's heroes, and the basic rights of a nation." Mr. Marais further quotes from H.T. Colenbrander to indicate that the onslaught against the Afrikaner has not subsided: "The world has, despite the peace accord of 1902, not finished dealing with the Afrikaner." He continues: "The struggle for the existence of the people -- which did not start yesterday -- is not ending tomorrow....A tree with such roots does not get pulled out of the ground easily. It might be standing bare without any leaves due to an unfavorable season, but the sap still goes up the stem and again it will have bear blossoms." Mr. Marais is very determined that the HNP will continue to work against the situation brought about by the reforms of Mr. John Vorster, P.W. Botha, and F.W. de Klerk's "National" Party. Right now there are new obstacles in the struggle, such as the Bill of Human Rights and the interim constitution, but this will not deter the HNP from the task at hand. He pointed out that the HNP previously also had to put up with laws that impeded the struggle. This did not discourage the HNP, and it will once again continue, just as it has done over the past 25 years. The whites presently find themselves in a similar situation as the Boers found themselves after the Second War of Liberation. They were impoverished and decimated by the British massacre of 26,000 women and children in concentration camps. Again they are impoverished and deprived of tens of thousands of children and potential mothers through a drop in the birth rate. The Afrikaner's struggle, however, had never been based on the power of numbers, but rather on the faith we have in our course, on our confidence in the God of our fathers, and on the courage and the will of the minority to continue the struggle."
