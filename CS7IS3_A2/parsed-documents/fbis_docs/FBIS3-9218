The government denies involvement in the sackings of 129 employees from the state radio earlier this month. They included some of the most experienced and best known journalists and editors. With national elections only two months away, the dismissals are widely seen as an attempt to stifle criticism of the government and the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum which is trailing in the polls. The Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists has strongly criticised the sackings and says its report "will be the basis of political action". Gustl Glatffelder, a radio journalist from German Sudwestfunk and chairman of the investigating committee, said: "Nobody could destroy our impression that indeed political reasons were behind it. "The government gave (the head of radio) $1.02 million (700,000 pounds) to finance the firings. They can't say they haven't been involved." Helsinki Watch, a division of Human Rights Watch, has already sent a letter to the prime minister, Peter Boross, "to express concern about dangers to freedom of expression with respect to state radio and television". The acting head of radio Laszlo Csucs, insisted the firings were to reduce the heavy overstaffing of state radio but he also referred to "ethical and professional reasons". Opposition parties have accused the government of crude political manipulation of the media. But the nationalist politician, Istvan Csurka, and his supporters have welcomed it as the start of a long overdue political cleansing of former communists from the state- owned media. The government came under heavy criticism last autumn when the acting head of television axed Channel Two's evening news programme and suspended its staff. He accused them of manipulating a news report. Since 1990, parliament has failed to pass a media law to regulate state broadcasting and distribute frequencies for commercial stations. The heads of state radio and television are government appointees. The report from the International Federation of Journalists comes at an embarrassing time for the government as it prepares to submit its application for EU membership. "Evidently there are limits to how far the government can go. There are signs we are close to those limits, from the information we get from international bodies," Silvano Presa, from the European Commission delegation in Budapest, said.
