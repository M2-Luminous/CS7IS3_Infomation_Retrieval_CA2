Although [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua does not want to admit officially that he benefited a great deal from the work accomplished by his predecessor, Pierre Joxe, the institutional boil has been lanced and the nationalist family has exploded. One cannot help but notice that the government's continuity of attitude toward Corsica scorns changeovers. By formally establishing the islands specific nature in terms of fiscal structure and language, Edouard Balladur has once again shown that the "center" is intelligent enough to make concessions to its "periphery." The reason of state includes that kind of common sense. However, nothing has yet been signed and sealed. The fate of Messrs. Balladur and Pasqua's gentle approach still depends on two unknowns. The first unknown stems from the reception given it by the nationalists. It is obvious now that the government has taken over part of their rhetoric on the "Corsica issue" -- the part that can be best reconciled with the imperative of the "unity of the Republic" -- so that it can do a better job toning down its originality. After playing the game so far, could they accept -- in the long term -- this kind of erosion of their ideological capital? The reaction of "A Cuncolta Naziunaliste," a legal movement close to the historic FLNC-Canal [Corsica National Liberation Front], denouncing the "appearances of change" and the "reality of dependence," bears witness to genuine confusion. The state most certainly provides less opportunity for their criticism than during the touchy Jacobin period, but there is nothing to say that these nationalists will not rebound off other resentments and, in particular, the blunders that could be made by their local opponents. That is the second unknown. Will the traditionalist elected representatives, who bear a great deal of responsibility for the troubles afflicting the island, be up to the task? While the guerilla war surrounding the succession of Jean-Paul de Rocca Serra, the RPR [Rally for the Republic] speaker of the Corsica Assembly, gets under way, will they yield to the poisoned delicacy of the "combinazione" [combination] which they habitually delight in, thus letting precious time slip away? Will they make good use of the 3 billion francs which Paris and Brussels are going to shower on them between now and the end of the decade? The past tends more toward skepticism, and we can understand that Mr. Pasqua wants to hasten the change of generations. Otherwise, the nationalists, which have always lived on the denunciation of the "clan," will find an unexpected mainstay in it.
