Between one election rally and another -- this evening he will be in Brescia -- Umberto Bossi vents the bad temper caused by the troubled events leading up to the election and sets out his anxieties regarding the next parliamentary term. The deep north resounds with the cry of pain raised by the League's hard-liners, who will not swallow the alliance with Berlusconi and "contamination" by the MSI [Italian Social Movement]. Opinion polls cast doubt on the League leadership in the north, where it is prey to Forza Italia. But what Bossi fears more than the forecasts is a "restoration by stealth," which would give rise to "a grave danger, the break-up of the state." [Vimercati] Bossi, what are you up to? Changing the stakes? They said it was the League that was pursuing the break up of the state. [Bossi] I am getting tired of repeating this: Federalism is the opposite of secession, it is an institutional buffer that prevents a divorce between areas in the country that differ too widely. [Vimercati] Okay, but what do you mean by "either in government or secession?" [Bossi] I live among the people, I listen to them. And I notice that there is a widespread desire to go it alone in the north. The people will not agree to turn back, to watch while the centralist state is restored. And if victory were to escape the League, or if it were to remain outside government, a centralist comeback would be inevitable. The north would have no part in it, and the result would be a break up. [Vimercati] What could happen, in concrete terms? [Bossi] It is not for me to say, but there are a lot of people in the north who will not agree to go back to the old system, to pay new taxes to cover the cost of an unacceptable political system based on bribes. The north cannot waste this opportunity, it is ready to go to any lengths. And the south, too, in my opinion, will go back to its old godfathers or will try to break its links with the state unless it obtains development and employment. [Vimercati] So you maintain that a vote for the liberal-democratic alignment is a vote for a united Italy? [Bossi] For a united, federalist Italy. But a win for the freedom alignment is not enough. Within the alignment, it is the League that must win, otherwise, if the recycled politicians in Forza Italia and the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] were to gain the upper hand, the mechanism of change could be brought to a standstill. [Vimercati] You have a single symbol and a joint manifesto, and yet you refer to the Berlusconians as "recycled." Do you think that is polite? [Bossi] I call things as I see them. I will not renege on the alliance with Forza Italia, even though I understand the distress that this inflicts on the League members, the people who have sacrificed themselves for the revolution. But I cannot, and will not, hide the fact that the League is one thing and Forza Italia is another. The League was the force behind the revolution, the locomotive for change. The others have jumped onto a moving train. If the League wins and goes into government, it will be another, perhaps decisive, step forward for us. If Forza Italia wins, or the CCD, or the Right, there is a danger that the train will stop, or even derail. [Vimercati] Be honest, now: Is there a leadership problem in the liberal-democratic alignment? [Bossi] After the election, what will count will be numbers in parliament. I am certain that the League will have the strongest and most united parliamentary party. We shall be a force to be reckoned with in government, and I have some surprises up my sleeve, a secret weapon. [Vimercati] Perhaps you want to emulate the socialists? [Bossi] This is no laughing matter; the league has been the socialists' grave. We shall govern with Forza Italia and anyone else who accepts our manifesto. Of course, I should have preferred the League to stand alone against the rest, but that way we would have left Berlusconi in the hands of his inventors, in other words the Christian democrats. [Vimercati] Are you sure the DC [Christian Democratic Party] welcomed Forza Italia's intervention? [Bossi] Let us say that the Christian democrats intended Berlusconi to represent the good League member who would eat up the evil League: the great recycler who, together with Segni, would put a nice bag of votes into the DC's basket. But we repulsed poor Segni with losses and broke up the Segni-Martinazzoli-Berlusconi axis, bringing the latter over to the freedom alignment. [Vimercati] So why are you distancing yourselves from him? [Bossi] Because the misinformation put about by the regime is confusing the voters and trying to make them forget which is the true motive force for change. There is an attempt to bring political debate back into the confines of a false right-left confrontation, when the real choice is between statism and the free market, federalism and centralism. The more the League wins, the greater will be the triumph of freedom: political, economic, and institutional freedom. [Vimercati] Do you not think that Berlusconi shares these slogans? [Bossi] We shall see when he is put to the test, when, for instance, we call for the antitrust rules to be applied to television. [Vimercati] Do you intend to join forces with the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] in the attack on Fininvest? [Bossi] The very idea! The private television companies have been the saving of pluralism in television, but we are against monopolies, and even duopolies. [Vimercati] You have recently gone back to attacking the public prosecutors. Why? [Bossi] I am afraid they might sway the election campaign, that they might try to prevent the emergence of a strong political power capable of extending the arm of the law to the caste of the examining magistrates as well. Even those who don gowns must go to jail when they commit mistakes. Diego Curto is the only one to suffer this fate so far. A single arrest is not much in a category that has always lived in the shadow of the parties. [Vimercati] Do you not fear that calling for a turn of the screw on the examining magistrates will make you unpopular? [Bossi] Turning of the screw? No, it is only a matter of balance. And I guarantee that there will be no more contact between the judiciary and the parties in federal Italy. That is why not even one of our candidates is gowned.
