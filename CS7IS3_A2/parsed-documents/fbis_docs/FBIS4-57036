A consultative group that groups together all of the grassroots indigenous organizations represented in the Confederation of Indigenous People of Eastern Bolivia has been created. The consultative group will meet every so often with the Ethnic Affairs Secretariat to discuss and approve programs. It is worth noting that the secretariat respects the indigenous peoples' organizational structure, which is divided into three groups: a people's directorate, an intermediate organization, and the grassroots, with which the dialogue must be held through the mechanisms established for that purpose.
