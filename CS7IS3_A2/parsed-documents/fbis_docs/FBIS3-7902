There is no point in debating which is more important," Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said in Budapest on Wednesday [23 February] at a session of Parliament's Human Rights Committee. He went on to say that "a good relationship with our neighbors is inconceivable in places where the minorities are oppressed, on the other hand, settling the situation of national minorities naturally brings an improvement in relations." As regards Slovakia, Jeszenszky said Budapest has committed itself to a Hungarian-Slovak compromise, although this is inconceivable without protection for Hungarians living in Slovakia. Jeszenszky noted with regret that his visit to Slovakia, which he hoped would clarify many hotly debated issues and which was planned for last autumn, did not come about. One of the issues which torpedoed the visit was Slovakia's binding of an earlier agreed-upon opening of new border stations to a deportation agreement that was unacceptable for Hungary. Hungary took a reserved position when Slovakia became a member of the Council of Europe, advancing its goodwill to Bratislava. However, events of the past months have not justified this advance confidence. According to the foreign minister, the greater part of Slovak society would prefer good relations with Hungary and is inclined to settle the minority situation. However, it is very difficult to represent sobriety against the nationalistic emotions whipped up in Slovakia. The Hungarian Government continues to be ready for compromises, and Budapest expects someone to grasp its extended hand. Hungary calls for both bilateral and multilateral minority protection agreements. The foreign minister also said the best solution would be for the legislatures of the countries concerned to themselves enact internal laws for the protection of minorities. Such legal measures could ensure bilingual education, and the use of the mother language in public administration. Jeszenszky voiced his regret over the fact that no such legal measures have been created in Slovakia, Romania, or Yugoslavia. He indicated that he is ready to hold talks about tasks related to minority protection legislation with the neighboring countries, and Hungary does not insist on the "principle of reciprocity."
