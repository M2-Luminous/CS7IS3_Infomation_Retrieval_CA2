Despite the obvious anger generated in China by Justice Minister Shiheto Nagano's remarks, analysts here said Beijing clearly wanted to avoid an emotive row with the government of Tsutomo Hata, who was only elected Japanese prime minister last month. "A cabinet member of the Japanese Government has openly distorted history and denied the facts to justify the (1937-45) war of aggression and we feel shock and indignation at that," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said. Nagano, who was appointed justice minister by Hata last week, said in an interview published Wednesday in a major Japanese daily, that the Nanjing Massacre was a "fabrication" and that it was "wrong to describe the war as a war of aggression." According to a Japanese source, the number two at the Japanese embassy here, Koichi Matsumoto, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry Thursday morning. "The representation made to Matsumoto was in line with the comments made by the ministry spokesman," the source said, adding that the Chinese side had asked the Japanese government to "deal seriously" with the matter. Japanese troops occupied the eastern city of Nanjing in 1937 and slaughtered citizens and prisoners of war. According to the Chinese authorities, some 300,000 people died in the massacre. Hata, currently on a European tour, publicly criticised Nagano's remarks on Wednesday, caling them "inappropriate." "My view on the past history is that our past actions, including aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many people," Hata said. Asked if Hata's remarks had sufficiently mollified the Chinese side, spokesman Wu said only: "We have taken note of Prime Minister Hata's attitude towards the history-distorting statement... and he also thinks it is inappropriate for the minister of justice to make such remarks."
