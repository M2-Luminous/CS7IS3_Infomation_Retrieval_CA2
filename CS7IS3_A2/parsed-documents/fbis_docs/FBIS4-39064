Voropayev video report; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program] [Text] Inhabitants of the southern Kuril Islands have sent telegrams to the Russian president, the Federal Assembly, and the oblast governor outlining their disastrous economic situation. A particularly tense situation has developed at the Yuzhno-Kurilsk fish processing combine -- Kunashir Island's basic enterprise. High prices and astronomic transport costs have made Kuril goods completely uncompetitive. The fish processing workers expressed a negative attitude towards the Federal Kuril Islands Development Program. The Yuzhno-Kurilsk fish processing combine strike committee, in signing the telegrams, warns that there is a developing opinion among the people driven to despair about the expediency of the Kurils' secession from Sakhalin Oblast. True, the strike committee did not elaborate further as to what the independent islands are going to do and whether this will help to improve the lives of the Kuril people. However, this is just another indication that neglect of the outlying regions' interests by the federal authorities could lead to an upset of stability in Russia's Far East. The meeting of the Russian Federation Government Commission for Operational Issues, on 25 May, noted the danger of the Maritime Kray's economic separation from Russia. This is further exacerbated by the critical social and economic processes in the Maritime Kray and the demographic pressures from neighboring China. As a countermeasure, it was proposed to form a commission to prepare proposals on the stabilization of the situation in the region and prospects for its development in the context of Russia's geopolitical interests in the Asia-Pacific region -- this is a quote. This is how they express alarm in Moscow over the fate of far eastern Russia -- mostly through lip service.
