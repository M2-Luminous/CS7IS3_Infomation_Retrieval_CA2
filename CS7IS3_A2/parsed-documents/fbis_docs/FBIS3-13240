Arriving, Darawshah said the delegation met Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, who stated that Syria wants a just and comprehensive peace in accordance with UN resolutions and that it is ready to apply the principle of "full peace in return for full withdrawal." Darawshah said al-Asad stressed that Syria wants to strengthen and unify Arab coordination to mark real achievements for the Arab parties. Al-Asad explained that Syria has a free Arab will and that no solution can be imposed on it through pressure or coercion. Darawshah said he also met Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', who stressed Syria's readiness to receive Israeli Arab delegations any time. Darawshah said the Syrian Government did not ask him to convey a specific message to the Israeli Government. But what he heard is considered a message of peace, which he will sincerely convey to the Israeli Knesset and Government. Concluding, Darawshah said: We trust the Syrian stance, which seeks to achieve peace. The ball is now in Israel's court. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin must frankly declare that he is ready for a full withdrawal. Darawshah said Syria is against settlement activity in the occupied territories and demands international protection for the Palestinians.
