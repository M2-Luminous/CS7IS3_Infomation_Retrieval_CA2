FR940406-2-00046 FR940406-2-00024 [Docket No. RM94&hyph;12&hyph;000] Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Gas Supply Realignment Costs; Public Conference March 30, 1994. Agency: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, DOE. ACTION: Notice of Public Conference. SUMMARY: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is issuing this notice to establish a date for a public conference to discuss the use of pricing differential mechanisms by interstate natural gas pipelines to recover gas supply realignment costs. DATES: The public conference will be held on May 26, 1994, in the Commission Meeting Room. Persons wishing to make a formal presentation to the Commission should submit a written request to the Secretary of the Commission no later than May 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary Hain, (202) 208&hyph;0996. Take notice that on May 26, 1994 at 10 a.m., the Commission will convene a public conference in the above captioned proceeding to examine the use of pricing differential mechanisms by interstate natural gas pipelines to recover gas supply realignment costs. In Order No. 636 1 the Commission established policies for the recovery of the costs incurred by pipelines in connection with the transition required by that restructuring rule. One category of costs recognized by the Commission were the costs the pipelines would incur to realign the gas supplies they had under contract with producers in order to make bundled sales. After unbundling, as required in the restructuring rule, the Commission expected that pipelines would have to reform their supply contracts to market levels or terminate the contracts altogether. In Order No. 636 the Commission adopted the policy that pipelines would be permitted full recovery of prudently incurred gas supply realignment costs. 2 1 Pipeline Service Obligations and Revisions to Regulations Governing Self-Implementing Transportation; and Regulation of Natural Gas Pipelines After Partial Wellhead Decontrol, 57 FR 13,267 (April 16, 1992), III FERC Stats. & Regs.

Subsequently, in cases concerning the implementation of the restructuring rule, the Commission decided that, in certain circumstances, it would permit a pipeline to recover the difference between the contract price and the market price as a gas supply realignment cost for a two-year period. 3 The premise underlying the Commission's decision was that allowing the recovery of pricing differentials for a two year period would be less costly than requiring the pipeline to hastily arrange to buy out of the contract. 3 See, e.g., Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., 62 FERC ¶ 61,015 (January 13, 1993); order on reh'g 63 FERC ¶ 61,100 (April 22, 1993); and Southern Natural Gas Co., 64 FERC ¶ 61,274 (September 3, 1993). The Commission's recent experience with pipeline filings to recover pricing differentials has raised questions about whether this method for recovering gas supply realignment costs is an effective way to minimize gas supply realignment costs_the Commission's original goal in approving the use of such mechanisms. If it is not an effective method for minimizing gas supply realignment costs, then the Commission requests proposals for alternatives that are consistent with the Commission's policy to permit pipelines the full recovery of their prudently incurred gas supply realignment costs. The purpose of the conference is limited to consideration of the pricing differential mechanism. The Commission does not intend to reexamine its other policies on the recovery of transition costs. The public conference convened by this notice will be held at 10 a.m. on May 26, 1994, in the Commission Meeting Room, 825 N. Capitol St., NE., Washington DC 20426. Any person who wishes to make a formal presentation to the Commission should submit a written request to the Secretary of the Commission no later than May 2, 1994. Every effort will be made to accommodate such requests. Members of the Commission intend to participate in this public conference and will reserve time for questions and answers. After the conference, participants and others may file written comments by June 24, 1994. By direction of the Commission: Commissioner Santa concurred with a separate statement attached. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. Santa, Commissioner, concurring: Issued March 30, 1994. With this notice of Public Conference, the Commission is initiating an inquiry into whether permitting the recovery of pricing differential costs (PDC) is an ``effective way to minimize gas supply realignment costs.'' The Notice includes the Commission's reassurance that, if PDC recovery is not an effective method for minimizing gas supply realignment (GSR) costs, we will limit ourselves to the consideration of ``alternatives that are consistent with the Commission's policy to permit pipelines full recovery of their prudently incurred gas supply realignment costs.'' Notwithstanding this reassurance, I am troubled by the prospect that the Commission would appear to be considering a mid-stream change in its mechanism for the recovery of Order No. 636 transition costs. In Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., 1 the Commission authorized PDC recovery for a period of two years. The Commission made clear that at the end of this period, the effectiveness of PDC recovery as a means to minimize transition costs would be subject to reexamination. In particular, the Commission has provided pipelines with warnings that: 1 62 FERC ¶ 61,015 at 61,125 (1993). (1) the burden is on the pipeline to support the continuation of PDC recovery beyond the initial period; 2 2 Id. (2) a pipeline cannot prudently delay realigning its problem contracts on the basis of the possibility of an extension; 3 and 3 Southern Natural Gas Co., 64 FERC ¶ 61,274 at 62,932 (1993). (3) after the two-year period, the Commission may revisit the issue of continuing the mechanism. 4 4 Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., 64 FERC ␣␣ ¶ 61,305 at 63,307 (1993). The Commission already has established a procedure for determining whether, ultimately, these costs will be recoverable. In addition to examining the eligibility and prudence of PDCs, if raised by parties to the proceedings, the Commission has stated that the burden will be on the pipeline to demonstrate that the PDC methodology will minimize GSR costs. 5 Further, the pipeline will have the burden of demonstrating that it made a bona fide effort to renegotiate the contracts underlying the PDCs it has filed to recover. 6 Filings to recover PDCs have been set for hearing, and the records developed in those proceedings will give the Commission a basis for determining whether the PDC recovery procedure in fact minimizes Order No. 636 transition costs. 5 Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., 62 FERC at 61,125. Also, to ensure cost minimization, the Commission required that Texas Eastern maintain a list of above-market contracts (List A) and a list of below-market contracts (List B) and credit net revenues from List B gas sales against the pricing differential from List A gas sales. 6 Id. Consequently, it is troubling that approximately nine months into the two-year period 7 the Commission is initiating a proceeding, docketed as a rulemaking, to consider whether the PDC recovery mechanism is ``an effective way to minimize gas supply realignment costs'' and to consider proposals for alternatives. I would hope that the end result of this proceeding is not a termination or modification of the PDC recovery mechanism effective prior to the end of the two-year period. Rather, I would hope that the record developed in this proceeding, together with the case-specific records developed in the section 4 GSR cost proceedings, will be used to inform the Commission's decision whether to terminate, modify, or continue the PDC recovery mechanism beyond two years. 7 Texas Eastern was the first pipeline to file to recover PDC costs, and approximately nine months of Texas Eastern's two-year period has elapsed. Absent compelling evidence that the PDC recovery mechanism is not minimizing GSR costs, I would be reluctant to modify the mechanism mid-stream. I believe that regulatory certainty is important, and that pipelines have relied on the two-year time horizon provided by the PDC recovery mechanism. Therefore, I would urge my colleagues to consider carefully the consequences of modifying this aspect of the Order No. 636 transition cost recovery procedure at this time. Donald F.
