I am happy to receive you, President Berisha said, and I follow the developments in your party with interest. Its recently acquired freedom to function, through the democratic mechanism of free vote in the last assembly and free elections in your party branches, enables party members to be engaged and contribute to the guaranteeing of Albanian human and national rights, as well as the development of democracy of Macedonia and its stability. An independent and stable Macedonia is in the interest not only of Albania, but also of all the peoples in the Balkans who are concerned about peace in the region. That is why we are determined to increase cooperation with Macedonia in the spirit of understanding. The Serb chauvinists and its ultranationalist allies desire the destabilization of Macedonia today. Your party must accomplish many tasks and should seriously work to implement them. The efforts of Albanians today should be concentrated in order to prevent conflict, develop and promote democracy, and establish local democratic institutions, i.e. found various democratic institutions. I want to tell you that the more evident the principles of democracy and the present European civilization are for the Albanians, the stronger they will be, and the more friends Albania and the Albanian nation in general will have. In all your efforts, you should assess what has been achieved through dialogue and democratic means and insist on the implementation of your rights and freedoms in conformity with the Helsinki Act and other international documents. For his part, in thanks for the reception, Arben Xhaferri, chairman of the Party for Democratic Prosperity of the Albanians in Macedonia, said that we support and will contribute to stability in Macedonia, but we are not relinquishing efforts to raise and strengthen our institutions as centers that generate values of patriotism and national rights. Thus can we create common valued of civilization with other nationals, which together connect us with Europe. I thank the Albanian Government for the support it has given and is giving to liberate and educate our students. Delegation member Mendu Thaci said that we hope, through hard work, to give our party its due role, so that the party is engaged inasmuch as possible in Macedonian political life. The assembly proceedings confirmed that this party enjoys the support of Albanians in Macedonia not only through the number of members, but also because of the assessment made by the Albanian intellectual world.
