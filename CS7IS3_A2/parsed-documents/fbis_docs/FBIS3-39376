He Will Be the Powder, We Will Be the Fuse"] [Text] Bormio -- This is how, with audacious metaphor, [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi, before sitting down at the table at a time when he usually goes to bed, put the problem to his grassroots supporters who are not exactly jubilant at his marriage of convenience with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi. "We will be the fuse and he will be the powder." Indeed, it is an unusual enough marriage: That is clear, since not all the grassroots League supporters gladly accept the embrace of the smooth TV mogul, nicknamed Cavaliere [the Cavalier], and his impeccable squires. The marriage was, however, the only way open and perhaps "the lesser of two evils" as Umberto Bossi, in his own version of realpolitik said in Bormio: It was the price that had to be paid to beat "the communists" and to leave the door to government ajar for the League, "slitting the Christian Democratic Party's [DC] throat from ear to ear." It was precisely to convince his party that Bossi spent a good half of his rally in the Alps on Saturday night [12 February] at Alberto da Giussano's party on skis, in front of 1,500 fans in jackets and apres-ski wear. The League secretary distanced himself slightly from events. From the stage, he retold the story of these last few months: the lost battle of the municipal elections, the arrest of Patelli, caught by "a bomb planted two years ago," the preconference meeting at Assago and the unfolding of a strategy largely based on [League lower house floor leader] Maroni's raids. Maroni had been sent out to negotiate with [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli's group just to reveal its inalienable social democratic nature. In Bormio, Umberto Bossi placed [Judge] Di Pietro among the "villains" since he helped support the anti-League maneuvering "of the large Italian families" in the Patelli case. Now, finally it is the "year of the samurai," the year when accounts will be settled for transformations like those of [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto and Martinazzoli, for whose "plastic surgery we would need 17 surgeons working together, and maybe even that would not be not enough." Yes, this electoral campaign that started with Berlusconi entering the race and the arrest of Paolo Berlusconi at almost the same time "will spare nobody: They will use every means, nobody will be spared, I repeat nobody" Bossi predicted. His speech conjured up the image of a whole blaze of "missile attacks"; fireworks, while "the problem is to truly change" the country. Bossi reasoned that to prevent being isolated the League needed a shore "against the pole of statism and centralism," Christian Democrats, the left, and [National Alliance leader] Fini -- "the fascist Fini" -- it needed a prop to even out the road to federalism in both the north and the south. He said: "We reckoned on it and we saw in the local elections that they can defeat us in the north because it is not easy for us to unite the people: We do not have TV access and we do not yet have the newspapers." Then his big idea begins to take shape: "We must invent a party that is no longer statist, no longer centralist, and that perhaps is not yet federalist like the League, a party that bridges the gap between the old and the new," good enough to present to the south. In short, a kind of party omnibus, perhaps a little amphibian, too. Bossi finally met with Berlusconi and the TV cameras at Arcore. Bossi also commented that it is necessary to "create the reins to somehow put the League in the hands of this superintelligent and irresistible Cavaliere" to win people over, even south of the Po Valley. Thus, when, on the road to Brianza, Berlusconi stepped forward "it went so well we did not even go to see the troops." Silvio Berlusconi himself, who "before, went with the old regime, like all entrepreneurs," is now ready. "When we saw him I said: `This is the container in which we will bear the ruins of the DC.'" Berlusconi has now been transformed into a wide net. This then "is the reason for the agreement, while the League, my friends, is going straight ahead with no turning back." This holds true even if, in the south, "Berlusca" is with Fini, who wants to land in Milan but must be careful "because we will never give you the north, dear Fini." Now, the League is ready to govern to "lead the way for change." The applause begins but is a little muted. The realpolitik is fine, but, for these League diehards the rose-colored Berlusconi still looks like an alien come down from a sky that does not resemble theirs.
