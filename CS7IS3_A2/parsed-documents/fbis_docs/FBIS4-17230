An open exchange of opinions on a wide range of problems of mutual interest took place. During the conversation Nazarbayev said that the Republic ascribes major importance to the activity of the CSCE and is ready for all-around cooperation with such a prestigious international forum, first of all in the humanitarian sphere. Nazarbayev positively assessed the growing attention of the heads of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in europe to the region of Central Asia. In his opinion, a CSCE seminar in Almaty very convincingly testifies to this fact. The seminar will undoubtedly become one more step on the way to developing a constructive dialogue between the countries of the vast European region with regard to all problems of security and cooperation. As far as demographic changes are concerned, said the president, they have occured in Kazakhstan during the years of Soviet power as a consequence of forced collectivization, industrialization, and development of virgin and fallow lands. From the former USSR's European region only, over 2 million people have moved here to Kazakhstan. But nobody in our country divides people into our own and strangers. Every Kazakhstani has equal rights and opportunities and can be sure of his tomorrow. Van der Stoel, in his turn, highly assessed the policy pursued by Kazakhstan with regard to interethnic relations and voiced his support for the president's stance with regard to legal status of his citizens. At the same time the high commissioner expressed his wish to familiarize himself in full detail with the experience accumulated in the Republic as far as creation of the interethnic accord and stability atmosphere is concerned. First of all, Max van der Stoel was interested in the outcome of the election and correction of the violations noted by the CSCE observers during the election. Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed his known stance on the matter. He said legal assessment to all deviations from the law will be given by the court. The court namely is working on it. In particular, with regard to cases noted in three constituencies, the court is examining the matter now. Vice President Yerik Asanbayev, Deputy Prime Minister Tolegen Zhukeyev, and Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev also participated in the meeting.
