The child is deemed to have applied and been found eligible for Medicaid on the date of birth and remains eligible as categorically needy for one year so long as the woman remains eligible or (with respect to infants born on or after January 1, 1991) would have remained eligible if still pregnant and the child is a member of the woman's household.

After the infant's release from the hospital, or in situations not involving hospitalization, States must apply the AFDC rules to determine if an infant (who is not an SSI beneficiary) is a member of his or her mother's household. 6.
