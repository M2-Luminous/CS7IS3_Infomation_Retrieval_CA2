With this special effect the multi-emitter resonant-tunneling hot electron transistor (ME-RHET) will help reduce the number of components of computer chips to about one-ninth, Fujitsu officials said. For example, a pilot type of this transistor coupled with a resistor can perform on par with a circuit of 18 ordinary transistors and resistors, they said. The new transistor is one of the major fruits of a project supervised by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. In line with the project aim of developing ultra-small, quantum- effect device fabrication technology in the near future, Fujitsu released the first version of the transistor in 1985, the officials said.
