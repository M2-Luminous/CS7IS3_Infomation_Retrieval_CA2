The report, produced for BNFL last year but kept secret, shows that in some years the people of Cumbria have unknowingly had more than 200 times the quantity of cancer-causing plutonium vented into the atmosphere around them than previously acknowledged. Scientific knowledge about the reasons children contract leukaemia is still uncertain, but the only known cause is plutonium, which when ingested, even in tiny quantities, is attracted to bone and attacks the bone marrow. The report detailing the excessive discharges is revealed today in a Granada Television drama documentary Fighting For Gemma, the story of Gemma D'Arcy who died just before her seventh birthday of chronic myeloid leukaemia. The programme traces her story and the so far unsuccessful fight by the small team of solicitors who took on the state-owned company to gain compensation. The plutonium has been discharged routinely through a large number of stacks on the Sellafield site while the company reprocesses spent fuel to extract the metal for nuclear weapons production and for future use as reactor fuel. Calculations made for the company by scientists, using soil samples from Cumbria and BNFL's own data from chimney filters, show that in the 1950s and early 1960s more than 200 times the previously revealed level of plutonium was routinely put into the atmosphere. Until now the amount of plutonium in mud samples and in dust in Cumbria has been attributed to the half ton or so of the metal which the company discharged into the sea over the same period. It now appears that some of it at least has been fall-out from the plant's chimneys. The programme will embarrass the company and the Government at a time when the decision on whether to go ahead with the new Thorp re-processing plant at Sellafield is still awaited.
