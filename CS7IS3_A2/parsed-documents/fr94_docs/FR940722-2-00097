FR940722-2-00097 FR940722-2-00062 [Docket No. 50&hyph;366] Georgia Power Co., et al.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPR&hyph;5, issued to the Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia (the licensee), for operation of the Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Plant, Unit 2, located in Appling County, Georgia. The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.6.6 for Hatch Unit 2 to permit the traversing incore probe (TIP) system to be considered operable with less than four operable TIP machines. The TIP system is used to periodically determine the power distribution in the core, for the calibration of the local power range monitor (LPRM) detectors, and for monitoring core thermal limits: the average planar linear heat generation rate (APLHGR), the linear heat generation rate (LHGR), and the minimum critical power ratio (MCPR). The proposed amendment will also allow the utilization of substitute TIP data for the inaccessible locations from either symmetric TIP locations or from normalized TIP data as calculated by the online core monitoring system. In the July 19, 1994, submittal, the licensee stated that, on July 11, 1994, with Hatch Unit 2 operating at 100% rated thermal power, Plant Hatch shift personnel were performing the procedure for the TIP normalization required to be performed every 31 effective full power days. Nearing completion of the procedure, personnel were unable to place the ``D'' TIP into channel 9. It had apparently stuck in channel 8, indicating a problem with the indexing mechanism. The indexing mechanism is located inside the primary containment (drywell), access to which is not possible at the present power level. Based on the last successfully performed LPRM calibration, the next one is to be completed no later than August 9, 1994. If the surveillance is not performed by that time, it will be necessary to declare the APRMs inoperable and, thus, enter an immediate reactor shutdown in accordance with TS 3.3.1.b, Action 3. The problem with the ``D'' TIP could not have been foreseen, although Plant Hatch has had problems with the indexing mechanism in the past. However, each problem is unique and has a different root cause. Subsequent to the discovery of the problem, efforts to return the ``D'' TIP to operable status were initiated. These efforts were led by the licensee's engineering staff with vendor representatives on-site as well. The licensee has performed several tests which included verification of proper voltage to the indexer motor, verification of proper motor winding resistance as well as over-voltage tests on the indexing mechanism, and also conducted a reverse motor test in an attempt to free the indexer; however, this attempt was unsuccessful. All the licensee's efforts to repair the TIP, without drywell access, were exhausted on Friday, July 15, 1994. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: The change does not involve a significant hazards consideration for the following reasons: (1) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The TIP system is not used to prevent, or mitigate the consequences of, any previously analyzed accident or transient, nor are any assumptions made in any accident analysis relative to the operation of the TIP system. No other safety related system is affected by this change. The use of substitute values from symmetric TIP locations or from calculations performed by the on-line computer core monitoring system does not affect the consequences of plant transients previously evaluated in the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report], because the total core TIP reading (nodal power) uncertainty is less than 8.7%. Thus, the MCPR safety limit is not affected. (2) The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not involve the installation of any new equipment, or the modification of any equipment designed to prevent or mitigate the consequences of accidents or transients. Therefore, the change has no effect on any accident initiator, and no new or different type of accidents are postulated to occur. (3) The proposed amendment does not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
