Among other things, he said that the government has many times been called a dilettante, mainly by the left wing, and at other times it was accused of lack of expertise, but the facts prove otherwise. Parliament has functioned undisturbed in the past four years and it created more than 400 laws. The MDF and its partners were able to ensure the country's security and stability and, owing to the population's wisdom, calmness and discipline were preserved. It is not by chance that, at the end of the four-year governmental cycle, the MDF is thanking the Hungarian people for calm and cooperation. Lajos Fur spoke about establishing the conditions for economic boom, settling the ownership relations in agriculture, and finally he said that a healthy national self-esteem is needed and, being aware of this, people will decide in favor of continuing on the current road. Lajos Fur gave an interview to our correspondent after the campaign meeting. [Papp] To what extent does the result of the nomination of candidates that ended on 8 April justify the former statements according to which the Polish syndrome, where parties belonging to the fragmented center and the right wing excluded themselves from the possibility of governing, may be repeated in Hungary? [Fur] The Hungarian political forces are not as fragmented as they were in Poland. Several outcomes are still possible here. The contest will be decided between the left wing and the center or center-right forces. I can still see a great chance that the some 40 percent of the electors who still have not decided whether to vote at all will, in the remaining three to four weeks, decide to support the center and right-wing forces, rather than the left wing. [Papp] During their discussions with the current socialist leaders of the former communist countries, the left-wing politicians spend much time talking about the issue of the interest representation of Hungarians living beyond the border. What are your views on this? [Fur] I could put it this way: Recently, everyone seems to have become a very true Hungarian. People who previously spoke about Christian regime, preached or screeched about the yokels' style of showing one's being a true Hungarian, have now suddenly realized that they support the Christian churches, and they foster the cause of Hungarians beyond the border; many such campaign measures have been included in the propaganda of certain parties recently. I hope that the public will remember what the same people said about the church, Christianity, and the Hungarians a few months ago. They will also hopefully remember how our critics voted in Parliament on these issues. [Papp] The Socialists have not named their prime ministerial candidate and Prime Minister Peter Boross objected to this a few days ago. [Fuir] Yes, there is some mysticism in this issue. The former communists and post-communists always adhered to the practice that they did not inform anyone about their decision, they thought they would make their decisions internally and then let the public know later. I am afraid that this is again a case of the old reflexes.
