How about aftereffects of the postponement? [Hata] Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura held two posts as chairman of Sakigake [Harbinger Party] and government spokesman. He agonized at the time. However, Mr. Takemura will leave someone with the work of running his party to some extent and perform his duty as spokesman. [Hanaoka] It has been said now that political reform, an agent holding the ruling coalition parties together, has been settled, the Hosokawa's Cabinet cohesiveness will be inevitably weakened. What do you think? [Hata] It has been weakened. However, the coalition partners have taken a new look at their positions. Chairmen of the ruling coalition parties held a meeting on the evening of 2 March when Prime Minister Hosokawa announced his decision to put off a cabinet reshuffle. The mood at the meeting abruptly turned gloomy when the prime minister expressed his intention to give up the planned reshuffle. The meeting was filled with the mood for working together when I said, "Let us return to the starting point and restart." [Hanaoka] Do you think the ruling coalition parties will consolidate their bipolarization? [Hata] I do not think so. The ruling coalition parties still have differing intentions. They should not cling to their names. [Hanaoka] It has been reported that the ruling coalition parties differ from each other on national ideology and political tactics. [Hata] The difference is not a ditch that they cannot cross. While Mr. Takemura is advocating the need to build Japan into a "small nation," Mr. Ozawa is speaking of the need to build Japan into an "ordinary nation." There is little difference in their views. They agree on the point that Japan should be built into a nation that has a great ideology to create a real peace for the world within the framework of the Constitution and has senior citizens live free of concern at home. If Japan were built into a small nation, however, it could not enjoy its present-day prosperity. [Hanaoka] I believe that the plan for the national welfare tax was a correct direction, but it was pointed out that the way Mr. Ozawa handled the new tax system was high-handed. [Hata] In the past seven months, the new multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round) was concluded, the Political Reform Law was enacted, and Japan decided to partially open its rice market. They are changes that can occur once in 10 years. Five ruling coalition parties shored up the coalition government when it dealt with those changes. The coalition government had a time limit for deciding on each of the changes. It was inevitable for Mr. Ozawa to deal with the new tax in a high-handed way. The high- handed way was a transitional way. If a new major political party is formed, such a high-handed way would disappear. [Hanaoka] How will the ruling coalition parties coordinate their choices of candidates for the next elections? [Hata] The ruling coalition parties must discuss how their candidates should be divided into single-seat constituencies and the proportional representation system. If any party fields no candidate, it would suffer a decrease in the number of votes obtained in the proportional representational system. If the ruling coalition parties are merged into a single party, this would resolve the issue of fielding unified candidates in the next elections. [Hanaoka] Mr. Hata, do you mean that the ruling coalition parties should be aimed to dissolve themselves to form a new party? [Hata] Now that the combination system of the single-seat constituency and the proportional representation system has been adopted, a realignment of political parties will take place. The best option for the ruling coalition parties is to merge themselves into a single party. A new party should be created. [Hanaoka] How are the ruling coalition parties going to deal with leftists in the Social Democratic Party of Japan? [Hata] There is an ideological problem with them. They should decide what to do in the future. [Hanaoka] Is there a possibility that more Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] members will desert? [Hata] It depends on whether the liberal democrats have the courage to purge themselves of their past and how they view politics in a new age. [Hanaoka] What is the cause of a new party? [Hata] It is to rally a powerful political force capable of countering the LDP. We will have to promote economic reform, administrative reform, and decentralization. From a broad-ranging point of view, we intend to develop a new tax system which will balance assets, consumption, and income in the long-term. [Hanaoka] Will Mr. Hosokawa head the new political party? [Hata] Yes, he will. [Hanaoka] Japan-U.S. relations are in serious shape. Would you comment on it? [Hata] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks did not break off, but ended with no agreements reached. The Hosokawa Cabinet intends to make a sweeping relaxation of regulations. For the United States, Japan is the second largest importer next to Canada. Both Japan and the United States are in a mature relationship of mutual dependence. If the two countries stop taking face-saving actions, their relations will certainly improve. [Hanaoka] Mr. Ozawa appears to be planning to visit the United States. [Hata] A decision has already been made about his visit to Washington. He will travel to the United States to give a lecture at the request of an American press club. Mr. Ozawa has not been seen in public for health reasons. When I told him, "If you continue to stay away from the public, it would immediately become a newsworthy story," Mr. Ozawa said, "I am really in poor health." [Hanaoka] No prospects are seen for deliberation of a budget bill for fiscal 1994 in the House of Representatives Budget Committee. [Hata] The Budget Committee should deliberate, among other things, the budget bill to recover Japan's economy. There are no clear reasons for delaying its deliberation. It is said that the Budget Committee will begin deliberating the bill when Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi returns to Japan after attending the job summit. I think it is good if a debate focuses on labor problems during the committee's general interpellation session.
