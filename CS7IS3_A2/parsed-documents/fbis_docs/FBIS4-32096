The company will take over the state's shares in Cenzin, Ciech, and Baltona. The ownership transformations minister, who comes from the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], thinks it is a scandal and amounts to using loopholes in the legal system. The holding company in question is the state-owned Agency for Economic Development [Agencja Rozwoju Gospodarczego], which was set up by Minister Leslaw Podkanski on 2 February 1994. Over the next few years, the agency is to assume control over several dozen State Treasury partnerships that deal primarily with foreign trade and that are currently supervised by the foreign economic cooperation minister. From Cenzin to Baltona The assets of these partnerships are evaluated at over 50 trillion zlotys [Z], which would make the agency the largest capital/financial holding company in Poland. Currently, its share capital is Z4.570 trillion and includes state-owned shares in three companies registered on the Warsaw Stock Exchange: 270,000 shares of the Bank Rozwoju Eksportu [BRE], 1.080 million shares of Electrim, and 2.628 million shares of Universal. Over the few next years, the agency is to take over the state's shares in such big companies as Cenzin (62.7 percent), Ciech (51 percent), Baltona (51 percent), Animex (34 percent), Budimex (53 percent), Polimex Cekop (51 percent), Paged (30 percent), Pol-Mot (24 percent), and Metronex, Poznan International Fairs (60 percent). So the agency will hold significant influence over the composition of the companies' governing boards. NIK's Control According to Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek, the establishment of the agency is a scandal: "Such institutions must be based on the legal system rather than taking advantage of loopholes in it," Kaczmarek told ZYCIE WARSZAWY. "As far as I know, the Supreme Chamber of Control [NIK] is examining the issue," he added. "NIK has been examining the agency since May, within a program of controlling foreign trade centers," confirmed NIK Press Spokesman Wojciech Daniel. "Results will not be published until mid-July at the earliest." Ambitious Plans According to the agency's statute, its goal, among others, is to provide financing for investment projects (construction of highways, border crossings, or inland waterways), promoting Polish exports, and providing guarantees or financial reinsurance for large economic ventures. "Company `X' wants to bid on a modernization project for Beirut airport, which is estimated to cost $300 million. But first it has to put up collateral worth one-sixth of the contract. Our financial potential makes it possible for us to help the company in a such a situation," explains Wieslaw Kuc, chief of the agency and a former member of the BRE governing board. What will happen if the agency finds itself in a situation of having to pay in place of a dishonest contractor? Shares and participation in State Treasury partnerships are one of the agency's assets. The agency does not want to sell them off, but it does not rule out doing that in case it gets into trouble by, for instance, having to repay a large credit that it had guaranteed earlier. Still, Chairman Kuc sounds confident that there will be no slipups because, in granting guarantees, he will be using the same kinds of procedures as those applied by banks.
