Meeting former U.S. President George Bush on a visit here, Kim said the U.N. Security Council has to act if transparency is not guaranteed on North Korea's nuclear program, spokesman Chu Ton-Sik said. Bush came to Seoul to attend the 43rd annual conference of the Pacific-Asia Travel Association (PATA). Bush agreed that the two countries must maintain firm alliance in dealing with the North Korean situation. He warned they should not be fooled by North Korea's attempt to break the two countries apart during North Korea-U.S. dialogue, Chu said. Bush commented that he saw the tension on the Korean peninsula was not as tense as he had thought when he was in the United States. Kim accused "irresponsible" people of exaggerating the situation, Chu said.
