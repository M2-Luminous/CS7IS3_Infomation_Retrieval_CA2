Oliviu Gherman, chairman of PDSR, reiterated in that context the program-like principles (observance of the Constitution, of the republic as form of government, and of the non-enforcement of the restitutio in integrum principle,) which the PDSR means to be truthful to. The role of the recent meetings at Cotroceni, Ioan Solcanu stressed, is to gather a picture of the political, economic, and social situation as seen by the other parliamentary parties. PDSR, Solcanu added, will not give up the portfolios of defense and national security, foreign affairs, and the interior if a mixed government is formed. Ion Solcanu admitted that the people's living standard declined over this year of PDSR rule, which was the reason of erosion of the government's popularity and credibility. At the same time, he said that although the government took a string of unpopular measures, engaged by the previous governments and imposed "by the seriousness with which it approached the continuation of the process of reform, it however neglected its own public image." He considered it necessary that the government should be given between 30 and 60 minutes a week on the air with the national television, in order to be able to correctly inform the population.
