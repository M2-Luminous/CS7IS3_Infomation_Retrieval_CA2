FR941020-1-00044 FR941020-1-00013 We believe that the requirement that ITOs must contract, or receive a grant, for child welfare services under Pub. L. 93&hyph;638 in order to be eligible for direct funding under title IV&hyph;B is no longer necessary. In recent years, Federal social service funding under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) has increased significantly. In fiscal year 1994, 530 tribes are expected to receive $22,905,000 under ICWA. We are aware that there are ITOs which do not receive Indian Self-Determination Act funding although they are operating child welfare services programs utilizing ICWA funding, and others which could choose to begin to provide child welfare services. III. Discussion of Proposed Amendment to 45 CFR 1357.40 The Department is proposing to revise paragraph (a) to eliminate the Indian Self-Determination Act eligibility requirement. Paragraph (a), as revised, states that ``any ITO that meets the definitions in section 428(c) of the Act, or any consortium or other group of eligible tribal organizations authorized by the membership of the tribes to act for them is eligible to apply for direct funding if the Indian tribe, consortium or group has a plan for child welfare services provided by the ITO that is jointly developed by the ITO and the Department''. In determining the amount of direct funding available to an ITO eligible under the existing regulation, the Secretary currently applies a formula similar to the one used to calculate the title IV&hyph;B allotments of the territories. This formula takes into consideration the Indian tribe's resident population under 21 and its per capita income. The current formula for calculating an ITO's allotment results in an amount which bears the same ratio to the total State's title IV&hyph;B allotment as the product of 1.4 times the proportion of the Indian tribe's resident population under age 21 to the State's total population under age 21. The 1.4 multiplication factor has not resulted in grant amounts large enough to make it worthwhile for many tribes to apply for title IV&hyph;B. By June 1993, only 24 tribes were receiving direct title IV&hyph;B grants totaling $549,340. The average grant available to specified ITOs was $22,889, and grants ranged from a high of $166,468 to a low of $648. The Department plans to change the multiplication factor to 3.0 for fiscal year 1995 in order to improve the quality of Indian child welfare nationally. For comparison purposes, using the fiscal year 1993 figures given above, this would have raised the average amount available to the specified ITO's to $45,778, and grants would have ranged from a high of $332,936 to a low of $1,296. Paragraph (g)(6) contains the Department's formula for the calculation of ITO allotments. The multiplication factor will be adjusted in future years based on the Department's experience, if necessary, in order to achieve the purposes of the Act. Any decision to change the multiplication factor will be promulgated through the issuance of an Information Memorandum under the ACYF policy issuance system.
