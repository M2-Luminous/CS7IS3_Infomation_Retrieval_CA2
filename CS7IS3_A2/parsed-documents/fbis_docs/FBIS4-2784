Designed by architects from Qinghua University, the town is expected to occupy 150 hectares with a building area of 2.6 million square meters. The town will include six main buildings and two sections: buildings for offices and conferences, trade, services, telecommunications and financial business as well as cultural, scientific and technological, and recreational facilities; and a residential section with gardens and a modern villa division. With a total investment of 10 billion yuan, the project is expected to be completed in eight or ten years. In the town, there is plenty of room for parking, and every household will have a parking space for cars. The state farm sector in Hainan Province has more than 100 medium-sized enterprises with more than one million people. In the past few years, the sector has made great contributions to the opening up of Hainan Island. Experts said the construction of the town is aimed at promoting the secondary and tertiary industries and will provide an opportunity for the sector to remold its development pattern.
