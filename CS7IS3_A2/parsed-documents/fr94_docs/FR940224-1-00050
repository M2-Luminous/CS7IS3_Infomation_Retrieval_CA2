In §663.23 paragraph (b)(4) is added to read as follows: §663.23 Catch restrictions. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (4) Pacific Whiting_Allocation. The following provisions apply from 1994 through 1996_ (i) The Shoreside Reserve. When 60 percent of the annual harvest guideline for Pacific whiting has been or is projected to be taken, further at-sea processing of Pacific whiting will be prohibited pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section. The remaining 40 percent of the harvest guideline is reserved for harvest by vessels delivering to shoreside processors. (ii) Release of the Reserve. That portion of the annual harvest guideline that the Regional Director determines will not be used by shoreside processors by the end of that fishing year shall be made available for harvest by all fishing vessels, regardless of where they deliver, on August 15 or as soon as practicable thereafter. (iii) Estimates. Estimates of the amount of Pacific whiting harvested will be based on actual amounts harvested, projections of amounts that will be harvested, or a combination of the two. Estimates of the amount of Pacific whiting that will be used by shoreside processors by the end of the fishing year will be based on the best information available to the Regional Director from state catch and landings data, the survey of domestic processing capacity and intent, testimony received at Council meetings, and/or other relevant information. (iv) Announcements. The Assistant Administrator will announce in the Federal Register when 60 percent of the whiting harvest guideline has been, or is about to be, harvested, specifying a time after which further at-sea processing of Pacific whiting in the fishery management area is prohibited. The Assistant Administrator will announce in the Federal Register any release of the reserve on August 15 or as soon as practicable thereafter. In order to prevent exceeding the limits or underutilizing the resource, adjustments may be made effective immediately by actual notice to fishermen and processors, by phone, fax, Northwest Region computerized bulletin board (contact 206&hyph;526&hyph;6128), letter, press release, and/or U.S. Coast Guard Notice to Mariners (monitor channel 16 VHF), followed by publication in the Federal Register , in which instance public comment will be sought for a reasonable period of time thereafter. If insufficient time exists to consult with the Council, the Regional Director will inform the Council in writing of actions taken. * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4108 Filed 2&hyph;18&hyph;94; 12:14 pm] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
