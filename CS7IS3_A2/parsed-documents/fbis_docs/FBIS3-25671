Allow a fractious province (kwaZulu/Natal) to exercise more power than other provinces might wish to. Second: abolish the override. The battle about where central power can override a province is not worth the trouble. If the elected government of a province fails to meet basic norms, leave the judgment to its voters. Considerable efforts have been made to satisfy the FA. History says: keep trying." BUSINESS DAY `Little Chance' of Election Postponement -- "Political opposition to the election is bound to be fanatical and violent, even if there is unexpected progress in the last-minute efforts to achieve an inclusive settlement," points out a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 24 February. "But if the pro-election campaigns can capture the public imagination, there must be a good chance that the spoilers will be overwhelmed by the numbers of those who want to choose South Africa's first representative government." The Business Election Fund was launched this week, as well as the publicity campaign explaining the role of the Independent Electoral Commission, setting the country "firmly on course for the historic poll in April. There now seems little chance that it will be postponed, whatever the threats of disruption." SOWETAN Homeland Amendment 'Vague and Impractical' -- "With the inclusion of a `self-determination' clause in the amended interim constitution, South Africa is sailing into dangerous waters," warns a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 24 February. "The problem is the ANC [African National Congress] and the AVF [Afrikaner National Front] cannot exactly spell out what they mean by self-determination. The Right wildly lay claim to the OFS [Orange Free State], Transvaal and Northern Natal as sovereign volkstaats [homelands] while some negotiations vaguely speak about Afrikaner cantons. The ANC gives the impression it is an issue it hopes will fizzle out after the election. The criticism levelled by the PAC's [Pan-Africanist Congress] Barney Desai at the World Trade Centre this week is valid: The volkstaat amendment is a vague and impractical promise unlikely to be fulfilled. It also leaves the door ajar for other groups to make similar claims to self- determination and territory and the Balkanisation of South Africa." CAPE TIMES Keys's Growing Economic Optimism -- Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 21 February in a page-4 editorial says Finance Minister Derek Keys's "growing optimism about the economy" is encouraging news for the labor and business community, and it "might be unduly cynical to suggest that such pronouncements should be regarded in an election context." Only "two days ago" economists expected the economy to grow by about 2-2.5 percent. Now Keys thinks the 1994 growth figure will be 3-4 percent. "It would be easy to dismiss such a shift as short term expediency by a politician with creative accounting abilities, but with Mr Keys this is unlikely. For starters, it is quite possible that he will still be presiding over the economy during the reign of the government of national unity. Far from enhancing his reputation and that of the National Party, Mr Keys stands every chance of becoming a scapegoat if buoyant growth fails to materialise." BEELD Standerton Community Provokes Black Majority -- A page-8 editorial in Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 18 February argues: "The blame for the events at Standerton in which 30 people were injured must first and foremost be placed on the shoulders of the right wing which decided unilaterally that the town must be incorporated into the so-called homeland. The ANC supporters who wanted to deliver a memorandum to the town hall in protest against such plans were fully entitled to express their dissatisfaction, provided that it was done in an orderly manner. It is a pity that blacks in the town were forbidden from doing so by the local magistrate declaring their march unlawful. A small portion of the community cannot provoke the overwhelming majority in this way and then expect no one to protest." "What happened at Standerton must serve as a warning to those who believe they can simply force unworkable plans on others." BEELD ANC Nurtures Communist Links -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 21 February says in a page-6 editorial: "In his first speech after his release, Mr. Nelson Mandela made a gesture towards his communist allies from the past. One had expected it. The `liberation front' had to pay its dues to countries and leaders who had themselves not set an example for freedom. However, one would not expect the ANC to still nurture these ties a few years down the line. The whole world has changed since then, with communism having collapsed, and with it the tyrannical authoritarianism which formed such a large part of the 20th century. But the ANC remains in alliance with the South African Communist Party," says BEELD, and "further evidence of how it holds alive the past are its ties with Cuba and Libya, countries which the United States views as terrorist states. In a draft document, the ANC's department of international affairs again stands up for Cuba, asking that the new government establish ties with Cuba and that the United States lift its economic sanctions against Cuba." "With such an approach the ANC will not attract international assistance to South Africa to create prosperity. At some time or another the ANC will have to choose between its friends and the interests of the people of South Africa." Violence Must be Stopped -- A second editorial on page-6 of BEELD says: "In South Africa there is the reality are politicial leaders who at gatherings plead the cause of tolerance and free political participation. There is, however, a second reality of intimidation and violence on the ground which is raging on unhindered and claiming more and more victims. Only last week the ANC complained that the death of a Nelspruit National Party organizer should be investigated in the ANC. At Creighton in Natal 15 ANC supporters died in a bloodbath. Civilized behavior has clearly become the first victim of the relentless power struggle being waged in the country. Political parties must know, though, that what is being sown by their followers today will be reaped by all in the months and years ahead."
