Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Ambassador to Seoul James Laney met in the morning soon after President Kim Yong-sam chaired a national security session. Han briefed Laney on what was discussed at the meeting and called for even closer cooperation in dealing with the latest crisis stemming from Pyongyang's nuclear program, especially as President Kim leaves for Russia Wednesday. "The two countries shared the view that the North Korean nuclear problem is entering its most serious stage and that the present situation is extremely worrisome," Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said. "They reconfirmed the principle that in order for dialogue to continue, North Korea must keep alive the basis for such dialogue -- that is, the opportunity to sample, secure and measure the fuel rods from the North Korean nuclear reactor must not be damaged," he said. The U.N. Security Council convenes Tuesday to address Pyongyang's latest refusal to keep this opportunity alive. The council is expected to adopt a presidential statement or even a resolution pressing North Korea to reach agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on guaranteeing the sampling and measurement of the rods.
