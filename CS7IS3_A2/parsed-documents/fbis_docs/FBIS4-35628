The Yemeni war has now entered its second month. Do you still believe it is a state of rebellion and civilian-military disobedience? [Basindwah] Yes, what is happening in Yemen is no more than a state of rebellion and disobedience. And even though the battle has continued for longer than expected, the reason is because we did not know that the group of apostasy and secession had all the weapons we have just discovered. We did not know that it had important strategic bases, which has caused the fighting to continue for longer than expected. All this prompts us now to say that the group of rebellion had made preparations, not for the sake of threatening its opponents in Yemen, but maybe for the sake of imposing its hegemony over the region as a whole. [Abu-Husayn] What do you mean by that accusation? [Basindwah] The Socialist Party, which is led by al-Bid, espoused the popular fronts for the liberation of Gulf states, as it used to say. It used to consider their system of government as reactionary and linked to Western imperialism, so it should be reexamined. The important thing is that, despite all this military preparedness by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the legitimate leadership in Yemen has managed to take control of three very large governorates -- namely Abyan, Lahij, and Shabwah -- from three directions. And Aden is now -- to a large extent -- besieged from several directions, especially the al-'Anad base, which is actually the third military base in the world in terms of the position and preparations inside it. [passage omitted] [Abu-Husayn] If the infighting in Yemen is merely an internal rebellion, why did the Security Council discuss it? [Basindwah] Some people say that what is happening in Yemen affects the region's security and safety, and we stress that we welcome any endeavors as long as they take account of Yemen's unity and constitutional legitimacy and refer to the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen. This is in addition to the return of the forces belonging to the group of apostasy, secession, and rebellion to their natural position as an integral part of legitimacy under President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. [Abu-Husayn] Is the Security Council abiding by the Yemeni demands you have listed? [Basindwah] We are opposed to the Security Council's discussing what is happening in Yemen, because what is happening in our country is an internal affair. However, we cannot prevent the Security Council [from intervening] by virtue of the new world situation. [Abu-Husayn] What if the Security Council adopts a resolution on a cease-fire only, without prior conditions? [Basindwah] No, no. If that happens, the Security Council must stress respect for Yemen's unity and compliance with legitimacy. [passage omitted] [Abu-Husayn] When will a cease-fire be announced? [Basindwah] We will respond to a cease-fire the moment the secession decision has been revoked and once unionist elements in the Socialist party leadership have announced their compliance with constitutional legitimacy. [Abu-Husayn] And what if the southern leadership refuses to revoke the decision to announce the new [Democratic] Republic of Yemen? [Basindwah] The fighting will continue. I would like to point out here that we do not want to impose unity by force, because the unity was established before the war, that is four years ago. It was achieved voluntarily, and a people's referendum on it and on the Constitution was held. So it is the south which is seeking to impose secession by force. We are defending the homeland's unity against this armed rebellion. [passage omitted] [Abu-Husayn] [Question not given] [Basindwah] A federation or a confederation might suit states whose peoples are divided among themselves ideologically, religiously, and linguistically. But in Yemen, we are one Muslim people. There are no religious minorities or sects. Yemen has been one country throughout history. For example, what happened between Egypt and Syria in 1958 does not apply to our case in Yemen. [passage omitted] [Abu-Husayn] If 'Ali Salim al-Bid -- and this is an assumption -- announces a decision to revoke the republic decision, would you hold a dialogue with him? [Basindwah] No, no, no. We would deal with the elements not implicated in the secessionist scheme. There are many people on whom we are pinning great hopes. [Abu-Husayn] Like whom? [Basindwah] I do not want to specify names so that the Socialist Party will not suspect anything. [Abu-Husayn] Is that a maneuver on the northern leadership's part to split the Socialist Party, as al-Bid and al-'Attas say? [Basindwah] The Socialist Party has split within itself more than once in the past, and we were not responsible for that. [passage omitted] [Abu-Husayn] Was the discovery of oil a direct cause of the separation, as is being said? [Basindwah] Maybe that is the thinking of al-Bid and al-'Attas, the group of rebellion seeking to monopolize the Hadhramaut area to establish a state for them in it. But the inhabitants of the area will not allow them to do that. [passage omitted]
