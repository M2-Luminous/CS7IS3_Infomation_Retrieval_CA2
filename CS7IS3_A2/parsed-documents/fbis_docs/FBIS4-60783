He dwelt on the changes and addenda to certain legislative acts in connection with the signing of the monetary merger agreement with Russia. In particular, he said: [Begin Hryb recording] In accordance with the agreement in the area of tariff regulations on external economic activities, both sides should introduce identical customs tariffs, taxes, and duties with regard to imports and exports. Under these conditions, customs duties in mutual trade are canceled as of 1 May. The Russian side also commits itself to fully abolish customs duties on supplies of energy resources and raw materials to Belarus. Under this commitment, imports from Russia will be much cheaper. The decrease in prices for energy resources and raw materials in connection with the abolishment of customs duties will allow us to decrease the production cost of Belarusian goods, as well as [word indistinct] production and trade in our Republic. [end recording] Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb then introduced members of the Constitutional Court to journalists. These judges were elected by Supreme Soviet deputies at yesterday's extraordinary session. Mechyslaw Hryb described how deputies were nominated for this high post. [Begin Hryb recording] Candidates for this high post were put forward with the participation of people's deputies, permanent commissions -- especially the Commission for Legislation and the Commission for Statehood Building, and the Supreme Soviet Presidium. Proposals were also made by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Belarus, the Prosecutor's General Office, the KGB, the Interior Ministry, and the Justice Ministry. This work was being carried out openly, with the broad discussion of candidacies in Supreme Soviet commissions and at the Presidium sessions. As you can see, there were many candidates proposed for the Constitutional Court. At Presidium sessions, we considered several dozen candidates. At the Supreme Soviet session, we considered 16 people, after listing them on a secret ballot. There were 10 candidates introduced on the secret ballot due to the fact that the Constitutional Court should comprise 11 judges: nine members, one deputy chairman, and one chairman. All this was agreed upon. Nine judges of the Constitutional Court were elected by secret ballot. One candidate did not go through on the ballot. Thus, according to the law on the Constitutional Court, this judicial body, with regard to the number of judges, is legitimate and can begin work today. According to our laws, the Constitutional Court is legitimate if the body has at least seven members. So, it is legitimate. The Constitutional Court chairman will be elected by the Supreme Soviet at the recommendation of the future president. As has become known, at their session yesterday, members of the Constitutional Court elected Professor Valeryy Tsikhinya, doctor of juridical sciences, deputy chairman of the Constitutional Court.
