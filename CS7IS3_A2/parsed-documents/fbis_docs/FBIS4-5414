The coalition will continue talks on the matter at the level of secretaries general, they said. Representatives of the coalition partners, who met for 40 minutes Monday morning, also agreed to convene a meeting of party leaders "as the need arises," the officials said. The accord represented a last-minute compromise to avert a decisive split of the eight-month-old, seven-party alliance. SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of Japan] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, the head of the coalition's largest party, Sunday proposed holding a meeting of the heads of all the coalition parties at noon Monday to discuss who should succeed Hosokawa as prime minister. Murayama's proposal aims at raising the level for discussing the succession to the premiership to that of the top leaders of the coalition parties from the present level of secretaries general. DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi and Sakigake [Harbinger] leader Masayoshi Takemura supported the idea but Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito rejected the proposal. Hosokawa, the JNP head, also responded coolly to Murayama's proposal. He told reporters that he will not attend the leaders' meeting. Komeito Chairman Koshiro Ishida told reporters Monday that a meeting of party heads should be convened at the final stage. Meantime, the heads of the SDPJ, DSP, Sakigake and the Democratic Reform Party had talks at noon Monday and agreed to propose a meeting of leaders of all the coalition parties at 10 A.M. Tuesday, well-placed sources said.
