[Peres] We will see what issues are finalized by this afternoon. There are still several issues that must be dealt with. [Einstein] Do you believe you will be able to reach understandings during your visit to Cairo today? [Peres] This is our intention, but it is impossible to know what the other side's position will be: What they will emphasize and what they will insist on. This is a negotiations process, and in every such process we can know at most only 50 percent -- namely, our own positions. [Einstein] What will we insist on? [Peres] We will insist on what we have insisted on throughout the process -- namely, the security issues. We will not make any compromises on anything relating to human life. I want to add here, however, something that everybody understands: It is impossible to eradicate violence by force alone. Like elsewhere in the world, we need a carrot in addition to the stick. In order to wipe out the raging terrorism in Israel, we must use both the carrot and the stick. [passage omitted] [Einstein] It is generally assessed that the agreement will be signed next week. Do you share this assessment? [Peres] Unfortunately I cannot predict the date. I can tell you with conviction, however, that we will do our utmost to navigate the ship safely to shore -- namely, to finalize the negotiations. If it takes one more week, that will be good; if an additional week will be necessary, however, so be it. Sometimes there is a trade-off [last word in English] between the time element and the contents. There is no doubt, however, that the issue has matured, and I believe we should sign the agreement. When I spoke about the carrot, I was not referring to mere tactics. I believe that only a new reality can change the old reality -- that is, when the Palestinians finally have a territorial address and possess various powers. The Palestinians will have a piece of reality in their possession. Without this, I fear that the overcrowded conditions, the overpopulation, and mounting hate will feed the growing violence and terrorism. [Einstein] Mr. Peres, do you believe that an agreement with the Palestinians will facilitate the talks with Syria? [Peres] We have never made the two issues conditional on each other. The truth is, however, that if we finalize the agreement with the Palestinians, we will be freer to deal with the Syrian issue, although we have never put this issue off. Incidentally, wrapping things up with the Palestinians will be no excuse for making uncalled for concessions on the Syrian track. We want to attain a comprehensive agreement, and this must clearly include Syria as well. We regard our future with Syria not in terms of warfare but in terms of peace and understanding in all spheres. [Einstein] Does Christopher's visit mean a possible breakthrough with Syria? [Peres] The United States is constantly trying to lower the expectations. It is right in doing so, because it, too, does not know exactly what to expect from Damascus. I have no doubts that Warren Christopher will exert supreme efforts to pave the way for the negotiations. So far, however, Damascus is behaving stubbornly. It appears to have a strategy of peace, but the winds of peace are still not blowing from that direction.
