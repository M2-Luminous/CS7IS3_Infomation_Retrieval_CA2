Narasimha Rao, has said that India attached top priority to improving its relations with Pakistan and denied that New Delhi was trying to play the role of a policeman in the region, PTI reports. However, Pakistan's support, encouragement and abetment of terrorism directed against India "is a matter of deep concern... We find this support totally unacceptable and believe that it is the basic cause of bilateral tensions and regional disquiet," he said in an interview with Saudi Arabia's leading Arabic daily, OKAZ. "India attaches high priority in its foreign policy to improving relations with the neighbours, including Pakistan," Mr Rao said. The Prime Minister said India was keen to resolve all differences with Pakistan peacefully through bilateral negotiations, in accordance with the Shimla agreement. As a result, Mr Rao said, the foreign secretaries of the two countries met in Islamabad in the beginning of the year. Referring to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr Rao said: "The assistance to terrorism by Pakistan is at the heart of the problem." He denied that the security forces in Kashmir were using excessive force and said: "We have gone to great lengths to ensure that our security forces use the minimum possible force against cilivians." Side by side, Mr Rao said, attempts were on to revive the political process in the state. "This process is understandably slow, because of the intimidatory tactics of the militants," he added. In reply to a question, the Prime Minister denied that India ever "sought to play the role of a policeman in the region." On India's growing ties with Israel, Mr Rao said it had no strategic or security dimension. "There is no question of its being directed against any third country," he added. Referring to the demolition of Babri Masjid he said he was aware of the reverberations abroad on the incident and mentioned his government's prompt action in dismissing the state government responsible for it. He said while the government was prosecuting those involved in the demolition, it had referred the matter to the supreme court and would abide by its decision.
