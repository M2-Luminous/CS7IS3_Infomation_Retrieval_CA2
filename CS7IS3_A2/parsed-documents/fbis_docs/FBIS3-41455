We all recall the Chernobyl tragedy and other similar accidents. Now a new concept has been submitted to the European Organization for Nuclear Research -- generation of electricity at a nuclear power station linked with a particle accelerator. The new reactor will be operating in a subcritical mode which rules out the occurrence of a chain reaction. The electricity will be supplied from particle accelerators. According to experts the new power generation technique will be competitive since it does not require new technological development while at the same time providing an ecologically relatively clean, inexhaustible, and reliable source of energy.
