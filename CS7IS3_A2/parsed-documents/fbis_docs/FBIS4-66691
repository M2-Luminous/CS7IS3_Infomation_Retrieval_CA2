[Ancer] What is your analysis of the current political situation? [Benhamouda] To make an analysis, there must be a political situation--with at least some data--to analyze. I think that we are going through a bad spell, so we can only speak of an observation. It may be objective or subjective. But there is a reality. For my part, I am one of those very numerous Algerians who defend the state. It is the state which, by being strong, takes charge of defending the country and protecting the citizens and their property. But what we are seeing is the total absence of the state. We also see that the people who used to talk about democracy, dialogue, "rahma" [compassion], tolerance, and human rights are the ones now defending criminals, terrorists, killers, and assassins. We see total silence on the part of the public authorities, the so-called political class, and the human rights associations while hundreds of Algerians have been murdered just during this month of Ramadan. Even more serious, we see, as though by coincidence, that in a sector of the press known to be the tool of the terrorists and the former FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], the roles have been reversed: the real victims are presented as terrorists, while the real terrorists become the victims. There is something worse than that. Newspapers that are supposed to defend the republic and democracy have recently been turned into tools of the former FIS. We have the impression, and it is also a profound feeling, that the only one concerned by this struggle is the citizen: the unarmed civilian. I often hear it said: "Where is civil society? We have no people, no citizens." But I ask two questions. The first is addressed to the public authorities. Why is the state, which disarmed the citizens, now asking them to stand up to unscrupulous criminals? Doesn't the state exist to ensure their safety? Unless it is incapable of doing so! We draw the following conclusions from such a situation: people are telling themselves that if the state cannot live up to its obligations, then the citizens are entitled to defend themselves by their own means. For six years, the political class has been abusing and terrorizing the people. Now, despite that, even the parties that protect or justify terrorism, thus ensuring it of political cover, are being threatened because of contradictory interests. The political class, whether in power or--in quotes--the "opposition," is asking where civil society is. Judging from the case of Ait Ahmed, civil society does not even have the right to defend itself. Unless it is supposed to wait for "Mehdi al-Montazer" [Hidden Iman] to come from Lausanne and defend it. The problem at present is that the overwhelming majority of Algerians are threatened, not just the members of the security services or the people expressing political stands. The terrorists are now murdering women, little girls, old men and women, workers, teachers, peasants, the unemployed, and so on. They are burning down schools, food units, industrial complexes, and so on. In short, they are destroying the entire country. Where is the concern on the part of the so-called opposition parties over such a situation? Where is action by the state in the face of such monstrous crimes? It should be pointed out in this connection that it is not the state that is hunting down terrorists. It is the latter who are, for example, assaulting a Gendarmerie station and organizing attacks in various places. But if they do not do anything, they are not disturbed. It is for all those reasons that the public is looking for the best way to protect itself on its own. Mass action must achieve two objectives: it must not be co-opted for the benefit of the mafia still existing within the apparatuses, and at the same time, it must strengthen the state's action. This is important because if we step outside the framework of the state, we become outlaws, and then no one will be governing anyone. We hope that those limits will not be exceeded, especially now that dialogue is being resumed. [Ancer] What exactly is your opinion of the results of that dialogue? [Benhamouda] In my opinion, it is more a matter of concessions. For example, every time there are clemency measures, the response by the terrorists is hundreds of Algerians being executed. The last time it happened--when leaders of the former FIS were released--the terrorists carried out the spectacular operation at Tazoult Prison. Judging from the information available so far, it seems unlikely that only two guards were in on it. [Ancer] Does this mean you are thinking of high-level accomplices? [Benhamouda] Yes! You will notice that no one has accepted responsibility, just as no one has resigned to at least keep up appearances. The political situation constitutes a whole. It is not limited to the management of security or to dialogue, which we do not believe in, at least not in the way that it is being conducted. There is not even any communication. Take the example of the negotiations with the IMF. All anybody knows is that individuals are in Washington. But we know nothing about what they are doing. Public opinion is not being informed. There is not even a communique, despite the fact that the country's future is bound up with the results of those negotiations. [Ancer] What do you think of dialogue "with none excluded" as reaffirmed this Friday by Liamine Zeroual? [Benhamouda] It is a problem. For myself, I understand it this way: there are people who feel responsible for the blood that is flowing because it is not compulsory to blame the one causing it--the one doing the killing. Responsibility is placed on the politician who pushed the terrorist groups to kill. Let us accept that no one is to be excluded. Thousands of Algerians have been victims of the terrorists. They have ties with hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of relatives and friends who are demanding justice. So there is a blood problem to be solved. We can talk about dialogue "with none excluded," but only after resolving the matter of the blood that has been shed, and every terrorist must pay. If that portion of the public that still believes in the state and in legality does not obtain justice, it will rebel. It seems to me that the people who think it is possible to have dialogue without excluding anyone in order to solve the problems of terrorism and security do not live in Algeria or in Algerian society. So they are greatly mistaken. It seems to me that there is a lot of manipulation going on, and what is more serious, we resent the fact that they are trying to present us with a fait accompli. Whichever group is acting in that manner is moving in the wrong direction. [Ancer] It is the women who are reacting now to the disturbing situation in the country. How can one explain what could be called hesitation on the part of the UGTA at such a serious moment? [Benhamouda] It is not a matter of hesitation, and we have our positions. It must not be forgotten that our organization has suffered many attacks aimed at destabilizing and destroying it on the grounds that the central union and Benhamouda in particular are engaging in politics and ignoring union activity. That is certainly false. There is no hesitation. We are observing the course of events. [Ancer] We asked that question because at several important moments in the life of our country, especially when the CNSA [National Committee for the Safeguard of Algeria] was being established and when preparations were being made for the march on 22 March 1993, the UGTA played a leading role. And now Algeria is experiencing a very dangerous situation. [Benhamouda] The UGTA has stepped back and is observing. So far no one has made a move. No one has lifted a finger or denounced or condemned anything. There are no longer even any notices of condolences in the newspapers. That just shows how far cowardice has gone. Some political parties do not express those condolences even to the families of their own murdered members. Let us talk about 22 March, when millions of people took to the streets in response to the call from the UGTA and other associations. They did not do so to make social demands despite the very difficult living conditions of the workers and other groups. They were all chanting slogans about halting terrorism and halting the assassination of Algeria. They were all demanding a state of law, a republic with its values, freedom, pluralism, democracy, and so on. For my part, I do not know exactly who heads the FFS [Socialist Forces Front], and it does not concern me. But in any case I do not understand why somebody named Khellil, speaking from the rostrum at a general meeting by his party, is targeting me in particular. Those who target the UGTA say that we are in the pay of the government. They have accused us of being responsible for halting the election process, the action that caused Chadli's downfall. Some people make a living from lies. If we supported Chadli's government, how did it happen that we played a part in bringing it down? On the question of dialogue, the UGTA took clear positions, regardless of whether it was talking to the HCE [Higher State Council] or the commission, even to the point of saying that all the window dressing had to be removed. Because if the window dressing is not removed, people will not be able to see who is pulling the strings behind the scenes. We wanted to know where the real power was. That is the UGTA which, speaking through its secretary general, denounces the government, the symbols of corruption, and the mafia. So where is the hesitation? The UGTA does not want political power, too. The workers are suffering, but despite that their first concern is the fate of Algeria. It is not our problems but the defense of the country that is taking center stage. We could have adopted a negative attitude, considering the seriousness of the problems in the world of labor. We might have been tempted to struggle for power so that even if we were unable to take it, we could still break the country and make everyone equal in misery. But no, our concern has always been to help make the state of law a reality. There are certain things that I am not going to talk about because I do not want to demoralize people. Let us talk instead about the state. In the government departments and state enterprises, people are going back to the beard and "kamis" [shirt]. They stop work and go off supposedly to say their prayers. In some mosques--I am not talking about the interior of the country but about Algiers--virulent speeches with invectives and insults are reappearing. This is true even on television, where the sermons have been just as virulent as those by the terrorists during this Ramadan. Despite all that, no one has eyes and ears for anything except the UGTA. [Ancer] The negative view is actually not the only one. People look to the central union because it remains the only organization with nationwide influence. [Benhamouda] I was getting to that. Although from the organizational standpoint, everything is relative. That being said, our concern is to make people appear as they really are. Now that we have had the communique from the president, we will see how the political parties react. As far as we are concerned, we have done all we could. But there is manipulation. [Ancer] Are you afraid of attempts at co-optation, as happened following the marches in March 1993? [Benhamouda] There is always manipulation. That is why it is absolutely necessary to establish a genuine and permanent popular movement. In the second place, there are a lot of volunteers. If the state wants that to be legal, let it hand out weapons. Otherwise people will get them some other way. Any popular political movement that matters must be able to protect itself. If the state takes charge of the security problem, people will organize peacefully. If the state does not accept its responsibilities, the law of the strongest will prevail /tag aala men tag/. [preceding words published in Arabic] [Ancer] But in that case there would be civil war--it would mean something terrible happening to the country! [Benhamouda] We do not want it. We do not want it. That is why I say over and over that only the state has the right to use force. I have always said that. But if the state does not use its strength to defend the citizens, who is going to do so--who is going to defend the innocent? We have not reached any decision. We are in the process of getting together as union leaders to consider how to go about it. Because after all, if you are going to die, you should certainly take your enemy with you. We need to keep in mind the kinds of atrocities they are committing. The terrorists went to the home of a gendarme, and when they could not find him, they killed his wife and sister-in-law. They kill women and a 14-year-old girl. They kill people in front of innocent children. How long are we going to put up with that? If we get to that point, there will no longer be political parties or personalities. It will be every man for himself. We cannot just stand around with our arms crossed. Who are we waiting for? Who? The tragedy of this country is that one person uses history and another uses religion to say: "I am a party." Then a third person comes along with neither troops nor trumpet and speaks in the name of the Algerian people on who knows what authority to exclude civil society at a time when intellectuals are living in hiding in their own country. So the state must accept its responsibilities in order to avoid civil war. There must not be a return to the practices of the HCE, in which there is dialogue with parties that justify terrorism by insulting everyone. We have already wasted a year and a half for nothing. We have already paid. And if we have to pay even more, will we not be tempted to burn the country down? People have suffered too much. Some, like Guendouzi, have died with their wages suspended. It is possible to play with everything except people's lives. The right to life is sacred. Concerning the women who have decided to rally in front of the ONDH [National Human Rights Organization], they could just as well have done so in front of the office of the president or some other important institution. In my opinion, they chose the ONDH because human rights associations exist to defend terrorists, murderers, and criminals. I do not recall any communique from an association calling for the enforcement of court decisions. But that is a right. The same is true of health at a time when hundreds of threatened physicians have fled the country, but we have not heard anything from the human rights associations on that subject. In my opinion, that is the symbolism of the women's choice. They are defending the right to life in order to arouse people's consciences. If there is no response, it will mean that there is no more conscience.
