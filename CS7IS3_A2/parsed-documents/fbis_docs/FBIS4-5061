Hosokawa, writing in the editorial page of the newspaper USA TODAY, said the fresh market-opening measures unveiled by Japan last week were one result of his reform efforts, and he urged Americans to take advantage of new business opportunities in Japan. "I hope that foreign firms will, with enthusiasm, take advantage of the opportunities provided by the measures, thereby leading to an increase in imports to Japan from the United States and elsewhere," Hosokawa said. A Japanese Embassy spokesman said Hosokawa contributed the article in response to a request from the newspaper to present the Japanese case on growing trade disputes between the two countries. The Japanese premier, who was swept to office last August as a champion of change, began his article by promising the American public that he is determined to press on with political and economic reforms in Japan. "Economic reform is particularly important in order to pull Japan out of the current recession and once again make it a powerful engine for the world economy," Hosokawa said. Hosokawa gave an outline of the market-opening measures his government adopted last Tuesday, arguing that tapping the Japanese market would help create jobs in the U.S. He said, "Japan is America's largest export market after Canada, and Japanese investment is greatly contributing to the creation of American jobs and to the enhancement of production in the U.S. industry."
