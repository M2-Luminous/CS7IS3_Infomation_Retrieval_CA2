Speaking at Larnaca Airport on his arrival, Clark avoided announcing the Turkish stance on the 21 March document on ways of implementing the confidence-building measures. Replying to a series of questions from CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] on the issue, Clark said that he did not expect Turkish authorities to explain their recent statements that they perhaps intended for someone else. He said he had the opportunity to deal with some wrong impressions that exist in Turkey, one of which is that there are two documents. There are not two documents but one and we will discuss ways to implement it. Clark also noted that the decision to accept or reject [the document] should be made by the two communities based on actual events. He also said that he will not present a new set of proposals. Asked about the purpose of his meeting tomorrow with President Glavkos Kliridhis, who has accepted the document, Clark answered that he will discuss ways of implementing the set of proposals that Kliridhis and Denktas have accepted in principle. Furthermore, Clark said that he would be surprised if a new extension is given for an answer from the Turkish side.
