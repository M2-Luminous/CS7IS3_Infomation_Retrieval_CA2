How the North Atlantic Alliance Is Transforming Itself"] [Text] He is married with three sons. He likes reading, singing, and drawing. He goes skating and yachting. A brief sketch of the private life of...no, not of a flourishing representative of the bohemian way of life, nor of a rich heir. We are talking about NATO's number three -- General John Waters, deputy supreme commander in chief of NATO Joint Armed Forces in Europe. My meeting with him took place at the M.V. Frunze Military Academy. Gen. Waters had come to Moscow to lecture on the transformation of NATO, the change in the strategic concept of the North Atlantic alliance, and its future role. A new page in NATO's history was opened in November 1991. The heads of state and government of the NATO member countries issued the Declaration on Peace and Cooperation. What did this mean? Nothing less than the end of the "cold war." However, Gen. Waters believes that when the threat of a major war disappeared, petty conflicts being to flare up more frequently, mainly over ethnic disagreements. How are they to be averted, and how is regional peace and stability to be consolidated? These are the questions facing NATO leaders today. It was to resolve these issues that the "Partnership for Peace" initiative was born. Gen. Waters said that he is not a politician but a soldier, and, for him, this initiative means only one thing -- the capacity to act jointly to consolidate peace in regions of confrontation. Armed forces may be required in these conditions, but their direct employment depends on the circumstances arising on the ground. In the main, servicemen will fulfill other functions in conflict regions: protecting people from starvation, providing them with humanitarian and medical aid, and rescuing people during natural disasters. As a whole the North Atlantic alliance's strategic concept is defined by a broader approach to security, an approach based on dialogue, cooperation, and maintaining the capacity for collective defense. This concept also envisages substantial changes in NATO's Joint Armed Forces. The goal has changed, and the means of achieving it are also changing. THe new structure of the armed forces, whose formation will be completed in 1995, assigns the major role to multinational formations. They will be provided to support UN or CSCE peacekeeping missions. The reconstruction of the NATO Armed Forces entails their reduction by 25 percent by 1997. The main reduction will be in the ground forces. In NATO's central region the reduction will be 45 percent. True, at the same time the number of reserve units will be somewhat increased. So, what will the North Atlantic alliance become now, an alliance which in the old Soviet history was never called anything but aggressive and hawkish? However substantive the changes in the NATO Armed Forces, it is clear that these forces will still be sufficiently powerful, and the hawk's claws and beak have by no means been blunted. The most obvious illustration of this is the former Yugoslavia and the current crisis in Bosnia. Gen. Waters was asked how the decision on air strikes against the Serbs was arrived at. He explained at length the so-called two-shoulder method, which boils down to the adoption of first and foremost a political decision at the highest international level on the basis of specific proposals from the military leadership on the ground. With evident relief the general acknowledged that this decision is now the property of history. He gave due credit to the Russian peacekeeping battalion, which managed to complete its march to Sarajevo in difficult conditions. The combat training of Russian soldiers is of a high standard, the general remarked.
