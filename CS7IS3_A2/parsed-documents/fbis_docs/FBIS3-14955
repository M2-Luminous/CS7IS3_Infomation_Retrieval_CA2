For some people this seemed to be a departure from the reforms policy, for others there seemed to be nothing new in the message, and still others said there were more statements than proposals in it. I, having an insider's knowledge of everything and following the president's thoughts step by step, can see that the report proved to be difficult for the president and I would say that he came out with it too late -- he should have made it two years ago. Without boasting and claiming more for myself than I should, I can say that I said similar things at Russian Government and Presidium sessions in February-March 1992. I said then: There are two ways of converting to a market economy. One way is to open the sluice gates, but we have to determine how much we can open them. Here, having worked out a program of structural restructuring for industry and created a modern doctrine for the Russian Armed Forces, leaving part of the military-industrial complex's plants under this doctrine and the international arms market -- let us say about 40 percent, with 60 percent undergoing conversion, an effective tax policy program would have to underpin all that which would stimulate the productive forces' development. This is what "opening the sluice gates" meant. Then there is the second model -- you blow up the dam, that is there is a chaotic transition to market economics. You blow up the dam, pressure is released, and absolutely everything is washed away -- be it useful or not, then you sort everything out. At that time I warned that if we started down the second path -- and we did actually start down the second path and blew the dam -- we would just the same be forced to follow the first model after a couple of years, but by that time we will be swallowing or being swallowed up by the mire we have gotten into. In principle this is what has happened. But Gaydar is not guilty of this. Gaydar was in general in agreement with this level of regulation back then, but he lacked a team. Those people who criticize Gaydar today -- Shokhin and others -- are culpable precisely because they did not manage to carry out the modeling while they occupied key posts. Several models should have been demonstrated, then we should have forecast where we would be, and only then should we have acted. But everything happened as God had ordained it. The president was to bring into the government more people from the provinces...but he gave in to pressure from Shokhin's team -- they said that they would not accept anybody into the government, their team, then this government in general began to represent a sect. This factional policy gradually led to what we have today. I fear very much that the president's speech will serve as a kind of sign that we should reject the reforms and go into reverse. This is no longer possible as going into reverse is suicide for Russia, a path back to where we have come from. I do not call this system totalitarian or anything else. It was simply a system where the flywheel of the cost-led economy turned with terrible force, sucking all the strength out of people and using up all natural resources and so on. But it is our misfortune that this flywheel continues to turn today. People work but they are told: We will not pay your wages. But his cannot happen! It might end in an outburst. Therefore, the government has today been forced to turn on the printing presses, turn on the currency-issuing mechanism, and put out the flames. But, by switching on the currency-issuing mechanism, the government, the Central Bank, and our authorities in general are beginning to provoke hyperinflation. As the saying goes, go left and you'll lose your horse; go right and you'll lose your life. The government is in this most difficult of positions today. I consider that we have no alternative route today. In order to survive, we will certainly have to jettison our gold and diamond reserves, and we will possibly have to sell several sources of major concessions to save the country from the threat of impending disaster. The most important thing -- which I also mentioned two years ago -- is that we should devolve some functions of the federal authorities to the regional level. We should not give them political power but economic power, power of management. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the the apparatus in Moscow by a factor of 25-30 and send it there. Then the regions will save Russia for us, I assure you. [Poltoranin ends] Specific Steps Awaited Viktor Stepanov, Federation Council deputy and chairman of the Republic of Karelia Supreme Soviet: In his speech the president only set out the points in his message to the Federal Assembly. Even a cursory analysis of the message's 100-page text shows that the proposals in this document with regard, among other things, to problems of the economic reform, strengthening federalism, and the development of the market go much further here than in the form they were presented in the Kremlin. The president called on society for reconciliation and accord in 1994; however, without the economy becoming revived, that is revived and not stabilized, inasmuch as protectionism is required at the level of surgical intervention, Russia's economy cannot be saved. If there are still discount-credit rates of more than 200 percent from the Central Bank, if the attitude toward rural areas is still so irresponsible -- after all the peasants have not yet been paid the astronomical debt of 3 trillion due them -- it will hardly be possible to talk of reviving the economy. Frankly, I expected more precise and specific targets for the government with regard to the economy's revival in the president's speech. In particular, there should, in my opinion, have been a statement about the undesirability of changing prices for energy sources this year, because our producers -- whatever form of ownership they enjoy -- will not manage to get used to the new prices. The president went on to emphasize in his message that the tax burden is fairly large and that it is necessary to change taxation policy. But again, logic would dictate that specific steps should be initiated by the president himself; after all, as recently as 22 December he signed an edict which actually proposes raising taxes for producers -- whatever form of ownership they enjoy -- and simply makes them bankrupt. In the context of enterprises becoming bankrupt, and thousands of workers simply beginning to live by begging, it will, perhaps, be very difficult to talk of national accord.
