ARENA, with a conservative ideology, continues to drop little by little from the 51.22 percent it initially had when 50.31 percent of the votes were counted and as the vote tally continues. The Salvadoran electoral law stipulates a runoff election must be held between the two leading candidates if none of the seven candidates who participated in the elections obtain more than 50 percent of the votes. Former San Salvador Mayor Armando Calderon Sol, 45, expected to win the first round while his main opponent, leftist coalition candidate Ruben Zamora, will regroup for the runoff election and try to win it with the support of other opposition groups. Zamora, a combative 52-year-old politician who has lived in exile, has 27.85 percent of the votes in the presidential elections, and it is likely his vote percentage will also drop. His closest rival, Christian Democrat Fidel Chavez Mena, has 13.98 percent; and votes for the candidates of four minority parties totals less than nine percent. There was 46.9 percent abstentionism and this figure is considered high given the expectations raised by the first elections to be held in El Salvador following the 1992 Peace Accords. The leftist coalition attributed the low voter turnout to critical mistakes in the voter registration list, which prevented thousands of citizens from exercising their right to vote. Specifically speaking, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, FMLN, a former guerrilla organization that disarmed and became a political party a year ago, blamed ARENA for the irregularities and accused it of fraud. Referring to the elections for Legislative Assembly deputies and municipal officials, the percentages are similarly distributed to the presidential election votes, with an overwhelming advantage for ARENA. In the deputy elections, the Conservative Party obtained 45.35 percent; the left, 31.15 percent; and the Christian Democracy, 14.51 percent; while municipal power is distributed in this manner: 44.65 percent for the conservatives; 26.61 percent for the coalition; and 17.39 for the third group. These results do not offer ARENA much of a difference compared with the previous presidential elections held in 1989, in which Alfredo Cristiani -- who will relinquish the presidency on 1 June -- won the post in the first round with 53.8 percent of the votes. Calderon Sol avoided claiming a victory in his first statements after the official tally began, waiting until the results are confirmed, but he criticized the Zamora's predictions concerning the certainty of a second round of elections. "It is clear the people still prefer us," Calderon Sol said and then he thanked the Cristiani Government, also of ARENA, for its successful administration of the country. Sunday's elections, watched by a contingent of 3,000 UN and foreign government and organizations observers, were the first electoral test for the FMLN, which obtained better results than those predicted by polls. Calderon Sol advocated a program that continued Cristiani's liberal economic experience, while the FMLN and the two social democratic parties that support Zamora want to implement a much more social policy, aimed at solving the people's critical needs. Aside from the criticism about irregularities voiced by the left, the tranquillity which prevailed in Sunday's elections was praised by most of the political groups and the UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal). Onusal issued a communique highlighting the absence of critical incidents and the peace and freedom with which 2.5 million Salvadorans summoned to the elections cast their ballots.
