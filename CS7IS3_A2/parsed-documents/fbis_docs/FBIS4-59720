FBIS4-59720 "drnes095_o_94002" FBIS-NES-94-095 Daily Report 13 May 1994 SYRIA U.S. Stance `Encouraging'; Pressure on Israel Urged U.S. Stance `Encouraging'; Pressure on Israel Urged PM1305132694 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 13 May 94 p 5 PM1305132694 London AL-HAYAH Arabic BFN [Unattributed report: "Damascus Welcomes Washington Pledge To Achieve Progress in Negotiations This Year"] [Excerpts] Damascus, AL-HAYAH -- Syrian sources said yesterday that the U.S. Administration's announcement of its commitment to achieve "major progress" in the peace process this year "is encouraging and positive, and we hope it will find its way to real implementation." However, they pointed out that progress depends on "pressures which Washington should put on Tel Aviv to comply with the full withdrawal from the Golan." On U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the region in a few days, the sources said that it is designed to convey ideas between Tel Aviv and Damascus. The Yitzhaq Rabin government had "requested some time to consider the Syrian ideas." They added that "while Syria makes it a condition that Israeli forces withdraw from all the Golan before any discussion of peace or security, Israel gives priority to security and peace, saying that the withdrawal can take place later and in stages, with a view to testing Syria's good intentions." [passage omitted] Syrian Foreign Ministry sources have told AL-HAYAH that pro-Israeli parties in the U.S. Administration are working to halt the development of bilateral relations between Damascus and Washington, and to keep Syria's name on the U.S. lists concerning "drugs, terrorism, and human rights." The sources told AL-HAYAH that these decisions conflict with previous U.S. positions, as the drugs list was issued days after a meeting between Minister Faruq al-Shar' and Robert Pelletreau, assistant U.S. secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs, during which they discussed this question in detail. The sources said that Pelletreau pledged to Syrian officials "to remove Syria's name from the list. But the reality was different -- which astonished Syrian officials." A Syrian official has reiterated Damascus' demand that Israel withdraw from all the Golan Heights it has been occupying since the 1967 war as a condition for achieving any progress in the peace negotiations. He said: "Israel must announce its willingness to withdraw completely from the Golan and to dismantle the settlements before there can be any discussion of peace and security. Israel must understand this well." He added: "No one can force Syria to take any position that conflicts with its principles and aims. Syria wants an honorable peace that guarantees security for all states in the region."
