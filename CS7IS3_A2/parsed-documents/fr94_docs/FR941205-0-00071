FR941205-0-00071 FR941205-0-00021 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 70 [AD&hyph;FRL&hyph;5116&hyph;6] Clean Air Act Final Disapproval of Operating Permits Program; Commonwealth of Virginia AGENCY: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final disapproval. SUMMARY: EPA is taking final action to disapprove the Clean Air Act operating permits program under title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 submitted to EPA by the Commonwealth of Virginia. The reasons for this disapproval action were fully described in EPA's notice of proposed disapproval (see the June 17, 1994 Federal Register ) and can be summarized as follows: (1) Virginia's program submittal does not contain the necessary legal authority to allow persons who have participated in the permit program's public comment process to obtain review of the final permit decision in State court; (2) the program does not contain the necessary legal authority to prevent the default issuance of permits; (3) the submitted regulations expired on June 28, 1994 and cannot be applied or enforced after that date; (4) the regulatory portion of the program submittal does not include the proper universe of sources required to be subject to a State operating permits program; and (5) the program does not ensure that permits contain all applicable Clean Air Act requirements and does not correctly delineate permit provisions enforceable only by the Commonwealth. DATES: This action will become effective on January 4, 1995. ADDRESSES: A copy of Virginia's submittal and other supporting information relevant to this action, including all public comment letters, are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following location: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, Air, Radiation & Toxics Division, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. David J. Campbell, Air and Radiation Programs Branch (3AT10), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107, Telephone: 215 597&hyph;9781. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Title V of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (sections 501&hyph;507 of the Clean Air Act (``CAA'')) and implementing regulations at 40 CFR part 70 (see 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992)) require that States develop and submit operating permits programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve or disapprove each program within one (1) year after receiving the submittal. EPA's program review occurs pursuant to section 502 of the CAA and the part 70 regulations, which together outline the criteria for approval or disapproval. If EPA has not approved a program by November 15, 1995 for a State, it must establish and implement a Federal program in that State. On June 17, 1994, EPA proposed disapproval of the operating permits program for the Commonwealth of Virginia. (See 59 FR 31183.) EPA received public comment on the proposal and will address those comments in this notice. EPA is taking final action to disapprove the operating permits program for the Commonwealth of Virginia. By promulgating this disapproval action within one (1) year of receipt of Virginia's November 12, 1993 operating permits program submittal, EPA has fulfilled its requirements for timely program review under section 502(d).
