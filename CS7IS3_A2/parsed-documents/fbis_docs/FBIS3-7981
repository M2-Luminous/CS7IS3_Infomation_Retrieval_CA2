[Iliescu] Romania's integration in European democratic structures was a priority objective of our foreign policy, which was actually affirmed right at the beginning of the December 1989 revolution. This is in keeping with our fundamental interests, a fact that has been attested to by the interest shown by the entire Romanian political spectrum in our country's admission to the Council of Europe. From an historical point of view, this event marks Romania's ultimate release from the ideological prison, which placed it in "Eastern Europe," and its natural reintegration in the area of European civilization and political beliefs to which it always used to belong. The political changes that have occurred in Romania since 1989 -- complex and difficult changes that, from many points of view, were more radical than in the other Central and East European countries, ranging from the adoption of the new Constitution to the operation of the new institutional system of our political, economic, and social activity -- have been recognized as contributing directly to the general process of change in Europe, in full accordance with the fundamental democratic norms and beliefs that have been preserved and promoted by this institution -- the Council of Europe -- that is a symbol of the renewal of the old continent . [FORUM] As a full member of the Council of Europe, what are your priorities within this organization? [Iliescu] Our priorities are the priorities of Europe. The creation of a new system of relations on the continent, both political and economic, and removing the consequences of past barriers do not take place on their own. There is, however, a tendency to preserve former gaps and to create new barriers to European reintegration. The Council of Europe is the institution that is able to play an essential role in overcoming outdated mentalities and promoting fundamental human values that, at this point, are more necessary than ever before. It can make a decisive contribution toward identifying new ways and means of communication and cooperation. It can create a new basis for broaching our common problems, ranging from economic ones to those concerning our continent's security, which has deteriorated so much due to the persistence of open armed conflicts and the intensification of ethnic or religious conflicts. The reestablishment of the unity of civilization and culture in Europe, where diversity constituted a source of progress and cultural enrichment for all countries, constitutes, probably, our most important common objective. The Council of Europe is the institution that is best suited to promote its implementation. [FORUM] On joining the Council, you promised to ratify the European Convention on Human Rights; these rights were seriously violated in your country before 1989. What is the situation regarding their reestablishment? [Iliescu] Reestablishing fundamental human rights and freedoms in Romania represents and has always represented -- right from the beginning of the December 1989 revolution -- a major objective of the process of social change that is under way. The drafting and approval by Parliament, and later by means of a referendum, of the new Constitution marked a decisive stage in implementing this objective. The Constitution does not only express fundamental rights and freedoms directly, but it also stipulates, in an equal way, the prevalence of international laws in this area. [FORUM] International public opinion is concerned about the minorities in Romania -- Hungarians, of course, but also others, for example, the Gypsies. What policy will be practiced to eliminate this concern? In what way may the Council of Europe be of help in this respect? [Iliescu] We intend to promote the policy of truth. As I have said before, Romania has no reason to develop complexes on account of its policy toward ethnic minorities. Romania's laws and practice exceed by far the generally accepted standards in this respect; there are not many European states where minorities enjoy the same rights that they enjoy in Romania, especially the Hungarian minority: Representation in Parliament, local councils, education, cultural establishments, publications in their mother tongue, and so forth. Unfortunately, however, this reality was often distorted to such an extent as to cause the international public concern to which you are referring. I regret that these false criteria are coming especially from countries that do not guarantee any rights to the ethnic minorities with whom they coexist, including Romanian ethnics. We hope that our country's admission to the Council of Europe will enable us to step out of the shadow of neglect by the media into which we were pushed by both domestic and foreign forces hostile to truth and democracy. We hope that the traditional Romanian tolerance that has developed and which today is characterized by the absence of any ethnic discrimination in our society may be verified and made known to European public opinion. Minorities in Romania are suffering because of economic difficulties, the strategic errors made by the recently removed totalitarian regime, the difficulties generated by the transition to a market economy, the effects of the observation of the embargo against former Yugoslavia and Iraq, and the world recession. They are suffering in the same way as most Romanians are suffering. This is why I think that the "concern" voiced by public opinion for the fate of minorities in Romania has to be channeled toward seeking ways and means to ensure more appropriate economic cooperation -- including a decrease in protectionism -- , investments, and the transfer of managerial and technological know- how so as to be able to capitalize fully on Romania's tremendous human and natural potential. [FORUM] Almost four years ago, the Council of Europe launched assistance programs for the democratization of Central and Eastern European countries. What do you think of these programs and what are your concrete expectations for Romania? [Iliescu] The answer to this question is the same as that given to the previous question. Foreign assistance cannot be ignored, but our own efforts and determination have essentially helped Romania pass through the main stages -- from the most despondent dictatorship to a European type of democratization -- in a relatively short period of time. From the institutional point of view, the democratization process is, in general terms, finished, while, in terms of mentality, development follows the nature of things, that is to say, more slowly. All experts view our Constitution as being very modern and democratic. We have pluralism, separation of state powers, and freedom of opinion, speech, press, and association and, in the past three years, we have had four electoral consultations with the people (after the general elections, local elections and a referendum on the Constitution) which were recognized as being free and correct not only according to the law but also in practice; we have all the elements needed to guarantee democratic political activity. At this point, there is no economic threat. However, if the current economic recovery were to be halted, any development would be possible, despite the Romanian people's craving for democracy for the sake of which they braved the bullets of the dictatorship in December 1989. One should not forget that Hitler installed totalitarianism in Germany in a politically democratic society that was facing, however, economic collapse. Therefore, the main way in which Europe can assist democracy in Romania is -- I am going to say this although I risk repeating myself -- through open economic cooperation, opening markets for Romanian trade, and through investments and transfer of managerial and technological know-how. [FORUM] After Bulgaria, your country is the second country within the Council of Europe with a common border with the new Yugoslav Federation against which the international community has imposed restrictions. This physical contact offers you the privileged position of an observer. How do you assess the development of the current situation? [Iliescu] Our relations with the Yugoslav Federation, with the countries within former Yugoslavia, are, in actual fact, special. Romania is a country that, throughout history, has not had any disputes or confrontations with any of those countries. We will continue to believe, as we have always affirmed, that, in order to avoid an escalation of bloody violence, the regulation of the situation in this area -- the current situation in the Yugoslav Federation can be assessed only by bearing in mind all the problems created by the dismemberment of former Yugoslavia -- can be achieved only through political will and dialogue. This should be the only direction in which events should develop: A peaceful solution. Whether this comes sooner or later, involving costs and human sacrifices, as well as lower or higher economic losses, depends, first and foremost, on the wisdom of the sides involved in the conflict, but also on the capability and concern of other forces that are able to arouse the interest of the world community in order to eliminate this dangerous source of conflict in the heart of Europe. We are certainly interested in a rapid solution to the differences and in the removal of the embargo that has had an enormous effect upon our economy from every point of view.
