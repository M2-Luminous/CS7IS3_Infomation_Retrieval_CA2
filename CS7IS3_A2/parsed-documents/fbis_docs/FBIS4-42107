The Temo public opinion institute has surveyed voter opinion as DAGENS NYHETER continues to scrutinize the government. The first of a series of grass-roots voters also express their opinion of the government and their party leaders. Nearly half the Swedish voters give the Bildt government a mediocre passing grade for its years in power. The government has performed neither better nor worse than expected, they say. In the nonsocialist corner, supporters of the Center Party and the KDS [Christian Democratic Party] are the ones most dissatisfied with the government. The high unemployment rate is what drags the nonsocialist government's grade down, but many people are favorably surprised that it managed to hold together at all. The above is shown by an opinion poll conducted by Temo for DAGENS NYHETER to ascertain people's views of the Bildt government and its policy. The poll, which was concluded last week, comprised 1,000 interviews. When asked their views on how well the nonsocialist government had done its job, 15 percent of Swedes said "better than expected," 46 percent said "neither better nor worse than expected," and 36 percent said "worse than expected." Little Difference Between Sexes The answers do not reveal any major differences between men and women or the various age groups. But those saying that the government has done its job worse than expected are mainly voters with little education, living in sparsely populated areas, and earning relatively low incomes. Naturally, it is primarily Social Democratic and Left Party voters who feel that the government has performed worse than expected: a full 47 percent. But 44 percent of Social Democrats feel that its performance was neither better nor worse than expected. The reason, of course, may be that their expectations of how the Bildt government would do were low to start with. But 7 percent of Social Democrats feel that the government has performed better than they expected. Some Have Left Since the government took office in October 1991, about 10 percent have left the nonsocialist camp, according to the polls. Many of those are probably to be found among the 47 percent of the Social Democratic Party's supporters who think the government has done worse than expected. Among nonsocialist voters, 48 percent say "neither better nor worse." "Better than expected" is the answer given by 27 percent, and 22 percent say "worse than expected." Most disappointed are Center Party and KDS voters, with 37 percent and 35 percent respectively feeling that the government has turned out worse than expected. Those most pleased, and to a corresponding degree, are Moderate and Liberal Party voters, where 34 percent and 35 percent respectively feel that the government has performed better than expected. Asked To Explain Those saying that the government had performed better than expected were asked to explain their answer. The most common answer, by 38 percent, was that they were favorably surprised that the government was able to hold together during the election period. The fact that the government was able to handle the financial crisis and pursued a good economic policy was mentioned by 31 percent, mostly Moderates. Issues such as the European Union [EU] agreement, low inflation, privatization, and better conditions for business were mentioned only in isolated cases. Of those feeling that the Bildt government has performed worse than expected, all 48 percent say that unemployment and the employment policy are the reason. The figure is 27 percent among nonsocialists and 52 percent among Social Democrats. This further underscores the fact that unemployment is going to be the big issue in this fall's election campaign. Excessive cutbacks in the public sector (the Health Service, child care, and so on) are mentioned by 26 percent (15 percent of nonsocialist voters and 29 percent of Social Democratic voters feeling that the government's performance was worse than expected). Feel Unfairly Treated The government's inequitable policy favoring business and the well-to-do and treating the worst off unfairly was the answer given by 17 percent (11 percent of nonsocialists and 14 percent of Social Democrats). Among nonsocialists who are disappointed in the government, 14 percent -- presumably mostly Moderates -- say the reason is that tax reductions have been too small or nonexistent.
