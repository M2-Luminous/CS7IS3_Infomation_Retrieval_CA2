According to sources, after CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin met with U.S. President Clinton last November and after former U.S. President Bush recently visited Beijing, the CPC authorities discussed the release-on-parole of Wang Juntao and Bao Tong in order to show their attention to human rights and their intention of improving relations with the United States. It was said that most people agreed that Bao Tong should be released first on parole, because Bao was sentenced to only seven years' imprisonment and his prison term would expire in less than three years. Moreover, Bao Tong is quite old and he was a member inside the establishment (or inside the party). He would not do or say anything unfavorable to the authorities after being released. However, former President Bush and incumbent U.S. President Clinton did not mention the release of Bao Tong, so the Beijing authorities have not decided whom they will release first, but the result of the discussion was only that one of them would be released. Reportedly, when meeting with Jiang Zemin in Seattle last November, Clinton hinted that if the CPC authorities did not take concrete action to improve China's human rights conditions, it would be difficult to extend China's most-favored-nation status next June. During Bush's recent visit to Beijing, Bush once again brought this message to the mainland authorities in moderate words. The CPC top authorities have decided to release a certain prisoner as an expression of goodwill to the United States.
