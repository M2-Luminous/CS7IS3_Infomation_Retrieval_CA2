They are swiping everything that comes to hand, everything to which the people have access, be it nails or gold bullion. But, as emerged at a briefing at the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] yesterday, people are most often put away for trifling matters as they are easier to investigate. Whereas the battle against "criminal infringements on hard currency assets," that is, against the plunder of the country's gold reserves, is very problematic. [passage omitted] According to Russian Federation MVD statistics, six times more gold is being diverted today (than in 1984). The situation is the same with regard to other precious metals and stones (mostly industrial diamonds). Inflation in Russia has forced citizens to think about the future -- should they invest their assets in freely convertible currency or get hold of it by any available means irrespective of how the Criminal Code regards them. For example, many people are today convinced that Article 88 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code has actually been repealed. No, dear fellow countrymen, it is alive and kicking, only they have stopped "putting people up against the wall" for illegal currency trafficking, and, what is more, nobody really knows what is legal and what is not today. If somebody buys $100 at the exchange rate from his neighbor, this remains legal until law-enforcement agency staffers collar him. If you have done this on the quiet, then well done. But in general it is forbidden by law to buy up hard currency from individuals. For example, there are some 15,000 bureaus de change in Moscow for this purpose, of which one-third, as a check showed, were set up independently, illegally, and have no license from the Central Bank of Russia or its representatives. In 1993 alone 70 percent of crimes in Moscow were connected with foreign currency, which, as a rule, was unrecorded. It is used for bribes and to pay off extortionists, and a few Russian citizens are setting up numbered dollar accounts in Western banks with it. The U.S. Congress has already discussed the question of $40 billion being siphoned into West European banks from Russia. They are very concerned about this matter there. In Russia people are also concerned and perplexed, but at the moment no one is in a position to even halt this currency crime wave. Incredible efforts by law-enforcement agencies have managed to return only one-fifth of what is circulating outside the homeland to its coffers. Predictions made by MVD staffers are very alarming: In the next three or four years there will be a repartition of spheres of influence among criminal structures in the gold- and diamond-extracting industry.
