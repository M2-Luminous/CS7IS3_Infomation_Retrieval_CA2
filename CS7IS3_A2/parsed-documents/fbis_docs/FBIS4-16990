Chernomyrdin signed Directive No. 451-R 31 March. Under this document the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, headed by A. Volskiy, is allocated 1.2 billion rubles from the government's reserve fund. And in the first quarter of the year, which has already ended! The aim is a fine one -- to ensure that enterprises with competitive technologies have enough funds to take part in Washington's "Technology From Russia" exhibition, which will run from 4 through 15 May. But why is this being done secretly, without coordination with the legislators? Why are the candidates to take part in the exhibition being selected not by the state but by a social organization? It seems a state, legally ratified program for support for highly developed production facilities ought to be adopted to define the specific recipients of budgetary aid. It remains unclear just how controls will ensure that taxpayers' funds are spent strictly as they should be. And why is aid going without any competition to one out of hundreds of industrialists' social organizations, rather than to the Federation of Commodity Producers, say? All this runs directly counter both to the principles of a healthy market and to the idea of strengthening a rule-of-law state.
