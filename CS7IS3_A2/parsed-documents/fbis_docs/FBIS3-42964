The goal of our generation is to prevent a worsening of the present situation and make some attempts so that at least our children's children shall not inherit a situation worse that what we have today. This is a difficult goal, and it will be essential to use all of our strength in order to make this happen. One of the basic principles, which could have a significant impact on the situation, is the adoption of a citizenship law favorable to the Latvian people. It is not a secret to anyone that the citizenship law involves many important questions. It includes a wide spectrum of problems, not only on the demographic situation of Latvians, but also on the status of the colonists brought into Latvia during the occupation. And there is also the gradual repatriation of these colonists and the promotion of emigration, as well as many other current problems. The subject of this article will be the relationship between the citizenship law and the question of the survival of the Latvia people. Before delving into the matter of the citizenship law, I would like to familiarize you with some figures describing the current situation: According to the residents' registry data, which have been entered into the computer data bank, we see the following picture: 1. Registered residents of Latvia: 2,410,763. Among this number: -- Latvian citizens: 1,355,259 -- 78.8% -- citizens of other nationalities: 365,043 -- 21.2%; -- total -- 1,720,302 -- 100%. 2. Registered Latvians who are not citizens of the Latvian state: 21,555; -- together with citizens -- Latvians --1,376,814 -- 79%; -- all citizens combined -- 1,741,857. 3. It can be estimated that the category of non-citizens to be naturalized outside the quota (excepting Latvians) would increase the number of citizens through the naturalization process by --180,000; -- all citizens combined -- 1,921,857. 4. If the number of Latvians in the total citizenship body does not change (1,376,814 resp.), then the proportion of Latvians in the total citizenship body will decline to 71.6%. 5. If we include those born in the Latvian SSR, who are not Latvian state citizens and who do not belong to the number outside the quota -- 213,250, then the total citizenship body of the Latvian state is 2,135,107, and the proportion of Latvians in the total citizenship body declines to 64.5/%. 6. If we include the number of those who entered the Latvian SSR until 1983, who are not citizens of Latvia, and who are not part of the number outside the quota -- approximately 200,000, then the total number of Latvian state citizens becomes 2,335,107, and the proportion of Latvians in the total citizenship body would decline to 59%. It is evident that such a picture, from the viewpoint of the survival of the Latvian people, is very sad. Over the normal course, the natural population growth rate of the Latvian people, i.e. the rate of generation change over, will remain under 2.1. Thus, every citizen who is not a Latvian reduces the proportion of Latvians in the total citizenship body, and along with this, increases the threat that Latvia, in the best case, will become a dual-community state. This perspective is most dangerous to the survival of the Latvian people. This risk was confirmed by a certain study in 1992[.sup]1[/] concerning the adaption of foreigners (Russians) to Latvia. The results confirmed that foreigners in a Latvian community did not adapt themselves, they did not become accustomed, nor did they wish to become accustomed, but wanted to live in Latvia within their own community. After 50 years of occupation, the Latvian people have assimilated, to a certain extent, in the direction of the Russian people. During the occupation of Latvia, a comfortable community was created for the Russia people, but not for the Latvians. This means that the possibilities to integrate such a large mass of colonists into the Latvian community are minimal, because, first of all, such a Latvian community must be created, i.e. it is necessary to turn the Latvians away from the influence of the Russian people and towards their own people. Only when the Latvian community has been established, more or less, can we talk about the integration of non-Latvians. The deciding role here is played by the citizenship law. In a normal society, the acquisition of citizenship is a very individualized and long-term process, and it cannot be accomplished in mass style. There is a critical moment when an individual has decided to commit his and his family's future to the state where he has been a long-term resident, and in which he has become so integrated that he feels more comfortable and more apart of its social and cultural community than that of the country from which he originated. The acquisition of citizenship is the culmination point of the integration process. In Latvia, there is a desire to start this process in a manner completely opposite from what is generally accepted elsewhere. The acquisition of citizenship is considered as the beginning of integration, and there are attempts to convince us that only after citizenship has been granted, can we hope to integrate the large mass of colonists. It is quite obvious that we will not be able to integrate into the Latvian community, which at present only exists formally, and is not a reality, 500,000 colonists. It is more plausible that quite the opposite will happen, that the russification of the Latvian people will continued in earnest. When this happens, we will be unable to claim our human rights because we have voluntarily agreed to these developments. The Latvian National Independence Movement (LNIM) has consistently supported the viewpoint that the proportion of Latvians in the total citizenship body should not be allowed to fall below 75%, if we want to provide for the existence of the Latvian people and the development of the Latvian state. In practice, this would mean that general naturalization should only occur after many years. From our standpoint, the citizenship law question is a political question, not a question of integration or loyalty to the Latvian sate. It is essential that political and economic power remains in the hands of the Latvian people, because the Latvia people do not have another country of their own. It is not a matter of how well or poorly the Latvians can realize this power, since Latvia is the only country that the Latvians have, whose future should be shaped by the Latvian people, not by people who have been systematically relocated as a result of some other country's politics. Therefore, the citizenship law of the Republic of Latvia is not merely a mechanism for dealing with the relationships between non-citizens and the state, but also the cornerstone for determining the fate of the Latvian people. Today, we are faced with a choice. It is a question of whether we will attempt to guarantee the survival of the Latvia people, or whether we will decide that our children shall live, as I mentioned earlier -- in the best case -- in a dual-community state, or -- in the worst case -- in a russified province of Russia. We have no other choices because the caravan is beginning to move on. What can we do right now to move the caravan in a direction that would be in our favor? Despite the unfavorable statistics, there are a few things that we can do. 1. Using all the means available to the state, we could promote repatriation of the Latvia people back to Latvia, and the voluntary immigration of non-citizens to foreign countries. I am purposefully using the term "foreign countries", because just as many non-citizens would gladly immigrate in the western direction as repatriate to the east. That would also mean that we must involve western countries for immigration (for example, the USA, Canada, Australia, etc.), so that they could establish specific immigration programs in which they would agree to accept a given number of colonists from Latvia within their general immigration quotas. We will have to deal with the repatriation of Latvians back to Latvia ourselves. 2. Within the citizenship law, it must be clearly and simply stated that the naturalization quotas will only be minimal, and that the beginning of generalized naturalization should not be expected, neither in the near future nor even sometime in the foreseeable future. In principle, non-citizens would be given two choices, respectively, either to emigrate or to continue living in Latvia as a foreigner. 3. All efforts should be concentrated on fortifying the establishment of a Latvian community in Latvia, and, as I mentioned earlier, to return Latvians in the direction of their people. I am speaking here about derussification, which, until now, has not be included among the famous three "D's". Latvian identity, etc., will not be found by shouting or contemplating one's navel. The Latvian community, first of all, is based on the Latvian language. When every student who graduates from school in Latvia will be totally fluent in the Latvian language, regardless of his nationality, then we have a Latvian community we can start talking about. Everything else will follow as a natural result. In ending, I would once again like to stress the cornerstones. First, the demographic situation of the Latvian people does not allow for generalized naturalization any time soon. Second, it is essential to create a Latvian community in Latvia, in order to insure the survival of the Latvian people, regardless of the regulations in the citizenship law. Third, with all of our power, we must promote the repatriation of Latvians and the voluntary emigration of non-citizens. Thank you for your attention, Viesturs Pauls Karnups Footnotes 1.
