Speaking before his departure for the talks in Honolulu, Mr Tharin described the meeting as "no big deal" for Thailand. The discussions will only cover general assessments of the economic climate, he said. US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who will host the talks, has said they will be informal and that the Americans would remain flexible on the agenda. Negotiations on opening financial markets will be left for the concluding ministerial meeting of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks in Marrakesh, Morroco next month, said Mr Tharin. There will be no talks on trading, services and double taxation. The discussions will cover situations of the world economy such as economic growth, capital flow and development of capital markets in the APEC countries, said Mr Tharin. He added that officials from the Ministry of Finance had been assigned to present a study on the effects of capital flows in the country's development. Bank of Thailand and Stock Exchange Commission officials will attend the meeting to provide additional information. The APEC discussions will take only one day, commented Mr Tharin. Mr Tharin said ASEAN Finance Ministers will arrange a meeting among themselves prior to presenting their positions and data one day before the full meeting takes place. Thailand is the host for this meeting. This does not mean, he added, that Thailand will present itself as the core for the ASEAN countries in the APEC meeting. Regarding the recent trade conflict between the US and Japan. Mr Tharin said the conflict did not directly involve APEC members. He believes the US will not involve APEC member countries in its dispute with Japan. Their effort to enforce the Japanese to open their markets will not affect Thai products in the US market as Thailand has already adopted free trade policies. Therefore, the US has no reason to pressure Thailand to open its market for US products, commented Mr Tharin. "Thailand has opened its markets for US products such as software and computer chips. Thus, I believe the US will have sufficient reason not to enlarge the trade war. Also US officials have assured the participants that this matter will be precluded from discussion," said Mr Tharin.
