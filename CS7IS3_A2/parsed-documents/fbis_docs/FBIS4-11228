Taboada said every area of Colombian life has been infiltrated by drug trafficking. Let us hear some reactions: [Begin recording] [General Hernan Guzman, Army commander, in progress] ...our country, and thus, completely loses the outlook of his country. Therefore, to think that this has.... [pauses] it is inappropriate to give a certain credence to the statements of this individual. [Gen. Octavio Vargas, National Police director] It is unfair to attack the dignity of people who are working courageously, honestly, and morally. [Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, presidential candidate] It is urgent to clarify this to stop the stigmatization of Colombia and avert unpredictable consequences. [Unidentified reporter] Is this an affront to the country, Mr. President? [President Cesar Gaviria] Yes, we have publicly stated, and in a very detailed manner, Colombia's position on this issue. We have demanded a sensible stand from the U.S. Government and the American people toward the efforts that our nation has made. [Presidential candidate Andres Pastrana, in progress] ...and know about money used in political campaigns in Colombia, must denounce it. [Vice Presidential candidate Humberto de la Calle] This is not a narco-democracy; Rodrigo Lara, Luis Carlos Galan, Carlos Mauro Hoyos, Guillermo Cano, journalists, and magistrates died here. We are fighting drug trafficking here; we must reject such claims that are unfair and constitute an insult to Colombia. [Presidential candidate Enrique Parejo] The government must demand the evidence from the United States that serves as the basis for the offensive that you talked about, or the testimony of Senator Kerry, or the testimony of this drug trafficker. [Presidential candidate Ernesto Samper] He must demonstrate that. I think that one cannot toss accusations into the air. There must be proof and certainty. The world must understand that we are not the drug traffickers but the main victims of trafficking. I was one of them. [end recording]
