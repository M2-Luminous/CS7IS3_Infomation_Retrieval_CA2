FR940822-0-00012 FR940822-0-00005 There are approximately 1,100 BFGoodrich ramp/slides of the affected design installed on Boeing Model 747&hyph;100, &hyph;200, &hyph;300, and &hyph;400 series airplanes in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 300 of these subject ramp/slides are installed on Boeing Model 747&hyph;100, &hyph;200, &hyph;300, and &hyph;400 series airplanes of U.S. registry that will be affected by this AD. It will take approximately 22 work hours per ramp/slide to accomplish the required actions, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will be provided by the ramp/slide manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $363,000, or $1,210 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. However, the FAA has been advised that 40 percent of the required modification kits have been delivered to airlines having airplanes affected by this AD. From this information, the FAA can assume that 40 percent of the affected fleet already have been modified in accordance with the requirements of this AD. Therefore, the future economic cost impact of this rule on U.S. operators is expected to be 40 percent less than the ``total cost impact'' figure indicated above. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .

(b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Los Angeles ACO. Note 3: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Los Angeles ACO. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.
