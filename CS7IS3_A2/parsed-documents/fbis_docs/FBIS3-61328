Then they dissipated. Delays in payments still occur, however. But now for a different reason. Some banks shamelessly keep their clients' money in the turnover for their own profit. At the same time, they try to blame those same clearing centers or technical errors, or sometimes computer breakdowns. We have already reported to our readers (RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, 17 December) how unceremoniously the commercial Narodnyy Bank treated its client, Moscow's Main Health Care Administration, in December, leaving thousands of health care workers in the capital city without salaries. In January the situation repeated itself. And with the same deplorable outcome for hospital and outpatient clinic employees. On 4 January, on the eve of payday for doctors, medical attendants, and other health care employees, the Government of Moscow's Department of Finance instructed Narodnyy Bank to transfer from its account to the account of the city's Main Health Care Administration 17.62 billion rubles [R]. However, the money had not left Narodnyy Bank on the 4th, or even on the 10th. Thus, over seven days this money, which the bank kept in circulation instead of carrying out the client's instruction, brought it--even at an interest rate of 210 percent (within Central Bank's official clearing rate)--R700 million tax-free profit. Actually, of the payment order of its client--Moscow's Department of Finance--Narodnyy Bank did deign it appropriate to transfer....R1.7 billion. When the client complained indignantly, the bank simply dismissed it: "The machine probably failed to print an extra zero," they said. Meanwhile, though, the clever bank did collect almost R700 million in interest. This is a good time to bring up another subject as well. Narodnyy is one of the few commercial banks which, with the snobbishness of the former State Bank's branch, loans out money from its clients' accounts. At the same time, however, it does not find it necessary to share the interest earned on these loans with the owners of this money. To this day, Narodnyy Bank has not entered a single kopek in interest on the so-called residual money into its clients' accounts. In violation of all norms established by the Central Bank, Narodnyy Bank uses an impermissible great share of its clients' money for loans in the high-risk zone--to various limited liability partnerships and joint-stock companies. Which are unable to pay off these loans. And the bank, as we have seen, cannot make good on its liability to the clients. The only thing that is hard to comprehend is why they get away with all these mercenary transgressions.
