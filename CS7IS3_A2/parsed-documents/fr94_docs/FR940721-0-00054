FR940721-0-00054 FR940721-0-00014 The starting place for resolving the question of what operations should be considered to be part of ``final assembly'' and therefore excluded from parts content calculations is the language of the Labeling Act. The Act includes several relevant sections. First, section 210(b)(1)(A) provides that the label must indicate ``the percentage (by value) of passenger motor vehicle equipment installed in such vehicle within a carline which originated in the United States and Canada *␣*␣*.'' Second, section 210(f)(10) provides that ``(c)osts incurred or profits made at the final vehicle assembly point and beyond (i.e., advertising, assembly, labor, interest payments, profits, etc.) shall not be included in [the calculation of value added in the United States and Canada].'' Third, section 210(f)(14) defines ``final assembly point'' as ``the plant, factory, or other place at which a new passenger motor vehicle is produced or assembled by a manufacturer and from which such vehicle is delivered to a dealer or importer in such a condition that all component parts necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile are included with such vehicle *␣*␣*.'' (Emphasis added.). While final assembly point can be considered as either a physical place or a phase in the assembly process, it is significant that section 210 defines it as a place, i.e., the plant, factory, or other place at which a new vehicle is produced or assembled. Thus, looking at the plain language of section 210, assembly and labor costs ``at'' the plant, factory or other place at which a new vehicle is assembled are excluded from parts content calculations. It is also significant that the language in section 210(f)(14) about the vehicle being in such a condition that ``all component parts necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile are included with such vehicle'' refers to the vehicle when it leaves the final assembly point for delivery to a dealer or importer. In citing this language for the proposition that ``final assembly'' is defined in terms of completeness, AIAM and Toyota confuse the completion of final assembly with the final assembly process. Section 210(f)(14) defines ``final assembly point'' as the plant, factory, or other place at which a vehicle is ``produced or assembled'' by a manufacturer. All of the operations that make up the production or assembly process are part of final assembly. There is no basis to interpret section 210(f)(10)'s requirement that assembly and labor costs incurred ``at the plant, factory or other place'' at which a new vehicle is assembled only applies to the costs associated with the last step in completing the vehicle. Since section 210 expressly provides that assembly and labor costs at the plant, factory or other place at which a new vehicle is assembled are excluded from parts content calculations, NHTSA believes that all assembly and labor costs that are ordinarily associated with final assembly must be excluded. However, the agency believes that the costs associated with parts production that may occur at a final assembly plant should not be excluded from parts content calculations. The agency notes the following argument made by the UAW in commenting on the request for comments: The definition of passenger motor vehicle equipment in section 210(f)(4) of the statute refers to components ``received at the final vehicle assembly point.'' Section 210(f)(14) then goes on to define ``final assembly point'' as meaning ``the plant, factory, or other place at which a new passenger motor vehicle is produced or assembled␣*␣*␣*.'' (Emphasis in UAW comment.) We believe these definitions can and should be interpreted liberally to include parts and components which are built ``in-house'' within the scope of ``passenger motor vehicle equipment.'' Even though such parts and components may be built in the same manufacturing facility, they are still built in a different ``place'' than where the vehicles are actually assembled (i.e., in a different department or operation within the plant)␣*␣*␣*. (T)he underlying purpose of the statute is to distinguish between labor performed in the final assembly of a vehicle and the value of the parts which go into the vehicle. Including ``in-house'' parts does not do violence to this distinction. NHTSA agrees with this comment of the UAW. A failure to consider parts produced at the final assembly plant as ``passenger motor vehicle equipment'' would result in significant differences among manufacturers. Further, if a plant were very highly integrated, it could result in a situation where the parts content percentages do not reflect the greater number of a vehicle's parts. At the same time, however, NHTSA must give full effect to the Congressional intent to exclude the costs of final assembly from parts content calculations. The agency believes that the best way to accomplish this is the method suggested by AAMA: define final assembly to include all operations involved in the assembly of the vehicle performed at the final assembly point (the final assembly plant), including but not limited to assembly of body panels, painting, final chassis assembly, and trim installation, except engine and transmission fabrication and assembly and the fabrication of motor vehicle equipment components produced at the same final assembly point using stamping, machining or molding processes. Under this approach, all costs incurred at the final assembly plant are excluded except for those that are incurred in producing either engines/transmissions or in producing parts using forming processes such as stamping, machining or molding. In addition to ensuring that final assembly costs are excluded as required by section 210, the agency also believes that a definition along these lines is much clearer than the proposed definition. For example, this type of definition will not raise issues concerning whether a part is assembled on the main assembly line or off of it. NHTSA cannot accept the recommendation of foreign vehicle manufacturers to define final assembly as starting at the time when the engine and body are fastened together. Under such a definition, manufacturers could add the engine to the body as the last step in assembling the vehicle, thereby reducing final assembly costs to a nullity. Such an approach would be inconsistent with the statutory requirement to exclude assembly and labor costs at the final assembly plant from parts content calculations.
