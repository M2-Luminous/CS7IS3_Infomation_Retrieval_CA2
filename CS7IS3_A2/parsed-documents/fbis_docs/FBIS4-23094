FBIS TRENDS-07JUN94-NORTH KOREA North Korean Nuclear Issue North Korean Nuclear Issue SUMMARY As North Korea's confrontation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United States has worsened over the last few weeks, South Korean officials and the country's media have backed the imposition of sanctions against North Korea. In their public comments, Japanese Government officials have continued to take a cautious approach to the sanctions issue, while both Beijing and Moscow are continuing to point to the need for a negotiated settlement to the DPRK nuclear crisis. Beijing, in keeping with its general foreign policy line, has reiterated its opposition to the use of sanctions, while Moscow is indicating that the time is not ripe for their imposition. END SUMMARY Seoul Supports UN Sanctions Against North Korea Responding to the recent escalation of the nuclear crisis brought on by Pyongyang's refusal to submit to IAEA inspections, the South Korean Government has pressed for sanctions against the North. South Korean President Kim Yong-sam has reportedly instructed his prime minister to take "all necessary steps" in connection with the UN sanctions against the North (Yonhap, 3 June). In his latest pronouncement on the North Korean nuclear issue, President Kim was quoted as declaring that "there is no other way now but to take sanctions" (Hanguk Ilbo, 6 June). Most major Seoul newspapers--whose reporting is often colored by their editorial biases--have seemed to agree with ROK Government pronouncements that sanctions are unavoidable. Papers across the political spectrum--from the conservative Choson Ilbo and Tong-a Ilbo to the moderate Hanguk Ilbo and the left-leaning Hangyore Sinmun--all approvingly reported on plans to move the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council for a possible sanctions vote (4 June). On the subject of China's and Russia's stance, both Choson Ilbo and the government-subsidized Seoul Sinmun noted the need to persuade China to go along with a sanctions resolution, while Tong-a Ilbo optimistically reported that although Beijing is opposed to sanctions in principle, the possibility "cannot be ruled out" that it may change its views on the issue. As for Russia's position, while Choson Ilbo simply reported Washington's opposition to Russia's proposal for an international meeting on the DPRK issue without criticizing Moscow's stand, the progovernment Kyonghyang Sinmun urged Moscow to "demonstrate" its recent commitment to the Russia-ROK "security partnership" by supporting UN sanctions against Pyongyang. Like the conservative and middle-of-the-road papers, the antiestablishment Hangyore Sinmun also admitted that sanctions against the North "will most likely" be pursued. It cautioned the government only against "uncritically following international trends" and called, without elaboration, for South Korea's own "countermeasures" to deal with further aggravation of tensions on the peninsula (4 June). However, Hangyore Sinmun subsequently expressed doubts about the effectiveness of any sanctions (6 June). Thus, the paper said sanctions against Pyongyang will not have a decisive effect since foreign trade accounts for only about 10 percent of North Korea's economy. Internal "Confusion" Despite the overall consensus between the government and press on the sanctions issue, the South Korean government's apparent attempts to balance its desire to appear firm against the North with its perceived need to ease the public's security concerns is reportedly creating some confusion among the population. For example, the probusiness Chungang Ilbo reported that "conflicting" signals given by high officials on the overall situation on the Korean peninsula are creating "confusion" in South Korea (6 June). It cited an unnamed National Assemblyman as pointing out that on the same day President Kim Yong-sam said South Korean people "do not have to worry," his prime minister "asked the people to strengthen their alert posture" within the country. The paper further quoted the assemblyman as complaining about the government's "inadequate" security measures, when, in fact, "we are in a state of emergency requiring everybody to don a gas mask." It cited another assemblyman as calling for "measures to minimize the [current] internal confusion." The daily had earlier expressed anxiety about the rising tension, openly asking the ROK Government whether it has "mapped out" measures to protect businesses engaged in North-South trade if sanctions are instituted against the North (4 June). In addition, it had cautioned government officials to be "prudent" in their remarks. Political Concerns Limit Tokyo's Maneuverability on DPRK The Japanese Government continues to publicly back dialogue and negotiation to resolve the crisis over the DPRK's nuclear program. According to the 4 June Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata told reporters on 3 June that Japan would "keep [its] doors constantly open to discussions." He added that the international community is "still not at the stage of imposing economic sanctions against the DPRK" and argued that it "should not drive the DPRK into a tight corner." The next day, according to a 4 June NHK Television report, he told a news conference that the international community 4,needs to do [its] best to seek the understanding of North Korea." Similarly, a 6 June Kyodo report quoted the coalition's spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, as telling a news conference that Japan's "basic policy" toward North Korea is to seek "resolution of the issue through dialogue." Japanese press reporting suggests that, in line with this guarded stance, the Japanese Government has formulated a cautious strategy to deal with the sanctions issue. The 4 June Mainichi Shimbun quoted Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Administrative Vice Minister Kunihiko Saito and another unnamed MOFA source as saying Japan plans to propose that the UN Security Council take a more moderate step, such as issuing a warning to North Korea, before it considers sanctions. Another unnamed senior MOFA official told the 3 June Yomiuri Shimbun that the government favors such an approach because it is more likely to win the support of China, which would, in Tokyo's estimation, probably veto a sanctions resolution. Yet another unnamed MOFA source told the 6 June Yomiuri Shimbun that Tokyo might propose an embargo on weapons exports to North Korea as an alternative to immediate economic sanctions. Political Concerns The major reasons for Tokyo's cautious approach to the DPRK nuclear issue are the weakness of the ruling coalition and public opposition to sanctions by the two main opposition parties--the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)--which together could bring down the government with a no-confidence motion in the Diet. The SDPJ, which the ruling coalition still hopes to lure back into the government and which has, in the past, had close ties with the DPRK, has repeatedly signaled that it will continue to oppose economic sanctions against Pyongyang. In one of the party's most recent statements on the issue, SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo reportedly told a news conference on 4 June that the SDPJ "opposes economic sanctions against North Korea" and argued that the United States, Japan, and South Korea "must be cautious" about imposing them (NHK Television, 4 June; Yomiuri Shimbun, 5 June). During a 5 June interview on Tokyo's FNN Television Network, Kubo also stated that it might be a "deviation from current constitutional constraints" for Japan to support any economic sanctions that the United States might seek to impose outside the framework of the United Nations if that body fails to take action against Pyongyang. In order to promote a negotiated settlement to the DPRK nuclear issue, the SDPJ reportedly plans to send a delegation to the DPRK on 10 June to urge Pyongyang to submit to IAEA inspections (Asahi Shimbun, 4 June; Yomiuri Shimbun, 5 June). The LDP, the largest political party in the Japanese Diet, has also indicated that it favors continued negotiations with the DPRK--possibly in part because it does not want to alienate the SDPJ, with whom some LDP members hope to form a coalition government if the current ruling coalition loses power. According to the 6 June Nihon Keizai Shimbun the LDP President Yohei Kono, during a 5 June news conference, stressed the importance of dialogue with the DPRK, arguing that "it is necessary to exert efforts to make North Korea understand correctly the appeals and demands of the international community." Possibly in an effort to weaken the coalition by underscoring its inability to deal with the DPRK issue, the LDP reportedly is planning to send a delegation to Pyongyang on 14 June for talks with North Korean Premier Kang Song-san to press the DPRK to "clear up suspicions" about its nuclear program (Asahi Shimbun, 4 June). The government's sensitivity to the positions of both the SDPJ and the LDP was underscored when, according to the 4 June Mainichi Shimbun, MOFA Vice Minister Saito met with both SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and the Chairman of the LDP's Policy Research Council, Ryutaro Hashimoto, shortly after he cut short a trip to Europe and returned to Tokyo to deal with the DPRK issue. Mainichi Shimbun quoted Saito as telling the SDPJ and LDP leaders that Japan plans to "buy time" by urging the United Nations to consider more moderate steps against North Korea before it imposes sanctions. Divisions in Coalition The ruling coalition itself may be divided over how quickly and to what extent Japan should publicly move to support sanctions against the DPRK. According to a 3 June Kyodo report, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told a Diet Foreign Affairs Committee that if the UN Security Council fails to reach an agreement on imposing sanctions because of opposition from China, Japan will offer "maximum cooperation" with any multilateral punitive measures against the DPRK initiated by Washington. Kakizawa reportedly added that Japan would halt cash remittances to North Korea from Korean residents in Japan and suspend all trade with the DPRK. By contrast, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai, speaking before another Diet committee the same day, reportedly restated Japan's current official position on the DPRK issue, saying that Tokyo will "tenaciously try to persuade North Korea to reach a negotiated settlement." He added that Japan has "no specific sanctions in mind" (Kyodo, 3 June). The 4 June Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted officials close to Prime Minister Hata as saying that the prime minister is concerned that some members of the cabinet are "increasingly calling for adopting a hardline position" against North Korea. The officials reportedly cited Kakizawa's 3 June comments before the Diet Committee as an example of such a hardline stance. They added that Prime Minister Hata prefers to take a more moderate approach for political reasons, hoping to convince the SDPJ to return to the coalition government it left in April. Beijing Calls For Talks, Rejects UN Sanctions Despite Pyongyang's refusal to submit to IAEA inspections, the Chinese Government continues to favor a negotiated settlement to the DPRK nuclear crisis. Speaking at a press conference on 2 June, a PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman reiterated Beijing's "unchanged" position favoring the settlement of the dispute through "dialogue and consultations" (Xinhua, 2 June). In an apparent reference to recent U.S. calls for sanctions, the spokesman went on to say that even though "some difficulties" have emerged as a result of the IAEA's recent inspection, the "key" to a settlement is for all parties to treat the issue with "calmness" and make "positive efforts in order to leave room and keep the possibility alive for a proper settlement." China's permanent representative to the United Nations Li Zhaoxing had been more explicit in rejecting sanctions in remarks made during UN Security Council consultations on 30 May. According to a 31 May Xinhua report, Li reiterated the need to settle the dispute through negotiations, saying that China "does not endorse any action that may exacerbate" the situation. According to the Japanese news agency Kyodo, PRC Foreign Minster Qian Qichen has also weighed in on the question of sanctions. A 7 June Kyodo report said the Chinese press agency "Xinhua quoted Qian" as telling the visiting Maltese Foreign Minister at a meeting that day that China believes imposing sanctions is "not a good way" to resolve the problem. Monitored Xinhua reporting has not yet been observed to carry Qian's remarks. The PRC-owned Hong Kong daily Hsin Wan Pao on 7 June also discussed China's views on the DPRK nuclear crisis. An article by the paper's veteran commentator Yang Chu said Beijing believes that there is still time to resolve the issue before sanctions are "officially proposed" and that China has to "choose between vetoing or abstaining from vetoing a decision." He concluded that China "will not agree" to economic sanctions against the DPRK in the UN Security Council. Moreover, taking note of the DPRK's threats of war, he said China "will not dispatch" troops and become "involved" in a Korean war. The second article, carried in the paper's "news talk column," also pointed to China's desire for a negotiated settlement, noting that Beijing is "obviously unwilling" to take a stand on sanctions and "hopes for another way of handling" the issue. Previous Views on UN Sanctions Although China has generally opposed the use of sanctions, it did vote for the imposition of UN sanctions against Iraq in 1990. Explaining Beijing's support for sanctions against Iraq, PRC Ambassador to the United Nations Li Daoyu said China believed that "state-to-state relations" must be "based" on the five principles of peaceful coexistence, that the "norms" governing international relations must be maintained, and that resorting to force or the threat to use force to violate a country's sovereignty and territorial integrity "must be opposed" (Xinhua, 7 August 1990). Moscow Advocates Talks, Conditionally Supports Sanctions Like China, Russia has stressed the need to resolve the present crisis through negotiations. Speaking at a press conference on 2 June, Russian President Boris Yeltsin repeated Moscow's call for an international conference that would be attended by Russia, China, the DPRK, South Korea, the United States, and Japan, saying it is the "only way to solve the problem" (Moscow Ostankino television). Moscow had first introduced the idea of an international conference on the North Korean nuclear issue in late March, claiming that bilateral efforts to resolve the crisis had been "inadequate" (ITAR-TASS, 24 March). However, unlike Beijing, Moscow, perhaps because its concern over Ukrainian nuclear intentions give Russia a greater stake in seeing that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) is adhered to, has not ruled out the possibility of sanctions. For example, although Yeltsin, at the press conference on 2 June, noted that it is "just a bit early" to speak of sanctions, he went on to say that if the DPRK "digs in its heels" and withdraws from the NPT, Russia "will be obliged, gradually, of course, to first warn" the DPRK and then later, "probably" join with the world community and "adopt some kind of sanctions." Reiterating this position on 7 June, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, according to Radio Rossii, told the independent press agency Interfax that the "time is not ripe for sanctions," saying that sanctions can only be introduced "in stages" after "all other possibilities" have been exhausted. In an apparent reference to a U.S. suggestion that Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo might join together and impose sanctions against the DPRK, Kozyrev said sanctions should be "introduced and lifted by the UN Security Council alone." A day earlier ITAR-TASS had cited an unnamed "high-ranking Foreign Ministry official" as saying that Moscow may not "support" sanctions if they are not approved by the UN Security Council.
