Our Army affairs correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda reports: [Begin recording] [Ben-Yahuda] Sergeant No'am Simha, 21, from Kibbutz Rosh Haniqra was killed this afternoon in south Lebanon. Three other soldiers were wounded, one moderately and two lightly. The casualties were soldiers in the Nahal Brigade who were part of a convoy that was making its way to the outpost at Beaufort Castle. The supply convoy consisted of a water tanker, several trucks, and armored personnel carriers. The road leading to the outpost is very steep, rising 700 meters above sea level. Before they reached the outpost, when most of the unit was making its way on foot, the terrorists fired antitank Sagger missiles and mortar bombs at the convoy and the outpost. One of the soldiers was killed by a missile and three others were wounded, one moderately and two lightly. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin reacted to the incident, saying it was a painful incident but did not mean an exacerbation of the tension on the northern border. [Rabin] Unfortunately there was an incident, but this is not an exacerbation of the situation. I cannot say that it deviates from other incidents to date, only that the outcome is more painful.
