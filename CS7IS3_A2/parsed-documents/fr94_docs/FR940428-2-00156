During the period beginning effective date and lasting through expiration, the permittee is authorized to discharge from each outfall of non-contact cooling water to a drainage basin classified as a warm or cold water fishery as designated below. a. Such discharges shall be limited and monitored by the permittee as specified below: ␣ 1Effluent characteristic 1Discharge limitations other units (specify) 2Avg. Monthly 2Max.

The designation of a cold or warm water fishery shall be that which is provided in the Water Quality Standards 314 CMR 4.06(3). 1See part I.A.1.i or j. 2See part I.A.1.K. b. The rise in temperature due to a discharge to Class A waters shall not exceed 1.5 ○F (0.8 ○C); and natural seasonal and daily variations shall be maintained (314 CMR 4.05(3)(a)2). c. The rise in temperature due to a discharge to Class B waters shall not exceed 3 ○F (1.7 ○C) in rivers and streams designated as cold water fisheries non 5 ○F (2.8 ○C) in rivers and streams designated as warm water fisheries (based on the minimum expected flow for the month); in lakes and ponds the rise shall not exceed 3 ○F (1.7 ○C) in the epilimnion (based on the monthly average of maximum daily temperature); and natural seasonal and daily variations shall be maintained (314 CMR 4.05(3)(b)2). d. The rise in temperature due to a discharge to Class SA waters shall not exceed 1.5 ○F (0.8 ○C); and natural seasonal and daily variations shall be maintained (314 CMR 4.05(4)(a)2).
