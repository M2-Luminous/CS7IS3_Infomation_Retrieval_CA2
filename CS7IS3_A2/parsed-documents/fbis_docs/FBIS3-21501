"Two close-circuit cameras have been installed and activated in an engineering facility at Um al-Ma'arik (Mother of All Battles), 20 minutes from Baghdad, with two film cameras as a back-up," said Gary Dillon, a Briton, about the site that was part of Iraq's enriched uranium production program. "The work was carried out without a hitch and the Iraqis were cooperative," said Dillon about his seven-member IAEA team that just completed a week-long mission in Iraq. On Feb 4, IAEA deputy chief Maurizio Zifferero said experts from his agency would remove the last batch of Iraq's irradiated fuel and start setting up cameras at former nuclear sites. The team was to have arranged removal of the five kilograms (11 pounds) of fuel believed to be left in Iraq. Some 35 kilograms (77 pounds) were removed on December 5. "The IAEA team will be back within two months to continue their work of installing surveillance cameras at maybe two or three more sites, where up to 20 cameras may be set up in total," Dillon said. Another 11 chemical weapons experts, led by Horst Reeps from Germany, accompanied Dillon's team on Friday. It completed a 10-day mission to identify and collect equipment Iraq had used in producing chemical weapons. "We completed our mission of identifying, tagging and filing 250 pieces of chemical production equipment of dual use nature. Part of these were used during the Iran-Iraq war," Reeps said. "Our main aim was to get more information on the planned use of this equipment in the future. Iraq has said it intends to make use of them for the production of pesticides, pharmaceuticals and other chemicals," he said. He said that some of the equipment was never used, some used on a regular basis and some would be the subject of new discussions with the Iraqis on their planned use. In the hope of obtaining an end to a three-year embargo, Iraqi authorities are cooperating with efforts to dismantle programs for making weapons of mass destruction which are banned under UN resolutions ending the 1991 Gulf war. The embargo was imposed four days after Iraq's forces invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
