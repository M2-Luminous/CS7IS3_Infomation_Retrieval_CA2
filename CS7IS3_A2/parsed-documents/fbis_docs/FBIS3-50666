The president thus rejected reports published in Washington on alleged U.S. pressure exerted on the late ARENA leader Roberto d'Aubuisson in 1984 to prevent an attack on Thomas Pickering, who was serving as U.S. ambassador at the time. Cristiani added that a report appearing in the U.S. newspaper THE WASHINGTON POST, which cited official documents on the recent Salvadoran war that had been kept secret until recently, are based on "unconfirmed" information. President Cristiani admitted that General Vernon Walters visited his country in 1984. He added, however, this was related to the selection of an acting president, who turned out to be Alvaro Magana, in view of the political crisis facing the country at that time. He added that the U.S. soldier met with Major d'Aubuisson, who died in 1992, because he was among the most prominent local politicians in his capacity as president of the Constituent Assembly, and he added that "they were searching for a consensus person to occupy the Presidency while the Constitution was being drafted." Cristiani said he has all the documents that the United States declassified, adding that he could list thousands of murders involving the FMLN, including that of Presidency Minister Dr. Antonio Rodriguez Porth in June 1989. The president criticized an alleged propaganda campaign unleashed against his party. He said that all those documents bear a headline stating that the Department of State does not guarantee the veracity of the information and that this is simply information collected by chance. U.S. President Bill Clinton made public in November 1993 a large amount of secret information on the Salvadoran war (1980-92). Publication of this information in U.S. newspapers has already unleashed several polemics in El Salvador.
