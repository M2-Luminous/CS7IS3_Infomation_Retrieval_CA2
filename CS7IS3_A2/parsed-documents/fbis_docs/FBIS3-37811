The letter was passed over on Monday [21 February] by the Russian ambassador to Riga, sources at the Russian Foreign Ministry's press and information department told ITAR-TASS here today. The Russian president stressed the priority of settlement of the citizenship problem in Latvia with a bilateral agreement. In his words, integration of ethnic Russians with public life of the independent Latvian Republic would open up a new chapter in relations with Latvia, "with which Russia is connected with thousands of ties and wants to have good-neighbourly relations and mutually beneficial relationship". According to the letter, the Russian and Latvian delegations are working to achieve progress in the elaboration of a treaty on Russian troops withdrawal, agreements on social protection of Russian servicemen, military pensioners and members of their families, as well as on the Russian radar station in Skrunda. The signing of these documents would boost settlement of other complicated issues of bilateral relations, stressed the president's letter.
