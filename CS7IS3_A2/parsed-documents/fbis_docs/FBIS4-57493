FBIS4-57493 "drlat098__a94004" FBIS-LAT-94-098-A Daily Report 14 May 1994 ANNEX Brazil Coalition Created To Support Lula's Candidacy Coalition Created To Support Lula's Candidacy PY1605205094 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 14 May 94 p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY1605205094 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Portuguese BFN [Text] PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva on 13 May supported the nationwide strikes against the economic plan of Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] presidential candidate and former finance minister. Yesterday in Rio de Janeiro, Lula installed the Popular Brazil Front. This is a coalition of parties that support his candidacy (PT, PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party], PPS [People's Socialist Party], PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil], PCB [Brazilian Communist Party], and PST-U [Unified Social Workers Party]). Lula said: "The demands by Federal Police agents are justified. The government called in the Army because it is unfit for dialogue." The PT candidate said that the claim that the strikes are political "is an old story." He noted that the PT opposed the economic plan since it was set in motion -- not since Cardoso became a candidate. Lula said the plan was not harmed by the strike, it was harmed because Cardoso "escaped from the responsibility" of managing it to become a candidate. "He should have raised his baby," he said. The Popular Brazil Front was set in motion during a lunch at the Brazil Automobile Club building, in downtown Rio de Janeiro. The reception was attended by Lula, by PSB Senator Jose Paulo Bisol, who is Rio Grande do Sul and Lula's running mate, and by coalition party leaders. The reception was attended by 160 persons who each paid $15. While unionist Ciro Garcia (PST-U) was defending the strikes, 85-year old Parana representative Cordolina Fontelles handed Lula a landless people's flag. She is the mother of Deputy Paulo Fontelles who was murdered in an agrarian conflict in June 1987. CUT [Sole Workers Center] President Jair Menguelli said that of the 5 million plus workers whose collective bargaining date is in May, less than 200,000 are on strike. "It is a small number compared to other years. Strikes should continue," he said.
