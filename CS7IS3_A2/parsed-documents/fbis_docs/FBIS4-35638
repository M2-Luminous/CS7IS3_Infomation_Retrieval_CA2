Informed sources note that Shaykh Abu-Luhum has disappeared from the arena in recent weeks, since his return to Sanaa at the beginning of the Yemeni war. Despite his state of health and advanced age, he had made great efforts in bridging the views of Yemeni president and his Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid since the beginning of the crisis last August. The sources say that Abu-Luhum may be under house arrest at present for refusing to add his name to the list of supporters signed by a number of YSP and opposition leaders currently in Sanaa despite their known opposition to President Salih in the past. It is worth noting that commercial offices partly owned by Shaykh Sinan were burned down six week ago while he was in the United States for medical treatment, because of the positions he had taken and statements he made to Sanaa's dissatisfaction, particularly his support for a strong Arab role in settling the Yemeni crisis after the Sanaa and Aden officials failed to contain that crisis.
