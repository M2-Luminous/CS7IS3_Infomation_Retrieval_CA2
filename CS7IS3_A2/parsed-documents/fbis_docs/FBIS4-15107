The session of the country's supreme legislative body was held in an atmosphere of heated debate and demonstrated radically different approaches to this problem. A number of members of opposition parties and factions gave a sharply negative assessment of the latest Georgian-Abkhaz document, putting emphasis on a clause relating to the restricted return of the refugees to their original places of residence, which is conditional on their nonparticipation in hostilities and nonmembership of military formations ready to enter the territory of Abkhazia. In the opinion of the opposition, this, being a disguised method of "filtering out" the deported people, is incompatible with the Georgian side's position. Some radically-minded parliamentarians even raised the issue of no confidence in the Georgian head of state and his personal representative at the Moscow talks, Aleksandr Kavsadze, who had signed the controversial package of documents on behalf of Georgia. A large proportion of members of the parliamentary majority welcomed the signing of the Georgian-Abkhaz quadrilateral agreement. They believe that this step was necessary in the current situation. They see it as the only chance to allow the return of the refugees to their homeland and to influence the UN Security Council to take a decision to deploy peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone.
