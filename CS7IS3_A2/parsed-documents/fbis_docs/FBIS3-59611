It flies up to 20 km from the operator. The cable controlling the 2 m long RPV has been developed to resist the stresses forced on it by erratic movements. The aircraft itself weighs 20 kg and it is able to carry a payload of up to 30 kg, such as a TV camera. Optical transmission of the collected data also means there is no "signature" so the data can be neither jammed nor intercepted, the developers claim. Originally developed for "intelligence gathering in theatres of operation" the Pirat has been adapted to civilian projects such as security patrolling of inaccessible locations or industrial inspection. The relatively cheap fibre link is intended to be an expendable item. It may be detached before the plane returns. Different recording devices may be carried by the Pirat's modular fuselage.
