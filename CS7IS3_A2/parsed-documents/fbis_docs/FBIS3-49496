According to the prime minister, the number of initiated privatization procedures exceed those initially planned, while the concluded deals fall short of those envisaged. Over the past year the Agency for Privatization with the Council of Ministers initiated 49 privatization procedures and concluded 13 deals for sale. The ministries and committees authorized to privatize put up for privatization another 293 smaller units, 49 of which were sold. Stepping into office in the last days of 1992, Prof. Berov's cabinet pledged to become the cabinet of privatization. A year later the most severe of criticisms are leveled exactly at that sphere of the government's activity. In the spring of 1993 the cabinet declared that it was adopting a course toward mass socially-oriented privatization and in September tabled for discussion at parliament a draft amendment to the effective Privatization Act. So far, the draft has been shelved by the MP's. "We hope that the draft amendment will be put to the vote by the end of this January," Prime Minister Berov says in his analysis. The 1994 national budget bill, too, has yet to be passed by the same time. Under the government privatization project, all Bulgarian nationals above 18 years of age living in this country will receive 25,000-leva registered privatization bonds. The Council of Ministers is presently drawing up a list of some 500 enterprises which will be put up for privatization. The list will include units of various profitability and financial states and will leave out those facing bankruptcy, Prof. Berov says. The World Bank and the IMF have pledged their support for the project.
