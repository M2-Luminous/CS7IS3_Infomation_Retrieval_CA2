We realize that a NATO attack on our positions would be an attack by a stronger party on a much weaker one, but the Serbs have no right to capitulate." This statement was made yesterday for Radio Kragujevac by Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the assembly of the republic of Srpska. "Although the Muslims, who rejected the peace plan, are responsible for the continuation of the war, the Serbs are being threatened." The only reason for this is that the political forces that support the Muslims are using the United Nations to conduct their politics financed by Islamic countries. On the subject of the continuation of the peace talks in Geneva, Krajisnik pointed out that it is very difficult to conduct negotiations under the conditions of threats and blackmail. Peace should be established as soon as possible; weapons should be laid down, and all controversial issues should then be calmly resolved through political negotiations.
