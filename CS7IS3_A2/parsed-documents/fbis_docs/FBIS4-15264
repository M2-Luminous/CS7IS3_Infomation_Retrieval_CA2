Because of various faults nuclear reactors at many of them do not operate to full capacity. In addition to technical reasons, the work of nine Russian nuclear power stations is affected by huge indebtedness to them by consumers. It amounts now to over 600 billion roubles. Observers believe this urges operators to protest actions such as the picketing of the government building conducted today. Because of the lack of funds, nuclear fuel cannot be bought. Prophylactic work cannot be done on time. Planned recharging of reactors with fuel is skipped. So nuclear power plants in Russia may turn out of energy producers into major energy consumers. Social tension is heightening among the personnel of nuclear power plants. Wages have not been paid to them for three of four months. Nuclear power plant operators have to resort to extreme measures. Five operators of the Kursk nuclear power station were recently fasting in protest against non-payment of wages. Despite the government decision to conclude collective agreements with workers in nuclear power, such an agreement was concluded with the personnel of only one of the nine stations, the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant. The coordination council for joint actions formed by trade unions of nuclear power sent an address to the Russian president, government and parliament. The address pointed to the need to stabilise the financial situation in the region. So far all Russian nuclear power stations have to work in a regime on strict economy. Because of this their output dropped by half.
