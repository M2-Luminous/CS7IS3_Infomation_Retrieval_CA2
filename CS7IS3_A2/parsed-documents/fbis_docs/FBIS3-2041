In revealing this new policy, the high-level leadership of the central authorities stressed that we should not rush headlong into mass action in the establishment of investment zones for Taiwan businessmen and that we should carry out solid work in economic relations and trade with Taiwan. How we establish such zones depends on how we absorb investment by Taiwan businessmen, and we should not confine ourselves to one form. The authoritative person quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying that the Taiwan independence movement can best be contained by letting the economy of the two sides become closely integrated. The high level of the central authorities stressed that this viewpoint of Deng Xiaoping should be embodied in the entire work on Taiwan and that economic relations and trade with Taiwan is engineering that places hope in the Taiwan people. A high-level leader of the central authorities said in a relevant speech a few days ago that the central authorities hold that the request for the establishment of investment zones for Taiwan businessmen put forward by some localities is good and that they are considering giving approval to the establishment of several such zones on a trial basis in several localities along the coast. However, we should not rush headlong into mass action in the establishment of investment zones for Taiwan businessmen, but should make arrangements and give approval in a planned manner. The central authorities hold that localities which are not on the coast need not focus all their attention on investment zones for Taiwan businessmen and that there are numerous ways to attract Taiwan capital. For example, a major Taiwan businessman can be allowed to develop a vast stretch of land and then this businessman can attract other businessmen to come. In this way, it will be possible to attract more Taiwan businessmen to a development zone in a short time, and the open zone will naturally take shape faster. Localities which fail to obtain approval for the establishment of investment zones for Taiwan businessmen may follow this very good method. The authoritative person continued to quote a high-level leader of the central authorities as saying that in recent years, Taiwan businessmen have vied with one another in making investment in the mainland. The volume of investment has grown by a big margin and some businessmen have even asked to contract the development of a large stretch of land. This being the case, since some coastal economic development zones are already almost filled with construction projects, and their fund-raising capacity is almost fully utilized, these zones are far from being able to meet the actual needs of investment by Taiwan businessmen. The central authorities approving the establishment of investment zones for Taiwan businessmen and approving the adoption of more open policies for attracting Taiwan capital is precisely to meet the needs of the situation as it has developed. He said that to attain reunification, it is first of all necessary to let the Taiwan compatriots really understand the mainland, particularly the tremendous changes since reform and opening up began 15 years ago. The overwhelming majority of Taiwan compatriots who invest in the mainland will benefit from the market on the mainland. The increase in economic exchanges will enable the Taiwan compatriots to increase their understanding of the mainland and will deepen the feelings and friendship between the people of the two sides of the strait.
