The chamber also discussed President Kresimir Zubak's report on the latest round of negotiations with the Serb side and government measures to curb lawlessness in the Herceg- Bosna area. Zdenko Vranjes reports: [Vranjes] In addition to proposing Jadranko Prlic as a candidate for the post of vice president and minister of defense, the following were also put forward as candidates: Neven Tomic as minister of finance, Mate Tadic as minister of justice, Nikola Grabovac as minister of trade, and Stjepo Andric as minister without portfolio. Two candidates are contesting the post of minister for health care -- Vlado Simunovic and Ivan Sarec. The deputies also adopted a list of deputy ministers from the ranks of the Croat people in the federal government. The constitutional amendments, including certain alterations, relating to the definition of mixed cantons were also adopted. A draft law on ministries and some other documents that will be placed on the agenda for a session of the federal parliament, scheduled to take place on Wednesday in Sarajevo, were also endorsed. It seems that the big powers have agreed on Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that they will not relinquish the division of Bosnia at a 51-49 percent ratio, Kresimir Zubak, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, said when presenting his report on the latest round of negotiations in Geneva. He also spoke in detail about the contact group's proposals; the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina, gray zones, and blue roads. The Croatian side has been short-changed to some degree in the areas of Teslic and Kotor Varos, while Muslim interests have been fundamentally damaged in the area of eastern Bosnia. The Muslim territories around Kljuc and Sanski Most may be reduced as they will be designated as gray zones. The Serbian side's demand for two power stations near Jajce to be given to the Serbs has not been accepted, Zubak added. Passages [pasaz] are now being mentioned instead of corridors, Zubak said, and added that this Serb passage in Posavina would run through Serb villages, so the whole of Derventa would be included in a Croat canton. Only some Croat villages between Brcko and Modrica would be included in the Serb passage. The president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation said that a blue road between Modrica and Bosanski Samac, via Jajce, Kljuc, and Sanski Most had been discussed in Geneva as well as a corridor between Livno and Bihac. Of the three draft political solutions for Bosnia-Herzegovina the Croatian side regards the solution that implies a confederation between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation with Croatia as the most acceptable, while at the same time the Serb part of Bosnia-Herzegovina might have a similar arrangement with the so-called Yugoslavia. If the Serb side refuses the contact group's plan the federation will demand that the arms embargo be lifted, Zubak added. The deputies also issued an appeal to the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and Fikret Abdic's forces to end their clashes in western Bosnia and to seek a solution at the negotiating table. The Croat side offers its services as a mediator in their negotiations. Tonight the Chamber of Deputies also adopted the government's measures to curb crime in the Herceg-Bosna area. The government is duty-bound to submit to the deputies a report on the implementation of these measures within one month. The deputies demanded that in addition to measures to curb robberies along the road over Mount Vran Planina, steps should also be taken to either prove or dispell rumors circulating among people that the criminal operations in Herceg-Bosna are being covered up by elements within the top ranks of Herceg-Bosna's authorities or that they themselves are involved in these operations. Speaking about the onset of a fierce anticrime campaign, Kresimir Zubak told the deputies that the Presidential Council has set up a headquarters that will spearhead the fight against robberies and crime.
