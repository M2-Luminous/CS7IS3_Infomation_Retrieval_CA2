This draws our attention as there is current suspicion regarding North Korea's nuclear weapons development. The NSP disclosed this on 26 March when it transferred Mr. Yi Pok-hon to the prosecutor's office. Since he left the country in 1990, Mr. Yi has been engaged in spy activities overseas, in regions such as Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and China. Mr. Yi reportedly stated during the NSP investigation: When I went to North Korea in March 1993, a Mr. Ho, a senior North Korean Workers' Party cadre, asked me directly if it would be tactically advantageous to North Korea to announce openly its possession of a nuclear bomb or would it be better to keep it secret after the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The NSP also disclosed that Mr. Yi said that Ho had told him that North Korea intends to deliver an atomic bomb, whose performance had not been tested, to a certain country in the Middle East sometime during 1994.
