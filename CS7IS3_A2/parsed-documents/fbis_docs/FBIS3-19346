[Giesbert] Bernard Bosson, good morning. [Bosson] Good morning. [Giesbert] You are a minister of everything, aren't you? [Bosson] Indeed, of parts of daily life and of preparation for the future. [Giesbert] We have not heard from you since Christian Blanc, Air France chairman, a manager, a very courageous man, published details of his plan last week. What is your first impression? [Bosson] It is extraordinary that the minister should be in the limelight when things are going badly. When things are going well, it is not the case. [Giesbert] Are you trying to tell us that things are going well for Air France? [Bosson] I believe that things are going well with Christian Blanc. [Giesbert, interrupting] What about the deficit? [Bosson] With Christian Blanc appointed by the government at my suggestion. We have changed our method radically. [passage omitted] [Giesbert] Bernard Bosson, would it not be a good idea to privatize Air France right now, quickly? [Bosson] One of the things that is far from being on the agenda is the privatization of Air France. On the contrary, what is on the agenda... [Giesbert, interrupting] Why? Why not? [Bosson] On the contrary, what is... [Giesbert, interrupting] Why? [Bosson] Do you know anyone who would be willing to buy an Air France share in the present state of the company? The real problem... [Giesbert, interrupting] I don't understand. You are going to privatize Bull. It has a huge deficit too. [Bosson] No, this is irrelevant. [Giesbert] Bull.... [Bosson, interrupting] I have tried to save the company, to do it with the men and women at Air France, and not against them. What is on the agenda is the participation of employees. [passage omitted] Twenty-five percent of the capital will be shared by the employees -- 10 percent by all and the rest for those who will agree to work more and to be paid with shares, those who will believe in the future of their company and mobilize the company around its chairman. [Giesbert] What you are telling me this morning is interesting, Bernard Bosson, that is: The privatization of Air France is not on the agenda, it will not take place for a long time, maybe never. [Bosson] This seems obvious to me, it is a different issue altogether. The present issue is to save our national company so that it is not the only great European company to disappear or to be bought up. Should our fleet fly under the flag of British Airways or a U.S. company in the future, I don't think that it would be a great French victory. This seems obvious to me. [passage omitted]
