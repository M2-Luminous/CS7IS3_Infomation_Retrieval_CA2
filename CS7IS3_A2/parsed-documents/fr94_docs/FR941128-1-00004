FR941128-1-00004 FR941128-1-00001 Section 130.620 would provide the procedure for amending or revising a Cooperative Agreement due to changes in the scope, work or funding of an SBDC during the budget year, and would set forth those changes which require an amendment. The section would further set forth those revisions or changes which do not require an amendment to the Cooperative Agreement, such as budget revisions or reallocations of funds in accordance with applicable OMB circulars. Proposed §§130.630, 130.640 and 130.650 would respectively set forth Dispute resolution procedures, Conflict resolution procedures and the non-renewal procedure to be utilized by SBA in the event of non-performance or poor performance on the part of an SBDC. Proposed §130.700 would explain the grounds and procedures for suspending or terminating a recipient organization. After the SBA has entered into a Cooperative Agreement with a recipient organization, the SBA would not suspend or terminate any such agreement unless the SBA provides the recipient organization with written notification setting forth the reasons for the proposed action and affording the recipient organization an opportunity for a hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553 et seq. The general procedures that would be applicable are contained in 13 CFR 143.43 and 143.44, Enforcement and Termination for Convenience, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments, and in OMB Circular A&hyph;110, Attachment L, Suspension and Termination Procedures for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and other Nonprofit Organizations, Uniform Administrative Requirements. Proposed §130.800 would explain that the SBA would have the authority to review and oversee the Cooperative Agreement and ongoing operations of the SBDC network. In addition, the SBA would have the authority to make programmatic and financial review visits to Lead Centers and SBDC service providers to analyze and assess training, counseling and any other SBDC related activities. Furthermore, an on-site evaluation of an SBDC network would be conducted by the SBA, with SBDC participation, as required by law. Additionally, this section would provide that the recordkeeping requirements of the SBDC network shall be as set forth in OMB Circulars A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133. Proposed §130.830 would also state that all audits are to be conducted in accordance with provisions governing audits contained in applicable OMB Circulars. Compliance With Executive Orders 12612, 12778 and 12866; Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.; and the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. ch. 35 The SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if promulgated in final, would not be considered a significant rule within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 because it would not have an annual economic effect in excess of $100 million, result in a major increase in costs for individuals or governments, or have a significant adverse effect on competition. The SBA has made this determination based upon the fact that this proposed rule would establish regulations which conform to the existing parameters under which the program is already functioning. Further, pursuant to Public Law 103&hyph;121, the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and the Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1994, the total amount of funds designated for the SBDC Program is $71,266,000. For purposes of Executive Order 12612, the SBA certifies that this proposed rule would have federalism implications. As such, the SBA offers the following Federalism Assessment. This proposed rule would implement Section 21 of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 648, and is designed to allow the States participating in the SBDC Program maximum policymaking and administrative discretion within the requirements of the law and sound program management. In formulating and implementing the policies governing the SBDC Program set forth in this proposed rule, the SBA has encouraged the State participants to develop their own methods of achieving program objectives and has refrained, to the maximum extent practicable, from establishing uniform national requirements for the program. For purposes of Executive Order 12778, the SBA certifies that this proposed rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in section 2 of that Order. For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if promulgated in final, would not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities for the same reason that it is not a significant rule. For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if promulgated in final, would impose no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements. This proposed rule does, however, codify, at §§130.800 through 130.830, paperwork requirements previously cleared by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control numbers 3245&hyph;0075 (SBA Form 20, National Training Participant Evaluation Questionnaire); 3245&hyph;0090 (SBA Project Officer's Checklist utilized in monitoring the SBDC); 3245&hyph;0091 (SBA Form 641, Request for Counselling Services); 3245&hyph;0108 (SBA Form 1062, Management Assistance Control Record utilized by the counsellor for each client as a running record of counselling activity); 3245&hyph;0123 (SBA Form 888, Management Training Form completed as a summary of a training event); 3245&hyph;0169 (Standard Forms 269 and 272, financial reporting forms completed by the SBDC); 3245&hyph;0183 (SBA Form 1419, counselling evaluation form completed by the client); and 3245&hyph;0221 (SBA Form 1496, utilized in the SBDC on-site review process).

For the reasons set out above, Title 13 of Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1 is proposed to be amended by adding a new Part 130 as follows:
