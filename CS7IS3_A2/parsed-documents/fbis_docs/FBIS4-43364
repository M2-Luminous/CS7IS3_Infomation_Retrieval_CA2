Radical reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy are needed to prevent "economic decline and political instability" in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania -- the six Central East European countries -- it says. The report, resulting from a five-month investigation by the all-party Lords Committee on the European Communities, concludes: "Unless the Community puts agricultural trade on a pan-European footing not only will these countries' efforts to join the Community be frustrated but their very exclusion will jeopardise stability in West Europe." The failure of trade agreements to open up EC markets to greater amounts of agricultural produce from the six had led to "growing disillusionment with the political reform process." The committee found "disturbing patterns" in the working of these agreements which resulted in a balance of trade moving in favour of the EC. In many cases subsidised EC food was competing for sales in the poorer East European markets while the EC was offering very few concessions in return. All this was happening at a time when agriculture represented a key share of national income. "Without the much needed foreign currency that agricultural trade can bring them, their economies will decline," the report says. "Both in Hungary and Poland, the first to begin dismantling their centrally planned economies, the backlash is now evident. Influential farming lobbies, now represented in government, are now demanding more protection: a direct response to the Community's own restrictive policies. Efforts to meet these demands could bankrupt their economies." While the EC had declared a year ago that these countries could join the Community when they satisfied the necessary political and economic conditions, "the trade agreements have not been altered to reflect this new objective," the report says. "There is a dichotomy at Community level between the political desire to enlarge the Community and the resistance of EC agricultural interests to will the means," it says. The Common Agricultural Policy is, it claims, the biggest obstacle to the six joining the EC. The National Farmers' Union said that some sectors of British agriculture would be "alarmed" by the report. While the political arguments were understandable it had to be remembered that the horticulture industry in particular was already suffering heavily from cheaper imports.
