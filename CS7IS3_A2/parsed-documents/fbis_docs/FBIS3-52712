This was stated by Husayn al-Nazir, member of the Fatah Committee in the governorate of Hebron, who resigned yesterday. [Begin al-Nazir recording] In fact, there are several reasons for the resignation. These reasons have accumulated due to the bad or deteriorating internal situation in the Fatah institutions in the past few months. Practically, the absence of a democratic policy in the Fatah institutions has negatively reflected on the situation in the occupied territories, particularly the southern region. This was one of the reasons for the resignation. In addition, there are personalities from outside Fatah. These are bad personalities who hold sensitive posts inside Fatah. We recently learned about the presence of personalities who carried letters entrusting them with forming a security apparatus. This apparatus is one of the most serious Fatah organs, so entrusting a bad personality with running this apparatus will practically destroy Fatah's internal structure in our positions. [end recording] These resignations came after some Fatah activists in the territories also tendered their resignations for the same reason. These collective resignations express the existence of a crisis inside the PLO. Al-Nazir added: [Begin al-Nazir recording] In our opinion, our historic leadership, led by brother leader Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], whom we respect very much, is surrounded by a group of personalities who do not brief him on the true reports sent from the territories. These are the reasons for the rise of traditional personalities who are outside the organization and who are even away from the suffering of the strugglers. These strugglers were always in the confrontation lines. We demand our leadership to return to the PLO Executive Committee, the Fatah Central Committee, the Fatah Revolutionary Council, and the Fatah General Congress, so the future internal arrangements and reforms may, in one way or another, lead to the circumvention of this crisis, and, consequently, decisions will be somewhat sound ones. We would agree if 70 percent of the stands were sound ones. However, we will not agree if only 10 percent of stands are sound ones. In the past, we frequently tried to hold discussions with our leadership to tackle this situation. However, we were surprised that it ignored us or did not pay attention to our demands. We were also surprised by the appointment of political personalities who are outside the organization and who are more preoccupied with the political situation. This has prevented these personalities from coordinating with the territories' leadership and the leadership abroad. We have resigned from our posts and not from our membership or our citizenship. We are citizens and [Fatah] members. However, we refuse to be appointed in sensitive posts under these difficult historical circumstances, whose developments we are far away from. We demand our leadership prepare a clear political program for the new phase. [end recording]
