At a luncheon given in honor of him by Gret Haller, president of the National Council of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland, Qiao said China and Switzerland have a long history of friendly contacts. He said that since diplomatic ties were established between the two countries in 1950, bilateral relations have developed smoothly in the fields of politics, economy, culture, science and technology. Such relations have grown in an all-round way over the past few years, Qiao said. The exchange of visits is on the increase while bilateral trade has jumped and economic and technological cooperation is fruitful. "All these fully show that the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit have broad prospects," Qiao said. He said China will implement a series of important reforms on taxation, finance and foreign trade this year. As China's reform and opening up are going deeper, the economy will become more vigorous and dynamic, he said, adding that this will create more favorable conditions for furthering the all-round friendly cooperation between China and Switzerland. Qiao said China's NPC is willing to deepen the mutual understanding and friendship between the two nations, expand bilateral cooperation and make its due contributions to bringing such relations to a new level. He praised Switzerland, as an eternal neutral country and a residing place of the European organizations of the United Nations, for its unique contributions to promoting international cooperation and safeguarding world peace. In her speech, Haller extended her warm welcome to Qiao, saying that it is her aspiration that the friendly cooperation between the two countries and the two parliaments will be further expanded.
