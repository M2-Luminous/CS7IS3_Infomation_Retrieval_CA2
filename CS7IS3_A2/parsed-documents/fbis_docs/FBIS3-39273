[Deschelotte] The provisional arrangement is not satisfactory, insofar as the threshold of four percent (of the CA [turnover]) for indirect public assistance allowed the United States is generous. This system, which is difficult to control, also makes major financing efforts possible. [LE QUOTIDIEN] What solutions do you envision? [Deschelotte] The European governments must become aware of the need to adapt the financing system to international conditions. Since it is impossible to control the United States, let us adopt their indirect aid system. This type of aid is not necessarily the most efficient economically, but, on the other hand, it is better adapted to the Anglo-Saxon rules of the GATT. And this is no accident, moreover, because it is the Americans who shaped the spirit of the GATT. What is needed is to abandon "vertical" aid and the project by project approach in favor of the horizontal financing of research projects. Another type of aid can be envisioned in the form of purchases by the governments that support us with military or tanker versions of the Airbus. This would enable us to find new outlets and to amortize our production. [LE QUOTIDIEN] What is the state of mind, at present, on one side of the Atlantic and the other? [Deschelotte] The European governments are beginning to become aware of what is at stake. This was urgently needed, because the nefarious effects resulting from the current distortions will not be visible until we are truly lagging behind the Americans.
