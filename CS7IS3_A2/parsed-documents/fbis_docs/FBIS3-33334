The board of directors of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH) decided yesterday to cut the required legal reserve by two points from 36 to 34 percent for commercial banks and from 17 to 15 percent for savings and loans associations. The legal reserve has remained at 36 percent since September 1993, when it was cut from 42 percent. The 42-percent rate was set in July 1993 as part of an economic measure to slow the rise of the lempira. In announcing the new legal reserve, BCH Vice President Daniel Figueroa indicated that the objective was to send a positive message to all productive sectors and thus create a suitable equilibrium between the banking system's active and passive interest rates. The BCH vice president also said that in the medium term banks will increase their short-term interest rates either by increasing their savings rates or by cutting loan rates.
