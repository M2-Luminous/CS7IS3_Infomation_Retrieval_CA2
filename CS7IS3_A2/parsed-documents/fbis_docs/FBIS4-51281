Taking part in the show, which lasts to May 30, are more than 182 textile and garment machinery producers and suppliers from 20 countries and regions, such as Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, China, the United Kingdom and the United States. The exhibitors are showing their high-tech weaving, spinning, knitting, dyeing and printing, sewing, embroidery, pressing, finishing and other relevant machineries. This important exhibition will also provide the customers with the latest information regarding the latest innovation in textile and garment machineries. In his written speech, Indonesian Minister of Industry Tungky Ariwibowo said that this exhibition will be a useful means linking manufacturers and customers for exchanging of information on market and technology. The textile and garment industry has developed rapidly in Indonesia for the last few years, becoming one of the pillars of the country's economy besides oil and gas. The export income from the industry jumped from 4,000 million U.S. dollars in 1991 to 6,000 million U.S. dollars in 1992. With a slight decline, the export earning of textile and garment in 1993 maintained at 5,900 million U.S. dollars. The comparatively weak competitive power of Indonesia's textile products is reportedly the main reason for the drop. Therefore, the textile industry in the country is in urgent need of modernization of equipments, so as to raise productive efficiency and upgrading of products. According to data from the Ministry of Industry, the import volumes of textile and garment machinery in 1990, 1991 and 1992 were 970 million, 1,372 million and 530 million U.S. dollars, respectively, while that for January to October in 1993 period was 450 million dollars. Xu Jinchang, head of the Chinese delegation, which is the biggest one in the exhibition, told XINHUA that China-made textile and garment machineries in the medium level are suitable for the Indonesian market. The Chinese businessmen would like to use this exhibition as an opportunity to make extensive contacts with their Indonesian counterparts and exchange information and experiences with them to promote bilateral cooperation in the field of textile and garment machinery industry.
