FR940419-2-00042 FR940419-2-00033 States, including those currently receiving financial assistance under these programs, may apply under each priority area described below. A separate application, however, must be submitted under each priority area. Only one application per State may be submitted under each priority area. Applications must clearly indicate whether they are being submitted under 1.01A, Temporary Child Care for Children with Disabilities and Chronically Ill Children, or 1.01B, Crisis Nurseries. Purpose: To support States in their efforts to assist private and public agencies in developing two types of services: •In-home or out-of-home temporary non-medical child care (respite care) for children with disabilities and children with chronic or terminal illnesses, including children with AIDS or AIDS-related conditions (priority area 1.01A); and •Crisis nurseries for abused and neglected children, children at risk of abuse and neglect, or children in families receiving protective services (priority area 1.01B). Special attention should be paid in both priority areas to the needs of drug-affected infants. 42 U.S.C. Section 5117a: Temporary Child Care for Children With Disabilities and Chronically Ill Children (Priority Area 1.01A) Background: The Act authorizes temporary child care programs for children with disabilities and requires applicants seeking temporary child care funds to define disabilities using the definition in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act: *␣*␣* The term children with disabilities means children_(A)(i) with mental retardation, hearing impairments including deafness, speech or language impairments, visual impairments including blindness, serious emotional disturbance, orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury, other health impairments, or specific learning disabilities; and (ii) who, by reason thereof, need special education and related services. (B) The term children with disabilities for children aged 3 to 5, inclusive, may at a State's discretion, include children_(i) experiencing developmental delays, as defined by the State and as measured by appropriate diagnostic instruments and procedures, in one or more of the following areas: physical development, cognitive development, communication development, social or emotional development, or adaptive development; and, (ii) who, by reason thereof; need special education and related services *␣*␣* (Public Law 102&hyph;119) The purpose of establishing a temporary child care program (also known as respite care) for children with disabilities or who are chronically or terminally ill is to alleviate social, economic, and financial stress among the families of such children. Such care provides the families or primary caregivers with periods of temporary relief from the pressures of the demanding child care routine, thus preventing severe family stress. The following components may be included in temporary child care or respite care projects: •24-hour services; •Access to primary medical services; •Referral to counseling/therapy services; •Staff training, including child abuse/neglect reporting responsibilities; •Public awareness programs; and •Linkages to other family support and/or family preservation services. 42 U.S.C. Section 5117b: Crisis Nurseries (Priority Area 1.01B) Background: A crisis nursery is defined in section 42 U.S.C. Section 5117c(d) to mean a center providing temporary emergency services and care for children. Crisis nurseries are child care facilities which protect children by providing a safe environment at a time when the chances of neglect or abuse in the home are increased. The programs offer parents the option of ``time out'' as a preventive measure in reducing the incidence of child maltreatment. They are designed to: (1) Develop a safe environment as a resource for children at risk of abuse; (2) deliver non-punitive, non-threatening services as a resource to caregivers of at-risk children; and (3) utilize existing community-based services to further diminish the potential for the maltreatment of children in families experiencing crisis. Services funded under 42 U.S.C. Section 5117b must be provided without fee and may be provided for a maximum of 30 days in any year. Crisis nurseries must also provide referral to support services.
