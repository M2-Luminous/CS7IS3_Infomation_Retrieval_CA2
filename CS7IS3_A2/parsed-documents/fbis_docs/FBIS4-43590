When in April the SKP-Y and the Left Alliance (VL) agreed to cooperate, it was asserted that the SKP's activity was being resumed. At the same time, agreement was reached that the VL would also place communists on its election lists in the next parliamentary election, states SKP-Y Chairman Yrjo Hakanen. According to Hakanen, communists will run in all election districts. Among the communist candidates, some will be members of the VL, some of the SKP-Y, and some unbound. The convention will be held in Helsinki on 26 and 27 November. Summoned to the convention are "all party units and district organizations within the SKP," in a statement released by the SKP-Y. Some of the former minority [hard-line or Stalinist] communists are active within the SKP-Y. The SKP itself has been dissolved as an organization.
