Later on Wednesday the committee is expected to vote on the amendments. Head of the Finance Ministry Henryk Chmielak told newsmen the cabinet was ready to present amendments to the budget law in the first half of the year, but the time would show the direction of changes. "We are open to deputies' suggestions. We declared readiness to come to the parliament with corrections of the budget law in mid- 1994 if the premise on which deputies base a growth of incomes would be more justified and specified. It would be too early today to have any increases," Chmielak said. Chmielak said that the deputies accepted the prime minister's explanation with understanding and added that the coalition would vote for the cabinet version of the budget. Next, Chmielak said possible talks concerning his appointment as finance minister would be held after the return of leader of the Social Democratic Alliance (SLD) Aleksander Kwasniewski from Lillehammer.
