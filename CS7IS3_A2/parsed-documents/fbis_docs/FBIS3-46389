An analysis of related materials shows that the so-called "900 million peasants" refers to the "900 million people" whose domiciles are in the countryside. Since China introduced the reform and opening up policy, however, some peasants have transferred to urban areas. Of the so-called 900 million peasants, only 797 million, namely 88.4 percent of the total, reside in the countryside, while the remaining 105 million have moved to cities and towns. Therefore, China actually has 797 million farmers, of these 523 million work in the countryside and the remaining 274 million are children and elderly people who can no longer work. Of the 523 million working in the countryside, only 420 million engage in farming and the remaining 60 million [figures as published] work in non-agricultural fields.
