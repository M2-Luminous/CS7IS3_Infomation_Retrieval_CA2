There have been reports of fighting around ULIMO's headquarters in Tubmanburg between Mandingos backing Koromah and the Krahns supporting Johnson. We received reports yesterday that Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] was also involved in the battle of Tubmanburg in support of Roosevelt Johnson's Krahn wing of ULIMO, something Charles Taylor himself has strongly denied. Over there the UN called us up to give us their version of events. On the line to Monrovia, Audrey Brown asked General Daniel Opande, chief UN observer in Liberia, whether he could, in fact, confirm that NPFL forces had been involved in the fighting around Tubmanburg. [Begin recording] [Opande] We have no evidence of NPFL having gotten themselves involved in helping a faction of ULIMO to fight another faction. That I can confirm. [Brown] But are you stating this categorically or are you saying that you don't have any information of this? [Opande] Well, the reason why I am saying categorically is because, if it is the fighting that is going on in Tubmanburg, we are deployed in Tubmanburg and we have a clearer picture of what is happening around there and the information we have through our own investigations confirm that there are no other factions from outside that organization who are involved in the fighting. [Brown] So, is the fighting still going on now? [Opande] No, Tubmanburg is very, very quite, you know, today. There was a fighting yesterday, you know, in fact, in the night until a little earlier in the morning. It died down and it has remained completely quiet. Life is returning back to normal and today is even much quieter. [Brown] How many people were killed or injured in this fighting? Was it very serious? [Opande] Well, from the information we have there may have been people injured, there could have been people killed, but we have no evidence of how many were injured and how many were, you know, killed. We don't have any firm information yet. [Brown] Are you not involved in treating people who are injured and clearing away people who have been killed? [Opande] When people are injured sometimes they report to our compound and ask for help. Yesterday none turned up. Our headquarters is very close to the only hospital which is in Tubmanburg. We have gone into the hospital and we have seen no new people who have been injured or any deaths reported there. [Brown] So, what are you doing to prevent more flare up and more fighting amongst ULIMO factions? [Opande] We have been in touch with ULIMO leadership -- both political and military leadership. We are in touch with them nearly every day and we are trying to encourage reconciliation so that there is no more fighting either within themselves or fighting between one faction and another. [Brown] We have information that the Liberia Peace Council [LPC], which is another armed faction in Liberia, has overrun Zwedru in Grand Gedeh County. Have you information of this? [Opande] We have had this information for quite some time now that there is activity between LPC and NPFL around Zwedru. They've been fighting for the control over that particular town and fighting is going on around that area but we have no confirmation that Zwedru has been taken over by LPC. Our information is that there is fighting going on around, you know, that town between NPFL and LPC. [Brown] It does seem that there is altogether too much fighting going on in Liberia where you are supposed to be disarming people. Does this worry you that there is so much fighting still carrying on? [Opande] Definitely, any fighting that is taking place at this time worries us a lot and we have been working right around the clock talking to all the factions and trying to see to it that the fighting is brought to an end. [Brown] They don't appear to be listening to you, is it frustrating thus? [Opande] It is very frustrating but we hope that they will come to their senses and they will stop this unnecessary fighting at this stage. [end recording]
