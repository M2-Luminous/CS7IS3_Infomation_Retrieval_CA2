By forgoing customs duties to the value of $750,000, Russia has thus participated in a joint humanitarian act with the United States. This was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the press and information department of the Russian Foreign Ministry. The Russian diplomat noted that there is some perplexity over claims by some mass media analysts that Russia intends to prevent the passage to Armenia of humanitarian grain in order to put political pressure on Yerevan and Washington.
