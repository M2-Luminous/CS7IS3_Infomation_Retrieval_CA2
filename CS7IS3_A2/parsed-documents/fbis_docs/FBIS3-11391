And It Is"] [Text] Havana -- Gold, that highly coveted mineral which has cost the life of more than one person, also benefits Cuba with its presence in at least five of the country's regions, two of which look like good prospects. The authorities see the new possibility of gold production opening up for Cuba as a means of diversifying national production and at the same time as another source of revenue and another opportunity to trade with foreign investors. According to Jose Casa de Valle, technical director of the Geological-Mining Union of Cuba, the possibilities of producing the valuable metal in Cuba are excellent because he considers it to be highly profitable, especially in the Pinar del Rio region where the mining process has already begun. In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the official said they expect to produce 300 kg in 1994 from the Castellanos deposit in Pinar del Rio, in the western part of the country, and 500 kg per year is expected in the near future. He said a sulfometals [sulfometales] plant there was adapted to obtain gold ingots through mass lixiviation. The final product is 99.999-percent pure gold. From that deposit, he added, 1 to 1.5 grams of gold per ton are extracted, which is the average measure for gold. He said they are conducting gold exploration and exploitation on their own, without foreign investments, at that plant. In the case of polymetals [polimetales], such as lead, zinc, and other minerals, however, we are exploring the Pinar del Rio zone with help from foreign companies, mainly Canadian. When asked about the participation of foreign companies in the exploration and exploitation of minerals in the country, Casa de Valle explained the island is divided into 37 blocks for geological prospecting and more than 20 contracts have already been signed with foreign investors, particularly Canadians, for the random exploration of solid minerals. That is also the case of Delita on the Isle of Youth; El Descanso in Villa Clara, in the central part of the country; Jobabo in eastern Camaguey Province; and Aguas Claras in Holguin. The executive, with 27 years of experience in the field, thinks the deposit at Delita is the most promising because, according to geological studies, it is currently the largest ore deposit in the country. Notwithstanding, gold mining there is complicated because the mineral is mixed with large quantities of arsenic, an undesirable element from every point of view. He said: The exploitation of that deposit is being negotiated with foreign companies, and the research was carried out by Cuban specialists. He explained: We believe that if those investments are made within two or three years, Delita will yield between 2.5 to 3 tons of gold per year. He said the remaining deposits, El Descanso and Melonera, in Villa Clara, are currently in the research phase. They are relatively small but they have a high content of the mineral. He thinks the region is the most promising as far as gold discovery is concerned. Canadian companies are conducting explorations at random there, but there is still no final evaluation. Casa de Valle reiterated that the prospects in that zone are vast because conditions are similar to the deposit in Nevada, United States, and Pueblo Viejo, in the Dominican Republic. In referring to the Aguas Claras mine in eastern Holguin Province, the specialist said negotiations are under way with foreign companies to explore areas around that mine since it is presumed it contains gold. Until recently, and even prior to 1959, molten gold was taken from that region to Pinar del Rio, where it was processed. The reserve ran out some time ago, however, and mining stopped. Speaking about the island's gold prospects, which is so useful in the electronic's industry because it is an excellent electricity conductor and is rustproof, Casa de Valle said mining and processing were highly profitable in Pinar del Rio because investments there had been minimal (between $6 million to $8 million). Delita is also considered profitable despite the complexity of the zone, given its proximity to the sea. It requires an investment of between $40 and $50 million but the gold there could be exploited for at least 20 years. He said that with these prospects, the country will soon become one of Latin America's gold producers, led by Chile, Brazil, and Peru, among other nations.
