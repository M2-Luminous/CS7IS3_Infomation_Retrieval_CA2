This reform covers a wide range of fields and has substantial contents. Practice over the past 15 years has proved that the structural reform of property rights. The remarkable results attained in this reform have played a decisive role in China's entire economic reform and development and are of a great significance to China's establishment of a socialist market economic structure by the end of this century and to bringing about a sustained, stable, and well-coordinated economic development. In view of this, we need to make careful studies and bold explorations to constantly push forward the property rights structural reform in a planned way and step by step. Meanwhile, we should also further emancipate our minds, introduce new concepts, accelerate reforms on both the government and political structures, and pave the way for the establishment of a modern property rights system with Chinese characteristics in line with the market economy of our times. [end editor's note] During the past 15 years of reform and opening up, China has firmly grasped the structural reform of property rights, a key issue in the economic structural reform, and has boldly carried out experiments and explorations, bringing significant changes to the property rights relations. Over the past two years, in particular, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's important remarks made during his trip to southern China and the spirit of both the 14th Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, property rights relations are entering a new historic phase featuring a brand-new system and China has property rights reform. Fundamental Changes Have Taken Place in the Traditional Ownership Pattern and a New Ownership Structure Is Taking Shape Which Mainly Relies on the Economy of Public Ownership and Allows Common Development of Diversified Economic Elements Judging by the proportionate structures of the country's total industrial value and total retail sales volume, the proportion occupied by the output value of state-owned industrial enterprises in the country's total dropped from 77.6 percent in 1978 to 48.3 percent at the end of 1992; while the proportion of collectively run industrial enterprises went up from 22.4 to 38.2 percent. Growing out of nothing, other industrial enterprises, including those which are foreign-invested, individually run, and privately owned, are now enjoying an industrial output value which accounts for 13.5 percent of the country's total. Of the total volume of retail sales, the proportions of the state-owned and collective sectors dropped from 54.6 and 43.3 percent respectively in 1978 to 41.3 and 27.9 percent in 1992, while the proportion of other economic elements went up from 2.1 to 30.8 percent. This shows that the unitary public ownership pattern has been replaced by a multiownership structure which mainly relies on public ownership, under which the proportion of public owned economy is declining while that of the nonpublic owned economies is on a gradual increase. What is more, the development of the nonpublic owned economies has been constantly accelerated: In 1992, the added value of state-owned industries, collective industries, township and town industries, and foreign invested industries went up by 14.4, 28.5, 40, and 48.8 percent respectively over the previous year, showing the fact that the state owned economy is growing at a slower pace than the collective and other economies. By the end of 1992, the total number of nonpublic owned enterprises in Guangdong Province had already reached 1.171 million with a total of 6.343 million employees and a total registered capital of 264.68 billion yuan. Nonpublic owned enterprises now account for 52.4 percent of the total number of enterprises, higher than the total of state owned and collectively run enterprises (31.2 and 16.4 percent), resulting in a development trend featuring coexistence and the common development of economies under diversified ownerships. Enterprise Experiments With the Joint-Stock System Are Undergoing Healthy Development China has strived to create a sound social environment for experiments with the joint-stock system and the past two years have witnessed the biggest and fastest development of China's joint-stock enterprises. As of the end of 1993, there were already more than 13,000 enterprises in all sectors experimenting with the joint-stock system, of which 9,440 were joint-stock enterprises newly established in 1994, registering a 155-percent increase over the previous year. A total of 182 joint-stock companies from over 20 of the country's provinces and regions have been listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, 106 in Shanghai and 76 in Shenzhen (up by 179 and 130 percent respectively over the previous year), with a total stock value (A Share) of about 400 billion yuan. By the end of June last year, China already had over 2,000 companies with specific fundraising targets, 1,700 of which allowed their workers and staff to become stockholders with a total share value amounting to 23.5 billion yuan. The companies with specific fundraising targets in the five provinces and cities of Guangdong, Liaoning, Hubei, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, account for 36.7 percent of the country's total, with a total share value of 19.2 percent of the total. Last year, while actively issuing public shares and continuing to act as experimental units for B Shares for overseas investors, nine economically strong state-owned large enterprises started to raise funds in foreign capital markets. Of the nine, six have listed in Hong Kong's stock exchange issuing H Shares, such as the Shanghai Petrochemical Works and the Qingdao Brewery. Meanwhile, the growth of township and town joint-stock cooperative enterprises is also gaining momentum. There were already 100,000 such enterprises across the country by the end of 1993. In Shanghai, the number of various kinds of township and town joint-stock cooperative enterprises reached 2,993 at the end of 1993 with 115,000 employees. The total share value of these enterprises stood at 1.46 billion yuan, of which shares of united cooperatives totalled 232 million yuan; shares of legal persons, 240 million yuan; and individual shares, 990 million yuan. Over the past two years, these joint-stock enterprises have further standardized their activities to gradually bring themselves in line with normal operation. Introduction of Foreign Funds and Capital Exports Are Under Expansion Statistics show that of the 117 countries and regions around the world which have made investment in China, Hong Kong accounts for the largest proportion, followed by Taiwan and the United States. The year 1993 witnessed the biggest amount of funds China has ever attracted from outside the country. In 1993, the number of newly registered foreign-invested enterprises stood at nearly 85,000, pushing the total number to 167,500 with a total registered capital of $245.63 billion. In the same year, 83,265 new foreign-invested enterprises were set up in China, entailing a total contracted foreign investment of $110.852 billion and an actual foreign investment input of $25.759 billion, up by 70.6, 90.7, and 134 percent respectively over the previous year. By the end of 1993, the accumulated total amount of newly approved foreign-invested enterprises exceeded 173,975 with a total contract foreign investment of $217.216 billion and a total amount of actually used foreign funds of $56.912 billion. The five special economic zones of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan have always been regarded as hot spots for foreign investment. By the end of 1992, the number of foreign-invested projects in these five zones totalled 15,300, with a total contracted foreign investment of $22.5 billion and a total amount of actually used foreign funds of $9.24 billion, accounting for one-sixth, one-fifth, and one-fourth respectively of the country's total. At present, China has 121 national-level development zones in five categories. Of the total, 32 are economic and technological development zones which have effectively developed and utilized 145 square km of land to established over 7,000 foreign-invested enterprises, involving contracted foreign investment of over $14 billion and actually used foreign investment of over $5.5 billion. Projects which entail an investment of $100 billion and above now exceed 100. In the past two years, foreign-invested enterprises have begun to extend from the coastal areas to inland provinces and cities as well as the western part of China. Last year, foreign-invested enterprises in five northwestern provinces and regions totalled about 3,000, over 10 times as many as at the beginning of the previous year, pushing up the proportion in the country's total number of foreign-invested enterprises from 0.6 to 1.6 percent. The five northwestern provinces and regions are also enjoying an increasingly large amount of contract foreign investment, which already exceeds $5 billion. Qinghai Province had only three foreign-invested enterprises in 1991; yet by the end of last year, the province had over 60 foreign-invested enterprises, with a total investment amount of more than $860 billion. Beijing also attained remarkable results in introducing foreign investment last year with 3,752 new foreign-invested enterprises being set up involving a total contract investment of $10.39 billion, up by 170 and 430 percent respectively over the previous year. China's enterprise investment is directed at areas within the country as well as other parts of the world. At present, China is the largest recipient of direct foreign investment and commercial loans on the one hand, and the largest investment exporter among developing countries on the other. By the end of last year, China had invested a total of $5.16 billion in 4,497 enterprises in over 120 countries and regions, of which 2,927 were trading enterprises and 1,570 nontrading enterprises. Fujian Province has been actively engaged in transnational cooperative operation. By the end of last year, the province had set up more than 190 enterprises in over 30 countries and regions, including North America, Europe, Hong Kong, Macao, and Japan. Of the total investment of $675.43 billion in the province, investment made by the Chinese side reached $356.224 billion, accounting for 52 percent of total investment. Last year, the province received 80 applications for establishment of enterprises in overseas areas and approval has already been granted to 40 of them. Operational Patterns of "State-Owned and People-Run" or "Public- Owned and Private-Run" Enterprises Are Being Adopted By State-Owned Small Enterprises in an Overall Way In the past two years, experiments with new operational patterns of "state-owned and people-run" or "public-owned and private-run" enterprises, which mainly feature means of lease and sales, have become a major reform item in state-owned commercial sectors, supply and marketing cooperatives, and grain administrations across the country. Enterprises which are "owned by the state and run by people" occupy a considerable proportion in provinces as well as prefectures, cities, and counties in northeastern, northern, northwestern, eastern, central, and southern parts of China. At present, many provinces and municipalities have attained remarkable results in the reform of "public-owned and private-run" enterprises, including Beijing, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hubei, Guangdong, and Fujian. Nanjing City has put into practice the operational pattern of "public ownership and private management" in 35 percent of its small stores which have an annual sales volume of less than 2 million yuan; as a result, 80 percent of them have made up deficits and increased profits and the profits and taxes submitted by some of them are up by as much as 800 percent. Moreover, most of the staff in these stores have seen a 100 to 200 percent increase in their salaries. This shows that we need to sum up good experiences, give correct guidance, and continue to expand experiments in this field. Markets For Property Rights Exchanges Are Being Set Up In Turn and State-Owned Enterprises Have Taken an Important Step in Putting "Transformed Enterprises [bian xing 6239 1840]" Up For Auction and in "Grafting" State-Owned Enterprises Onto Their Foreign-Invested Counterparts At present, markets for property rights exchanges of differing scales have been set up in over 20 cities and prefectures in many 10 provinces, including Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Changchun, Shenyang, Dalian, Wuhan, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Nanning, Kunming, Wuxi, and Lanzhou. Henan Province has established more than 20 markets for property rights exchanges and readjustments of idle assets. With more then 400 full- and part-time technical personnel specializing in property rights exchanges, these markets are enjoying increasingly brisker business and have produced a positive impact on society. By the end of last October, Jilin Province had put 436 enterprises up for auction and attracted 35 million yuan (including mergers) from outside the province through property rights exchange markets. To date, Mudanjiang City has sold by auction 10 enterprises to South Korea, Hong Kong, and people from outside the country, retrieving a total of 57.52 million yuan. Last September, Hunan Province held a property rights exchange fair at which 220 enterprises were put up for public auction. In the end, 16 enterprises were sold for a total of 63.7 million yuan, while five were leased for 2.901 million yuan. For example, a Hong Kong company purchased the Yueyang Chemical Fiber Factory, which had long suffered operational losses, for 2 million yuan while an individual businessman purchased one floor of the Yiyang Building for 1.2 million yuan. Most of those who have bought or taken leases on these enterprises are businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan as well as domestic private entrepreneurs. Over recent years, China has also conducted the reform of transforming state-owned enterprises into collectives through mergers and other forms. By the end of 1992, 34 collective enterprises in Sichuan Province had merged 67 state-owned enterprises. Recently, the Shanghai Hailian Lubrication Material Research Institute, a small state-owned enterprise, was reorganized into a people-run collective enterprise under the joint- stock cooperative system. At the same time, fruitful efforts have also been made in "grafting" enterprises with foreign investment. In Wuxi City, more than half (170 enterprises) the large and medium enterprises have recently "grafted" themselves using foreign investment. Quanzhou City in Fujian "grafted" all its state-owned enterprises (41 enterprises) with foreign investment during the first quarter of last year, putting into practice a cooperative system in these enterprises. Growing At a Fast Pace, Individual and Private Economies Have Become Active Forces in China's Economic Development At present, 28 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities listed as independent units in the state plans have drawn up policies and measures for the promotion of individual and private economic development. Moreover, all localities have gradually standardized their management over individual and private enterprises, thus bringing about healthy development in the individual and private economies. The present period is marked by the fastest development of private enterprises since registration and a new situation has been opened up wherein, for the first time ever, no provinces are plagued by declining or sluggish growth. Currently, the industrial output value, the total volume of retail sales, and the industrial and commercial taxes of privately run enterprises make up 4.1, 18.1, and 7.8 percent respectively of the country's total. The industrial structure of the private economy tends to be more rational. The proportion of privately run enterprises engaged in tertiary industries has reached 57.4 percent, of which privately run scientific and technological consultation enterprises are enjoying the fastest development. At present, the number of privately run scientific and technological consultation enterprises has reached 3,871, registering a 220-percent increase over the previous year, while the number of private export-oriented enterprises which earn foreign exchange through exports totalled 1,996, with a total amount of 1.58 billion yuan equivalent in foreign exchange. Last year, 98,286 new private enterprises were set up across the country and, by the end of last year, the number of private enterprises across the country had reached 23.18 million, with 3.726 million employees [figures as published]. The total registered capital of these enterprises stood at 68.05 billion yuan and the registered capital per enterprise rose from 159,000 in 1992 to 286,000 yuan, a 79.9-percent increase. In 1993, taxes submitted by privately run enterprises (including individual industrial and commercial businesses) exceeded 29 billion yuan, an increase of over 43 percent compared to the previous year. Guangzhou now ranks first in the country regarding the number of privately run enterprises, totaling 48,500 by 1993 since 1988. These enterprises have a total of 642,000 employees and a total registered capital of 18.29 billion yuan. Over 100 percent growth has also been registered in other places, including Beijing, Hainan, Anhui, Heilongjiang, Shanghai, Hubei, Xinjiang, and Jinagsu. Individual industrial and commercial sectors have also undergone rapid development. By the end of September 1993, China had 17.67 million individual industrial and commercial businesses, with a total registered capital of 85.48 billion yuan and 29.39 million persons engaged. Meanwhile, China's nongovernment-run scientific and technological enterprises have also displayed their great vigor. According to incomplete statistics, the number of nongovernmental scientific and technological enterprises had exceeded 50,000 by the end of 1993, employing 800,000 people, and their total revenue from technological transformation, industrial production, and trade amounted to 25 billion yuan. Continued Progress Has Been Attained in Enterprise Merger and Bankruptcy and Both the Industrial and Organizational Structures of Enterprises Further Rationalized 1. Benefiting from an early start, enterprise mergers are enjoying a smooth progress. According to statistics for the 1980's, 6,226 enterprises absorbed through merger a total of 6,906 other enterprises in 25 provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions as well as 13 independent cities in the state plan; as a result, the transferred stock assets totalled 8.25 billion yuan and 4,095 loss- making enterprises were closed down, thus avoiding a further loss of 522 million yuan. The past two years have seen more noticeable results in enterprise mergers. By the beginning of last year, as many as 10,000 enterprises had been merged, reducing the number of loss-making enterprises by a large margin and activating a great amount of tied-up capital. As of the first half of 1992, 2,288 enterprises had been merged in Sichuan Province, accounting for 1.4 [as published] of the country's total. According to a survey conducted last April in 16 cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Shenzhen, over 2,900 enterprises had been merged; as a result, the transferred stock assets rights amounted to about 6 billion yuan and more than 400,000 workers and staff were resettled. 2. Enterprise groups and enterprises are undergoing continued development. By the end of 1993, there were over 1 million groups and companies (centers) across the country, 552,000 more than the previous year, an increase of 113 percent. Both the number of employees and the amount of registered capital also went up by 42.6 and 92 percent respectively over the previous year. Guangdong has the largest number of companies, totalling 114,000; while Beijing, Shanghai, and Zhejiang have seen the fastest growth in the number of companies, which stood at 179, 170, and 168 percent respectively. Of the 55 large enterprise groups selected as experimental units by the state, 26 have been listed as independent units in the state plan, 18 have set up subsidiary financial companies, and 34 have been granted examination and approval autonomy on foreign-related projects. Meanwhile, readjustments have been made to the management structure and the operational mechanism of over 1,600 enterprise groups, of which 431 have taken initial shape, thus optimizing the personnel, assets, and organizational structures of these enterprises. 3. A number of enterprises have been eliminated through market competition and have declared bankruptcy according to the law. From the promulgation of the "Bankruptcy Law" in 1988 till the first half of 1993, 356 enterprises went into liquidation according to the law as a result of poor management and long- standing financial losses, of which 88 were owned by the state and 268 by collectives or other sectors. Shenyang was the first city in the country to introduce bankruptcy. On 3 December 1986, the Shenyang City Government declared the bankruptcy of a small crackproof materials factory in Shenyang, the first bankrupt enterprise ever in mainland China. As of the end of 1992, 28 insolvent enterprises in Shenyang had gone broke (two of which were enterprises under public ownership). Of the 8,591 workers and staff involved, 4,294 were given new jobs following the transfer of enterprise assets and 121 lived on pension while awaiting employment. Total external debts of 75.4 million yuan were paid off, thus bringing life and economic efficiency back to 11.1 million yuan worth of fixed assets as well as sites covering a total area of over 12,000 square meters [figures as published]. With 2,914 workers and staff, and 1,200 sets of equipment of various kinds, the Chongqing Knitting Mill, which covers a total ground area of over 11,000 square meters, has an annual production capacity of 16 million knitted pieces and 8 million tonne of processed chemical fiber. However, due to its poor management, long-standing debts, and insolvency, the factory had no alternative but to submit an application for bankruptcy to the court on 8 June 1992. On 3 November 1992, the Chongqing City Intermediate Court handed down the ruling, upon which the Chongqing Knitting Mill was declared bankrupt. Because it is the first time a large state-owned industrial enterprise has ever gone broke in the country, the event has sent shock waves through the entire society and has become the focus of attention of all sides. In the end, through the technical work on all sides, proper arrangements were made on the issue. Rural Enterprises Under the Joint-Stock Cooperative System Have Become Another Creation By the Masses of Peasants Statistics show that the output value created by 112 million workers and staff of township and town enterprises across the country reached 2.9 trillion yuan, up by 60 percent over the previous year and accounting for 45 percent of the country's total purchase volume of export commodities produced by foreign-invested businesses. By the end of 1993, the number of rural joint-stock cooperative enterprises had soared to 2.08 million, accounting for 10 percent of China's total number of township and town enterprises. Last year, leaders of over 20 provinces and municipalities, including Beijing, Henan, Sichuan, and Anhui, all stressed the need to regard the establishment of joint-stock cooperative enterprises as a key issue in the future efforts to deepen rural reform. They also urged all rural enterprises, newly established or transformed, to try hard to turn themselves into joint-stock cooperative enterprises. At present, Henan Province has more than 15,000 newly established or transformed joint-stock cooperative enterprises. In the rural areas of Shandong Province, in order to expand their business scale and enhance economic efficiency, some owners of individual and private businesses have introduced the joint-stock cooperative operation by converting factory buildings, capital, technologies, and equipment into shares. As one of the birthplaces of China's rural joint-stock cooperative economy, Zhejiang Province has been enjoying a strong development momentum for all these years. As of last August, there were as many as over 60,000 rural joint-stock cooperative enterprises across the province, of which 50,000 had evolved from individual and private businesses, 800 transformed from rural collective enterprises, and 10,000 engaged in other economic fields. Wenzhou City, a well-known experimental field for China's reforms, has seen an even faster growth of enterprises under the joint-stock cooperative system. By the end of last September, the number of joint-stock cooperative enterprises in the city went up dramatically from 24,000 in the previous year to more than 34,000, of which 21,000 were joint-stock industrial enterprises with a total output value of 12 billion yuan and accounting for 50 percent of the city's total industrial output value. Taxes submitted by joint- stock cooperative enterprises amounted to over 500 million yuan, making up 45 percent of the city's total financial revenue. Today, the joint-stock cooperative economy and individual and private economies account for 70 percent of Wenzhou's national economy; therefore, they are regarded as the foundation of Wenzhou's market economy. At present, reforms on the housing and land use systems are being carried out in depth and real estate management is being gradually brought onto the right track. Remarkable results have been registered in the appraisal of fixed assets and circulating funds, aimed at serving the structural reform of property rights. Experiments in reforms on the management system and administrative structure of state-owned assets have attained further progress and laws and regulations favorable to the property rights structural reform are being constantly reinforced.
