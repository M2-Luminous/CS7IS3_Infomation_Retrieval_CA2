A strengthening of the Finnish economy is mentioned as an advantage of EU membership, while the adaptation of farming is regarded as a disadvantage. [passage omitted] Only now is a special working group going to start drafting a detailed study on the effects of the EU settlement on Finnish farming. [passage omitted] The other studies published today see the advantages of Finnish EU membership as greater than the disadvantages, which is probably no great surprise. The advantages mentioned are an increase in investments, participation in the EU's joint trade policy and other decisionmaking processes, and a strengthening of the foreign and security policy. But the latter is also linked with great problems, in addition to farming, depending on whether Europe is moving toward integration or division and on what Russia's position in Europe will be. With EU membership, Finland would say farewell to the policy of neutrality. According to a study commissioned by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, as a member of the EU, Finland could not pursue the policy of neutrality as it did in earlier years. According to the same study carried out by the Foreign Policy Institute, outside the EU, the only alternative remaining for Finland would be a policy of neutrality, whose pursuit, however, would be more difficult than in the Cold War era. The study stresses that as a member of the EU, Finland could expect support for the security policy and solidarity from the other member countries.
