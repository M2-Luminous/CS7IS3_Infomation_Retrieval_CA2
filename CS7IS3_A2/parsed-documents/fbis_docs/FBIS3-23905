Chugunov: "Unemployment Will Grow"] [Text] A rapid increase in unemployment is reported by the oblast committee on labor after analyzing last year's figures. For the oblast as a whole, unemployment increased by a factor of more than 1.5 as compared with 1992. The oblast's eighteen employment offices registered a total of 27,400 unemployed during the year. In January, as compared with December, the number almost doubled. As for the rayons specifically, the ones that proved to be in the most alarming situation were the most industrially developed ones. In Podporozhskiy Rayon the unemployment level passed the 10-percent mark, reaching 11.5 percent; in Tikhvinskiy Rayon it came to 6.6 percent; in Kirishskiy Rayon, 5 percent; and in Priozerskiy Rayon, almost 4 percent. The rayons that proved to be in the best situation in this regard were Luzhskoy Rayon, where 473 unemployed were registered; and Lodeynopolskiy Rayon, 553. Last year almost 25,000 unemployed received unemployment benefits throughout the entire period and were unable to find suitable work. A total of 480 persons took the risk and underwent training or retraining in areas suggested by the employment service, thus increasing their competitive capability in the job market. But, unfortunately, it must be admitted that currently there are few people like this, who are capable of adapting to the new conditions and want to do so. A very large number of people do not want to change their occupation, even if the employment service pays for their retraining and gives them a stipend during the entire training period. Among the reasons for being unemployed, the predominant one is "personal reasons," 44 persons. Only 24 percent are people who were laid off from enterprises or organizations as a result of reduction in forces, reorganization, or the elimination of the enterprise. Sixty-two percent of the unemployed in the oblast are women,and in Luzhskoy and Tosnenskiy rayons and in Sosnovyy Bor, the figure is as high as 90 percent. As for age, almost every third unemployed person is a young person between the age of 16 and 30 years. With regard to social makeup, the predominant group is people with working occupations (as many as 66 percent), and only 34 percent are white-collar workers. In 1994 it is expected that the number of unemployed will increase in most of the rayons in the oblast. And, for the labor market as a whole, there may prove to be 37,000-57,000 persons seeking work. [Editorial note] At the same time the city's labor and employment committee reports that, during the first month of 1994 (from 1 January through 4 February), 26,509 persons applied to the rayon offices in St. Petersburg, with 10,784 doing so in order to find a job. Only 1640 persons were deemed to be unemployed. But, since the beginning of the year, jobs were found for 3224 persons.
