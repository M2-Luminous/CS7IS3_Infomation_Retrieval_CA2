What might the substance of this greater role be? We know that Italy is making at least two demands. The first is that our country be considered for one of the permanent seats when the reform of the UN Security Council comes under discussion. In view of our current international image, it is unfortunately likely that this demand will remain no more than a pious wish. However, there seem to be better hopes for the other demand, namely, that Italy participate in the special "contact group" established by the major powers, which is supposed to find a solution to the Bosnian conflict and which is meeting in Switzerland. But here too there are some reservations to be noted. It is certainly illogical that our country is not a member of that group, in view of our proximity, our interests in the area in question, and also the fact that the NATO aircraft deployed in operations there take off from Italian bases. So there may be good reasons for supporting the Italian Government's viewpoint, especially since there is now plenty of talk about using Italian troops as "blue helmets" in that theater of war. Hitherto the United Nations rejected this possibility for two reasons. The first was that, in the case of Italy and the former Yugoslavia, the two countries shared a border. However, two new states -- Slovenia and Croatia -- have now occupied the space between us and Bosnia, so at least on paper this reason against an Italian presence on the battle front seems no longer to exist. However, there remains the other, and more compelling, reason against deploying Italian blue helmets. Italy was one of the occupiers during the last war, so that unfavorable opinions among the local populations might act against it. However, the United Nations desperately needs not only troops but also men to carry out its peace mission. This is why, in the interview that he granted us a while ago, Secretary General Butrus- Ghali said: "Of course, in those territories there could be dangers to the Italian troops stemming from the past, as, for that matter, would be the case with the Turks, but the greatest danger that we have to face now is that we have insufficient UN forces." However, recently other factors have emerged that could jeopardize any Italian policy directed toward our disputatious neighbors to the east. Is it conceivable that Italian troops could take part in the peace mission in the former Yugoslavia when there are people in our country who want to challenge the territorial order that was one of the painful consequences of the war that we lost? Fortunately Minister Martino made a point of stressing that, despite the intention to reconsider some aspects of the implementation of existing agreements, there is no intention on Italy's part of revising existing borders. The fact remains that those who are talking about a revision of borders occupy prominent positions within a movement that now has representatives in the government itself. It is they who are jeopardizing our initiatives in the international field. The man who allowed himself to get so carried away as to talk about the "Italian-ness" not only of Istria and Fiume [Rijeka] but also of Dalmatia is the sanguine Deputy Tremaglia, who holds the chairmanship of the e Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, albeit by a single vote. So even within the majority there are those who are undermining the foreign minister's comforting reassurances. This is in fact the problem which, though it mainly concerns the Balkan issue, obstructs the greater role that the foreign minister is demanding for our country. It is unnecessary to recall the climate of exacerbated nationalism into which the entire Balkan world could plunge. It may be that the Yugoslav tragedy is just the first chapter in a process that threatens to spread to other lands and that the countries with a greater sense of responsibility, including Italy, should strive to halt, first and foremost by avoiding any kind of demonstration that could inflame people's feelings. Those acquainted with the opposite shore of the Adriatic know that it is always necessary to draw a distinction. Italy's influence was strong even in the immediate postwar years, which were marked by sharp political disputes. At that time, not only the literature and movies of the new Italy, but also its songs and products as a whole held a prevalent position. It is tempting to say that our culture caused people to forget the sad times of war and the occupation and that a kind of victory was won over adverse events. But all it took was a few demonstrations by some politically insignificant groups displaying revanchist intentions to prompt sharp accusations against Italy and the Italian people. It is as though we were witnessing a conditioned reflex response having the power to unite everyone, irrespective of their differences. This was confirmed a few days ago when the Croatian leader, Tudjman, took advantage of a few remarks by some Italian figures to express heated opinions in public in excessive and furious language. Minister Martino is right to consider it unacceptable that Italy is absent from a forum in which the future of a region so closely bound to us is discussed. But he must guard against those who are in practice sabotaging his efforts to gain credibility. Only if he does so can he gain more credibility and be better heeded.
