President Leonid Kravchuk, who spoke first, proposed the appointment of a Constitutional Court that would issue a ruling on the Crimean Supreme Soviet's last law. Kravchuk pointed out that he himself does not have the right to rescind the Crimean parliament's decision, that he has such a prerogative only with respect to decrees issued by Yuriy Meshkov. At the same time, he emphasized that "Russia will never give up its influence in the Crimea, just as the Russian population, which makes up a majority on the peninsula, will never give up close relations with Russia." "We realize," the president continued, "that Russia has no realistic alternatives to basing the Black Sea Fleet and must secure its southern borders. We must divide basing zones between the Ukrainian and Russian fleets, establish temporary leasing terms, and at the same time uphold the principle that the Russian Fleet must eventually be based on its own territory." National-democratic deputies, without bothering to analyze the factors that have led to the current situation in the Crimea, blamed everything on Russia. They demanded that the Crimean knot be cut in the following way: make power-wielding structures subordinate to Kiev and remove the Black Sea Fleet from Ukrainian territory by January 1, 1995. Deputies representing the Ukrainian National Assembly-UNSO [Ukrainian People's Self-Defense Forces] demanded that the Crimean Supreme Soviet be dissolved immediately and that additional troops be sent there to "protect the population from extremists. Although, we should point out, leftist deputies reminded the "loggers" (as one deputy referred to his more zealous colleagues) that at stake is the fate of thousands of people, and that politicians just don't go swinging axes. Deputy Mikhail Doroshevskiy stressed that he knows of plans for a forcible change of power in Crimea, as he had seen documents in the working presidium confirming this. Many deputies believe that some of the causes of the current flare-up of tension in and around Crimea are the imposition of ideological stereotypes of a nationalist slant, a self-isolationist policy on the part of the Ukrainian leadership, and ill-considered decisions on borders that have divided the Slavic peoples. A decision which was adopted states that it is essential to submit proposals on bringing current Crimean legislation into conformity with the Ukrainian Constitution within two weeks. The Crimean Supreme Soviet is ordered to adopt a decision to the effect that Crimean legislation must conform to the Ukrainian Constitution within 30 days. Leonid Kravchuk is instructed to propose a list of actions he will take to normalize the situation in Crimea within six days. A Ukrainian parliamentary delegation led by Boris Oleynik left for Crimea on Thursday morning. That same day, as was to be expected, Leonid Kravchuk proposed that parliament postpone the presidential election to a later date. The situation with respect to dividing the Black Sea is developing in an interesting way, in our opinion. At a press conference in Kiev on Wednesday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskiy said that where the Ukrainian Navy will be based is Ukraine's internal affair and is not subject to discussion. The Crimean problem, he said, should be solved through dialogue. "We are taking Russia's interests into account with respect to its southern flank, but it is not taking our interests into account and allowing itself to engage in unilateral pressure," the minister said. Meanwhile, negotiations on dividing the Black Sea Fleet are under way in Sevastopol, albeit behind closed doors and in the absence of the delegation chiefs--Russian Special Ambassador Yuriy Dubinin and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmirov. This has significantly lowered the talks' level, but it is a logical move: The military experts are at work. But we have learned from a well-informed source of an agreement to divide the ships 50-50, after which Ukraine would sell an agreed-upon number of ships to Russia.
