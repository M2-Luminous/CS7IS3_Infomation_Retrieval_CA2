The centre's headquarters is located in Shanghai with its trading business already connected with those in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Chengdu and Xiamen and by the end of June this year, such business will expand to 18 main cities in the country. The centre is a non-profit-making organ, practicing a membership system with its members coming from banks entitled to do foreign exchange business, some non-bank financial institutions and some foreign- funded banks. They can make their deals both at the Shanghai centre and at other cities' exchanges. Its trading at present is only available for U.S. dollars and HK [Hong Kong] dollars and its opening hours are from 9:00 to 11:00 am from Monday to Friday each week. The People's Bank of China will, when necessary, intervene in the foreign exchange market in order to regulate the supply and demand of such currencies and push down trading prices. In the first three days after the centre went into operation, trading prices saw little fluctuation and the trading business there was booming. On April 6, trading of U.S. dollars against renminbi was basically kept at between 8.69 and 8.70 with the daily total transaction value put at over U.S.$100 million while trading between the HK dollar and the renminbi was maintained at between 1.12 and 1.3 with a daily total transaction value of HK$10.35 million.
