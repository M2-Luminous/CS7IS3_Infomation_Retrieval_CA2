Yesterday, however, a "source close to the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR]" contacted SEGODNYA to say that "the NKR Foreign Ministry learned about the Moscow agreement from the papers." "NKR representative Bako Saakyan," who took part in the negotiations at the Russian Federation Defense Ministry on 18 February, indeed is an officer of the NKR Defense Ministry but, according to Stepanakert, "he is in Moscow for medical treatment and has no official powers from NKR official bodies to act as a representative of Nagorno-Karabakh or sign anything on behalf of the NKR government." Therefore, from the viewpoint of the NKR leadership, the agreement signed in Moscow has no binding legal force. This, as far as can be understood, does not mean that the NKR Defense Army is going to breach the relative cease-fire that has developed de facto in the last few days (from the lessening of hostilities to separate shoot-outs) on the Karabakh fronts. The NKR leadership has not planned any major offensive operations because the positions currently held by Armenian detachments generally suit Stepanakert. As for the terms of the three-stage plan, "On the Cease-fire in Nagorno-Karabakh and on the Border Between Armenia and Azerbaijan," proposed by Russia and partially coordinated last week in Moscow, they obviously do not please Stepanakert.
