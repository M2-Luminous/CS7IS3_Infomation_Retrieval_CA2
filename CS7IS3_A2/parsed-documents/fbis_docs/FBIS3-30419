The declaration is an important step toward mutual recognition of the two sovereign countries, and also paves the way for reaching a political solution and for unconditional re-integration of the UN-protected areas into the Republic of Croatia. The declaration will contribute toward normalizing relations between the two states and toward general stability in the whole of southeast Europe. An important step on the way is explicit recognition of all the states in their legitimate international borders. The Chamber of Deputies called on Bosnian Muslims to unconditionally and promptly halt attacks on Croat-populated areas, in particular in central Bosnia. If they fail to do so, the chamber believes that the government and the president of the republic should examine the current state of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The deputies most strongly condemn all crimes and acts which are in breach of international law on warfare and humanitarian issues, and call on the president and government to do their utmost in the diplomatic, political, humanitarian and all other fields to guarantee the survival and normal life of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. All sides in the conflict were called upon to persist in their efforts to end the war through negotiation and political means and to reach a just and lasting solution acceptable to all three peoples.
