Democrats counting on centrist Vasiliy Durdinets lost the election of speaker by just a couple of points. History teaches us that its lessons are never learned... We will not take it upon ourselves to pass judgment on the state of memory in other countries, but, for us who live in Ukraine, memory is quite short. It is as though the four years separating us from the May days of 1990 did not transpire. Why such a historical digression? Well, the events of 18 May of this year in the Ukrainian parliament are painfully reminiscent of that scenario. True, four years ago everything was decided beforehand. The "leading and guiding" party resolved at its plenum to elect Vladimir Ivashko, first secretary of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party, as chairman of the Supreme Council of the Ukrainian SSR. Though reduced at that time basically to a declaration of political pluralism, the nomination of aspirants from our young democracy to this position was still of some use to society. For the first time, a call to reject hegemonism and refrain from electing yet another party leader as speaker resounded under the arches of the parliament. A neutral, centrist figure could bring accord to society. But the Communist majority in the hall shouted and stamped, listening to itself and deciding things its own way. How did it all wind up? In August of 1991. It is a blessing that Ukraine managed to avoid more serious upheaval. A similar situation was observed last Wednesday--with the one difference that almost all those seeking the position of Supreme Council chairman declared their centrist orientation. But when the time came for former First Deputy Speaker Vasiliy Durdinets and leader of the Socialists Oleksandr Moroz to present their programs, it became clear that it was between them that the fight for the post of chairman would ensue. The former, not formally connected with party factions in the parliament, appeared to be the most centrist figure among the contenders. While the leftist portion of the parliament immediately sided with the latter. The Communists also resolved at their plenum to support Moroz--the chairman of the Political Council of the Socialist Party. A promising unification of leftist forces, correct? The uninterrupted string of conferences of deputy groups and factions only served to add the finishing touches. On behalf of future accord and rejecting party ambitions, the leaders of Rukh [Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka] and the Democratic Party, Vyacheslav Chornovil and Vladimir Yavorivskyy, withdrew their candidacies. Mikhail Pavlovskyy, representative of the Republicans, followed their example. Just a little more, it would seem, and good judgment would fall upon the hall of parliament. Just a bit more, and Ukraine would get its first nonparty speaker. But loyal to Bolshevist traditions, the Communists, Socialists, and like-minded people were not about to begin acting on principle--the interests of the party above all else! Yuriy Tima and Oleksandr Karpov, the deputy from Kharkov, decided they too would stay the course along with Oleksandr Moroz and Vasiliy Durdinets. But Tima and Karpov were just extras. Discussion of the four candidacies turned into a sham. Now and again there resounded in the hall fiery appeals to the leader of the Socialists--"remain loyal to your banner," "maintain conviction in the rightness of the cause," "loyalty to the charted course." Then the uninterrupted ovations. How familiar it all was! Too late, all too late did Vyacheslav Chornovil suddenly remember, perceiving the malevolent ruse in formation of the list of speakers, drawn up contrary to regulations not by the Rada system, but in the secretariat of the parliament. The result of the secret voting was predetermined. Oleksandr Moroz was elected chairman of the Supreme Council, receiving 171 votes--169 were necessary. It still remains for Ukraine to interpret what took place in the parliament last Wednesday. Triumph for some, frustration for others. So it would seem once again that accord was just an alluring apparition to our legislators. But what exactly took place? Figures of familiar hue will continue to rule us. It would be naive at the very least to perceive the Ukrainian socialists as true centrists. This is not France, Sweden, or Austria... We do not doubt the wisdom of politician Oleksandr Moroz, or his desire to introduce accord both in society and in the parliament. But will he be successful? Or will he slide over to the leftmost fringe of politics, assisted by his friends and comrades-in-arms in the Communist and Socialist Parties? This is what is alarming. In addition to everything else, the election of the speaker has revealed a noticeable striving on the part of a significant portion of our legislators to begin once again to build a bright Communist future. This time--in an as yet independent Ukraine. But if this does not turn out--and there are such feelings in the parliament--we can again move to the Union. Of course, today is not 1990. A great deal will depend on the actions of the Democrats. Will they join the structures of authority, or will they be forced to form a distant opposition? In the first case, they run the risk of turning into hostages of that same old system; and, in the second--of being regarded as a destructive force. One thing is clear--that the time has not yet arrived for true reformers in Ukraine. The coming presidential elections will change little here. That scenario is akin to the parliamentary one. The roles were assigned long, long ago. But now the fate of independent and democratic Ukraine--is not clear... The day of 19 May began in the parliament with consultations and discussions in deputy groups and factions of the possible nominations for deputy chairmanship of the Supreme Council and the chairmanships of committees and commissions.
