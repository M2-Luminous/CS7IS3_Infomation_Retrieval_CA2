According to the source, after the situation of the Colombians was studied, they were freed because there was not enough evidence against them. Nevertheless, the two Colombians, whose names we omit because of the principle of presumption of innocence, are prohibited from leaving the country. These individuals told the Assistant Prosecutor's Office they were in Panama to buy automobiles. On Thursday, the vehicle Schwartz was driving exploded and burned on Via Italia in the Paitilla neighborhood as a result of the explosion of a grenade connected to the front wheels of the vehicle. Schwartz suffered minor injuries to his arms and feet. The Colombians were linked to the attack after an anonymous call reported their alleged participation in the incident. According to the source, the investigations have taken a new turn after data was gathered on the professionalism needed to place the grenade and the high cost of this type of work.
