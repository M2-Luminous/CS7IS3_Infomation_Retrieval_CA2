Jean Pierre Ngambi, secretary general of the Communist Party of Cameroon, said on March 24 when he met the Korean ambassador that the anti-socialist campaign of the United States must be stopped, condemning the United States for totally reversing the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and leading the situation to the brink of a war. Expressing the belief that the Korean people, firmly united behind His Excellency Kim Chong-il, supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, will win victory in confrontation with the enemy under his wise guidance, the secretary general stressed that the Communist Party of Cameroon would always support the Workers' Party of Korea in its struggle for realising the socialist cause and the reunification of the country.

He appealed to all the people who love justice and peace to wage a powerful solidarity movement for supporting the Korean people in their struggle to defend socialism centering on the popular masses. A meeting of the presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Federal Communist Party of Russia in a statement on March 25 extended full support and solidarity to the struggle of the heroic Korean people united as firm as a rock around the Workers' Party of Korea.
