The Bank of Korea has revised foreign currency loan-related regulations in such a way as to expand foreign currency loans to enterprises in a bid to promote corporate facility investment and to lessen companies' financial burden, it said yesterday. Under the revised regulations, the ratio of foreign currency loans extended to businesses has been raised. The foreign currency ratio for large-sized manufacturers which import facility equipment will be raised from 80 percent of import prices to 90 percent and for small-sized companies, from 90 to 100 percent. The comparable ratio for enterprises which seek direct investment abroad will also be raised by 10 percentage points to 70 percent of the invested fund for large companies and by 10 percentage points to 80 percent for small companies. Along with this, a maximum maturity for foreign currency loans will be extended from the current eight years to 10 years, considering long-term fund demands such as importers of plants or airplanes, the central bank said. The central bank also abolished regulation requiring domestic businesses to acquire prior recommendation from the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Energy when they import facility equipment from Japan. In the past, the recommendation system was introduced to curb excessive imports of various facility equipment, including machinery. The central bank also allowed foreign currency-dealing banks to have a free hand in determining grace periods and repayment methods of foreign currency loans raised by themselves. Meanwhile, the central bank plans to provide $3 billion out of its foreign reserve holdings to foreign currency banks in the first half of the year. Now, the central bank is offering foreign currency funds at Libor (London Inter-Bank Offered Rate) to foreign currency banks which in turn loan the funds to enterprises at an annual rate of 0.5-1.0 percent above Libor.
