Dlouhy: Guarantees Are a Matter for the Banks and the Insurance Companies"] [Text] Prague--Representatives of the major manufacturers agreed on yesterday's Debata [Debate] television program that large industrial projects cannot be implemented without state guarantees. Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said in response to this that commercial projects cannot be guaranteed by the state but, rather, on the basis of guarantee and insurance companies such as EGAP [Enterprise Guarantee and Insurance Program] or by the banks. Skoda Plzen Director General Lubomir Soudek referred to the small number of Czech banks that are actually recognized throughout the world as guarantors. Dlouhy described the absence of bankruptcies as a negative influence on the Czech Republic's economy. He added, however, that certain structural changes are taking place in the enterprise sphere. National Property Fund Chairman T. Jezek said that some firms are indeed folding, but this happens more often by means of liquidation than by bankruptcy. Dlouhy also expressed himself in favor of a smaller percentage of industry in the Czech Republic's overall economy, a change in the structure of the industry sphere, and also greater efficiency in industrial output. In 1991, industrial output declined by 22 percent, compared with 1990. It declined by 10.6 percent in 1992, compared with 1991, and, last year, the industrial sector declined by 5 percent.
