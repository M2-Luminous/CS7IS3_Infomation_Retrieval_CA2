Safronov; place and date not given; from the "Vesti" newscast -- recorded] [Text] [Safronov] Today, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and his German friend, Gerhard Frey, leader of the German People's Union [Deutsche Volksunion], held a joint news conference. Both talked of their attachment to German-Russian friendship. Frey reproved a number of German journalists who write disrespectfully about the future Russian president. Zhirinovskiy predicted the emergence of a Moscow-Berlin axis and added Delhi -- evidently in connection with [his book]: "The Last Push South." In his words, the present government would fall in the autumn without having solved a single problem and then the president himself would invite him to Zavidovo and would entrust him with the mandate to form a government. At the very worst, he was ready to head one of the power ministries or the Foreign Ministry. In three months, according to him, the government of the single unblemished party -- the Liberal Democratic Party -- would root out 5,000 armed gangs, put an end to military conversion, and completely cut off neighboring republics. Zhirinovskiy denied that criminal proceedings had been instigated against him, accusing him of propagating war in connection with his book "The Last Push South." He stressed that everything would occur without a single shot being fired. First, Russia would withdraw its troops from the south and then the peoples there, beset by conflict, would ask to be put under Russian dominion. As for his coming visit to Europe, Zhirinovskiy said that he was interested in the present and that was why he did not plan to visit Auschwitz and Dachau. [Zhirinovskiy] I am only in the capital for a few hours -- Ljubljana, Belgrade, Warsaw -- and millions of people are standing there shouting: Russia, Russians, we are behind you. They kiss my hand, throw flowers at my feet, and I have difficulty escaping back to Moscow. [Safronov] In characteristic form, Zhirinovskiy promised a permanent tundra residence permit for journalists who slandered him.
