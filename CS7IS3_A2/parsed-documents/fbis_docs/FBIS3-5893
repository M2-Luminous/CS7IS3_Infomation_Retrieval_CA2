The two countries reaffirmed that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) must conclude successful inspections in North Korea and the two Koreas must exchange special envoys before the Pyongyang-Washington meeting can take place, Kim Sam-hun, Seoul's nuclear ambassador, said after consultations with U.S. officials. As to what constitutes successful inspections, Kim said the IAEA is responsible for making that determination. "South Korea and the United States will respect the IAEA's decision on the inspection results," said Kim. Seoul and Washington shared concern over Pyongyang's negative attitude at inter-Korean contacts, evidenced by its "impure" demands, the ambassador told reporters. While repeating their commitment to solving the dispute through dialogue, they noted that the world's patience was running out. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, also chief American representative at the two previous high-level talks with North Korea, has come to Seoul to draw up strategies in dealing with the North Korean nuclear crisis. A team of IAEA inspectors is in North Korea, probably until March 15, checking primarily whether the communist state has diverted nuclear material to non-peaceful uses. Earlier, Washington made conditional promises to North Korea to cancel this year's "Team Spirit" military drill, held annually with Seoul, and to meet for further high-level talks on March 21. But North Korea must permit full IAEA inspections and exchange presidential envoys with South Korea before the promises are carried out. The bilateral consultations here came amid another budding crisis as Pyongyang holds out on inter-Korean dialogue. Kim said after talking with Gallucci that he cannot emphasize enough that the envoy exchange is a precondition that must be met. The three-hour session dealt with what the next North Korea-U.S. talks would cover. "The meeting would in reality be the last opportunity to solve the nuclear problem," said Kim. "As stated at last November's summit, they would negotiate related agendas on a thorough and broad basis." Resolution of the nuclear problem means North Korea's complete return to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty [NPT], acceptance of special inspections of its undeclared facilities and implementation of the inter-Korean agreement on denuclearization, said Kim. Exactly one year ago this Saturday, North Korea announced it was bolting from the NPT, riveting the attention of the international community. Speculation here is that North Korea will hold out to the last minute on the envoy demand, possibly offering to conduct the exchange sometime after March 21. "As I said, the envoys have to have come and gone. It's not enough to just agree on the dates of the exchange," said Kim. Asked whether that means the March 21 meeting might be delayed or cancelled, Kim answered "yes." North Korean and U.S. officials meet for their sixth contact Saturday to arrange the envoy visits.
