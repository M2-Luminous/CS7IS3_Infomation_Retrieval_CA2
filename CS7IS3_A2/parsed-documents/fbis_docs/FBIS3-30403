According to the same source, many previous reports are now being confirmed by the Croat side in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. The latest example is the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] report on Muslim terror against Serbs and Croats in Tarcin. According to the reports many Serbs and Croats have been imprisoned in Tarcin for a long time and all other Serbs and Croats from the area have been forced to join work details of the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army. They have been transferred to Zabrdje near Kiseljak where they have been forced to dig fortifications for the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army. According to Croatian sources Muslim forces in the area plan to use the imprisoned Serbs and Croats as a human shield in attempts to recapture certain positions seized by the HVO. According to the latest refugee accounts the position of around 100 Serb families remaining in Zavidovici is extremely difficult, Srpska republic army sources said. [passage omitted] Serbs remaining in Zavidovici area are threatened with death on a massive scale if international, particularly humanitarian, organizations do not intervene urgently on their behalf, sources close to the Srpska republic army warned.
