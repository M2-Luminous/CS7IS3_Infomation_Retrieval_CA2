FBIS4-10131 "drlat067_s_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 Uruguay Cuba's Robaina on Economic Opening, Blockade Cuba's Robaina on Economic Opening, Blockade PY0604223994 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1457 GMT 6 Apr 94 PY0604223994 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Montevideo, 6 Apr (EFE)--Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, who is making an official visit to Uruguay within the framework of a Latin American trip, said Cuba is willing to continue its economic opening in order to integrate with the current world, but it will not modify its "sacred" political system. Political freedom in Cuba is conditioned by external pressure, Robaina told the media when he referred to the trade blockade the United States imposed more than 30 years ago; "therefore, today there is no need for political unity." Regarding the economic opening, the foreign minister indicated there are already 100 important international enterprises with investments in Cuba, but he stated that he could not reveal their names because their enterprises in other countries might suffer U.S. pressure. Regarding President Bill Clinton's government, he said: "It has less aggressive language (regarding the Cuban regime) but the blockade has increased." Regarding President Fidel Castro's stay in power (for 35 years now), the foreign minister stressed that the president "is not in power because he wants to hold it nor does he want to perpetuate himself in power: The most important thing is not his physical presence, but the continuity of the plan" that he embodies. Asked about succession, Robaina explained that Raul Castro, the Armed Forces minister and Fidel's brother, has been designated, but he added that "under new circumstances, new names emerge," although he made it clear that he himself "is not in line" for that task. Robaina also commented on the accusations against his government regarding human rights violations, which he considers "to be a highly manipulated, discriminatory, selective, and politicized topic," and he denied that such cases occur in his country. "My country disagrees with the entry (into Cuba) of those who wish to impose conditions" regarding human rights, Robaina said, when he was asked why his government has never allowed an in situ inspection by UN or Latin American Inter-Parliamentary Union members. Montevideo media reports today that Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu suggested to Robaina "the desire (of the Uruguayan Government) that human rights be respected in that country and that a multiparty democracy be established." During the meetings with President Luis Alberto Lacalle and Abreu, the Uruguayan Government reiterated these petitions for a political opening, according to sources. Robaina arrived on 4 April in Montevideo and today he concludes his official visit to Uruguay, where he will remain for two more days on a private visit. He then will travel to Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay to explain the Cuban economic opening to the respective governments and request support against the blockade.
