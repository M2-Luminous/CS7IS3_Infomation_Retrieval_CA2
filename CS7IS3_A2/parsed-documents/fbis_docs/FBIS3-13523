Nateq-Nuri stressed: America's performance has always been in contradiction with such remarks, and thus far this performance has not been in a manner to demonstrate that country's good intention, and which can be trusted. He stressed: As long as America maintains its hegemonistic and aggressive nature, we will continue our struggle. On biased western propaganda alleging that Iran is striving to build nuclear weapons, the head of the legislative branch said: All international organizations and forums, particularly the International Atomic Energy Agency which has inspected our country's installations, have declared that there is no evidence to show that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. We use our installations to generate power. About the main obstacles along the path of improving ties with Egypt, Nateq-Nuri replied to the correspondent's question by describing the Egyptian Government as the biggest obstacle along the path of upgrading these relations. Referring to the Egyptian Government's opposition to the Islam-seeking and Islam-supporting wave in that country, the Majles speaker added: The Egyptian Government cannot see the people's Islam-seeking mentality and blames Iran for provocation. On Iran's relations with other Asian countries, particularly China and India, the Majles speaker emphasized: We wish to establish ties and unity with all other countries, except Israel and the United States, and we believe this unity will serve the interests of us all.
