In an article today, the newspaper says: We are with Yemen's unity. We reject secession, which means separation of part of the nation, which badly needs that part in the current atmosphere of conspiracy, defeatism, and subservience to foreigners. The newspaper criticizes statements by Husni Mubarak, president of the Egyptian regime, who is fishing in murky water and trying to escalate Arab crises and undermine Yemeni unity by spreading despairing ideas, feeding differences, and widening the gap among the Arabs. AL-JUMHURIYAH points out that one of the aims of the president of the Egyptian regime is to peddle the U.S.-Saudi plan to partition Yemen in order to win U.S. and Saudi goodwill. He also tries to portray the situation in the Arab homeland as unstable and fragile in order to cover up his internal crisis and the growing national opposition against his regime, which is founded on precarious balance. The newspaper explains that by this position, Husni Mubarak is taking revenge against Yemen for its national and pan-Arab stand during the immortal Mother of Battles, for its rejection of the foreign occupation of the Gulf region and the Arabian Peninsula, for its support for Iraq's principled position, and for its adherence to a solution within the Arab home. All this, the paper says, conflicts with Husni Mubarak's position. Concluding, the newspaper says: These goals remind us of Husni Mubarak's attempts during the 30-state aggression against Iraq, when he hastened to hold an Arab summit conference in Cairo to abort the Arab solution and give legitimacy to bringing the invasion forces to the region to strike lofty Iraq and its people.
