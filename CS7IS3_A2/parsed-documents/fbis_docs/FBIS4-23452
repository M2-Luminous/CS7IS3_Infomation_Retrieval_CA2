Addressing a news conference in Pretoria today, he accused Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who is a Tutsi, of deploying 40,000 troops in Rwanda. Tutsis and Hutus are involved in the tribal killings in the country. Mr. Ntagerura is in South Africa to brief the government on the current state of affairs in Rwanda and is scheduled to meet Mr. Mandela tomorrow. He expressed the hope that Mr. Mandela can use his influence to persuade Mr. Museveni to drop his support for the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], which he blamed for the widespread human slaughter in his country. Mr. Ntagerura also alleged that Mr. Museveni is also destabilizing the country by arming RPF troops. He further blamed the Belgian contingent of UN peace keepers for allowing the conflict to get out of hand in the first place, through what he claimed was their failure to control arms acquisitions by the RPF. He said due to a lack of supervision by the Belgians, the RPF grew to 2,000 heavily armed soldiers who infiltrated the entire country and sparked the current bloodshed by shooting down President Habyarimana's plane. Mr. Ntagerura denied that the interim government is in hiding or has gone into exile, saying it is holding regular meetings in the capital, Kigali.
