Unfortunately, when they arrived, the only vehicle on show was a BMW; of the Rover there was, initially at least, no sign. Rover's departure is something BAe executives have been privately looking forward to for some time. But it will be fear that Rover, submerged within BMW, may eventually disappear from the UK, taking with it technological expertise and jobs, that will concern the Labour party, trade union leaders and Rover's 30,000 employees. Among City analysts, though, there was a sense almost of exhilaration. "It's pretty much what I predicted last year," said Chris Tarry, of Paribas Capital Markets. "I thought the buyer would be Volkswagen, but BMW was my second choice." The sale of Rover by BAe is unquestionably an historic event in British manufacturing. In 1986, when Paul Channon, then industry secretary, tried to sell Land-Rover and Austin Rover to General Motors and Ford of America, respectively, there was public outrage. So furious were the Tory supporters in the shires, that Lady Thatcher's administration was forced to back down. Debarred from an overseas sale, Lord Young, a subsequent industry secretary, turned to Britain's biggest manufacturing company, and in August 1988 concluded a sale of the entire Rover Group to BAe. Professor Sir Roland Smith, then chairman of BAe, described his 150 million pound purchase as the "deal of the decade." Even though BAe was subsequently obliged by the European Court to repay 48 million pounds in illegal sweeteners, yesterday's agreement to sell Rover to BMW for 800 million pounds is a tribute to the accuracy of his assessment. Of course, Sir Roland was at his most ebullient in those days, gathering acquisitions into BAe almost willy-nilly, so long as they could be bolted on somewhere. Perhaps it was unsurprising, given BAe's history. Formed in April 1977, BAe was a nationalised corporation designed to bring together the aerospace interests of the British Aircraft Corporation, Hawker Siddeley Aviation, Hawker Siddeley Dynamics and Scottish Aviation in a single "national champion" company. Although the incoming Conservative government privatised the company in February 1981, it became increasingly acquisitive as the restructuring of British industry gathered pace. In April 1987, the group picked up Royal Ordnance, the munitions group. Ballast Nedam, a Dutch construction company, was added in December. The company diversified into property (to maximise revenue from land released by restructuring), telecommunications, wind farms, airports. Subsidiaries mushroomed until the autumn of 1991 when the recession exposed how overstretched the group had become. Shareholders reacted with fury when it plunged into loss and called on them for 432 million pounds to bail it out. Sir Roland was ousted in a boardroom coup and Sir Graham Day, the Rover Group chairman, was asked to draw up a new strategy and find a new chairman. The man he chose was John Cahill, from the conglomerate BTR. Since he arrived almost two years ago Cahill has set about the restructuring and rationalisation that Sir Roland so conspicuously failed to achieve. In classic BTR style, BAe has focused on markets where it can command a dominant position, and endeavoured to become a low-cost producer. In little more than two years, the company has shed 25,000 workers, taking total employment down to some 95,000, and made a string of disposals, including corporate jets and Ballast Nedam. Once Rover is sold, the defence business will once more be the heart of the group. Annual sales last year are thought to have been 3.8 billion pounds, only a whisker below Rover's 4 billion pounds. But unlike car-making, manufacturing weapons has been consistently profitable. United Kingdom defence spending is set to fall 16 percent in real terms between 1991 and 1997. But aided by government ministers, BAe has secured massive long-term export deals around the world in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and elsewhere. Its Hawk aircraft is the best-selling jet trainer in the world, the Harrier vertical take-off fighter is a winner, Tornado is the mainstay of several European air forces and the Eurofighter project remains a long-term moneyspinner. The profitability of defence will be reinforced by job cutting, especially in Royal Ordnance. The deepest retrenchment has occurred in civil aircraft, where profits have been devastated by a fall in aircraft demand triggered by the recession. A loss of 337 million pounds on sales of 1.5 billion pounds is predicted by independent analysts for 1993. The core of BAe's civil business is its 20 percent stake in Airbus Industrie, the pan-European planemaker which is now the world's second largest after Boeing. BAe builds the wings, profitably, for every plane in the range. In an effort to secure the future of its regional jet range, BAe wasted 15 months talking to Taiwan Aerospace Corporation about joint-venture production. In the end, TAC walked away. But capital-cost write-offs, concentration on a single site at Woodford, in Cheshire, and modernisation of the plane and the manufacturing process appear on course to restore profitability and the status of the Avro RJ series as the world's most successful regional jet. Avro has already sold seven this year. BAe's biggest remaining problem on the civil aircraft side, and the source of continuing losses, is Jetstream Aircraft, at Prestwick in Scotland. Although the smaller Jetstream turbo-prop planes have been a commercial success, the larger Jetstream 61, derived from the ATP, has not. Talks are in hand with a rival manufacturers [as published] around the globe. The sale of Rover will provide the opportunity to focus attention on solving the weaknesses of the defence and civil aerospace businesses. The combined effect of an 800 million pound cheque from BMW and removal of Rover's borrowings should leave BAe modestly in the black with its bankers. Removal of Rover's 700 million pounds of off-balance sheet borrowings from the liabilities will simultaneously give BAe headroom to borrow any funds needed to conclude a deal on the Jetstream business. But there should also be more cash and management time to devote to BAe's remaining broad spread of activities. Top of the disposal list is believed to be the space systems business, with the retail side of Arlington, the property company, a close second. Talks with Matra-Hachette of France about a joint company embracing their missile manufacturing interests are also well advanced. Some other disposals are expected to follow when circumstances permit, such as the sale of BAe's 30 percent interest in Hutchison Telecommunications, the mobile telephone company. But many questions about BAe's stewardship of Britain's most advanced technologies remain unanswered. BAe can take no credit for Rover's revival. That was achieved by the combination of Rover employees and Honda engineering. Defence has been successful at winning overseas orders, thanks in part to strong backing from government ministers. But after the sale of Rover, which BAe repeatedly insisted was a "core" business, and the vacillation over Avro, the company's determination and ability to remain a player in civil aviation is open to question. Civil aircraft manufacture, historically, has been a way for companies to maximise government investment in military technology. But the current over-capacity among state-sponsored regional aircraft manufacturers around the world accentuates the need for collaboration and joint ventures. The bitterness of Rover's former partner, Honda, over yesterday's events, combined with the failure of discussions with TAC over Avro, may well cause any would-be BAe joint venture partners to have second thoughts. John Cahill has shown he is good at rationalising businesses, and not bad at selling them. But he has yet to show that the new BAe can run high-tech companies successfully for long term growth, either alone or in partnership.
