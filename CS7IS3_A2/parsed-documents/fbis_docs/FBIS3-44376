Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin topped the list in terms of high comprehensive levels of social development, while Anhui, Qinghai, and Guizhou were ranked among the top three in terms of growth rates of comprehensive levels of social development. According to a State Statistics Bureau briefing, comprehensive levels of social development are indexes of regional and overall social development calculated on the basis of the weighted average of figures for all fields of social development for the purpose of presenting a comprehensive picture of social development in a given country or region. This assessment -- which is based on 1992 statistics and uses the method of multistage consolidation [duo ji zong he fang fa 1122 4787 4844 0678 2455 3127] -- covers more than 100 statistical indicators in ten fields, including the environment, population, economics, living standards, and levels of scientific and technical education that reflect China's overall levels of social development. The results of the assessment indicate that China's average social development level index in 1992 reached 121, an increase of 10 percent over 1991. Fourteen provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities are above the national average in terms of comprehensive levels of social development. The assessment also reveals some new characteristics in China's social development in 1992: China's social development basically kept pace with the development of the economy; China's gross domestic product registered an increase of 13.2 percent in 1992, while the average social development level index rose by 10 percent, basically keeping pace with the former. Large gaps exist from region to region. Excluding Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, the average social development level index of the five highest-ranked regions is 60 percent higher than that of the five lowest-ranked regions. The level of social development was higher in eastern and coastal open areas. Thirteen out of the 14 regions -- Shanxi Province is the exception -- which enjoy index figures greater than the national average are from eastern or coastal open areas. Regions with relatively low average social development levels saw faster growth; twelve of the fifteen regions with index figures below the national average reached or topped the national growth rate for 1992. An analysis of the results reveals uneven development from sector to sector in 1992. Nationally, the index figures of population, economy, hygiene and health care, social security, public order, and living standards saw large increases; the environment and scientific and technical education index figures registered slight progress; and the labor index figures declined.
