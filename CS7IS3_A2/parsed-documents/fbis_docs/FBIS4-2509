Wei Ling, the younger sister of Wei Jingsheng, said during an interview with a foreign press agency yesterday that the authorities had on many occasions hinted to Wei Jingsheng's family that there might be some problems with Wei's health, and this made people worry that Wei Jingsheng had been inhumanely treated while being "kept under surveillance at a certain place." She said: "They told my father it was necessary for them to give my elder brother a health check-up. However, he was in good health before he was arrested." Wei Ling worried that the doctors in the prison might do harm to her elder brother. However, when she was answering MING PAO reporter's questions, Wei Ling said she knew nothing about her elder brother. She only said that she thought it was possible that Wei Jingsheng's secretary, Tong Yi, might be sentenced to imprisonment, and it was even more possible that Wei Jingsheng would be sentenced to imprisonment, because this had already been implied in some statements made by public security departments.
