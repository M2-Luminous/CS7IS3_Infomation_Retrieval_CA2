The government also protested against Russia's attempts to destabilise the situation in the Baltic region and demanded that the troops withdrawal be completed by August 31. The Estonian Government statement stressed Estonia's willingness to continue the negotiations. Prime Minister Mart Laar told the journalists that the Russian additional conditions, including the demand of 23 million dollars, contradict Russia's international obligation of a speedy, orderly and complete withdrawal. "The Estonian side never promised them any compensation," Laar said. Foreign Minister Juri Luik explained that the consultations would help to settle the differences and to continue the talks. He also pointed out the threat of the Russian military presence, referring to the recent fire in a Russian military unit near Paldiski. Riigikogu [parliament] Foreign Affairs Commission Chairman Vello Saatpalu had recommended to continue the negotiations in the territory of a third country, but Friday's [4 March] government session did not discuss it, government spokesman Ain Saarna said.
