[passage omitted] [Peter Boross, prime minister and member of the MDF Presidium] We have four years ahead of us during which we have to construct a modern, professional political party in the true European sense of the word by 1998--one that will be able to represent social interests to become a governing force again. [Correspondent] To outsiders you represent the liberal line within the MDF, and now, you are the party's parliamentary group leader. Does this also mean a change in the political line? [Finance Minister Tamas Szabo] I really respect the liberals, the national liberals working within our circle. Although I have never been a member of the Liberal Foundation, I have always played a serious role in the Christian democratic circle of the MDF, ever since it was formed. This is where my loyalty lies. [passage omitted] So in this respect, my person will not really bring change. [passage omitted] Whenever there was trouble within the MDF, it was when somebody wanted to push one or the other of the MDF's three main ideological pillars--the national, the Christian democratic, and the national liberal ideology--to the forefront. If any of these trends becomes dominant the MDF is finished. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Does Peter Boross really represent another group within the MDF? [Szabo] In my view, Peter Boross represents an extremely pragmatic line and has an enormous capacity for organizing. [passage omitted] He represents a fourth pragmatic wing and he, as a man thinking in terms of organizing and organization, approaches issues from a different angle. It is possible that he will have difficulties because every stream feels that he does not really represent any of them. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Does it mean, at the same time--since tendencies are linked to persons--that there is an unresolved debate in the MDF whether it should be a people's party, a program party, a party of law and order, or an action party? [passage omitted] [MDF Chairman Lajos Fur] Obviously, it appears that winning the next election will be possible only with the oft-mentioned wider social basis, which is necessary in any case. Therefore, it is obvious that the MDF should move into the direction of a kind of people's party, which does not mean that the MDF will be a mass party in that it will have a mass membership, but that it should have a broad electoral basis; that it should put down roots in the various strata of the people, in the various social groups. [Szabo] If anything can change in the MDF it is the fact that we will move in the direction of a completely balanced, modern conservativism, one that does not require a change in the order of values but demands a change of expression. [MDF Deputy Balazs Horvath] The zealous and strong attitude-- which, on more than one occasion has irritated people, often unnecessarily--which exaggerated the national feature will obviously weaken, will be pushed into the background, if not in substance certainly in form. [Correspondent] Does the MDF's defeat mean the defeat of the unity of forces of national sentiments [nemzeti eroek] as well? [Fur]] The forces of national sentiments competed in this last election in a rather fragmented way--at least they were divided into several parties--but if I add up the results of all the parties of this kind, then I must say that their result was not all that bad. After all, more than 1.5 million people voted out of the 5.6 million for these parties, which means that this kind of thinking or set of political ideologies already has a wide basis. Obviously this basis must be broadened because, as we have seen, an election cannot be won through this and in this way. Possibly the fragmentation, too, needs to be resolved in some form and the forces will have to be concentrated. [passage omitted]
