This was timely in view of the fact that the SZDSZ's leaders had visited a number of neighboring countries in recent weeks and had conducted talks with leading politicians. As Szent-Ivanyi said, the relationship system with the neighbors is one of Hungarian foreign policy's most important areas. For this reason, in their view, Hungary's interest is to have peaceful and well-functioning relations with the neighboring countries. However, in the past four years most problems have arisen precisely in this area, which has been partly due to the government's ideological style of foreign policy, Szent-Ivanyi said. Unlike the current coalition, although the SZDSZ considers it very important that the situation of Hungarians living in the neighboring countries is settled, it does not make relations solely dependent on this. According to Szent-Ivanyi, new principles need to be introduced in regional relations, practical issues have to be placed to the forefront, and the interests of the other side in improving the relationship have to be made clear. During their visits to Romania, Austria, and the Czech Republic, the SZDSZ politicians found that interest was mainly shown in economic cooperation. The SZDSZ considers regional organizations like the Visegrad cooperation or the Central European Initiative particularly important. Talking about the Visegrad group, Szent-Ivanyi said that in the course of their talks with the Czech foreign minister, it was said that Prague does not want ostentatiously to break off this cooperation but it has different ideas on it. Szent-Ivanyi said that, in their view, Romania and Bulgaria should join the Central European Free Trade Agreement.
