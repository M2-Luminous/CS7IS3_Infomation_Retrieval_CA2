In a report on employment and unemployment, the Paris-based Western think tank also called for improvement of education and job training systems to meet a shift in demand away from unskilled jobs to more highly skilled jobs. The report came out as the OECD opened a two-day ministerial meeting to look into ways to secure employment, with as many as 35 million people out of work within the group. As for working hours, the report proposes introducing flexible working schedules for part-time workers, reducing overtime allowances and reviewing the minimum wage to provide more job opportunities. But the report is quick to underline the need to carry out the changes without reducing social protection levels for workers. "High unemployment should be addressed not by seeking to slow the pace of change, but rather by restoring economies' and societies' capacity to adapt it [as received]," the report says. "But this must be undertaken in ways which do not abandon the social objectives of OECD societies. Rather, social objectives must be met in new, more carefully designed ways that do not have the past unintended and undesirable side effects." It brushes aside a persistent argument in some industrial nations that imports of low-priced goods from developing nations is the main cause of unemployment in industrial nations, describing such a view as "ill-founded." The report points to data showing that the weight of low-wage countries' exports in the overall expenditure of OECD countries on goods and services is only about 1.5 percent. "The number of markets which they (low-wage countries) contest is greater, and their effect on the intensity of competition is increasing," it says. "But the judgment on present evidence is that the overall impact both of imports from these countries and their contestation of OECD markets is too small to account for a significant part of either current unemployment or falling relative wages of the low-skilled."
