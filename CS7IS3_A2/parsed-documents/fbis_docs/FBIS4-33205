About 300 people, called by leftist parties, marched on 31 May in repudiation of police repression. UCR [Radical Civic Union] leader Juan Manuel Casella asked for no intervention in the province "like it was done in Santiago del Estero and Jujuy Provinces, sending border policemen to carry out a repressive mission to please [Economy] Minister Cavallo." Casella supported Rio Grande Mayor Jorge Colazo "in his position of solidarity with the workers." Casella said the government demonstrated "its idea of quenching dissent and expressions of rejection of its economic policies. [no closing quotation marks as published] Grand Front Deputy Graciela Fernandez Meijide also criticized President Carlos Menem. She noted that it is "not possible" to attribute all the conflicts in the country's interior "to alleged activists." Fernandez Meijide asked the government to have "a bit of common sense" to admit that the conflicts in Santiago del Estero Province, Jujuy Province, and southern Argentina "have been prompted by something more significant than the presence of agitators." UCR Deputy Enrique Mathov, who has been visiting Ushuaia since 28 May, asked the federal government "to implement all the mechanisms available to it to prevent the conflict from escalating."
