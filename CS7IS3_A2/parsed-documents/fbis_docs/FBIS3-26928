These figures signify that our country's overall grain production capability has stabilized to reach the level of producing 450 billion kg annually. China's grain output has jumped by leaps and bounds over the past 15 years, increasing from 300 billion kg in 1979 to 450 billion kg in 1993. Fifteen years is a very brief period in the long history of humans. The sharp increase in grain output over the 15 years represented a quantum jump in the several thousand years of history of farming in China. It is exactly because of this quantum jump in grain production that the Chinese people have realized the dream of having attained the sufficiency in food and clothing that had long eluded our ancestors. With only 7 percent of the world's arable land, China has solved the problem of feeding and clothing 22 percent of the world's people. This undoubtedly represents a great contribution to the entire human existence and development, and it has surprised the entire world. According to a foreign economist's analysis, between 1980 and 1991, China contributed 20 kg out of every 50 kg of the increase in the world's gross grain production. The same foreign economist observed: "It is a miracle in the history of the world economy; it is simply incredible." This is a towering monument to bountifulness erected by China's 900 million farmers on some 1.4 billion mu of farmland. The most fundamental reason behind it is the reform that has liberated the most active factor for productive forces -- human beings. (1) When New China resolutely parted with the old age, which had lasted for thousands of years and which was a synonym for hunger and poverty, it failed to establish a set of excellent operating mechanisms that could effectively encourage production and help increase the market supply. Possessing neither the right to manage the land nor to manage the produce, farmers' enthusiasm for production was greatly dampened. From 1957 to 1978, a span of 21 years, our country's per capita annual increase in grain production was less than 0.6 kg. This cruel reality had forced the state to practice a rationing system for the supply of some staple agricultural products. By 1978, when the Republic marked its 29th anniversary, there were still more than 200 million people in the nation struggling against hunger. "If people go hungry, can we call this socialism?" In December 1978, farmers in Xiaogan village, in Fengyang County, Anhui, while running the risk of being thrown into prison, ignited the spark of the contract responsibility system and unveiled the curtain on rural reform. The spark spread throughout the nation and in one stroke reversed the stagnation that had long affected the agricultural sector. In 1982, the total national grain output reached 354 billion kg, an increase of about 50 billion kg over 1978. By 1984, the nation's gross grain output increased to 407.30 billion kg, a further increase of 50 billion kg from 1982, and the per capita possession of grain reached 400 kg, thus nearing the world's average level for the first time. Farmers elatedly hummed tunes while harvesting. Ordinary people, however, were puzzled by the agricultural miracle that the farmers had helped to create. They noted that before the introduction of the reform, the emphasis on "taking agriculture as the key link" had been repeated time and again and that 800 million farmers were bound to the earth for farming. Despite all this, grain production remained stagnant. Following the introduction of the contract responsibility system, not only grain production posted sharp increases but the production of other agricultural sideline products, forestry products, animal husbandry products, and aquatic products also registered great increases. An economist had the following explanation: A comparison between 1949 and 1952 showed that because of farmers' heightened enthusiasm for production due to farmland having been distributed to them, they helped boost overall annual grain production by 13 percent. However, we miscalculated the situation, thinking that collective farming would bring about higher efficiency than family-style operations. Farmland operations were then turned into collective and unified operations, and areas of farming activities that were put under control were further expanded. Because laborers, who in the first place should be the most active factor of the productive forces, were "dead," the key production element for farming could not be "enlivened." The household contract responsibility system, which links remuneration with output, gave the farmers the right to manage the land. The benefit mechanism fired up farmers' enthusiasm for farming, which brought about creativity that was unthinkable in the times of people's communes. Farmers had a simpler explanation: "After fulfilling the set quotas for the state and for the collectives, the rest is ours." The results of labor and the benefits for the producers were thus closely interlinked. The contract responsibility system elicited a sense of responsibility, inspired enthusiasm, and led to bumper harvests. (2) Today, if we take a walk through urban and rural market places, we will find an abundant supply of grains, fowls, fish, meat, eggs, vegetables, and dairy products. There is a dazzling display of various lines of food products in stores. Following the successful solution of the basic problem of "filling the hungry stomachs" in the mid-eighties, we then entered a stage where we become particular about the nutrition, tastes, and varieties of what we eat. This shows the historical change that has occurred to grain varieties and product quality. Production and consumption is an inseparable "pair." Market is an indispensable link between them. But before our country carried out the rural reform, the link was artificially cut off and the "pair" was separated. In the area of crop planting, people were told: "Plant as told." In the area of eating, people were told: "Eat whatever is available." Both producers and consumers lost the right of autonomy. Reform finally dismantled the barrier that separated the producers and consumers and established a link for the market. From 1985, the year that saw the issuance of the CPC Central Committee Number 1 Document, which announced the reform of the system of the state's monopoly over grain purchase to the nineties which saw the lifting of controls on grain procurement and marketing, grain has entered the market as a commodity. Amid the gradual yet positive and steady reform, the market's role was recognized, market forces were constantly expanded, and market mechanisms were introduced one after another. The opening of the market gave the right and room of maneuver for farmers to decide on production on their own. This undoubtedly is another liberation of the productive forces in rural areas. Now, hundreds and thousands of farmers can hold their heads high. They plant crops with market demands in mind. They say: "I will plant whatever the market demands." In 1992, farmers in six provinces, including Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Fujian, riding on the crest of the tide of reform, reduced the acreage of long-grained nonglutinous rice which suffered sluggish sales on the market; instead, they increased the planting acreage of 17.90 million mu of superior-quality rice. The following year, the craze to engage in "high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency farming" infected the entire nation. According to the Agriculture Ministry, the nation saw the shrinking of the planting acreage for long-grain nonglutinous rice by over 12 million mu and the increase over 100 million mu of acreage for superior-quality rice in 1993; compared to the previous year, the acreage for superior-quality wheat was increased to over 3 million mu; acreage for soya bean and other food grains was increased to over 34 million mu over the previous year. It may be said that the product quality and the structure of varieties of the current 450 billion kg of grain are far superior to those in the past. "When the people are alive, the market gets enlivened, and the earth also awakes." The folks use the above simple yet concrete language to describe the truism that has brought about all the changes that have occurred so far. (3) Capital, materials, and science and technology are three major factors for developing grain production. But these three major factors require the efforts of farmers. Increasing chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic sheeting output and widespread promotion of agricultural science and technology over the past 15 years have greatly contributed to the increase in grain production by leaps and bounds. What gives us much food for thought is that prior to reform and opening up, there existed the same key elements for production and the same degree of importance had been attached to those key production elements. But they were like "a cesspool of dead water." People still remember the policy of the "Eight-Point Character for Agriculture" proposed by Mao Zedong. However, even at Mao Zedong's personal prompting, it was difficult to put that Eight-Point policy into practice. The state invested a lot of funds into the agriculture, but they produced little results. Despite a lot of scientific achievements in those days, they failed to take root. It's easy to find the reasons for the above problems. Under the shackles of the old system, farmers "started and stopped working at the sound of the whistle." They just did not care. As they did not have autonomy, they were powerless to make things move. They used to say: "What is the use of producing more grain?" Reform has liberated millions and millions of farmers from the shackles of the old system. When this human factor becomes brisk, all other key elements for production will no longer remain in "a cesspool of dead water." Statistics show that in 15 years of reform, the overall generating power of our country's farm machinery jumped 1.6 times, the number of tractors owned by farmers increased 3.4 times, trucks for farm-use grew 8.5 times, of which 80 percent of the growth in farm machinery came through farmers' purchases. The fact that hundreds and thousands of farming households' snapping up farm-machinery has brought about the following changes: Acreage plowed by farm machinery in China has increased 26 percent; acreage sown by farm machinery jumped 95 percent; and farmland harvested by farm machinery is up 3.5 times. Reform and opening up have liberated the most active factor in the productive forces and enabled science and technology to display its power as the "primary productive force." When the prairie fire of the contract responsibility system swept through the great earth of central China, there were reports of news on people "fighting for the god of fortune." Now, the farmers' longing for science, technology, and talented people is the strongest of any time. They not only try every possible means to "fight for things that grow money," for "technology," and for "patent rights," but are willing to spend money to train "local talents." In just five years during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period, the acreage of China's cross-bred paddy rice fields was expanded from 100 million mu to 230 million; cross-bred corn field from 190 million mu to 270 million; and farmland covered by plastic sheeting from 31.50 million mu to 53 million. When talking about the tremendous changes that had been brought to agriculture, farmers invariably attributed those changes to the party's good policies. They did not say that just to flatter the party; they really meant it. The lesson from the grain output increasing by leaps and bounds over the past 15 years is: Human beings are the most active element of the productive forces. When the human factor gets activated, it will produce a chain reaction upon other key elements for production and lead to a situation where "one will try his or her best; things will serve their proper purpose; and the earth provides of its own accord."
