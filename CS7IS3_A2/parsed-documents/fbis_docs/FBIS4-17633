We are presenting a radio interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian parliament and head of state. Mr. Shevardnadze, I remember you said during last week's interview that no grave crime had been committed in the republic for the last 24 hours. On 20 April, a new terrorist act was committed in Tbilisi, when Major General Gia Gulua, head of the transport police and a deputy interior minister, was assassinated. Do you think this killing could be politically motivated? At any rate, considering the result, we can say that the event has created the impression that the authorities are not sufficiently secure; it has also raised questions as to who will be next and why all this is being done. A feeling has been created both within the country and outside that terrorist acts are common in Georgia. Furthermore, the time has come when it is necessary to have the investigation brought to completion so that this case will not remain a common unsolved case of a terrorist act. [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. I already expressed some of my concerns regarding this case at a meeting of heads of law enforcement bodies and rayons of the republic which was shown on Georgian television; those who were interested were able to hear them then. This is an event that has given rise to grave concern. [passage omitted] Of course, I have charged the law enforcement bodies to solve the case in the very near future and to ensure that incidents like this do not happen again. I have said that the bodies which must fight terrorism and which must aim to reach a situation where they are able to rule out terrorism as a phenomenon are still not up to the mark. This cannot be justified by asserting that Georgia is not an exception and terrorist acts happen in other countries, too. This is true. They do happen in other countries, too. But this could prove disastrous for Georgia. If the world gets an established image of Georgia as a country where terrorism is a common occurrence, we will not be able to speak about the development of a large and serious economy or about the involvement of big and serious foreign business. So this is a political issue, and that is why I regard terrorism as a phenomenon which should be combated with all possible means. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that Gia Gulua's assassination was connected with past deeds. [passage omitted] Now, are the authorities and senior officials in general adequately protected? I would say that they must be provided with the essential minimum. Although I prohibit anything excessive -- I mean special means and special transport that require large expenses -- the minimum of what is needed to protect the authorities should be provided and it has not been sufficiently provided so far. In any normal country, the authorities should have guarantees of security. Thus, we have to draw serious conclusions from what has happened. [passage omitted] [Oniani] During your meeting with law enforcement bodies you spoke about drug addiction. Last week your edict on urgent measures to enhance the struggle against drug addiction and drug trafficking was released. According to this edict, a national bureau to combat drug addiction and drug trafficking has been established on the basis of a former ministry department with a similar task. Is it possible that this edict will share the fate of your previous edict? We are very well aware that no one has quit his post because of drug addiction; there have been no cases like this. Do you think it possible to fight against the phenomenon when, for instance, Irakli Menagharishvili, our deputy prime minister, said during that meeting that the narcotics gangs had powerful patrons in the power structures [Security, Defense, and Interior Ministries and Procurator's Office]. The population knows everything and is very well aware of the ways drugs are brought into Georgia, who sells them, and what bars a supplier has to pass, or rather, whom and how much he has to pay to bring these drugs into Georgia. Yet another question, if you permit. Will the law relating to drug traffickers become stricter? This was also mentioned at your meeting with law enforcement bodies. [Shevardnadze] Drug addiction, together with terrorism, must be considered as the most serious threat to our national statehood and, I would say, to the whole population -- all citizens and our future generations. The thing is that Georgia attracts drugs trafficking by its geographic situation, and will attract more in future. Regrettably, no guarantees have been created in the world to restrict the growth of drug trafficking into an international force. It is not late yet; drug addiction and drug trafficking have not reached syndicate proportions and they should never do so. [passage omitted] When drug trafficking reaches that stage, Georgia will not be able to afford a fight like this. It will hardly be possible to overcome the problem later. [passage indistinct] Thus, paramount importance is attributed to an edict I signed recently and structures being established at the moment -- in particular, a government commission which will be chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Irakli Menagharishvili. Working groups have been established. The same sort of commissions and groups should be established in rayons and towns. [passage indistinct] A battle has started. This will be a long and complex battle and I agree with Deputy Prime Minister Menagharishvili that much will depend on how we succeed in destroying any kind of support for drug trafficking within the law enforcement bodies. Playing with drugs and especially patronizing drug trafficking must be declared a dreadful crime. I am for making laws stricter. Of course, parliament will make the ultimate decision but, if needed, I can use my right of legislative initiative to speed up drafting laws and to set conditions for the parliament to create a legal basis for fighting drug addiction and drug trafficking. [Oniani] Talks pertaining to the Abkhazian issue continued last week. How should the results of our activities be seen today in light of the Moscow meeting in May? Another question: It was said on television yesterday that we did not capture Gudauta because Shevardnadze thought that this would result in the genocide of Abkhazians and psychologically that was not the aim of the Georgian side. Could you comment on this, because it is not very explicit? [Shevardnadze] [passage omitted] A meeting in Moscow has been arranged for 10 May. Roughly the same parties as in Geneva will be involved there. The representation may be wider in certain issues. I would say that if the 10 May Moscow meeting fails to pass a decisive and serious resolution under the UN aegis, securing all conditions for a safe return of refugees that would be acceptable to us, we will be obliged rather than forced to appeal to the CIS. [passage indistinct] There is a third version combining the two. According to this, there will be military forces in accordance with the CIS summit concept and UN observers. However, this combination would be more complicated, I suppose. We are rather short of time and I believe the UN representatives will seriously consider compressing the time so that the UN accomplishes its mission. If it does not, we will turn to the CIS and will have everything done within a CIS framework. As for the question pertaining to last night's television program, I can say that the question was asked in such a way as to imply that Shevardnadze was concerned about danger and so on. My God, some people enjoy turning inside out 100,000 times what I have said 10,000 times. I have explained why all this happened so many times. There were not even any plans to enter Gudauta, just as there were no plans to stop in Sukhumi. There were even no plans to enter Sukhumi. I did not issue an order to enter Sukhumi. This was an unauthorized action. And now it is being interpreted in a special way. I think that, having entered Sukhumi, the troops should not have stopped there. We spent [word indistinct] days in Sukhumi and no one knows how we spent these days. You all know that. Later, after Sukhumi, our troops were in Leselidze, Gantiadi, and Gudauta and then the question of joining those troops by marching from Sukhumi through Gudauta was put forward, but it was too late. Strong defense lines and covering forces had been created there. A question was asked whether to enter Gudauta or not. Then I expressed my opinion, indicating that it would be wrong to enter Gudauta. There would be heavy casualties. Of course many thousands of Georgians would be killed but the Abkhazians who were there would be exterminated. I do not think anyone can see anything odd in the fact that the head of state demonstrated certain caution and care about people. We can call it genocide or simply elimination. This was the case. But this probably was not the only thing. I am saying this for the first time. Marching into Gudauta meant a virtually direct clash between Russian and Georgian Armed Forces. This was the issue then. [passage omitted] Everyone must realize that it was not just like that that we could march into Gudauta, and because we did not do it, we lost everything. But apparently we have not lost absolutely everything because we did not go for Gudauta. You are all well aware what a direct clash with Russia Armed Forces would mean. Everyone knows why it was like this, what forces were accumulated at Gudauta Bombora airport and the adjacent territory, how much armament was concentrated there, and many other things. This is my answer: we could not act otherwise. [Oniani] There is no logic in demanding that the government admit officially that Russia was fighting against us in Abkhazia on one hand and on claiming that we could capture Gudauta and did not do so on the other hand, because if Russia fought against us and Russian forces were involved in it, no one would give up Gudauta. [Shevardnadze] This kind of talk has to be stopped, too. Some say that we have to declare that we were and we still are in a state of war with Russia. They did not realize then and fail to realize now what effect this would have. [passage omitted] [Oniani] Mr. Shevardnadze, you visited the Tavtavi agricultural scientific and production organization yesterday and familiarized yourself with its activities. What are your impressions? [Shevardnadze] I spoke yesterday at the meeting attended by scientists, practical workers, experts, and in the first instance the staff of Tavtavi and the management of the organization. [passage omitted] The less we talk about the country having been ruined and about the country being doomed and beyond salvation, and the more we think of the available resources and possibilities which remain unused and which do not require investing billions, the better. Here is one concrete example. What can be done by cultivating soya? No country can survive without fats. We are importing fat just by grams. We sell 200 grams of margarine a month to the population and think that this is the height of delight. But life cannot go on like this. [passage omitted] Georgia seems to be created for the purpose of cultivating soya. I said yesterday that in 1905-1910 some 360,000 pounds of soya was exported from Kutaisi to Japan. We have forgotten all this. I returned from my visit very encouraged. The people there care about production. We have certain foreign credits we can invest in this business. We can after all buy a factory. We can conclude a contract with farmers on good and favorable terms. A possibility will probably be found to pay them in kind, or in dollars so that they are able to safeguard their life. The main thing is that we have to create an owner, a proprietor, I mean a proprietor in science, in industry, and a proprietor in breeding this culture. I am deeply convinced that if we take to this business using all our potential fully, I mean the scientific potential, an industrial potential and all our experience, the harvest will be miraculous. [passage omitted] If we add the production of rape which provides huge long-term effects, and which also provides a large quantity of vegetable oil, we will be able to satisfy our own requirements. The development of cattle production will take a little longer and we have to search for ways to do this. Although the meeting could have been held without me, I went there yesterday to say that we possess huge reserves. [passage omitted] [Oniani] The parliamentary majority made a statement last week about the necessity for drastic economic reforms. During your speech at the meeting with the law enforcement bodies you said that the implementation of decisions made in the economic sphere is essential. Does this mean that a decision has already been made and really drastic economic reforms will be implemented in the very near future? [Shevardnadze] I have long been aware that without drastic economic reforms the country will not be able to overcome the crisis and [words indistinct]. But in order to speak seriously about drastic reforms we needed basic preconditions -- I mean, we had to prevent the danger of a civil war and help the country to escape the state of war. Now, we have an opportunity to draw breath. It has also been necessary to establish basic order. One can hardly speak of drastic economic reforms without establishing basic order. At present, this precondition is also being created. [passage omitted] For me, a decision on the implementation of drastic economic reforms already exists. The essence of the activities is to speed up the process and we are creating grounds to go ahead in this direction. Drastic measures are necessary for the creation of [word indistinct] of money. We have had talks on this subject and I think that by the end of April we will know what to do and what actions are to be taken to bring the economy into a relatively healthy state. A drastic turn is necessary toward ownership. I dream of the time when every citizen is as proprietor. Every citizen must have a certain share in the wealth created over hundreds of years. This may be production or commercial spheres or any other. [passage omitted] Drastic measures are also required to create the most favorable conditions for foreign investments. There is competition in this field, too. Investments stream down to countries where the most favorable conditions exist. Conditions for this can be created by geography, geopolitics, relative order, and so on, but unless there is a taxation system stimulating investors to come here, to settle down, and lay firm grounds for himself in order to help us and gain something for himself, no large-scale foreign investments will enter Georgia. Also drastic measures must be taken in the fight against corruption. I have often spoken about this. Corruption will nip in the bud any kind of initiative. A proprietor's work will be made futile if this disease gets into the whole structures of the huge state institutions and lawenforcement bodies. [passage omitted] In concluding our present conversation I would like to say that we shall be able to come out of the crisis only by drastic reforms, and the time is ripe for this. [passage omitted]
