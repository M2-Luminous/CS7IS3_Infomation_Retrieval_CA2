[Adams] No, never. Where did you get that idea from? [Correspondent] Are you acquainted with the persons who carried out this terrorist action? [Adams] No. You forget that the Sinn Fein is separate from the IRA. [Correspondent] If you are not acquainted with IRA leaders, how can you make the IRA stop its armed operations? [Adams] One does not have to know the IRA activists personally in order to move things along. My wish is to demilitarize the Anglo-Irish conflict. Two armed groups are facing each other in this conflict, the British Army and the militant pro-British groups from Northern Ireland on the one hand, and the relatively smaller IRA on the other. They must all lay down their arms at the same time. [Correspondent] You are the Irish politician with the greatest influence on the IRA leadership because of your origins as a Catholic-Republican resistance fighter. You cannot say you have no connection with the IRA leadership. [Adams] I have never dissociated myself from the IRA. That would be a dishonorable thing to do. But while I am politically active, the IRA is an armed, secret organization. I would like it to stop its actions. [Correspondent] Do you see any chance of that? [Adams] The IRA is not going to stop unilaterally. In order to speed the peace process along, I would like the British Government to commence talks with our Sinn Fein. Then I could go to the IRA and, hopefully, offer it a packet of solutions that would permit it to reach a final decision on future policy. The British Army has been trying to beat the IRA for 25 years. But the IRA has not been beatable. On the contrary, it looks as if the IRA could continue its armed actions forever. [Correspondent] In other words, war to the very last? [Adams] No. For Ireland, there is no military solution. We have a political problem here, and it needs a political solution. I have been trying to break the military stalemate for years. Several times the IRA has publicly said that the initiative coming from me and from John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic party in Northern Ireland, could provide the basis for peace. Hume and I suggested a roundtable of all parties involved. [Correspondent] Your credibility as a man of peace collapsed when you were one of the pall-bearers of the coffin of the IRA terrorist Thomas Begley, who killed nine persons in a bomb attack in Belfast's Shankill Road. Does this gesture not have the effect of a nod of approval to violence? [Adams] What is violence? There is institutionalized violence, the violence of the state. I was a victim of this violence when the British Army locked me up for five years. [Correspondent] Let us not get philosophical. What do you say to the murder of innocent civilians? [Adams] I am against that, of course. What happened in Shankill Road was unforgivable and wrong. [Correspondent] Then why do you help carry Begley's coffin? [Adams] The man was dead. Why should I not carry his coffin at his funeral? I am not going to leave Thomas Begley's family alone in their grief. I would feel the same way about any family that loses a 19 year old son. We cannot make teenagers responsible for this conflict -- neither British soldiers, nor young Protestants, nor IRA volunteers. [Correspondent] After 25 years of bloodshed and 3,400 deaths, you said during your recent U.S. visit that "this generation is going to see peace in Ireland." What makes you so sure? [Adams] The world climate of solving conflicts. If I had said five years ago that Nelson Mandela would be released from prison and become South Africa's president-designate, everyone would have thought I was joking. The conflict seemed insoluble. [Correspondent] Just like the conflict in Northern Ireland. [Adams] I hope the progress in Africa also provides a signal for people here in Ireland. The turnabout in South Africa occurred because Mandela's enemy, the government of Pretoria, was prepared to swallow the bitter pill and make concessions that set the process in motion. The government in London should learn something from that. [Correspondent] Nonetheless, the London government has already taken a big step and held secret talks with the IRA and Sinn Fein. Do you think Prime Minister Major is determined to find a political solution for Northern Ireland? [Adams] British public opinion would surely approve the taking of risks in order to achieve peace in Ireland, but unfortunately Major is too much a victim of the obsessions of his party's right wing, as well as being a victim of the Unionists, the Northern Irish party that wants Northern Ireland to belong to Great Britain at all costs. Major's weakness is an obstacle to a peaceful solution. That is why we must seek other ways of attaining our goal. [Correspondent] London treats you like a persona non grata. You cannot travel to England, Scotland, or Wales, and you cannot be heard or seen on radio or television. [Adams] That is just one example of the British Government's stupidity. [Correspondent] You and your family survive all attacks. Once you were hit by five bullets when you entered a Belfast restaurant. Do you feel in greater danger now that you are involved in the peace process? [Adams] I feel no hatred toward the people who tried to shoot me, nor toward those who might be planning to do so now. That is the way things are here. Men act this way because they see me as a danger to their interests. There is only one way: The armed wings of the radical pro-British groups must be involved in the peace process just like the IRA. [Correspondent] Are you really prepared to sit down at the negotiating table with your archenemies the Protestants? [Adams] This has nothing to do with religion. My enemies are not the Protestants. We are talking about political groups, and they must all take part in the talks. There must be dialogue without preconditions. Certain people have been excluded for too long, and that is why no progress has been made. [Correspondent] With your readiness for compromise, you will also turn IRA hardliners into your opponents. For them, your policy means treason. Do you not think that the next bullet fired at you might come from an IRA weapon? [Adams] No. The IRA would have to join the back of the line of my potential assassins.
