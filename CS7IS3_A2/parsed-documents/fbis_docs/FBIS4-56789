Alhassan stated today in Havana during a news conference that his government will maintain its peaceful policy, but will be firm against any attack from the Republic of Cameroon. The Nigerian ambassador provided broad information on the border conflict between the two countries in the Bakassi peninsula zone which has always belonged to Nigeria, as confirmed by several treaties, although Cameroon is now expressing some designs on this territory. The ambassador added that the strengthening of Nigerian forces, to maintain order in that region, has been misinterpreted by the neighboring country, which conducted three military attacks in February 1994. He added that Nigeria will never be the first to attack, but that its armed forces are prepared for anything.
