FR940928-2-00111 FR940928-2-00067 3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Because the changes only delete an unnecessary reactor trip and do not actually alter the plant, the proposed changes do not affect the failure values for any system or component. Accident analyses have shown that all relevant, existing event acceptance criteria have been satisfied without taking credit for the deleted reactor trip; therefore, the event acceptance criteria are not being revised. Because neither the failure values nor the acceptance criteria are affected, the proposed changes have no affect on the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Edgar, Esq., Newman and Holtzinger, 1615 L Street, N.W., Suite 1000, Washington, D.C. 20036. NRC Project Director: William D. Beckner. TU Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;445 and 50&hyph;446, Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, Somervell County, Texas Date of amendment request: August 12, 1994. Brief description of amendments: The proposed amendments would revise the Administrative Controls section of the technical specifications to reflect changes to the licensee's organization, change the submittal due date for the Monthly Operating Report, and delete provisions that will be relocated to other controlled documents. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and reflect new organizational position titles, reassigned managerial responsibilities, a change in the required submittal due date of the Monthly Operating Report, and the relocation of selected Technical Specification Administrative Controls to licensee controlled documents. The proposed organizational changes include manager position title updates as follows: ``Group Vice President, Nuclear Engineering and Operations'' changed to ``Group Vice President, Nuclear Production''; ``Vice President, Nuclear Operation'' changed to ``Vice President of Nuclear Operations''; and ``Shift Supervisor'' changed to ``Shift Manager''. Manager responsibilities remain unchanged except the annual management directive concerning the Shift Supervisor's control room command function which is reassigned to the Group Vice President, Nuclear Production. Additionally, responsibilities of the Vice President, Nuclear Operations and Plant Manager are proposed for reassignment to either the Vice President of Nuclear Operations or the Plant Manager. In all cases, responsibilities will continue to be assigned to appropriately qualified individuals. The proposed change in the submittal due date of the Monthly Operating Report is to provide additional time to facilitate data compilation and report preparation, review and approval for two operating units. This change does not alter any data or information already reported. The proposed administrative control relocations include details of minimum shift operations crew staffing, method of onsite and offsite review and audit, selected reportable event actions, review of security and emergency plans and associated implementing procedures, requirements for record retention, and program elements for radiation protection, process control and radiological environmental monitoring. These administrative controls are addressed by other regulatory requirements and are relocated to other licensee documents (i.e., Final Safety Analysis Report, Emergency Plan, Security Plan, Offsite Dose Calculation Manual) which have adequate change control to ensure that intended plant design/safety functions will be maintained. No design basis accidents are affected by these proposed administrative changes as they do not impact nor affect accident analysis assumptions. Therefore, accident analyses assumptions are preserved and there is no change in the probability or consequences of any previously evaluated accident. 2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes to update organizational position titles and reassign responsibilities will not delete any responsibility/function already designated in the Technical Specifications. All given management activities will continue to be performed by qualified individuals. The proposed change in the submittal due date of the Monthly Operating Report does not alter any data or information already reported. The administrative control relocations retain adequate regulatory basis to ensure that intended plant design/safety functions will be maintained. These changes are administrative in nature and do not affect the design or operation of any system, structure, or component in the plant. Accordingly, no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety, nor have any new initiating events been identified as a result of the proposed changes. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes involve the Administrative Controls Section of the CPSES Units 1 and 2 Technical Specifications and provide for updating organizational position titles, reassigning managerial responsibilities/functions, changing the required submittal due date for the Monthly Operating Report, and relocating administrative controls to other controlled licensee documents. These changes are administrative in nature and do not directly affect any protective boundaries nor impact the safety limits for the protective boundaries. The relocated requirements retain adequate regulatory basis for continued proper administrative review and plant configuration control to ensure that actions prescribed in plant operating procedures are maintained so as not to impact the plant's margin of safety. Therefore, there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
