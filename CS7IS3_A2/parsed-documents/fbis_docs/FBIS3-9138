Simic was interviewed by the JOURNAL DE GENEVE daily, which introduced him as the first Yugoslav politician to visit Zagreb after Croatia violently seceded from the former Yugoslav Federation in 1991. Speaking about the Moslem-Croat agreement on setting up a federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Simic said the Serbs would welcome the deal if it was to bring about the cessation of hostilities and peace in the republic. The paper reminded its readers that Belgrade had made it clear to U.S. Presidential Envoy Charles Redman that there could be no solution to the Bosnian crisis without Bosnian Serbs and that political and military aspects of the situation could not be overlooked. The Yugoslav Government maintains that the European Union has lost credibility in trying to resolve the crisis in ex-Yugoslavia, of which it has informed President of the E.U. Ministerial Council Karolos Papoulias of Greece during his recent visit to Belgrade, JOURNAL DE GENEVE said. Paraphrasing Simic, it went on to explain that the European Community last December proposed that sanctions against Yugoslavia be lifted if Bosnian Serbs made territorial concessions to the Moslems. This condition has been met, the paper said, but the Serbs now have the impression that they have been pushed to the side. Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) insists on the adherence to the democratic formula adopted at the Geneva-based International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, according to which a solution to the Bosnian War is to be negotiated by all three sides to the conflict, the paper explained. It quoted Simic as saying that the Yugoslav Government did not want to be directly involved in the upcoming talks in Zagreb between Croatia and the Republic of Serb Krajina, and that its dialogue with Croatia should be conducted on an equal footing. This implies the lifting of the absurd anti-Yugoslav sanctions which have harmed both the Serb people and countries neighbouring on Yugoslavia.
