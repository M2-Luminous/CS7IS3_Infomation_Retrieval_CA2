R. Linscott] [Text] Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi of kwaZulu says he is not dismayed by the prospect of losing office by staying out of the April election. Interviewed at Ulundi, he said he would continue the political struggle using his traditional power base as chief adviser to King Goodwill Zwelithini. "My leadership was not built up by the homelands policy. I'll be part of the struggle -- my king, myself and my people." He was not prepared to speculate as to tactics. But he said the outlook was bleak. The mood of people on the ground was ugly -- "I've never known it like this before" -- and it could get worse and become difficult to control. He said he was not responsible for keeping the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] out of the election -- it had been forced on him by the Government and the ANC [African National Congress], which refused to consider federation as an option. The logical next phase was the king's demand for the restoration of the Zulu sovereignty of 1834. "When they rejected the federal option and could not accept our amendments, I was disarmed in my relationship with the King. There was nothing I could say to him. I had not delivered on self-rule." He said it was pointless to participate in elections for a non-federal dispensation, something he had worked for for 20 years. The Buthelezi Commission and the kwaZulu/Natal Indaba [meeting] had been rejected. And the IFP's contribution to constitutional negotiations had been rejected. In 1910 the whites were fooled. They were bluffed by Smuts that they were going to get a federation, but in the end there was no federation. We're not prepared to walk that road. I can understand that whites are concerned at us staying out of elections but they have to appreciate that for my people it is nothing new. We never had the vote before. Nothing much has changed. "I don't know why the Government and the ANC reject federalism. It is a democratic way to protect the interests of regions and minorities. What's wrong with the system in countries like the United States, Germany, Canada and Australia?" He denied being a secessionist. "I refused to take independence because although we went into Union kicking and screaming, history has made us South Africans. We don't want to be deprived of that." The king's stand had been forced by events, he said. It was now out of his own hands as chief minister. Asked whether it was feasible for elections to be held in Natal/kwaZulu without IFP participation, and whether a subsequent government could be effective, Buthelezi declined to speculate. "That is their problem, not mine."
