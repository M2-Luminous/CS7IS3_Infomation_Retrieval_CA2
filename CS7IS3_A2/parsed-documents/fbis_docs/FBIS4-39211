He also gave up his seat as a member of the Saeima today. His powers as a deputy were suspended by parliament at the end of April because the minister's name was discovered in a card index of agents of the former KGB. At the same time, Andrejevs issued a statement in which he expresses the hope that his resignation will "help society and legislators realize the need to make changes to Latvia's laws." He believes that only a proven fact should serve as the reason for punishing or limiting the activity of an individual. It is the imperfect nature of Latvia's laws, in which the concept of "collaboration" is in need of clarification, and also the reaction in the country to his open letter in which he described what his contacts with the KGB had been, that made the minister decide to resign. As already reported, Latvian laws do not permit those who collaborated with the KGB to be deputies or occupy certain state posts.
