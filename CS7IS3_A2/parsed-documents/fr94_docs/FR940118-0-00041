FR940118-0-00041 FR940118-0-00011 Section 644.32(d)(1) accurately reflects both the intent of the 1992 Amendments to the HEA and the Secretary's commitment to coordination. Waivers of the requirement for a full-time director are available under §644.32(d)(3) if an applicant can show that efforts to coordinate among projects will be hindered by not allowing one person to direct more than one project. The Secretary believes that in many cases the size and scope of an EOC project require the attention of a full-time director. The average EOC project receives more than a million dollars over the course of a project period and serves more than eight thousand participants. Given the size and scope of EOC projects, the Secretary believes that the appropriateness of allowing a part-time director must be evaluated with great care. Changes: None. Comment: Several commenters suggested that the Secretary should change §644.32(c)(3), relating to records of educational benefits. The commenters requested that the Secretary eliminate the phrase ``the specific educational benefits to the participants that resulted from the services'' because keeping a record of how each participant benefited from the services would be too burdensome. The commenters suggested that §644.32(c)(3) require only that grantees keep a record of ``the specific educational benefits received by the participant.'' One commenter suggested that the Secretary should not change the recordkeeping requirement in §644.32(c)(3) because it formed the basis for collecting valuable statistics. Discussion: The Secretary agrees that the phrase ``that resulted from the services'' implies that a grantee must demonstrate and record a causal relationship between services and benefits. The Secretary believes that such a record is not necessary to indicate a benefit, particularly in instances where the services provided can be deemed to be benefits in and of themselves. Changes: The recordkeeping requirement at §644.32(c)(3) is changed to read ``the specific educational benefits received by the participant.''
