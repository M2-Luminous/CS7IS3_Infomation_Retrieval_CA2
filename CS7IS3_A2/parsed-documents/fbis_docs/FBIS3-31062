Fekete report: "Orban's Key Question: Will Bekesi Beat Sandor Nagy"] [Text] Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], will also run as an individual candidate at the elections in Szekesfehervar's electoral district No. 1. This was one of the decisions at the two-day weekend meeting of the Fidesz's national committee. After the meeting, in an interview with NEPSZABADSAG, in addition to talking about relations between the Fidesz and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], Orban also said that the Fidesz's talks with the National Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary [MSZOSZ] are made rather difficult by the fact that [MSZOSZ Chairman] Sandor Nagy is ahead of Laszlo Bekesi on the Hungarian Socialist Party's [MSZP] national list. By way of introduction, Orban repeated that the Fidesz members in Szekesfehervar had asked him to run in the elections as an individual candidate; he asked the national committe's support for this, which he received after some debate. Many members thought that by running as individual candidate, the party's first man can only play a smaller part in the national campaign and he exposes himself to unnecessary and unseemly attacks, and his possible failure might have a negative effect on the party's performance in other districts. At the same time, Orban thought that the British election system should be taken as an example, where those people who had themselves assessed in the campaign as individual candidates have the biggest chance of becoming ministers or state secretaries. The Fidesz will begin the fight for mandates at different times and in different ways in each county. It is planning a brief and positive campaign whose "grand national opening" will be at the beginning of March. Orban said that his party certainly does not want to commit the same mistake as the MSZP -- not intending to nominate a prime ministerial candidate until the final results of the elections are known -- therefore, the Fidesz will name its prime ministerial candidate at the national opening of the campaign. Talking about the Fidesz-SZDSZ relationship, Orban said: I trust that relations between the two parties will continue to be correct and balanced in the future, too. It is natural for minor or bigger conflicts to arise between two rivals, however, considering the election alliance, it is expedient to reduce the number of these conflicts to the minimum. It has to be accepted that the two parties can only cooperate. "According to our surveys, if either of the parties looked for other election allies or future coalition partners then it would significantly reduce its election chances." In an interview, [Fidesz official] Tamas Deutsch said that certain forces in the SZDSZ would prefer cooperation with the MSZP to the parties of the liberal bloc. Not disputing this, Orban pointed out that if the SZDSZ came noticeably closer to the MSZP, or possibly started talks on cooperation between the two parties, then this would prove the claims made by the politicians of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] in the past three years. They claimed that the two parties had evolved from the same cultural and social roots and set rather similar goals for themselves. However, cooperation with the MSZP would destroy the SZDSZ. A significant section of the SZDSZ's membership joined the party at a time when it most loudly advocated its anti-communist views. Anyone who knows the provincial SZDSZ organizations is aware that rapprochement with the MSZP would lead to the SZDSZ's splitting into two. At its congress held in Debrecen in March 1993, the Fidesz accepted its election program. Orban said that, in the past year, major changes that would require a significant adjustment of the program have not happened in Hungary. The party continuously coordinates its goals with the organizations of interest representation and interest protection. They will first talk to the representatives of employers, and they wish to hold discussions with the trade unions in early April. As is known, the chairman of the MSZOSZ, the biggest trade union federation, is second on the MSZP's national list. In connection with this, Orban said that this issue even evoked serious debates in the Fidesz. The party's economists claimed that Laszlo Bekesi's economic program was worth accepting as a basis for discussions. Three years ago, I said the same on this issue, namely that the MDF's program was full of liberal elements and we can see what has happend to that, Orban reminded. The key issue for us is whether Bekesi is before or after Sandor Nagy on the MSZP's list. Naturally, if Nagy is further forward, we still have to talk to the trade unions, but perhaps, in this case, not on the level of the chairman. Finally, Orban said that after the elections, we have to expect a strengthening of the extreme right wing and radical right-wing forces. So far, these forces have either been part of the government coalition or, if they were out of it, the conservative government was still acceptable to them. Although they criticized the government regularly, they did not make social or economic demands on it. After 1994, the situation will be different; especially if the trade unions, namely the representatives of the employees' interests, get into Parliament or government through the MSZP. After this, it will be the radical right-wing forces, rather than the various trade unions that will make demands contrary to economic rationality; the reduction of the retirement age for example. It will be these forces that will radicalize the strata of society that are becoming poorer. In reply to whether this reasoning would justify the MDF's participation in the next coalition, Orban said that this can also be a solution, but he would rather that a government supported by a broad coalition be established after the elections. It will not be possible to govern the country with a 51 to 52 percent majority between 1994 and 1998. Anyone who keeps announcing with whom he is unwilling to govern is acting against the country's interests, he stated. A party chairman only acts wisely if he either does not talk about the coalition possibilities or, if he does, he keeps as many avenues open as possible.
