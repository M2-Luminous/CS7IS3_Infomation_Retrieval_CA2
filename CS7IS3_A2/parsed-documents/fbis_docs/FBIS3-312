Addressing a meeting in Durban last night, Mr. de Klerk said the government had not been consulted on this issue, and that he needed a concrete proposal to be tabled before it could be considered. However, he had serious reservations as to whether international mediation could address the issues at stake. Mr. de Klerk said he was open to negotiations to reach agreement for implementation after the elections. Mr. de Klerk said he was disappointed with the Freedom Alliance's actions regarding the amendments proposed by the government to break the constitutional deadlock. He described the alliances' reaction as inadequate, as the government's proposals address the core of the problems. Mr. de Klerk said he rejected the alliance's efforts to play down the latest amendments.
