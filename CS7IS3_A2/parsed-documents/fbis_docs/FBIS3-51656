CORFO [Production Development Corporation] Chairman Rene Aveliuk said the issue took place in 1973, when the Arauco Fishing Company, a CORFO branch which no longer exists, rented Russian ships. He said that the Chilean Government knows what to do over a Russian Government demand for compensation. [Begin Aveliuk recording, in progress] ... CORFO believes it has absolutely nothing to do with them. This is obvious because it was an associated enterprise, which is very different from CORFO. Everything is over, concluded, and closed. This is what we have said and this is what we will continue to say. [end recording]
