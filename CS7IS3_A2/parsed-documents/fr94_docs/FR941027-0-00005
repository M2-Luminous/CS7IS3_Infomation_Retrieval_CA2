FR941027-0-00005 FR941027-0-00002 In compliance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR part 1320) implementing the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) and Section 3504 of that Act, the information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in this rule have been approved by OMB under control number 0572&hyph;0090. Comments concerning these requirements should be directed to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for USDA, room 10102, NEOB, Washington, DC, 20503. The Administrator has determined that this rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. The program is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials, with the exception of applications for Project Feasibility Studies. This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.854, Rural Economic Development Loans and Grants. This catalog is available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402&hyph;9325. Background On February 15, 1989, REA published the final rule, 7 CFR 1709, subpart B, in the Federal Register (54 FR 6867) that implemented the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program, also known as the Cushion of Credit Payments Program, established by Section 313 of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (Act). This program provides funds to Act borrowers for the promotion of rural economic development and job creation projects. On September 27, 1990, REA changed the designation of this rule from 7 CFR part 1709 to part 1703 (55 FR 39393) and on September 25, 1992, published an amendment (57 FR 44314) to refine and improve the structure of the rule. On March 14, 1994, REA published a final rule (59 FR 11702) establishing procedures to approve and administer grants and grants in conjunction with zero-interest loans. On July 28, 1994, a proposed rule was published (59 FR 38378) to amend the rule to enhance the funding potential of Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program (REDLGP) applications from economically devastated areas. This constitutes the finalization of that proposed rule. Synopsis This rule amends the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program as follows: •The Administrator will have the discretion to designate special economic status under the REDLGP selection factors, adding up to 25 points to an applicant's score if at least one of the four conditions outlined in §1703.46(g)(7) has occurred. •The prohibition on funding community antenna television systems or facilities has been reinstated except in special cases as outlined in §1703.17(d). •The provision for disbursement of grant funds has been revised to allow REA Borrowers with limited financial resources, or for other reasons, to receive funds based on invoices from project owners rather than committing their own funds under the reimbursement provision. This arrangement will require prior REA approval. See §1703.22(e). •The definition of ``Rural economic development'' has been revised to clarify REA policy on funding projects located outside rural areas as defined in Section 13 of the Rural Electrification (RE) Act but which provide significant benefits to rural areas. Comments REA received seven comments regarding this regulation, which were taken into consideration in preparing this final rule. Comments were received from the following: (1) Minnesota Rural Electric Association. (2) Riverside County Economic Development Agency, Riverside, California. (3) City of Hollister, California. (4) Maine Ambulatory Care Coalition, Manchester, Maine. (5) Crown Economic Development Corporation, Hanford, California. (6) Merced County Board of Supervisors, Merced, California. (7) Community Development Division, Fresno, California. Of the comments received, one commenter suggested that REA accept ``local'' unemployment data, if available, instead of county-wide data because of significant variances in larger counties. We recognize that large geographical counties are at a disadvantage if only countywide data is accepted. Therefore the use, where appropriate, of State-published information, would be a reasonable alternative and have amended §1703.46(g)(7)(iii) is hereby amended to allow the REA Administrator to consider State-published statistics, provided by the applicant, in those situations where the Census material is clearly not representative of the project location. However, the data must be verifiable and part of a recognized database which reflects information for other areas within the State. One community expressed concern that requiring disbursement of funds up front and awaiting reimbursement could be a hardship on small rural communities. However, this requirement does not actually impact community government entities because the reimbursement policy is applicable only in cases where REA Borrowers receive grants to establish revolving loan funds. This final rule provides special arrangements only for REA Borrowers establishing revolving loan funds, who are unable to fund projects using the reimbursement method. Another comment was that REA's definition of ``rural'' in this rule was too broad and would allow reviewers to fund projects not directly benefiting rural communities. The commenter suggested that the funds either be restricted to the 2500 population limit or controlled by organizations from such communities, that at least 70 percent of the funds be spent in communities under 2500 and that the urban entity provide at least 60 percent in matching funds. All REDLGP applications are reviewed by the REA staff and selected based on the evaluation criteria outlined in §1703.46, much of which is based on benefit to rural areas. Moreover, REA borrowers serve primarily rural areas, and they are well-suited to determine that the final benefits are directed toward the local community. As discussed previously in this preamble, the rule has been revised to allow projects which are not located in rural areas. However, those projects must result in significant benefit to rural areas.
