Addressing the District Bar here, Nawaz suspected the claims of US Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott that his visit to Pakistan was a complete success. "If they want to peep in our nuclear programme, they should first mind their own nuclear programme," he said. He said US officials had also met him "but I told them that we want friendly relations only and would not beg for aid". Pointing out that India was far ahead of Pakistan in the production of conventional weapons, he said the country's nuclear programme was the only deterrence to India. Rejecting the capping of the country's nuclear programme in exchange of F-16 aircraft, he feared that the F-16s would be of little use once the nuclear programme was capped. He also warned that the inspection of the nuclear facilities was tantamount to accepting restrictions at every stage of development of the programme. Condemning the rollback of the Motorway project, he asked Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto not to cancel the programme only because it was started during his government. He said [Uzbekistan] President Islam Karimov had also expressed his concern over the cancellation of the project and said he would not be keen to expand ties if Benazir was not interested in boosting mutual relations.
