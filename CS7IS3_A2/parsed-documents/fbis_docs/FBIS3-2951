A person in charge of the bank pointed out that the state budgetary deficits must be covered through issuing state treasury bonds. Earlier, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is also governor of the People's Bank of China, said: "No bank should be treated as a teller or an accountant for the government or a government department." All the above information suggests that China is trying to set up a relatively independent Central Bank, policy-related banks, and commercial banks, so as to meet the needs of the market economy and bring about the convergence of China's financial system with the international financial system. Without doubt, the first step China is to take in financial reform is to change the People's Bank of China into a real Central Bank, to set up policy-related banks, and to change professional banks into commercial banks. As the central bank, the People's Bank of China will have two major functions: Stabilizing the currency and supervising financial matters. In the future, the People's Bank will not provide funds to government departments or supply money directly to industrial and commercial enterprises to help solve their problems. Instead, it will focus on the efficient exercise of its powers to supply money, adjust reference interest rates, manage central funds, and control the total amount of credit, while the functions of its branches will include supervising and managing financial matters, conducting investigations, compiling statistics, making analyses, laterally adjusting the money supply [heng xiang tiao cun tiao ji 2897 0686 7333 1407 6148 0495], managing the state treasury, providing funds, controlling foreign exchange, and settling combined accounts. The second step is to set up three policy-related banks -- the State Development Bank, the China Agricultural Development Bank, and the China Import and Export Credit Bank -- which will be placed under the supervision of the central bank. The three banks will have their capital provided by the Finance Ministry; they also can raise money through issuing bonds to banking institutions. The sole function of these three banks is to provide loans on government instructions for the purposes of production, development, and foreign trade. They are expected only to break even, rather than to make profit. The third step is to gradually change the existing professional banks into real commercial banks. The Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the People's Construction Bank of China, which are existing professional banks on the mainland, gradually will be transformed into commercial banks. A number of commercial banks have been set up on the mainland over the last few years, including the Communications Bank of China, the CITIC (China International Trust and Investment Corporation) Industrial Bank, the Everbright Bank, the Huaxia Bank, the Zhaoshang Bank, the Fujian Xingye Bank, the Guangdong Development Bank, the Shenzhen Development Bank, and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. The total capital of all these national and regional commercial banks, some of which are collectively owned or joint-stock enterprises, has reached 100 billion yuan. These banks enjoy a more rapid capital turnover and a higher rate of loan recovery because they only provide mortgage loans under their systems of fund management. However, as these banks have gone into operation for a short period and the government has yet to formulate appropriate laws for commercial banks, their management remains to be standardized and improved. While commenting on changing the way the bank operates, Wang Qiren, chairman of the board of directors of the Bank of China, believed that it is necessary to draw on the experience of foreign banks, especially commercial banks in Hong Kong and Macao. He said: "The mainland and Hong Kong banking industries have built closer and closer relations. A total of 13 Hong Kong banks have set up 35 branches, 24 offices, and six joint-venture banking institutions on the mainland, while various mainland professional banks, such as the Bank of China and the People's Construction Bank of China, also have set up branches in Hong Kong. It is necessary to make appropriate use of Hong Kong commercial banks' experience in management and operation. However, we must change the operational mechanism gradually." Since the beginning of this year, the National People's Congress has stepped up financial legislation and will promulgate the "Law of the People's Bank of China," the "Banking Law of the People's Republic of China," the "Law on Commercial Banks," the "Stock Law," and the "Bill Law" in turn, indicating that China is planning to put banking system reform onto a legal basis.
