FR940222-0-00049 FR940222-0-00018 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 1 [ET Docket No. 93&hyph;266; FCC 93&hyph;551] Review of the Pioneer's Preference Rules AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In October 1993, the Commission initiated a review of its pioneer's preference rules to assess the effect of competitive bidding authority recently enacted by Congress. In this First Report and Order the Commission concludes that any changes to its pioneer's preference rules will not be applied to the three proceedings in which Tentative Decisions have been issued. The action is intended to ensure the equitable treatment of pioneer's preference applicants in these proceedings. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Rodney Small, Office of Engineering and Technology, (202) 653&hyph;8116. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Commission's First Report and Order adopted December 23, 1993, and released January 28, 1994.

Summary of First Report and Order 1. In the Notice the Commission initiated a review of the effect on its pioneer's preference rules of new authority to assign licenses by competitive bidding. Comment was solicited, inter alia, on whether repeal or amendment of the pioneer's preference rules should apply to the three proceedings in which Tentative Decisions, but not final Orders, have been issued that address preference requests. 2. In response to the Notice, American Personal Communications (APC) requested that the Commission address early and separately whether to apply to the 2 GHz broadband Personal Communications Services (PCS) proceeding, GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314, any changes or repeal of the pioneer's preference rules. Most parties concurred with APC that it would be unfair to apply any modifications to the pioneer's preference rules to the 2 GHz broadband PCS proceeding and to two additional proceedings in which Tentative Decisions have been made. With regard to amending or repealing the rules with respect to the 2 GHz PCS preference applicants in particular, several parties expressed agreement with APC that it would be arbitrary for the Commission to treat the 2 GHz PCS preference applicants different from the 900 MHz PCS applicants solely because the Commission bifurcated its PCS proceeding and reached conclusions on narrowband issues first. See GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314/ET Docket No. 92&hyph;100. 3. The Commission has issued Tentative Decisions in two proceedings in addition to 2 GHz PCS. With respect to the 28 GHz Local Multipoint Distribution Services (LMDS) proceeding, CC Docket No. 92&hyph;297, the Commission tentatively awarded a pioneer's preference to Suite 12 Group. Suite 12 argued that if the Commission decides to eliminate or alter significantly the pioneer's preference rules, equity demands that the tentative grants, including that for LMDS, be judged in accordance with the existing rules. With respect to the 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) proceeding, ET Docket No. 92&hyph;28, the Commission tentatively decided that no pioneer's preference award was merited. Motorola Satellite Communications, Inc. argued that there is no reason to change the preference rules as they apply to this proceeding and that authorization of competitive bidding does not undermine the basis of the Commission's decision to consider pioneer's preference requests in this proceeding because the MSS applications are not mutually exclusive.
