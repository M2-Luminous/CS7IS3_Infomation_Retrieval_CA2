Referring to the changes made, he emphasized that the PNTCD views the appointment of a civilian at the helm of the Army as inopportune and that General Niculae Spiroiu's replacement will exert a negative effect, while the presence of Iosif Gavril Chiuzbaian as head of the Ministry of Justice could be beneficial. Insofar as the replacement of the other ministers is concerned, in the opinion of the PNTCD this looks like a change of cadres. Keeping the prime minister in his position, Coposu continued, proves that the ruling party is trying to avoid parliament control and to postpone early elections. In conclusion, Coposu specified that the PNTCD believes that the reshuffle has not contributed to the consolidation of the government nor has it ensured its stability at home and abroad. We want to recall that Coposu made a similar statement during an earlier program this morning. In addition, the PNTCD leader said that he hopes for a positive conclusion of the current negotiations between the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] and the other political formations, so that by the beginning of summer a viable government may be formed that is able to cope with the current crisis situation. If this is not the case, then early elections are the only solution.
