Or the Nationalist Party Has Been Created in Georgia" -- words between slantlines published in boldface] [Excerpts] Reason: "Up to now, not one of the parties in existence has been able to create such a society where each Georgian is able to harness his potential to the maximum for the well-being of the nation." Aim: "To ensure the permanent existence of the nation." Mission: "To guide the efforts of the Georgian nation toward great aims." Naturally, there is nothing bad in the fact that one more party has been formed but why, after all, a nationalist party? Zaza Vashaqmadze, chairman of the Georgian Nationalist Party: "Nationalist means the same as national and our direct aim proceeds from this. The essence of our activities is to place national consciousness above everything else! If we do not elevate our own national [awareness], nothing will save Georgia." [passage omitted] Whether we like it or not, one more party -- the Georgian Nationalist Party -- has been created in Georgia. In the main, it unites young people aged between 18 and 30, students, lawyers, and economists. [passage omitted]
