Speaking before the Korea-America Friendship Society in a dinner speech, Han predicted an end to confrontational division of the Korean peninsula by the 21st century. To better facilitate this, the Asia-Pacific region needs to strengthen a multilateral cooperation forum and incorporate North Korea in this new order, Han said. The region, for example, could embark on security dialogue, give APEC a bigger role, and cooperate closely with North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and link it with EAEC, the foreign minister said. To prevent NAFTA and EAEC from becoming regional blocs, South Korea and other mid-economy nations of East Asia should link up with both forums in due course, he suggested. "No matter what the situation, South Korea and the United States should continue to work to retain and develop world free trade order and make APEC which connects North America with East Asia the basic framework for the economic order in the Asia-Pacific," said Han.
