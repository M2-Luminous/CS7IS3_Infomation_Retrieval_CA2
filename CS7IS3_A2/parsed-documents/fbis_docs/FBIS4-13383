While in Sri Lanka, the speaker held talks with the Sri Lankan president, his counterpart and a number of Muslim personalities in that country. Nateq-Nuri will visit Malaysia at the end of his three-nation tour which has already brought him to Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Before his departure from Colombo, the speaker met with a number of Sri Lankan Shiite and Sunni Muslim scholars and writers in which he criticized the indifferent attitude that international bodies have adopted towards problems facing Muslims in the world. Nateq-Nuri referred to the deplorable situation in Gorazde where a large number of people have been subject to Serbs attacks in recent days and blamed the biased stance of the international communities towards the issue. He said that international bodies and the NATO were not only watching the genocide of people in Bosnia-Herzegovina but were trying to divert the world's public opinion from the Serbs crimes by the means of a few statements. The speaker said that the U.S. and its allies were trying to annihilate Muslims throughout the world irrespective of being Shiite or Sunni, either living in Iran or in any other part of the world. Calling on the Sri Lankan Muslims to maitain unity, Nateq-Nuri promised that an Iranian delegation would visit Sri Lanka in a near future to study situation of Muslims who have become homeless as a result of Tamil Tigers attacks. About 170,000 Sri Lankan Muslims, residing in northern and eastern parts of the country, have been rendered homeless by Tamil Tigers who oppose the government.
