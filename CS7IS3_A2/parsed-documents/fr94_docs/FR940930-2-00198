FR940930-2-00198 FR940930-2-00067 3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The bases for the TS require that all snubbers whose failure could have an adverse effect on any safety-related systems, be operable. This ensures that the structural integrity of the reactor coolant system and other safety-related systems are maintained during and following a seismic or other event initiating dynamic loads. The bases also discuss clarification and grouping of the general snubber population, snubber listing requirements, visual inspection frequency, and visual acceptance criteria. The proposed TS changes will provide for the same confidence level as that which currently exists in TS for determining snubber operability. The proposed TS changes will continue to maintain the same test scope ratio as that currently provided in the TS. The 10% plan is used at LGS for compensating struts only, and increasing initial sample size to 13.3%, as proposed, will have a negligible effect on the number of struts functionally tested during each interval. No other aspects of the bases associated with snubber surveillance will be affected by these proposed TS changes. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
