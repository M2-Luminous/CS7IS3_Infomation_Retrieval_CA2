In conclusion, the aforementioned communique points out that in view of the fact that the head of state has exceeded his prerogatives through such statements and has seriously obstructed the perquisites of the judicial power, the PNTCD Leadership, Coordination, and Control Bureau has decided to open impeachment proceedings against Romania's president, through its parliamentary representatives, in accordance with Article 95 of the Constitution. Referring to the communique issued by the PNTCD Leadership, Coordination, and Control Bureau on 10 June, Presidency Spokesman Ambassador Traian Chebeleu made the following statement, the contents of which we are presenting in full: I consider the communique of the PNTCD Leadership Bureau as an inadmissible offensive against the president coming from a parliamentary political party. This is a regrettable act, even embarrassing for its authors. The communique's allegations are most serious and devoid of any factual foundation. I do not know when or how Romania's president might have infringed upon the independence of the legal bodies. This is an unfounded accusation that I categorically refute. It is possible that, in its combat program against the country's freely elected president, the PNTCD has run out of all arguments and is now inventing something to artificially provoke tensions and divert the attention of the country's political forces and the parliament from the real problems that have to be solved now. This is painful and, I repeat, embarrassing for the authors of this initiative. So concludes the statement of the presidency's spokesman regarding the communique of the PNTCD Leadership Bureau released today, 10 June 1994, by the ROMPRES agency.
