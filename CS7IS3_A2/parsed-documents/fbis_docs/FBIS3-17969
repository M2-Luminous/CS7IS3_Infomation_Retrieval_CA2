He said that his commission has demanded the resignation of Deputy Prime Ministers Mikalay Kostsikaw and Stanislaw Bryl; Uladzimir Radkevich, head of the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations; chairman of the Board of the Belarusian National Bank [Stanislaw Bahdankevich]; and Defense Minister Pavel Kazlowski. However, A. Lukashenka did not present specific facts, except in the case of Deputy Prime Minister Stanislav Bryl. According to Lukashenka, S. Bryl pulled some strings so that his son could receive a plot of land on which to build a house. Deputy Prime Minister Mikalay Kostsikaw was one of the people on Lukashenka's list that took advantage of services rendered by the governments's renovation and construction administration, and failed to pay the entire amount of money charged by the administration. In addition, A. Lukashenka said that his commission sent a letter to Belarusian Prosecutor General Vasiliy Shaladonov with the request to see that individuals mentioned earlier in the commission's report be persecuted. There are 54 officials, including Foreign Minister Pyotr Krawchanka, named in the report.
