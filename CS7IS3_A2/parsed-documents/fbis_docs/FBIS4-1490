Transvaal Polls MB2804115794 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in Afrikaans 1000 GMT 28 Apr 94 MB2804115794 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network Afrikaans BFN [Text] The National Party has expressed dissatisfaction with the voting in some parts of Northern Transvaal. We spoke to Regional and Land Affairs Minister Andre Fourie this morning on the issue. [Begin recording] [Fourie] Corruption is an ugly word, but I have no doubt that there are irregularities at voting stations. We have sufficient evidence. Our election agents will be prepared to make sworn statements if necessary to prove this. At some of the polling stations things are just not right. [Correspondent Danie Hefers] What are these irregularities? [Foure] Well, at some places there is no ink. At others with no electricity the batteries have run down and cannot provide lighting. Voting cards are being issued to youths arriving to vote, youths who one can see are clearly not yet 18 years old. [end recording]
