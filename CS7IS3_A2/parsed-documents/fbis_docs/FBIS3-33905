Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, a key figure in the national dialogue that spawned the document of understanding to be signed by the Yemeni president and his deputy in Amman next week, indicated that agreement has been reached as to which local, Arab, and other parties will be invited to attend the signing ceremonies. Since the accord was initialed, the General People's Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] have differed over which Arab and other states to invite for the event. While the YSP wants Britain, France, the United States, Eritrea, Canada, and China to be present along with Oman, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and the Arab League, the GPC prefers a restricted attendance. Abu-Shawarib said that agreement has been reached to invite five Yemeni figures from the three ruling coalition partners: the GPC, the YSP, and the Reform Party, a representative from each of the parties that sat on the dialogue committee, including the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, al-Haqq Party, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping, plus a limited number of independents.
