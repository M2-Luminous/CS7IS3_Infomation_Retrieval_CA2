The essential points of the guidelines follow: National Police Agency 1. A wider range of application for the ordinary driver's license -- regulations should be revised so that vehicles weighing less than 10 tons and carrying less than five tons of payload will be considered "ordinary cars." Ministry of Transport 1. Revision of the method under which passenger fares are fixed by railway enterprises -- a ceiling should be set on passenger fares, while the existing method should be improved. 2. Relaxation of regulations on railway freight charges (details are omitted). 3. Drastic revision of the tonnage adjustment system that is applied to coastal shipping vessels (details are omitted). 4. Deregulation concerning the trucking industry -- the ministry should increase the number of expanded operations areas. In the end, each operations area should be expanded so that it will correspond to each administrative district covered by each local transport bureau. Ministry of International Trade and Industry 1. Phased abolition of the Large-Scale Retail Store Law -- the ministry should define the abrogation program, for example, the law can be abolished by gradually raising the upper limit on floor space for outlets not needing government approval. 2. Relaxation of the Electric Appliance and Material Control Law -- the ministry should further promote harmonization with such foreign standards as IEC (international standard) and UL (U.S. standard). It should also encourage the reconversion of electrical appliances and materials classified under Group A to those classified under Group B, while relaxing the obligation to obtain type certification for electrical appliances and materials still falling under Group A. 3. Regulations on foreign investment in Japan and its application -- as for industries that directly affect national security, many of them are not mentioned clearly by reason of the Foreign Exchange Law. This should be revised, because it lacks clarity. Fair Trade Commission 1. Revision of regulations prohibiting the establishment of holding companies (details are omitted). Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries 1. Relaxation of conditions for obtaining a license to sell rice retail -- in principle, the ministry should grant a license to every capable retailer eager to sell rice. 2. Drastic revision of regulations on farmland -- the ministry should review city planning and revise its agricultural development program. It should promote the use of underutilized lands located in urbanized areas. Concerning the right to authorize the conversion of farmland covering a total area of more than two hectares, the ministry will place the matter under the authority of prefectural governors. As for cities meeting certain requirements that include population size, the ministry will also entrust the matter to the municipal authorities. 3. Introduction of a selective system to limit rice acreage -- the ministry should implement a new system under which rice farmers will have free choice as to whether they will continue to operate under the government's umbrella in accordance with the production adjustment policy, after due consideration of such factors as market pricing and production cost. 4. Encouragement of direct sales by rice farmers to consumers (details are omitted). 5. Reduction of the government purchasing price and the government selling price of rice -- the ministry will help cut the average production cost by half in about 10 years. 6. Reduction of the government purchasing price and the government selling price of wheat (details are omitted). 7. Reform in the pricing process of rice authorized for free distribution -- the ministry should increase the volume of rice authorized for free distribution, offer more bids for such rice, relax measures aimed at curbing excessive price fluctuations, and promote diversification of rice sellers and buyers. 8. Reduction of subsidies connected with raw sugar imports (details are omitted). 9. Revision of import restrictions on wheat and barley for use as feedstuff (details are omitted). Ministry of Finance 1 Further relaxation of conditions for obtaining a license for retail sale of liquor--the ministry will grant a license to every retailer considered to be capable of dealing in liquor on his own responsibility. However, for the moment, the ministry will first authorize retail stores having floor space of more than 3,000 square meters. It will also shorten the period during which sales of alcoholic beverages will be restricted so that retailers will be able to sell any kind of liquor as soon as they start their business. 2. Further relaxation of conditions for obtaining a license for retail sale of cigarettes (details are omitted). 3. Reduction to 5 percent of the withholding tax rate applied to stock dividends paid to foreign parent companies. The government will ask pertinent countries for revision of the tax treaty, while it will voluntarily lower the tax rate to 5 percent regardless of negotiations to revise the treaty. Ministry of Health and Welfare 1. Relaxation of criteria for obtaining a license for retail sale of medicines -- designated inspection institutions will take care of a wider area covering several prefectures. In principle, inspection equipment will no longer have to be set up inside a drugstore. 2. Plant quarantine -- to remove barriers impeding food exports, the ministry will define the medical inspection process, stop holding public hearings, and remove the zero-tolerance requirement. Ministry of Construction 1. Revision of the essential points mentioned in the administrative guidance concerning development projects (details are omitted). 2. Amplification of assistance by the Housing Loan Corporation concerning the purchase of houses with a leasehold on land. The Corporation will accommodate people with loans to enable them to buy such houses and to pay key money to landowners. 3. Simplification of the approval process for imported construction materials that already meet foreign standard requirements (details are omitted). National Land Agency 1. Relaxation or cancellation of supervision over specific areas -- local governments should stop supervising designated areas when there is no more danger of a sudden rise in land prices. Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications 1. Relaxation of regulations concerning the launching of a new telecommunications business classified under the first category [category of common carriers], or the withdrawal from such a business. The ministry should abolish, or if not, revise, the provision on supply-demand adjustment, and implement impartial and clear criteria in exchange. 2. As for telecommunications companies that come under the first category, fewer services (rates) will be subject to government approval. Only services that deeply affect the national economy or people's everyday life will be subject to approval. 3. Promotion of the open network program -- the ministry should implement the principle of the open network agreement to help realize the hookup of different telecommunications networks under fair conditions. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) should further open its network to other telecommunications companies. 4. Measures to cope with the fusion of the communications industry and the broadcasting industry (details are omitted). 5. Revision of the standard certification system regarding the certification of telecommunications equipment -- the ministry should reduce the certification fee and simplify and accelerate the application procedure. It should also gradually integrate government offices where applications are sent. Other Deregulatory Measures 1. Revision of the government procurement system -- an information system should be created to give equal opportunities to foreign-affiliated companies. As for the advance registration system, the government will take necessary steps so that foreign-affiliated companies will have to register their name only once.
