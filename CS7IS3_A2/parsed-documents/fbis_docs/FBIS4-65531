His strong points include having demonstrated his capacity for managing the changing mission of the OECD in the light of the new balance of world forces and being in the best position to bring the shift that is currently under way to its conclusion. His handicap is being a European. [Bazil] By supporting the candidacy of a Canadian, the United States would appear to be seeking to bring the OECD back under its wing, or at least contest its eurocentric character and European leadership since 1961. What do you think of this? [Paye] In my eyes, the important thing is that at a time of uncertainty and change throughout the world, the OECD is able to remain an objective, peaceful forum for consultations between countries. This presupposes that the necessary agreements can be reached within it. If the impression is given that the OECD is being used as a means of exerting pressure at the service of one country or another or a group of countries, then the machine will become blocked. [Bazil] In saying that, are you having a go at the United States? [Paye] Not at all! You are the one saying that the United States wants to get rid of a European secretary general so as to use the Organization for their own benefit. If that is the calculation they are making, then they have gotten their sums wrong. I hope they are not reasoning along such lines and that it is simply out of principle that they would like to see the OECD change its leader after a certain period of time, which in my book is not a compelling argument in itself. What is more, why should the United States seek to "regain" its influence over the OECD? It has always exerted such influence. Quite frequently in recent years it is the United States which has pushed for the exploration of new areas. When the secretariat believed that these proposals were justified and were pointing in the same direction as general interests, it helped the United States to convince other countries of this fact. [Bazil] Today, some candidates are arguing that the OECD has greater prominence and is playing a more political role... [Paye] It is the governments that must choose. Personally, I believe that it would be wrong to politicize the OECD. The constant danger in an organization for dialogue such as the OECD, is of provoking a public confrontation between countries. It is not by being antagonistic and beating on this drum that the secretary general will manage to play a useful role. In my opinion, the quest for a more political profile of the OECD does not appear to be a way of making it more efficient. [passage omitted] [Bazil] What is your view of the future for the OECD? Does the OECD not risk losing its identity by opening up to countries with a very different culture and past history than our own, like Mexico or South Korea? [Paye] The OECD is currently faced with a dilemma. Today, virtually all the countries of the world are counting on the market economy as a means of economic growth and social development. Many of them are rapidly nearing the averages set by the OECD. The OECD must open up to these countries under pain of going into decline. Intergovernmental cooperation that was limited to certain countries and ignored the new major players in the world arena would lose its pertinence. On the other hand, the modus operandi of the OECD presupposes a certain homogeneity between the member countries, a similar approach to problems, and a willingness to reach consensus. This "culture" must be enriched, but also maintained. So I believe we must be selective when choosing new members as well as cautious with regard to the pace at which we open up the organization. The countries applying to join the organization can start off by participating in certain activities, familiarizing themselves with it, and gradually approximating their policies and institutions to the tone expected of them after their accession. Mexico, which has just become a member, underwent this process and South Korea, like several Central European countries, is currently undergoing it too. The OECD, however, is not only interested in countries that might join within the near future. In fact, it is developing its relations with a large number of countries around the world in various ways. [Bazil] Does that mean we will soon see a multispeed OECD? [Paye] Let us imagine the world 15 years from now and imagine that a market economy has been established everywhere. To remain useful, the OECD will have to include the principal economic powers, whether large countries or sufficiently well-integrated regional groupings. Working methods will have progressed: The European Union will undoubtedly speak on behalf of its member states; less well-integrated groupings will be represented by their leading countries or, in each committee, by the countries most closely involved, or maybe there will even be rotating representation. By means of a kind of variable geometry, the OECD will manage to remain an official forum for effective dialogue between the most prominent economies in the world at that time.
