The proposal stems primarily from foreign policy considerations. "The U.S. boycott of Cuba no longer has any reason to exist" at a time when communism has collapsed, believe the signatories to this proposal. Now that the Soviet Union has ceased to exist, Cuba's population is the principal victim of Washington's policy. The embargo "in fact stops Cuba from developing positively" and, on 24 November 1992, the United Nations General Assembly (with the exception of the United States, Israel, and Romania) called for it to be lifted. Our Trade But the text submitted to the Chamber is also a response to domestic considerations. Since 1992, Washington has tightened its embargo as well as the Torricelli Law, which imposes trading restrictions on third countries. U.S.-owned or controlled companies based in Belgium cannot trade with Cuba, which is a barrier to Belgium's trade and "could even result in a second embargo on Belgian exports to the United States." Although the Chamber of Representatives "is concerned by the human rights situation" in Cuba, it must "increase dialogue with Cuba at the European level with a view to promoting the process of reform which has already begun."
