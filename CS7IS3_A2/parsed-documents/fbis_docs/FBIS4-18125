These deliberations are under a time constraint because corresponding measures would have to be included in the draft of the 1994 employment promotion law, which is to be decided by 14 April. The committee discussions have not yet been concluded. On Monday [28 March] government spokesman Norbert Schaefer announced that the chancellor will invite the top associations of industry and the trade unions for a talk on expanding the supply of part-time jobs. Over the weekend, FRG Labor Minister Norbert Bluem advocated providing financial aid of about 3,000 German marks [DM] per part-time job, thus winning over employers for the creation of such jobs. A one-time investment is economically more useful than the expenditures for a jobless person, who costs about DM2,000 per month, Bluem said. However, considerations do not just revolve around the DM3,000 premium for the companies. Rather, the intention is to pay the same amount to employees if they change from full-time work to part-time work. The unemployed are also to receive a premium of DM3,000 if they accept a part-time job and not a full-time job. In practice, the creation of a part-time job or the division of a full-time job could require three times the premium of DM3,000 -- for the employer, for the employee, and for the unemployed person hired in addition. The premiums are to be paid by the Federal Employment Office. Chancellor Helmut Kohl seems to support these conditions, because the government spokesman expressly "indicated additional incentives to create more part-time work." The chancellor let it be said that a "part-time offensive with imagination" is needed. The Federation of German Employers' Associations (BDA) and the trade unions are discussing how more part-time jobs could be mobilized by means of a joint campaign. BDA Main Manager Fritz-Heinz Himmelreich said that the employers' associations are very interested in such an initiative. However, Himmelreich was skeptical regarding material incentives to promote part-time work. There is the danger of follow-up effects. It would probably also be difficult to persuade a former full-time worker who gets unemployment benefits to take a part-time job.
