According to experts' estimates, over 1 trillion rubles is required to cover the losses -- caused by the devaluation of individual deposits -- by 100 percent. It goes without saying that it is necessary to repay the population what it lost not through its own will, believes Alyaksandr Barkun, deputy chairman of the Savings Bank of Belarus.
