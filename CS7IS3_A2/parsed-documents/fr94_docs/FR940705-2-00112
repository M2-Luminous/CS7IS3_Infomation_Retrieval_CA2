FR940705-2-00112 FR940705-2-00079 [Release No. 34&hyph;34268; File No. SR&hyph;CHX&hyph;94&hyph;12] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Disclosure of Pending Formal Exchange Disciplinary Proceeding to the CRD June 28, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice if hereby given that on May 6, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'') or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The CHX proposes to add Rule 9 to Article XII of the Exchange's Rules. Rule 9 to Article XII is proposed to be provided as follows: The initiation of, and all significant changes in the status of, a formal disciplinary proceeding brought by the Exchange shall be reported by the Exchange to the Central Registration Depository operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. For purposes of this Rule, significant changes in the status of a pending formal disciplinary proceeding shall include, but are not limited to, issuance of a decision by the President, the filing of an appeal; to and/or the issuance of a decision by, a Judiciary Committee, the Exchange's Executive Committee or Board of Governors. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements governing the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change (1) Purpose The proposed rule change authorizes the Exchange to provide information to the Central Registration Depository (``CRD'') 1 concerning pending formal Exchange disciplinary proceedings for disclosure to the public. A formal disciplinary proceeding is considered to be pending from the time charges are issued 2 until the proceeding is completed. 3 Currently, the Exchange discloses information only on final Exchange disciplinary actions to the CRD. 1 The CRD is an automated industry database containing employment and disciplinary history of members and associated persons registered with self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') and state securities agencies. The CRD is operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') with input on policy and other matters from federal and state agencies and other SROs, including the Exchange. 2 CHX Article XII, Rule 1(b) provides, in part, that if in the judgment of the President it shall appear that an accused has committed a default or other offense in violation of the Constitution or Rules of the Exchange the President shall, except as hereinafter provided, direct the staff to prefer written charges against the accused. A copy of such charges shall be served upon the accused. The accused shall also be served with written notice of when and where the charges will be heard. 3 See CHX Article XII, Rule 7. Information concerning final disciplinary actions taken by the Exchange and other SROs and regulatory organizations and certain criminal convictions contained in the CRD has been disclosed to the public pursuant to the NASD's 800 number service since October 1991. 4 4 The Commission subsequently approved the NASD's procedures for operating its 800 number service in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30629 (April 23, 1992), 57 FR 18535 (April 30, 1992) (File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;91&hyph;39) (``800 Number Service Plan Approval Order''). On July 1, 1993, the SEC approved an NASD rule change to make more information available to the general public regarding pending disciplinary proceedings or actions taken by federal or state securities agencies and SROs that relate to securities or commodities transactions, and regarding criminal indictments and informations. 5 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32568 (July 1, 1993), 59 FR 36723 (July 8, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;93&hyph;26) (``Pending Event Disclosure Approval Order''). Information on pending SRO disciplinary proceedings, among other events, is currently also in the CRD, to the extent that reports are made by members, member organizations and associated persons pursuant to their reporting obligations on the Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer (Form U&hyph;4) and Form BD, the uniform applications form for broker-dealer registration. However, the Exchange does not currently report such pending events to the CRD.
