Russia has never had enough food. In 1989 the need for basic agricultural products was met by only 58 percent. In 1993 this indicator dropped to 37 percent. What awaits us in 1994? These figures were mentioned at a board meeting of the RF Committee on Trade, where the food problem was discussed. During 11 months, as compared with the same period of last year, the volumes of sales of livestock and poultry for slaughtering decreased in 67 out of Russia's 77 regions, of milk, in 61 regions, and of eggs, in 35 regions. The reduction in the stock of cattle, hogs, sheep, and goats, owing to its considerable discarding on kolkhozes and sovkhozes, is compensated for only partially by the increase in the number of animals in private homesteads. The breeding stock has also decreased in many regions, which undermines the foundations of animal husbandry over the long term. During 11 months of 1993, as compared with 1992, the production of basic foodstuffs decreased as follows: of meat, by 16 percent; of butter, by 4 percent; of sugar, by 5 percent; of vegetable oil; by 34 percent; of whole milk products, by 16 percent. In Russia in the middle of December the average price per kg of first-category beef was 1,949 rubles. Throughout cities the situation with prices looked as follows: in Kemerovo, 2,800 rubles; in Murmansk, 2,622 rubles; in Ryazan, 1,784 rubles; in Belgorod, 1,440 rubles; in Ulyanovsk, 561 rubles. Milk prices also differ very substantially: in Arkhangelsk, 390 rubles; in Kemerovo, 360 rubles; in Kirov, 248 rubles; in Tula, 192 rubles; in Ulyanovsk, 61 rubles. There is a big "spread" in the cost of bread. The most expensive is in Kemerovo--311 rubles. The cheapest is in Ulyanovsk--47 rubles. Sugar: in Tyumen, 900 rubles; in Kemerovo, 311 rubles; in Belgorod, 581 rubles; on the average throughout Russia, 708 rubles per kg. A reduction in livestock products is expected this year. The state purchase of [refined] and raw sugar is not envisaged, whereas only one-third of the needs of the Russian Federation for sugar are met by its own production. Vegetable oil and milk products will not be sufficient. There will not be enough vegetable oil and milk products. In 1994 it is difficult to forecast the import of foodstuffs purchased by state and other organizations and enterprises in connection with the lack of clarity about customs duties for their import. It should be stated that the per-capita delivery of basic food products has decreased annually and in 1993, in relation to the 1991 level, comprised the following: of meat products, 58 percent; of milk products, 64 percent; of vegetable oil, 38 percent; of sugar, 84 percent. In 1993, as compared with 1992, the sale of fish declined to 45 percent. And this, despite the fact that the fishing fleet came to a standstill--ships were filled with products. The volumes of export of fish products from the country exceed the consumption inside the country, although everyone knows that the demand of the Russian people has not been met. With regard to this year resources are quite sufficient. However, the exorbitantly high transport rates spoil everything. For example, the delivery of every kilogram of fish from the Far East costs 240 rubles. The price of fish products in retail trade has long outstripped meat products. A reduction in the production of canned goods is not expected. There are no problems with salt. Its remainders in warehouses are increasing. Vodka is the only product, the sale of which proceeded "with a plus" last year, making up 106 percent of the 1992 level. Things are not going too well with tobacco. The domestic industry is capable of meeting only 50 to 60 percent of the need for tobacco products. Previously, imports rescued us. Now the excise on tobacco greatly hampers deliveries from abroad. And so, if nothing changes, it will not be possible to meet the population's demand. As was noted at the last board meeting of the RF Committee on Trade, with the shortage of food resources in Russia the creation of insurance food volumes is simply necessary for a guaranteed supply for servicemen and residents of the Far North and of ecologically polluted territories of large industrial centers, such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, and for the fulfillment of state goal-oriented programs adopted by Russia's government--"Children of Chernobyl," "Children of the North," "Protection of the Russian Federation Population Against the Effect of the Chernobyl Catastrophe," and others. The RF Committee on Trade advocates the preservation of federal food stocks for this year at last year's level. However, the draft decree of the Council of Ministers "On Food Deliveries for Federal Needs for 1994" provides for a significant reduction in the volumes and number of consumers of these stocks. It proposes that they be formed only in order to provide the military and categories of consumers equated with them, to replenish state reserves, and to create operational government reserves--and only of several types of foodstuffs at that. In this case federal stocks are envisaged in the following volumes: of grain--9.6 million tonnes, or 96 percent of the 1993 level; of meat products--633,000 tonnes, or 37 percent; of dairy products--3,349,000 tonnes, or 26 percent; of vegetables--466,000 tonnes, or 48 percent; of sugar--839,000 tonnes, or 20 percent; of vegetable oil--166,000 tonnes, or 15 percent; of eggs--1,445 million, or 9 percent. In order to provide incentives for rural commodity producers, it is planned to make advance deliveries amounting to no less than 70 percent of the value of contracted products. Despite the fact that Russia's Ministry of Agriculture, the RF Committee on the Food and Processing Industry, the RF Committee on Fishing, and the Roskhleboprodukt Joint-Stock Company insist on the preservation of previous volumes of federal stocks, the Ministry of Economics considers it possible to allocate funds only if the number of federal recipients is reduced. Recently, a special subdivision engaged in problems of commodity supply for Moscow has been established in the RF Committee on Trade. How to feed the city of many millions? This question has always been quite acute. The committee has prepared a draft decree of the Council of Ministers "On Measures To Provide the Population of the City of Moscow With Food During the First Half Year of 1994," which determines the volumes of basic food products at the 1993 level. However, the fair on the sale of food products held in the capital on 16-17 December made it possible to conclude contracts for their delivery in 1994 from Russia's regions as follows: of meat--75,000 tonnes, or 62 percent of the volumes, which, according to our calculations, are needed; of butter--7,500 tonnes, or 75 percent; of dry milk--2,000 tonnes, or 67 percent; of vegetable oil--0,100 tonnes, or 0.2 percent. Only cheese (5,700 tonnes, or 190 percent) and sugar (60,000 tonnes, or 120 percent) will be sufficient until July. Undoubtedly, Moscow is a special city both in terms of the number of its residents, its status, and other indicators. The RF Committee on Trade advocates that the country's capital also be included among federal recipients. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Economics has another opinion. To all the above-stated I would like to add that the new customs duties on many key food products greatly aggravate the food situation. The RF Committee on Trade asked the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations not to apply customs duties to meat, meat products, milk, dairy products, sugar, vegetable oil, and baby food at least for contracts concluded before 1 January 1994. Thus, all forecasts can be made only tentatively, except for one: under conditions of the increase in inflationary processes, the crisis of insolvency and financial instability of enterprises, and the unbalance of previous trade relations a saturation of the market with food at prices within the reach of the basic population is not foreseen.
