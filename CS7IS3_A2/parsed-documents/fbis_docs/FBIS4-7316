FBIS4-7316 "dreas083_a_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Labor Ministry Releases Report on Wages, Hours Labor Ministry Releases Report on Wages, Hours OW2904084094 Tokyo KYODO in English 0810 GMT 29 Apr 94 OW2904084094 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 29 KYODO -- Japanese workers' average monthly wages showed the first year-on-year decline in 13 years in fiscal 1993, though a scant 0.1 percent, while annual working hours also declined by 50 hours, the government said Friday [29 April]. The Labor Ministry said in a report on the nation's labor situation for the year ended March 31 that average monthly basic salaries of workers at companies with 30 employees and more increased 2.7 percent from the year before to 272,743 yen. But special allowances, including bonuses, declined 1.6 percent to 106,594 yen per month, reflecting the sluggish business climate. Payments for overtime work also dropped 5.6 percent to 21,957 yen per month as companies cut back overtime hours during the recession. As a result, workers' total monthly wages averaged 401,294 yen, up 1.0 percent from the year before. The ministry said the increase is the lowest since it started such a survey in fiscal 1970. Taking into account the 1.1 percent consumer price hike in fiscal 1993, monthly average wages showed a 0.1 percent decline in real terms, it said. Regarding working hours, the ministry said annual regular working hours in Japan averaged 1,777 per worker in the year, down 37 hours from the year before. Overtime hours averaged 131 for the year, down 13 hours. In total, annual working hours came to 1,908 per person, down 50 hours from the year before, the ministry said. The government has long promoted a reduction of Japan's notoriously long annual working hours to 1,800. In fiscal 1992, annual working hours declined by 50 to 1,958, with regular hours dropping by 24 and overtime hours by 26. Compared with the 1992 figures, regular working hours declined more than overtime in 1993. A ministry official said the trend was because many companies reduced their regular hours last year ahead of a planned law revision in April requiring a cut in regular working hours to 40 hours a week.
