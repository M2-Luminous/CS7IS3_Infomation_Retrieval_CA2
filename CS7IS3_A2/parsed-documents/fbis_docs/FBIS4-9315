Here is what hospital director Alija Dogovic told us about the situation in the Gorazde war hospital: [Begin recording] [Dogovic] In the past hour, since it became dark [passage indistinct] the hours of hell, the wounded in a horrifying condition [passage indistinct] without bandages -- have been arriving. Many are in a very critical condition. [passage indistinct] We have no more people to give blood. They cannot come here. Those who are giving blood and those who are receiving it are bleeding. [end recording] [Reporter] Foreign journalists were today particularly interested in whether the situation in Gorazde had changed after NATO's ultimatum to the aggressor's side. Esad Ohranovic, the president of the executive committee of the Gorazde district, answered the question. [Begin recording] [Ohranovic] The intensity of shelling is not the same as during the day, but an occasional shell lands even as I am speaking. The Serbs are firing from anti-aircraft weapons, but not with the same intensity as before. The shelling did not stop after 1900. We could say that the intensive shelling stopped around 2000 or 2015. However, they have continued shelling and firing from anti-aircraft weapons, but with reduced intensity.
