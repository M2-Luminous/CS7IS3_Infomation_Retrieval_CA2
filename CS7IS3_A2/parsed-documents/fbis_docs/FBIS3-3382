They attentively listened to deputies' views and suggestions on work in various fields and gave their views on many issues of concern to the deputies. Tian Jiyun, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member and vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, took part in the Guizhou delegation's discussions. He said: In the course of establishing a socialist market economic structure, the NPC's legislative responsibility has become heavier and heavier. In conducting legislative work, it is necessary to take into consideration China's conditions and foreign experience as well as the question of compatibility with international practice. He said: We have been carrying out construction and legislation under a social condition where the sense of the legal system is weak and the legal system is not very comprehensive and sound. Because of this, not only do we shoulder a very heavy legislative responsibility, but we also shoulder an even heavier responsibility in supervising law enforcement. We must do a tremendous amount of hard work for an extended period to ensure that our people and cadres have a higher sense of the legal system and that laws are adhered to and strictly enforced in administering state affairs. Only when we have done so can we ensure the establishment of a socialist market economy, the irreversibility of our reform and opening up, and the success of socialist modernization. During discussions with the Jiangxi delegation, Li Lanqing, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member and vice premier, said: Reform provides the fundamental solution to education. First, we must readjust education's macro structure, concentrating our principal energy on basic education. Second, we must not impose uniformity in promoting nine-year compulsory education. We must not demand uniform education, ignoring differences between urban and rural areas and between developed and underdeveloped areas. Third, we must step up reform with the goal of improving educational standards and increasing the beneficial results of higher education. We must encourage people to pool their resources to set up and operate schools. Fourth, we must strengthen moral education. During a discussion with the Shandong delegation, Jiang Chunyun, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member, said: To ensure the smooth progress of reform in all fields, we must firmly cultivate an overall point of view; correctly handle relations between partial and overall interests and between immediate and long-term interests; stress discipline and the overall situation; consciously safeguard the authority of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and take concerted steps with them. We must fully arouse and bring into play the initiatives and creativity of the broad masses of people. Reform is an undertaking involving the broad masses of people. We must channel their initiatives to reform so that they will concern themselves with reform, support it, and successfully carry it out. During a discussion with the Ningxia delegation, Qian Qichen, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member and vice premier, said: Helping the poor involves a transitional period. We must earnestly implement the state's program to support the poor, make concentrated efforts to make full use of the program's funds, work hard to improve the production conditions in poor areas, and help them vigorously develop village and town enterprises and intensive processing industries. He stressed: Stability is a major issue. Because national minority regions lag behind in economic, educational, and cultural development, strengthening unity among nationalities and properly resolving ethnic and religious issues have become all the more important. Only in this way can we have a stable foundation to develop the economy in national minority regions and gradually narrow the difference between national minority regions and developed areas. During a discussion with the Guangdong delegation, Xie Fei, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member, said: The state has announced a series of reform measures related to finance, taxation, banking, foreign trade, and enterprises since the beginning of this year. We must make efforts to implement these measures, promptly resolve new problems discovered in the course of implementation, and take steps to improve the measures and gradually develop a mechanism for operating a socialist market economy. At the same time, we must step up our efforts to establish a mechanism for rule of law and democratic supervision. This will be a main focus of Guangdong's political structural reform, which will be undertaken simultaneously with its economic structural reform so that political structural reform will support economic reform and ensure the healthy development of the socialist market economy. In discussions with the Shanxi delegation, Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, said: Currently, China enjoys economic development, political stability, national unity, and social progress. The situation is generally good. However, we must also realize that safeguarding social stability and public order is an arduous long-term task. We must mentally prepare to take all realistic and effective measures to go all out to safeguard social stability. We must uphold the policy of doing two types of work at the same time, attaching equal importance to both. We must handle the work of safeguarding social stability in the same way we handle the economy. Speaking at a discussion held by the Hubei delegation, Ni Zhifu, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said: In building a legal system for the socialist market economy, we must use Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide, use the Constitution as the basis, proceed from reality, and vigorously but prudently carry out the work in a spirit of reform. He said: We have achieved remarkable results in the legislative field in the last few years. However, law enforcement remains a weak link. Failure to observe the law strictly is still quite serious, and this has led to complaints from many quarters. We must place as much importance on supervising and monitoring law enforcement as on legislation. Only by doing so can we safeguard the authoritativeness of the law. During a discussion with the Hebei delegation, Wang Bingqian, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said: In developing the economy, we must pay attention to both quantity and quality, that is, to the unity between speed and efficiency. We must pay closer attention to economic efficiency, without which speed is not only worthless, but may even be harmful. We must pay attention to resolving "bottlenecks" and promote short-term as well as long-term development. We must pay attention to mobilizing positive factors in various economic sectors and jointly develop social productive forces to make people rich and the country strong. We must give equal emphasis to development and conservation to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economic results in production and construction. During a discussion with the Inner Mongolia delegation, Buhe, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said: There is a gap between national minority regions and advanced areas in economic development. Doing a good job in national minority work has a positive impact on the stability, development, and prosperity of the entire society. Equality, unity, and mutual assistance among different nationalities serve as a guarantee for economic development and social progress in national minority areas. We must use the Marxist outlook on nationalities to educate the masses of people and to codify and institionalize our national minority work along a correct path. We must comprehensively and correctly implement the policy toward religion and strengthen management of religious affairs according to the law. Taking part in discussions with the Jiangxi delegation, Vice Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Li Peiyao noted that this year's economic targets are not set very high. He said: This has created relatively good conditions for reform. In administering macrocontrol last year, we found a successful experience, that is we must carry out macrocontrol through financial means instead of administrative means. He also said: On the issue of safe production, we learned some lessons last year. The Government Work Report stresses the importance of safe production more than in the past. Due to the change from the old system to a new one, safe production is particularly important and we must pay good attention to the matter. Vice Chairman of the NPC Stannding Committee Wu Jieping took part in the Shanghai delegation's discussions. He said: The achievements of our country's reform, opening up, and economic development have attracted worldwide attention. However, there are still some problems and contradictions which must be solved by further carrying out reform. At present, we are strengthening macrocontrol, and we must carry forward the spirit of taking the situation as a whole into consideration and "firmly implement the central guidelines and unified planning without exception." We should work with concerted efforts and take the interests of the whole into consideration. We should firmly and truly implement the principle of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development and maintaining stability. State Councillor Chen Junsheng said during discussions with deputies of the Guangdong delegation: Judging from the situation of the whole country, total grain output in 1993 increased and set an all-time record. Nevertheless, there are shortages in the supply of food grain in some locales. This is mainly due to the imbalance in supply and demand. Take the situation in Guangdong for example, the annual grain output was more than 30 billion jin, but the total demand is more than 40 billion jin. Guangdong must buy 10 billion jin of grain from other provinces to make up for its shortage. Moreover, there are many migrants in Guangdong who must also eat. Guangdong must be determined to ensure adequate acreage of land sown in grain crops and raise grain output. We should not only pay attention to economic results, but also pay attention to social benefits. We must strive to raise the level of reliance in the supply of food grain. State Councillor Ismail Amat took part in discussions with the Tianjin delegation. He pointed out: We are establishing a socialist market economic structure, and the biggest difference between China and the Western countries is that, in China, all activities throughout the nation are coordinated like pieces in a chess game and there is a great unity among people of all nationalities. We should be proud of this at all times. In past decades, various provinces and municipalities in the country have provided great support to areas resided in by minority people. In the future, the more developed coastal cities and areas should, while developing their economies, further support and help the development of areas resided by minority people.
