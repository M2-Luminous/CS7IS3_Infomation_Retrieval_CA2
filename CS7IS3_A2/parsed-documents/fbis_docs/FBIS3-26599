Huang Zhaohong, who headed the Chinese delegation to the meeting, told XINHUA that China has entered into 57 cooperation agreements with Nigeria at the five-day forum, which ended last Friday [4 February] in the Nigerian capital Abuja. "This is the first time for China to have TCDC agreements with Nigeria," said Huang who is also economic and commercial counselor in the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria. The Chinese delegation returned to Lagos on Saturday from the consultation meeting held in Abuja. This is the first international conference held in Nigeria since General Sani Abacha came to power last November. In addition, the Chinese delegation also signed seven other cooperation agreements with Benin, Cuba, Gambia and Thailand. A total of 280 cooperation agreements were concluded by the end of the consultation meeting, which involved 26 developing countries from Africa, Asia and Latin America. "The Chinese delegation ranks first in reaching agreements with other nations," Huang said. In fact, "We are among the busiest people at the meeting. People came to our table for consultation and negotiation before they made up their mind" to sign a cooperation agreement with the Chinese delegation, said Li Wanming, a woman member of the Chinese delegation at the conference. Initiated under the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the TCDC is aimed at promoting cooperation among developing countries. China began to take part in the UNDP activities in October 1972. In September 1979, the UNDP set up a permanent representative office in China.
