FR941004-1-00029 FR941004-1-00007 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [AZ&hyph;13&hyph;2&hyph;6293; FRL&hyph;5084&hyph;7] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Arizona State Implementation Plan Revision, Maricopa County Division of Air Pollution Control AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the Arizona State Implementation Plan (SIP) which control emissions from solvent degreasing operations, petroleum solvent dry cleaning, gasoline transfer, and the use of roadway asphalt. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. EPA proposed conditional approval of earlier submittals of several of these rules in the Federal Register on September 29, 1992 based on the Maricopa County Division of Air Pollution Control's (the Division's) commitment to fix the rule deficiencies. The Division has fulfilled its commitment to fix the rules, and has submitted the revised rules being acted upon in this document. EPA has evaluated each of the rules and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. DATES: Comments must be received on or before November 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to: Daniel A. Meer, Rulemaking Section (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. Copies of the rule revisions and EPA's evaluation report of each rule are available for public inspection at EPA's Region 9 office during normal business hours. Copies of the submitted rule revisions are also available for inspection at the following locations: Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, 3033 N. Central Avenue, Phoenix, AZ 85012. Maricopa County Division of Air Pollution Control, 2406 South 24th Street, suite E&hyph;214, Phoenix, AZ 85034. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Julie A. Rose, Rulemaking Section (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105, Telephone: (415) 744&hyph;1184. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Applicability The rules being proposed for approval into the Arizona SIP include: Maricopa County Division of Air Pollution Control (the Division) Rules 331, Solvent Cleaning; 333, Petroleum Solvent Dry Cleaning; 340, Cutback and Emulsified Asphalt; and 353, Transfer of Gasoline into Stationary Dispensing Tanks. These rules were submitted to EPA by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) on August 10 (Rules 331 and 333), November 13 (Rule 340), and June 29 (Rule 353), 1992. Background On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included Maricopa County. 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.303. On March 19, 1979, EPA changed the name and modified the geographic boundaries of the ozone nonattainment area of Maricopa County to the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) Urban Planning Area. 44 FR 16391, 40 CFR 81.303. On February 24, 1984, EPA notified the Governor of Arizona, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act, that the Division's portion of the Arizona SIP was inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call, 49 FR 18827, May 3, 1984). On May 26, 1988, EPA again notified the Governor of Arizona that the Division's portion of the Arizona SIP was inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies relating to VOC controls and the application of reasonably available control technology (RACT) in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's second SIP-Call, 53 FR 34500, September 7, 1988). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their deficient RACT rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amended guidance. 1 EPA's SIP-Calls used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The MAG Urban Planning Area is classified as moderate 2 ; therefore, this area is subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. 1 Among other things, the pre-amended guidance consists of those portions of the proposed post-1987 ozone and carbon monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 Federal Register Notice'' (Blue Book) (notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on May 25, 1988); and the existing control technique guidelines (CTGs). 2 The MAG Urban Planning Area retained its designation of nonattainment and was classified by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the CAA. See 55 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991).
