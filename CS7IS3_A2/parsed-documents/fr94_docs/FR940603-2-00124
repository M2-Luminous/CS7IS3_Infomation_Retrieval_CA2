FR940603-2-00124 FR940603-2-00080 In addition, the Commission notes that the Amex has represented that there is customer interest in 21/2 strikes for near-the-money XMI options. Specifically, the Exchange has stated that the existing 5-point strike intervals frequently result in in-the-money options that are ``too costly'' and out-of-the money options that yield too little premium to attract uncovered or covered writers. Moreover, the Amex believes that the proposed 21/2 point strike intervals will satisfy requests by investors to maintain the pre-split ``Index-to-strike price ratio'' of the XMI. In light of the investor interest in the 21/2 price strikes, and the proposal's limit on the number of strikes the Amex may list, the Commission believes that the proposal should provide the Amex with the flexibility to list additional strike prices in near-the-money XMI options in response to genuine customer interest and, at the same time, appropriately limit the number of XMI options series that may be outstanding at any one time. Finally, based on representations from OPRA, 11 the Commission is satisfied that the Amex and OPRA will have adequate computer processing capacity to accommodate the trading and quote dissemination demands of the additional strike prices that may be listed under the proposal. 11See OPRA Capacity Statement, supra note 4. In summary, the Commission believes that the benefits to be derived from the proposal in accommodating the needs and objectives of investors outweigh the possible adverse effects on market liquidity due to the dispersion of trading interest in more XMI options series. In making this determination, the Commission notes that the change is limited to near-the-money series in XMI options only. Nevertheless, the Commission expects the Amex to monitor additional strikes added under this proposal to ensure that there are no detrimental effects on the market for XMI options. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19 (b) (2) of the Act, 12 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Amex-91-31) is approved. 12 15 U.S.C. 78s(b) (2) (1982). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 13 13 17 CFR 200.30-3 (a) (12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
