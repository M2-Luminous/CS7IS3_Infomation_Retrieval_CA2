In Zelenyy Mys, the settlement of the plant's security guards, the Ukrainian side represented by the leaders and specialists from the State Committee for Nuclear Power Industry [Derzhkomatom], the Ministry for Chernobyl Issues, and the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences have explained to the guests the technical task on which the feasibility study of "Sarcophagus 2" construction should be based. Although the conversation, in which EC Envoy to Ukraine Louis Morren participated, was held behind closed doors, there was a presentation of the technical task. Its basic conditions are as follows: To build a new sarcophagus which would allow the continuation of research on the old one and its contents and the stabilization of the situation, to construct a nuclear waste storage, to sort out and reprocess nuclear waste, and to dismantle the old sarcophagus. The main issue here is the safety of people and environment. All this should not hamper the station's safe operation and its gradual closure. It has also been envisioned that Ukraine's industry and scientific-technical potential will be used in this process. The last two conditions have become the most significant obstacle. The West is afraid of our instability, and it trusts neither the country's leadership nor our specialists. Nor does it want to continue the Chernobyl nuclear power plant's operation, indicating that after the plant is closed down, it will help to construct additional power units which would compensate for the closure, and it will build the "Shelter 2" itself. To put it briefly, the situation resembles that connected with Ukraine's nuclear weapons. By the way, the West does not put such pressure on Russia, which has many more less sophisticated RBMK reactors. Asked by a KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI correspondent whether EC is planning to provide assistance to the constructors of the first sarcophagus and other people who suffered while liquidating the Chernobyl disaster aftermath, and whose health is much worse than that of their creation, and whether it is not better to allocate the funds the West intends to spend on closing the station for this purpose, Mr. Morren replied very evasively: "The international community should tackle all Chernobyl problems." His statement was expounded on by H. Hotovchyts, minister for Chernobyl issues, who led the presentation: "The EC Commission is helping us in many directions. This assistance, however, does not relate to social protection of those who suffered. Here, Ukraine is coping with its misery alone." Derzhkomatom Chairman M. Umanets: "The Chernobyl nuclear power plant is a part of our state's nuclear power engineering system, without which our independence is impossible. The station is operating successfully, and nobody is more interested in closing it than Ukraine itself. Therefore, we should have the decisive voice. Yet, the Chernobyl plant can only be closed down after resolving all problems. We cannot allow ourselves to again deceive the station personnel." S. Parashyn, Chernobyl nuclear power plant director general: "We are professionals, and the most important goal of our work is to improve safety. Nevertheless, political games surrounding this issue, as well as our uncertainty concerning the future, are hampering our safe work. We are tired of being a bargaining chip in someone's policy. Two commissions of the International Atomic Energy Agency have recently visited the station, and nobody said that it should be closed down. On the contrary, they noted that we are proceeding on the right path, and that there are no preconditions to stop the RBMK reactors. Having done that prematurely, Ukraine would lose hundreds of highly qualified specialists. It takes from seven to 10 years to train one such specialist." Of course, there are also contradictory opinions among our specialists, and while this protracted debate continues, the following question is very much to the point: What is the real condition of the "Shelter 1"? Will it not tumble down as we keep talking? I addressed this question to Oleksiy Bytskyy, former general designer and current director of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences department of design-construction works of MNTTs [expansion unknown] "Shelter": -- The current condition of the sarcophagus does not pose any threat, Oleksiy Andriyovych says. However, it is deteriorating, simply because everything in the world ages. There are not enough funds to service it; we are looking for them. It is unfortunate that the tender drags on. The "Shelter 2" should have been built as early as two or four years ago. I doubt that foreigners will build anything. This is nonsense, and the old sarcophagus will last another 30 years. Well, shall we wait?
