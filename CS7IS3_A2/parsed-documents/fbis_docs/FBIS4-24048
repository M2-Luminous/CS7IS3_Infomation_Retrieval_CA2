Addressing the crowd outside the African National Congress headquarters in Plein St, Mr Mandela said he would not accept them acting like gangsters. He said he had heard that bread had been stolen from a nearby bakery, and that a police vehicle had been damaged. Mr Mandela said he did not want an army of criminals, but a disciplined force. The would-be army recruits camped outside the ANC headquarters on Monday and vowed to stay there until the ANC agreed to talk to them. They said they had been turned away from the SA [South African] National Defence Force [SANDF] assembly point at Wallmannstahl, near Pretoria, after being told they were not on the ANC list of recruits. They told SAPA: "We registered. Now suddenly we are no longer registered. Some of us left school and our jobs to join the army. What are we supposed to do now? We have no money for food or accommodation." Bags, luggage and personal belongings were strewn around the entrance to the ANC head office. "We have been here since 4AM, and some have been sleeping out here for the past two weeks, living on handouts." A woman said some of them were Umkhonto We Sizwe (MK) [Spear of the Nation, ANC armed wing] members, while others had left work or school. "We are not going anywhere until the ANC speaks to us. We want to be part of the SANDF," she said. "We can't go back to school or tech because registration is over. We left our schools and now we are just dumped," said a young man. MK Commissar Andrew Masondo said on Monday the crowd was being "impatient". He said MK had submitted a list of its members to be retrained at Wallmannstahl for integration into the SANDF, which had to be thoroughly checked. When it was pointed out to Mr Masondo that many of the crowd were not MK members and had left school or jobs to join the army, he said: "The list is for MK members. If the others just want to join the army, they should apply like everyone else does. You don't have to join the army via MK." Officers said that of the 6,200 people who originally reported to Wallmannstahl, nearly 3,000 had been turned away because they were not on the ANC's list. On Tuesday, Mr Mandela appeared and urged the crowd to follow proper induction procedures and to approach regional ANC structures for inclusion in the armed forces. More exiled soldiers are expected to arrive in South Africa this week.
