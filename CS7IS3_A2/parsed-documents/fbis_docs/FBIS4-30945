The melting of all the groupings belonging to the CDR into a unique party may actually be interpreted as the efforts of certain people with dictatorial tendencies, unquote, [PNCTD Chairman] Corneliu Coposu emphasized, adding that the unification of parties is made on the basis of the fusion of their interests rather than on the basis of decrees. Furthermore, Coposu remarked that the PL-93 proposal may also be interpreted as an attempt by that party to divert attention from the need to reestablish the unity of the liberal movement. Answering a question related to a statement he had made in Paris in connection with the form of government in Romania, the PNTCD chairman confirmed that he had made a statement emphasizing that, in his opinion, at present the solution for salvaging Romania would be the restoration of the monarchic principle. We consider that King Mihai is the sole personality having the vocation able to concentrate the sympathy and the aspirations of the Romanian people, Coposu said, also mentioning that despite the fact that the PNTCD did not vote in favor of the Constitution, it will observe its stipulations as long as it is valid. However, this does not exclude the PNTCD's intent to alter it if it wins the majority in parliament, the PNTCD chairman added. Talking about other issues, Coposu commented on the adherence of the Romanian Mining Trade Union Confederation to the principles of Christian democracy, expressing his hope that future visits by the miners to PNTCD headquarters will be in accordance with those principles. Regarding the program for public investments that was discussed during the 28 May cabinet meeting, Senator Radu Vasile stressed that the PNTCD will support this idea of furthering economic revival, provided that the investments in question are earmarked for works of national interests, our correspondent Elena Perdichi reports.
