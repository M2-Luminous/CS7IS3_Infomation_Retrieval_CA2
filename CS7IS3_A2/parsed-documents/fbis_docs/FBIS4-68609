Interview with Russian Minister of Railways Gennadiy Fadeyev"] [Text] [Rybakov] Gennadiy Matveyevich, as minister, which form of transport do you use most frequently -- aircraft or the train? [Fadeyev] The train of course. It is cheaper and more reliable. [Rybakov] Why? [Fadeyev] Take safety. Last year seven people died in accidents. Whereas 37,000 died on the roads, 222 died in the air, whereas the figures were nine and 30 for river and maritime transport respectively. You can direct a host of complaints at railroad workers bar one: Trains run despite the general crisis and the 25-percent decline in industrial production in the country. At the very least, every Russian citizen uses the train 14 times a year on average. Given the size of our country and the astronomical prices of air tickets, this is the only reliable means of transportation that people can afford. The "iron horse" fully meets the needs of the national economy -- it carries three-fourths of all freight and almost one-half of all passengers. If there were to be holdups owing to strikes say, there would be chaos. During the first quarter of the year we carried 267 million tonnes of freight and 470 million passengers. That is less than in the past. But nevertheless losses incurred from shipments in the first three months of the year totaled 200 billion rubles [R] and overall losses totaled R37 billion [figures as published]. In this period our enterprises were owed R1.87 trillion. Owing to nonpayments by customers the railroads are unable to pay for electricity, fuel, semimanufactures, and rolling stock. [Rybakov] What is the solution? [Fadeyev] At the moment the Ministry of Railways is finding barter to be the solution. During the first quarter we received coal, timber, cotton, food, and so on, worth R1 trillion to cover freight costs. This is tackled by a specially created financial-industrial group. But in principle I deem it necessary to revive a normal system of systematic, advance payment for freight shipment. In civilized countries coal is not shipped more than 600 km from the place of extraction because it is not profitable. In our country the distance covered can be 10 times that. The Kuzbass and Vorkuta are particularly sensitive to this. It looks as though it is cheaper for the Far East to buy coal from Australia than to extract coal in the Kharanor pit near Chita. The government must sort out this matter (we have made our proposals). All the regions cannot be treated alike. And it does not pay us to carry 10 tonnes of freight 1 km for R160. Today many existing and newly formulated statutory acts do not take into consideration the special features of our work. As federally owned enterprises, the railroads do not have the right to autonomously manage their property in order to enhance their effectiveness. The State Committee for the Management of State Property, which has been assigned these rights, does not bear responsibility for the sector's work and does not guarantee compensation for damage incurred as a result of the measures it takes. For instance, a section of the line of the Chusovoye Branch of the Sverdlovsk Railroad was confiscated without coordination with the Ministry of Railways. There are also cases of the State Committee for the Management of State Property leasing our nonhousing premises. [Rybakov] What are your relations with the CIS countries? [Fadeyev] Our payments with the CIS are sometimes described as something of a one-way traffic. Nearby foreign countries owe us around R600 billion for shipments. We are once again taking payment via barter. But as chairman of the CIS States' Council for Railroad Transport I can say that they are all guided by Russia in terms of the price of passenger freight. There is some trouble with Ukraine, particularly at maritime ports. But I think that we will eliminate that. [Rybakov] There are a great number of complaints that freight is not kept safe. [Fadeyev] We did indeed lose freight worth R5.5 billion during the first quarter, R3 billion of which is accounted for by Chechnya and Dagestan. Incredible things happen. Motorized cranes go up to the train and remove literally everything -- timber, coal.... One conductor was taken hostage and returned four days later, but she was unrecognizable, she was almost mute. Now trains carrying our crews do not go through Chechnya and valuable freight is not carried at night. I do not see any solution with regard to Chechnya. Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, and Russia need to pool their efforts to combat looting. [Rybakov] It is being said today that railroad workers are stifling people with their prices. [Fadeyev] I do not want to have to justify myself, but let us look at the figures. Carrying 10 passengers 1 km costs R104.2 -- that is the price of three cups of tea in any canteen. But we do not only have to keep the locomotives, cars, and tracks in good repair, but also to maintain housing, the health service, and kindergartens. Where is the money to come from? Some of the problems have been shifted on to customers -- 30 percent of the expenditure on freight shipment is "covered" by ticket prices because the state does not allocate the requisite funds. But that cannot go on, no railroad in the world survives without state subsidies, the sector's problems cannot be resolved by raising charges. And the Ministry of Railways has repeatedly told the government that. Nonpayments are also taking their toll. We are owed a total of R3.5 trillion and we owe miners, power generation workers, and others R2.6 trillion, We are in effect providing our customers with credit to the tune of R1 trillion and delivering freight free of charge. [Rybakov] The summer season is drawing near. For what should passengers be prepared? [Fadeyev] The rise in the cost of output used by the sector is making it necessary to index charges in order to preserve the efficiency of railroad transport. But the Ministry of Railways has no intention of raising prices of long-distance passenger travel before the end of the summer season or of suburban travel before the end of the year. We now have 460 long-distance trains running every day, during the summer there will be 660, and 12,500 suburban electric trains compared with the 10,000 we have today. We have increased the number of conductors to two per car. In order to improve the service the Ministry of Railways is outlining a new railroad schedule. The arrival and departure times of 24 trains at terminuses have been altered to suit passengers, while the normal traveling speed of 30 trains has been increased, seven trains have become fast trains by canceling stops at underutilized stations, and the number of trains has been increased by 15.5 pairs [na 15.5 pary]. In order to reduce expenditure, the network of deluxe trains [firmennyye poyezda] (now 53) is to be expanded and flexible transportation schedules are being developed taking into consideration the change in demand on different days of the week. We asked the government to exempt us from some taxes in order to reduce the amount by which charges are indexed, but this matter has not so far been resolved. Despite the five-fold increase in passenger charges in 1994, transportation is still extremely unprofitable. According to preliminary estimates, losses will rise to R1.5 trillion in the first half-year. Steps need to be taken. [Rybakov] What are the sector's prospects? [Fadeyev] Moving on to streamlining railroad transport I would like to point out that the regions have a large part to play here. For instance, the Moscow Government has allocated R22 billion for the procurement of electric suburban trains, and St. Petersburg will not lag behind. But other regions are not particularly getting moving at the moment. Following the breakup of the USSR, Russia lost capacities for the production of passenger cars, electric trains, freight diesel locomotives, and tankers. The temporary drop in production is making it possible to redevelop Russia's transport machine building base. The Ministry of Railways, in conjunction with involved ministries and departments, has drafted federal programs entitled "Developing Freightcar Building in Russia" and "Developing Russia's Enterprises To Increase Production of Locomotive Passenger Cars," which are at present with the Ministry of the Economy and are to be adopted by the Russian Federation Government once they have been examined. The implementation of these programs, along with the "Developing Locomotive Building in Russia in 1994-1995" Program, will make it possible to supply railroad transport with Russian equipment, stop foreign procurement, and work reliably to meet the country's transportation needs. The first step was for the Demikhovskiy Plant to assimilate production of Russian electric trains in just a few months in 1993. It is planned to produce at least 25 suburban electric trains by the end of the year.
