There are more than enough of all sorts of presentations happening in Kazan. True, it is not always that they are attended by politicians of such caliber as the Russian Federation's deputy prime minister, Sergey Shakhray. Putting aside all business for a day, he came to Tatarstan to "bless" another regional branch of his party. This visit, of course, was not to the taste of activists of some political organizations of a nationalist orientation: There were pickets at the entrance to the former Lenin memorial, with posters whose content the population has become accustomed to lately. The introductory word at the presentation was delivered by Insaf Sayfullin, chairman of the board of the PRES regional branch. Judging by all signs, he does not have to worry about party affairs--they are on the upturn. When the PRES registered two months ago at the Republic of Tatarstan's Ministry of Justice, it had 67 Tatarstan residents as members. Now the ranks have more than doubled. A number of [line(s) missing], heads of major industrial enterprises, and members of the technical intelligentsia reacted positively to the new entrant in the republic's political arena. Some even joined the PRES; some are still looking with an appraising eye at the political organization which proclaims itself a national conservative party adhering to traditional values: state, family, property, morality. After the signing of a treaty between Russia and Tatarstan, even many officials accept with a great deal of understanding the main ideological tenet of PRES--federalism, the strengthening of the Russian Federation through a diversity of forms of regional economic, political, national, and cultural development. The young party probably will gain new supporters after S. Shakhray's speech yesterday, in which he outlined the PRES' main task as forming a concept of civil accord. His party's like-thinkers are represented in the Federation Council, and 30 State Duma deputies follow PRES aims. Neither can one call its position in the Russian Federation government shaky--four ministers are active members of the party. All this enables the party, in Deputy Prime Minister S. Shakhray's opinion, to conduct a purposeful regional policy using economic and treaty mechanisms. An announcement was made at the presentation that PRES has proposed a concrete draft of a confederation treaty, which envisages creating within the CIS framework a "core" consisting of three or four states ready for greater integration in matters of economics, collective security, and coordinated foreign policy. In the author's conception [line(s) missing], it is possible to form a confederation that envisages equal subjects voluntarily joining into a commonwealth. The key to the problem is how this process will proceed: on the basis of mutual understanding or "a la Zhirinovskiy"--by way of the absorption and destruction of republics and turning them into provinces. Tatarstan's Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev predicted a good future for the PRES. In particular, he said that high political and legal culture are in Tatarstan's interests. We should not forget that not a single of the most complex issues at state level can be resolved without the consent of all sides. And it is good that a party whose activities revolve around the regional theme is currently strengthening its positions. This will help us to act together, to understand one another. A press conference followed, where detailed replies were provided to journalists' questions. For instance, in S. Shakhray's opinion, very soon three directions will play a decisive role in the Russian Federation: [words indistinct], which will include communists; conservatives--on the basis of the PRES; and liberals, but spearheaded by Russia's Choice rather than the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. Time will tell whether this prediction will come true.
