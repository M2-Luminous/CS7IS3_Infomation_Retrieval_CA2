The Chamber makes a point of advising that in keeping with the Constitution, it will never accept an attack on Haiti's sovereignty. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Haiti believes that it must also protest to the American people and the international organizations the untimely statements of President Clinton's representative, William Gray. Mr. Gray, states the Chamber of Commerce, in the policy that he is ready to apply without visiting Haiti, without knowing the country's problems, without getting in touch with the Haitian organizations, attacks the Haitian people. Mr. Gray totally ignores the fact that 90 percent of all airline tickets are bought and used by a small group of vendors. Indeed more than 2,000 to 3,000 venders travel back and forth to Miami, New York, Curacao, and Panama to supply themselves with goods for resale, and to provide jobs to more than 10,000 small distributors. It is this possibility that Mr. Gray wants to prevent because it will increase the number of boat people, since this group will no longer be able to feed their families, states the Chamber of Commerce. Out of 700,000 airline tickets, this group uses approximately 600,000. Only 100,000 tickets are used by the so-called wealthy class and the middle class, those traveling on business and to visit their children studying abroad. Moreover, implying that $50 a month should be enough to support a Haitian family is without a doubt, says the Chamber, an insult to a whole nation, and a scandal similar to genocide. Such statements and all of those who approve of Mr. Gray have ignored the Haitians themselves and are considered detractors and destroyers of the Haitian nation. Furthermore, it is incomprehensible that to restore democracy to Haiti, dictatorial formulas are being used, such as freezing all Haitians' bank accounts in the United States, and imposing an unfair, criminal embargo. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Haiti takes this occasion to reiterate that only Haitians will succeed in solving the current crisis of the country.
