Top communist dissidents expressed this fear yesterday in a statement condemning the "senseless murder" of Martinez by three gunmen who barged in his house in Antipolo, Rizal, last 2 January. Martinez, 44, was shot several times in the head and body in the presence of his wife and son, police said. His assailants had introduced themselves as agents of the National Bureau of Investigation. "Whoever perpetrated this cowardly crime, whether the Ramos government agents or the Stalinist faction, must be punished," said Victor Del Mar, CPP Visayas Commission chair, and Bimbo Magtanggol, NPA Visayas commander. Del Mar is believed to be the rebel name of Arturo Tabara, who recently declared his group's autonomy from the party's "Stalinist faction" because of ideological and political differences. The "Stalinist faction" is reportedly headed by Armando Liwanag said to be the guerrilla name of exiled CPP founding chairman, Jose Maria Sison, and Benito Tiamzon, alleged acting chairman of the party. Del Mar and Magtanggol identified Martinez as "Comrade Poping," a former member of the Visayas Commission, vice commanding officer of NPA-Visayas and member of the Eastern Visayan Party Secretariat. They said he was an active opposition leader in the CPP and one of the signatories to a petition calling for a special party plenum, "and thus earned the ire of the ... Stalinist faction." Martinez was arrested in 1990 in Quezon City and charged with illegal possession of firearms in furtherance of rebellion. He was released in 1992 as part of the government's peace initiative with communist rebels. Before he was killed, Martinez worked as a peasant organizer in Samar under the Philippine Ecumenical Action for Community Empowerment (PEACE) Foundation, a nongovernmental organization. "Comrade Poping's death signals the escalation of the party crisis to a higher and violent stage," Del Mar and Magtanggol said. They placed "primary responsibility" for the incident on the Stalinist faction "for creating the conditions which the Ramos government and its agents could exploit to sow bloody intrigues" within the revolutionary movement. As of press time last night, Sison could not be reached for comment at his base in Utrecht, the Netherlands. "We call on all party members in the opposition and the broad masses of the people to condemn this senseless crime and to take steps to put a stop to a possible chain reaction of bloody confrontations," Del Mar and Magtanggol said. The anti-Sison rebels said their communist adversaries have declared intent and capability for the "physical elimination" of their detractors. They were referring to an order announced by CPP spokesman Gregorio "Comrade Roger" Rosal last month to try critics before "people's courts" for alleged crimes against the people. Issued "charge sheets" were Tabara; Romulo Kintanar, alleged former NPA chief; Felimon Lagman, head of the CPP Metro Manila-Rizal committee; and Ricardo Reyes, alleged CPP secretary general.
