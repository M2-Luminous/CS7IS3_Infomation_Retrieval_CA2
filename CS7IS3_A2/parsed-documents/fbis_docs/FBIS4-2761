The bank is preparing to issue 15 billion to 30 billion Japanese yen worth of bonds in Tokyo, said Huo Tuanjie, deputy general manager of the bank's foreign exchange department. The money raised by the bond issue will be used to finance Chinese energy and transportation development, she said. Huo said the Bank of China has been in contact with well-known Japanese securities companies and banks about underwriting the bonds. She said the bank will decide whether to issue the bonds at fixed or floating rates according to market conditions. "We will select the best time to enter the market," she said. "It will probably be done in the first half of this year." The interest rate for bonds issued in Japan has remained quite low, which will reduce the bank's costs. The rate for one-year Libor (London inter-bank offered rate) bonds in Japan is about 2 percentage points lower than in the United States. And, Huo said, the rate is expected to bounce up in the second half of the year. Although the low rate will save money for the bank, it will also bring some disadvantages. Investors are usually reluctant to invest in low-rated bonds since the yields are less, so the bonds' issuer must rely on its good reputation with investors. Huo said the Bank of China is quite experienced in the Japanese market, having issued bonds there 14 times in the past decade. Japanese investors are familiar with the Bank of China and have been enthusiastic buyers of its bonds. Japan has played an important role in the bank's long-term strategy for pooling capital internationally. It was the first market the bank entered and served as a springboard for entering Europe and the United States. Earlier this year, the bank issued $500 million in Yankee bonds, its first flotation in the United States. But Huo cautioned, "While making efforts to tap new markets, we should also pay great attention to strengthening our foothold in our traditional market." Besides Japan, she said, the Bank of China will look for the proper time to go back to the European market. So far, the bank has issued 21 batches of bonds in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Singapore and the United States with a combined face value of $4 billion. Issuing bonds not only raises foreign capital, but promotes the reputation of the Bank of China. "We are trying to make the Bank of China a globally-known name in financial circles," Huo said. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |BOC's Overseas Bonds | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Time |Place |Amount |Term | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | |(Billions) |(years) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1984 |Tokyo |JY20 |10 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1985 |Tokyo |JY20 |10 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1985 |Frankfurt |Dm0.15 |7 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1985 |Tokyo |JY30 |10 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1985 |Tokyo |USD0.15 |10 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1986 |Tokyo |JY20 |10 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1986 |Tokyo |JY50 |12 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1986 |Frankfurt |USD0.2 |10 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1987 |Singapore |USD0.2 |10 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1987 |Tokyo |JY15 |5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1987 |London |USD0.2 |5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1988 |Luxembourg |JY15 |5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1988 |Frankfurt |DM0.2 |5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1989 |Tokyo |JY20 |10 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1991 |Tokyo |JY20 |5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 |Tokyo |JY15 |5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 |Singapore |USD0.15 |5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1993 |Tokyo |JY15 |5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1993 |Tokyo |JY15 |7 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1993 |London |USD0.2 |5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1994 |New York |USD0.5 |5, 20 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Text](Note: DM stands for Deutsche marks, JY stands for Japanese yen, USD stands for U.S. dollars)
