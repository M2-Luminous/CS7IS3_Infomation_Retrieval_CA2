FBIS4-47692 "drafr084_cs94015" FBIS-AFR-94-084-S Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Strike Reported at Northern Cape IEC Office Strike Reported at Northern Cape IEC Office MB3004183994 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1807 GMT 30 Apr 94 MB3004183994 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] De Aar April 30 SAPA -- Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] officials in the IEC's control room at De Aar in the Northern Cape on Saturday [30 April] embarked on a sit-in strike because, they said, complaints about pay had not been addressed, a SAPA correspondent reports. They said they had unsuccessfully asked for service contracts and information on pay scales when employed two weeks ago. After insisting on these late on Saturday afternoon, they were provided by the IEC regional office in Kimberley. But the pay offered was less than they had hoped for and the strike began. An official said the pay offered was less than that offered to officials in the main urban centres. Telephone communications with the control room have been cut and striking officials are not responding to faxes. IEC officials at Springbok and Upington are also dissatisfied about not receiving service contracts or information on pay scales. Vote counting at De Aar was continuing on Saturday night, despite problems in the control room.
