FBIS4-48294 "drafr095_c_94017" FBIS-AFR-94-095 Daily Report 13 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Agreement Reached With Warring Factions on Gold Mine Agreement Reached With Warring Factions on Gold Mine MB1405063394 Johannesburg SAPA in English 2247 GMT 13 May 94 MB1405063394 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg May 13 SAPA -- Western Areas gold mine management reached an agreement with two warring factions on its mine on Friday, ending fighting which led to the killing of six miners since last weekend. Mine owners Johannesburg Consolidated Investment [JCI] Gold Division Chairman Kennedy Maxwell said the parties agreed to a code of conduct, security arrangements and a high-level committee to investigate the causes of conflict. In terms of the agreement mine security personnel and National Peace Secretariat monitors would be deployed underground where four miners were killed on Wednesday. Western areas consulting engineer John Brownriggs said miners had agreed to resume work on Saturday. Search teams comprising mine security, the South African National Defence Force, the Internal Stability Unit and the National Peace Secretariat had confisticated eight tons of home-made weapons during hostel searches in the past week. Mr Brownriggs said initial indications were that the faction fighting was a sequel to the killing of two Zulu miners returning from an Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] rally on April 17. Subsequent to the arrest of a Xhosa suspect on May 4, renewed tension arose in the mine when a group went to the mine management demanding the release of their arrested colleague, he added. JCI was assessing production losses resulting from the work stoppages during the conflict and would make an announcement next week, Mr Maxwell said. Production had continued throughout the period as white miners had continued working. National Union of Mineworkers [NUM] Assistant General Secretary Gwede Mantashe said the code of conduct agreed to with JCI provided for the control of access to mine hostels, possession of weapons as a dismissable offence and control of visits by non-hostel dwellers. Mr Mantashe blamed the conflict on the housing of workers on ethnic lines and the promotion of IFP-aligned elements to undermine the NUM. Mr Maxwell conceded that historically workers had been housed according to ethnic affiliations, but JCI had started negotiations a year ago to abolish ethnic housing. JCI Gold Division human resources manager Craig Lawrence said the transformation from compulsory segregation to integration was a sensitive and difficult problem, with no consensus among all those involved.
