U.S. President Bill Clinton was facing harsh criticism of his foreign policy -- or of his neglect of foreign policy -- and he took the bull by the horns. Over the 16 months of his presidency so far, the bull usually was where the cameras stood. Be it a news conference in the White House, which was convened just to justify his actions; the carefully staged "town hall meeting" in the midst of an impressive crowd of citizens; or the "Global Forum" that was carried by the U.S. television station CNN on Tuesday evening [3 May]: The ups and downs of devastating accusations, their "talkmasterly" refutation of political mishaps, their telegenic correction of neglect of international crises, and correcting this in a way that is very impressive for the public, have become the characteristic quality of this President. The man in the White House made mistakes in the Whitewater scandal, is swaying in social policy, and is sloppy in foreign policy -- but then he makes his critics look like school children in public. This is also what happened on Tuesday at CNN in Atlanta. Journalists from 80 countries asked hesitatingly -- and the president answered grandly. The political pressure to act had become too great; thus, Bill Clinton used the "Global Forum" to sell the domestic and international audience a new policy for Haiti. It is time "to go" for the military rulers in Port-au-Prince and to let the elected and then ousted President Aristide return from his exile in the United States. Suddenly, the President "no longer" wanted to rule out military intervention, knowing that junta chief General Raoul Cedras can also receive "CNN International." However, the Clinton administration's policy toward Haiti, with its direct deportation of Haitian refugees, remains as morally dubious as it was before and the threatened replacement of the diplomacy of compromise with a military intervention can hardly be taken seriously, particularly since the sanctions, which have now been applied for at the UN Security Council, are far less than what critics demand. However, Clinton's appearance in Atlanta was certainly sufficient to reestablish the "image" of a competent President who is dedicated to foreign policy. A strong statement on Haiti, an elegantly oscillating answer regarding the policy toward Bosnia, a monologue full of statistics on the human rights conflict with China -- compared with that, the harmless questions of the journalists felt like interjections by gullible country bumpkins. If President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the inventor of the charming "fireside chats" on the radio and John F. Kennedy was the first U.S. President of the television age, then Bill Clinton is the master of interactive media talks, from the local radio talk show to global satellite conferences. However, it is quite a different question whether these skills Clinton has guarantee a successful presidency, because the rescue attempts are subject to the law of diminishing returns: Every time he manages to talk himself out of a quandary, a bit of the authority of his presidency seems to have been used up. For the superficial television watcher such tricks may be sufficient, but Clinton will hardly manage in this way to create a community of supporters dedicated to him, because what his critics have repeatedly accused the President of is not a lack of competence, but a lack of concentration, staying power, character, and credibility. These are qualities whose credible presentation requires more than a "Global Forum" a la CNN.
