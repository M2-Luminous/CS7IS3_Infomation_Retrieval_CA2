He expressed his deep remorse over any trouble the remark may have caused to Taiwan-Japan relations. The 71-year-old upper house member was forced to resign from the new Japanese cabinet last week after the MAINICHI SHIMBUN quoted him as saying the "rape of Nanking was a fabrication" and that the Pacific war "was not an error." His remarks prompted severe criticism at home and abroad. In the meeting with Nagano, Lin expressed the hope that for the the good of Sino-Japanese relations, all Japanese should be taught the truth of Japan's militaristic expansion into Asia before World War II. Nagano, who once served as chief of staff of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, has been a member of the upper house for two terms.
