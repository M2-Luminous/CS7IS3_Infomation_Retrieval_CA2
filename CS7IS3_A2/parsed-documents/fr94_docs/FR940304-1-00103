FR940304-1-00103 FR940304-1-00014 United Technologies Carrier proposed a separate product class for a combined space and water heater. Electricity-using design options are viable for combination appliances, but would cause substantial increases in prices for gas water heater installations, and would inconvenience many customers. (United Technologies Carrier, No. 84 at 1). The Florida Governor's Office and the Northwest Power Planning Council proposed a product class for desuperheater water heaters. These are popular in Florida and use waste heat from air conditioners. Therefore, they operate only during the cooling season. (Florida Governor's Office, No. 42 at 6, and Northwest Power Planning Commission, No. 32 at 2). Before the Department can consider combination space and water heating appliances and desuperheating water heaters for regulation, test procedures would have to be developed and adopted by DOE for such appliances. Furthermore, appliances that provide combined services will be examined during a forthcoming rulemaking on amended standards for central air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps. Design options. There were many comments on the design options for water heaters. A discussion of these comments follows below. The Southern Gas Association and other gas companies provided price estimates of more efficient water heater designs. For water heaters with energy factors of 0.63, 0.74, and 0.54, the American Gas Association estimated uninstalled prices of $667, $729, and $195, respectively. (Southern Gas Association No. 4 at 4; Energen Corp. and Alabama Gas Corp., No. 12 at 6; South Carolina Electric and Gas Co., No. 34 at 3; Montana-Dakota Utilities Co., No. 54 at 3; Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, No. 57 at 4). The Columbia Gas provided a comparison of design options, energy factors and retail prices for four designs of efficiencies of gas water heaters. These were atmospheric draft/underfired (energy factor .54, $150-$350), atmospheric draft/subchamber (energy factor .62, $250-$500), forced draft/subchamber (energy factor .72, $600-$900), forced draft/immersed chamber (energy factor .82, $1300-$1800). (Columbia Gas, No. 45 at 3). The Department used a retail price of $155.48 for the baseline model with an energy factor of .54. This is based on a factory cost of $95.63 supplied by the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association. The 63 percent markup from factory cost to retail price was provided by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model. Installation expense used in the analysis for the baseline model was $126.12. The Department included a standard venting, submerged combustion chamber water heater with heat traps, reduced heat leaks and R&hyph;16 insulation in the analysis, with an estimated energy factor of .57. At large-scale production, the submerged combustion chamber will not increase the factory cost. 17 The heat traps, reduced heat leaks, and R&hyph;16 insulation added $18.19 to the factory cost, for a total factory cost of $113.82. The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model estimated a markup of about 57 percent for a total retail price of $179.22. 17 This information was from Robert Cook who cited a study on projected costs done by A.O. Smith. A model with an energy factor of .74 (calculated to have an energy factor of .71 using the proposed test procedure) was also included in the analysis. This unit has 2 inches of foam insulation surrounding a plastic tank, heat traps, indirect heating of the water, and electronic ignition. The Department estimated the factory cost of this unit at large-volume production to be $344.41. This estimate was based on an estimated 16 percent reduction in factory costs due to large-scale production. The retail price predicted by Manufacturer Impact Model was $612.96, with a 78 percent markup. A water heater with forced draft and submerged combustion chamber was not analyzed. However, the Department did consider forced draft with increased baffling. An estimated incremental manufacturing cost of $312.50 was supplied by the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association. Heat traps, reduced heat leaks, and R&hyph;16 insulation were also included on this unit for an energy factor of .67 (calculated to have an energy factor of .66 using the proposed test procedure). A total factory cost of $426.32 was used. A markup of 40 percent from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model was applied to arrive at a retail price of $596.83. The Department was not aware of any existing designs or prototypes for water heaters with forced draft and immersed chambers. No analysis was done for this design option.
