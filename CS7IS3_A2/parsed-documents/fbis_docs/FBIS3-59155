Denktas was speaking at Ercan [Tymbou] Airport before he went on a private visit to Istanbul this morning. He said that in today's papers he read that the Greek Cypriots will not attend the meetings on the confidence-building measures. However, he added, I do not have any official information confirming this. I hope this is not true. Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side expects the Greek Cypriots to place their views on the table, approach, the points they accept and those they do not accept, and also, if they have any reservations, to inform the UN secretary general of them with a letter, like the Turkish Cypriot side did. He added: In this way, the duty of Mr. Clark and Mr. Feissel would be to work together to eliminate any conflicts there might exist in the documents posited by the two sides. Denktas revealed that the United Nations found the Turkish Cypriot letter and document favorable. It is obvious, the president stressed, that the Turkish Cypriot side is showing its intent to reconcile. Denktas pointed out that if he receives official information about the attitude of the Greek Cypriot side, and if he learns of the reasons of this attitude, then he can reply to them. The president said that he did not have another telephone conversation with Joe Clark. In a statement on arrival to Istanbul, Denktas reiterated that the Turkish Cypriot side has adopted a conciliatory attitude regarding the Cyprus problem. He pointed out that he held positive talks with Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special envoy in Cyprus. Denktas added that the Turkish Cypriots will continue to show their goodwill. The president recalled that the Turkish Cypriot side informed the UN secretary general with a letter that it will participate in the work on the confidence-building measures with a constructive and positive attitude. He said: The right thing to do, the natural thing to do, is for Kliridhis to write in a letter what he accepts, and if there is a difference of opinion between us, then we must sit at the negotiating table and resolve it between ourselves. Denktas said he learned that Kliridhis did not find the Turkish Cypriot letter satisfactory and will therefore not attend the meetings. Denktas added: If Kliridhis is saying that he will not sit at the negotiating table unless the Turkish Cypriots concede to a certain line, and if he is trying to make us concede to that line without him making any concessions, then this is a distorted approach. Replying to a question, Denktas said that the use of the Lefkosa [Nicosia] International Airport -- under UN observation -- by Turkish Cypriots is included in the agreement. Ercan Airport will continue to function too, he added.
