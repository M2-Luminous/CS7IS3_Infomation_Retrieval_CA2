If the two days of meetings among heads of state and government in Brussels are compared with the 1991 Rome summit meeting and, a year earlier, the one in London, it can be seen that the Atlantic alliance is still the most important basis for peace and security in Europe. Yet, it has also become obvious that this is exactly why NATO is at the moment unable to come up to people's expectations. It disappointed the hopes of the Central and East European countries, which would like to join NATO, and has thus gone onto the defensive. This has overshadowed the offer of military cooperation on which the heads of state and government agreed in Brussels, even though what NATO is offering the countries in Central and East Europe with the Partnership for Peace is quite something. The offer includes joint military exercises, seats for representatives of the partner states at NATO's political and military headquarters in Europe, staff cooperation for planning and implementing UN operations and crisis management, and the harmonization of the armed forces of the partner states on technology and operational procedures to facilitate cooperation with NATO forces in the future. Moreover, NATO has promised its future partners consultations when they feel threatened. Hence, NATO is being serious when it expresses its intention to develop pan-European security structures and to include its former opponents in such structures. What is taking place here is of a different quality than irregular meetings within the UN framework. NATO's plan to negotiate a treaty with each partner state to specify the framework document that was adopted in Brussels according to the individual country's capabilities and interests offers additional opportunities to do justice to individual needs. All that has an impact on Europe's security. That this has failed to get the praise desired by NATO is due to the fact that many governments to which this offer was directed only see it as a consolation prize that is unable to alleviate their disappointment about being unable to become NATO members in the foreseeable future and to remain without protection that the alliance's assistance obligation would offer. Their position is determined by the desire to protect themselves against imponderables and dangers that might once more emanate from Russia. In view of these countries' experience, their position is understandable. However, the NATO members had very good reasons to turn down their request. Future developments in Russia and other important countries in East Europe appear uncertain. The risks that NATO would have incurred with the assistance obligation would not be calculable. Moreover, the assistance obligation would have to have been reinforced by the political will and the military capabilities to use NATO forces in faraway eastern areas under currently unclear framework conditions. The assistance obligation must not be an empty promise that would imperil NATO's credibility. Germany would have special difficulties with such consequences, not only because it might involve new armament efforts but also because it would reestablish NATO's old front-line position against Moscow, and it would forfeit the chance to integrate Russia. This, however, would run counter to the interests of all the European countries. The experience from history is obvious: Without taking into consideration Russian interests and without integrating Russia into a European security system there can be no security, particularly for those states that strongly miss this security right now: Russia's immediate neighbors. Only very rarely does one get the chance to build a security system that is inherently stable because it is based on an accommodation of interests of all the states on the continent. This is why this chance must not be forfeited. NATO is doing the right thing in trying to take advantage of the current favorable situation. If at all possible, Russia has to be integrated into the West's policy. This is what Partnership for Peace is seeking, because it is not only open to states that fear that Russia might return to its policy of hegemony, but even to Russia itself. Should Moscow participate in Partnership for Peace in the same way that it does in the NATO Cooperation Council, it would be a first step toward military cooperation, and thus to the development of an pan-European security system. Not only the European countries but also the United States are interested in such a system. With their Partnership for Peace, the United States and its allies have shown that they are ready to take Russia's wishes and interests into account -- to contribute to Yeltsin's success. For European security the success of the democratic forces in Russia is more important than extending NATO eastward. Should, however, the reformers in Moscow fail, the next NATO summit would have to face some difficult decisions. Still, even then NATO would not have to accuse itself of forfeiting the chance to build a European security system together with Russia.
