Speaking in the Kazakh parliament on Thursday [9 June], he emphasized that the country had to face a very heavy economic and social crisis. Nazarbayev suggested that reforms in the credit-bank sphere were the guidelines of the economic policy. He said that the key task was to fight down the run-away inflation and to strengthen the national currency unit. Nazarbayev underlined that to carry out the policy on investments it was necessary that the inflation rate did not exceed 10 pct per month. He said that the inflation rate might decrease in autumn to 9 pct or 10 pct if a tough credit policy be carried out. In March, the inflation rate in Kazakhstan was 17 pct. In April, it went up to 31 pct. Nazarbayev insisted that all state expenditures be reduced except for the vitally important ones and that there be no more direct or hidden subsidies to enterprises. He also considered it necessary to free prices for all goods and services, and for bread. "The budget must be tough in what concerns its implementation," the Kazakh president pointed out. Nazarbayev was against resignation of the Kazakh Government led by Sergei Tereshchenko. "All of us can be changed. However, there is no way to fool the natural laws. We will just defer the agony and waste the time," he suggested. Nazarbayev announced that the government had worked out a new program of anti-crisis measures. The president is expected to confirm it in the near future. Over 15 months the government may have a carte blanche for implementation of its program. Nazarbayev proposed that a coalition of supporters of the reforms be established, in which all powers and public and political organizations would participate. He stressed that an atmosphere of stability and national accord was required for realization of the planned reforms. Nazarbayev demanded that the government work out a special program in order to put an end to migration from Kazakhstan for ethnic reasons. He suggested that a new law on languages must be adopted and the status of the Russian language be reviewed. The Russian language in Kazakhstan is that of inter-ethnic communication but not the second state one. The policy on personnel issues must also be improved. The Kazakh president said that the issue on citizenship was still pressing. He believes that all handicaps for acquisition of citizenship when moving from one country into another should be eliminated. However, Nazarbayev stressed once again that Kazakhstan would not accept dual citizenship since its introduction could deteriorate the situation with inter-ethnic relations in the country. Commenting on his initiative on establishment of the Euro-Asian Union, Nazarbayev emphasized that the CIS must be transformed into a more efficient formation -- "from the old irresponsible forms of integration to a totally new union." He suggested that the CIS peoples sought this but were hindered by the political elite. Nazarbayev thought that the Euro-Asian Union could help to overcome the economic crisis and would be a guarantor for security of its member-states in the background of instability in the southern CIS. Nazarbayev said that putting an end to military actions between the member-states of the future union would be one of the obligatory condition for those countries, which would like to join the Euro-Asian Union.
