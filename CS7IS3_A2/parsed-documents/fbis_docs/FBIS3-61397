Their Ramifications for the Future of Lithuania": "Ceslovas Jursenas: 'We May and Must Work Well for the Good of Lithuania'"] [Text] Naturally, the last week of the year could not go by without an analysis and discussion of the operation of the Seimas. We did this both at a meeting of the leadership of the Seimas and among our associates. To my mind, the best result is that, if we were to compartmentalize the work of the Seimas by session and month, it has become more intensive, organized, and fruitful. As the leader of the Seimas, I certainly find this gratifying. Of course, we argue at plenary sessions, and sometimes quarrel. However, our productivity is obvious. What has been required of the Seimas under the Constitution has mostly been completed. We will discuss and adopt at our session the things we have not completed after all, the draft legal acts we have not managed to translate into the form of laws; this is why the session was extended. What remains is to pass several articles of the law on Seimas controllers or ombudsmen, and to vote on this law, which establishes a new and very important constitutional institution. In the future people will be able to turn to it with complaints about bureaucratic, unlawful actions of officials and employees of government and self-government structures. That is, along with state control which monitors how state property is used, how the budget is implemented, and so on, we will have an office which is called upon to analyze specific actions of officials and defend the legitimate interests of citizens. The adoption of the 1994 state budget on time certainly is a favorable aspect of what the Seimas has accomplished. This is of special note because the budget was adopted as the Constitution requires for the first time in the years of independence, i.e. the full four years. Is this a good or a bad budget? I would say it is mediocre because we did not succeed in meeting all needs; the situation of the state is still quite difficult, but we do already have a budget, and certain prospects together with it. If we consider that in 1993 Lithuania hit the bottom in its socioeconomic development and achieved a certain stabilization, albeit at a low level, this means that in 1994 we should have an opportunity to elevate ourselves and climb out of the hole of the crisis. I believe that the Seimas has facilitated this by way of its legislative proceedings, its cadre decisions, and its activity. As far as the budget specifically is concerned, as I see it, it is primarily called upon to meet social needs. This budget is intended for the people to a greater degree than those we have had so far. I believe that everything possible has been done to meet their needs, and that the government, in keeping with its policy, will help retirees, the handicapped, and other low-income strata of the population if new funds become available. Agriculture, for which 400 million lits were appropriated, was the second concern of the budget. Although agrarian deputies counted on greater funds, judging from their criticism, things that were done for the rural areas exceeded our potential to begin with. It was also important that Seimas commissions analyzed and revealed shortcomings in relations between producers of agricultural products and representatives of processing enterprises and mutual complaints were clarified; we now have an extra opportunity to regulate mutual settlements. There was no dearth of criticism concerning expenditures from the budget for state government. I would say that these were largely populist statements; there are people who like to rail at the authorities and demand that wages and other expenditures of the government staff be cut. However, when I read letters from the people, of which a great many are addressed to me, I find out that complaints from the people are mainly due to a failure to sort things out, a lack of potential to do so, and so on rather than the desire to harm someone or gain advantage. If we keep cutting wages or outlays on the government staff, it will hardly retain good specialists. Competent and businesslike people will leave for some kind of commercial structures. If we were to look at it seriously, this would be an antistate decision because both the Seimas and the government structures need skilled workers no less than any other organization. Having increased expenditures, we have the legal and moral right to demand high-quality and effective work and the performance of their duty from the people. We already have a preliminary plan for the future spring session. A comprehensive plan of sorts for all our laws and envisioned draft laws, amendments, and additions to the laws has been compiled in order to see graphically how the system of state government and state structures will be transformed in keeping with the Constitution. If in addition to that we refine certain articles of the Seimas Statute, I believe that the spring session will be held in a still better organized format. The draft laws on retirement benefits, taxes, land use, antialcohol control, and so on are among the most important draft laws. It is natural that heated debates are now taking place at Seimas meetings. The truth is born from disputes. To be sure, it is possible to call into doubt the constructive nature of particular pronouncements and proposals of Seimas members. However, if different opinions exist, all of them must be heard and discussed. I know that many people are concerned about the prospects for relations between the position [as published] and the opposition. Some interpret the activity of the Fatherland Union party, such as was recently displayed at its congress, as well as at the Sajudis congress, as a threat to domestic political relations in the country. I think that political attacks of this kind are not viable and are transient. The consent of almost the entire Seimas is needed in order to hold early elections to the Seimas, as they proclaimed at these events; this case is clearly defined in the Constitution. This is resolved either by the Seimas itself or by the president dissolving the Seimas in a certain situation. The president's opportunities also depend on our considered or not considered actions. I believe that this composition of the Seimas works in a quite organized and effective manner; the members of the Seimas have improved perceptibly with regard to parliamentary work. Given the experience we now have, we may work calmly and work well for the good of Lithuania. I see no formidable grounds for early elections; if anyone does see them, let them make demands--it is their right. They wish to aggravate and inflame the situation. What can we do? However, we will have enough energy and patience to engage in our positive endeavor. It is precisely through such positive actions in both the legislative and executive areas that we will ensure that Lithuania moves ahead. As far as our interaction, for example, cooperation within the framework of the Seimas, it existed and must exist in the future. Of course, we cannot accept proposals of the right-wing opposition that would run counter to our electoral program or our principles. After all, we won elections, and are pursuing our own policy; the government and the president do this. However, we accept all constructive proposals, and many such proposals from the right-wing opposition have already been accepted. We are in favor of a constructive approach to work--this is our principled position, my personal position, that of the DPTL [Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania] in the Seimas, and finally, such is the position of the president. I repeat that we may and should work well to benefit Lithuania. I would like to wish all people of Lithuania a quiet year of work. I am convinced that this year will be better than the last, and life will gradually become easier if we work in a quiet environment to benefit ourselves and advance the country.
