As part of the agreement between Amman and Tehran, the last of the 33 diplomats left at the end of February and the previously bustling embassy, according to the secretary general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been reduced to four diplomats, including the ambassador, four administrators, a driver and cook. Nayef Hadid told the JORDAN TIMES that the Kingdom believed it was necessary to request the reduction because the number of Iranian diplomats in Jordan was not compatible with Amman's two diplomats in Tehran. In the first on-the-record confirmation of the Jordanian request, Mr. Hadid said that he first approached the Iranian ambassador here about reducting his diplomatic staff in November last year. "Ten days later, Iranian guards shot at our embassy in Tehran injuring a security man," Mr Hadid said. The shooting incident was not reported in Jordan. Officials, however, had said that Jordanian ambassador to Iran Yasin Istanbuli was attacked at his home in Tehran and his assailants searched his house and stole some of its contents in August of that year. It was Tehran's refusal to apologise officially over the mistreatment of the Jordanian ambassador that initially made the Jordanian government ask for the reduction. Sources had said that Mr. Istanbuli was tied up for several hours while his assailants searched his house and stole some of its contents. Jordanian officials at the time expressed their suspicion that the assailants of Mr. Istanbuli belonged to one of the security wings in Iran and demanded that the Iranian government investigate the cause. The government here, according to the sources, also demanded an "official apology" from Tehran but only received a message that the Iranian government was "sorry" that the attack had taken place. Privately, officials say that the Kingdom was becoming concerned over increased activities by Iranian diplomats to infiltrate cultural and research centres in the Kingdom and distribute leaflets targetting Gulf regimes. Officials contacted by the JORDAN TIMES would not confirm these accusations but one source said that the embassy had been able to win support among private sector businessmen here and that these influential traders contacted the Foreign Ministry on behalf of the embassy when it first became known that they were being asked to reduce their staff. Jordan and Iran restored diplomatic relations in 1990 after a decade of strained relations caused by Amman's support of Iraq in the 1980-88 war. Iran reopened its embassy in March 1990 and appointed the first ambassador in 13 years in October 1993.
