CONTENTS: 1. Awqaf Minister's Efforts Defended 2. Imams Urged to Take Propagation Initiative 3. Western Media Criticized 4. Koran Meanings Translated into Albanian, Bosnian 5. NATO Ultimatum to Serbs AWQAF MINISTER'S EFFORTS DEFENDED In its 22 February issue, the state-owned weekly 'AQIDATI publishes on page one a 300-word editorial signed by Board Chairman Samir Rajab defending Awqaf Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub from criticism. The writer begins by saying that it is not surprising to see Dr. Mahjub attacked because he is a successful man, and it has become the habit in Egypt to criticize only successful people. He adds that the main accusation leveled at the minister was that only policemen and state employees attend his seminars and meetings, but this accusation was refuted last week when thousands came to hear him speak in Upper Egypt. The writer then praises the minister for his successful efforts in bringing Christians and Muslims closer together and arranging meetings between Coptic Pope Shinudah and Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi and Shaykh Muhammad Mutawalli al-Sha'rawi. In conclusion, the writer says: "While Awqaf Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub has taken upon himself the task of confronting terrorism with an enlightened mind and a boldness that many lack, he must fully realize that the propagators, planners, and perpetrators of terrorism will use all illegal means to deter him from this noble aim. Hence, what they are using against him now is one of these dirty tricks, intellectual terrorism. But we tell him: Continue on this path and fear nothing but God Almighty, your conscience, and the Egyptian people." IMAMS URGED TO TAKE PROPAGATION INITIATIVE Further reporting on Dr. Mahjub's activities, the paper publishes on page two a 450-word report on speeches he made in al-Minya and Asyut that focused on the roles and duties of mosque imams. Speaking in al-Minya, he urged the imams to retake the initiative in propagation and stand firmly against impostors. He said: "Religious propagation and those in charge of it have entered a stage where the situation has become confused and trends have diversified; where a group that has no knowledge of religion, its tenets, or the rules or methods of propagation are vying with the legally, religiously, and constitutionally qualified imams. This has lead to confusion in religious thinking among our youth. Adulterated thinking has been propagated among our youths by a group of people who have nothing to do with their religion's thinking and who are not asked to explain this thinking." He then warned: "We will pay a heavy price and the moderate Islamic course will be affected" if any of the imams fail in their duties. After stating a similar message in a speech in Asyut, the minister added that the state is responsible for the correct concept of Islamic propagation, fully supports religious establishments, and gives them unlimited backing. He then urged the imams to go to the streets, mosques, youth centers, and schools to spread the message. WESTERN MEDIA CRITICIZED On page six, the paper publishes a 340-word comment by Basyuni al-Halawani in the "Very Frankly" column, in which he criticizes the Western media for exaggerating "individual and limited" terrorist actions that take place in Egypt in order to distort the image of Islam and damage Egypt's economy. After noting the number of terrorist incidents in Germany in 1993, the writer says that comparing the terrorist incidents in Egypt with those abroad shows that real terrorism is in Europe and not in Egypt, "which remains the most stable and safe country in the world, and that treachery and betrayal will not change the Egyptians' tolerant nature." But, he adds, the western media is persisting in exaggerating these incidents, and this shows that there are specific objectives in this campaign. He then calls for a stand against these correspondents "who speak only in the name of extremism and terrorism and who are looking daily for whatever distorts our image and damages our interests while turning a blind eye to all Egyptian achievements." He adds that this entails drawing up rules and regulations and reviewing our media policy of dealing with terrorism and extremism so as not to give the Western media the opportunity to continue publishing tendentious reports. KORAN MEANINGS TRANSLATED INTO ALBANIAN, BOSNIAN The paper carries on page 11 a 700-word report describing the efforts of the Islamic Relief Society and its latest achievement, the printing of 100,000 copies of interpretations of the Koran in the Albanian and Bosnian languages for distribution among Muslims in these two countries. NATO ULTIMATUM TO SERBS On page 21, 'AQIDATI carries a 300-word comment by Ashraf Abu-al-Hawl on the aftermath of the NATO ultimatum to the Serbs in Bosnia. He says that NATO should extend this ultimatum to other Muslim areas but concludes by saying that one should not expect "the West to sacrifice its sons for a few Muslims, even if they are Europeans or Slavs, as is the case with the Bosnians. Therefore, we have no choice but to accept the West's solution as long as we cannot resolve it ourselves."
