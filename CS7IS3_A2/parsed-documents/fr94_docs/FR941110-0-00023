ACTION: Immediate final rule. SUMMARY: North Carolina has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). North Carolina's revisions consist of the provisions of HSWA Cluster I promulgated November 8, 1984, through June 30, 1987. The Environmental Protection Agency has reviewed North Carolina's application and has made a decision, subject to review and comment, that North Carolina's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve North Carolina's hazardous waste program revisions. North Carolina's application for program revisions is available for public review and comment. DATES: Final authorization for North Carolina's program revisions shall be effective January 9, 1995 unless EPA publishes a prior Federal Register action withdrawing this immediate final rule. All comments on North Carolina's program revision application must be received by the close of business, December 12, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION A. Background States with final authorization under Section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements under Section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements. In accordance with Part 271, ยง271.21(a) of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 271.21(a)), revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268 and 270. B. North Carolina North Carolina initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on December 31, 1984, (49 FR 48694). North Carolina most recently received final authorization effective June 3, 1994, for RCRA Cluster II (59 FR 15633, April 4, 1994). On October 29, 1991, North Carolina submitted a program revision application for additional program approval for the requirements of HSWA Cluster I. EPA granted North Carolina interim authorization for HSWA Cluster I effective June 1, 1993. Today, North Carolina is seeking final authorization of its program revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). EPA has reviewed North Carolina's application and has made an immediate final decision that North Carolina's hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the HSWA Cluster I program modifications to North Carolina. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until December 12, 1994. Copies of North Carolina's application for these program revisions are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the ``Addresses'' section of this notice. Approval of North Carolina's program revisions shall become effective January 9, 1995, unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received, EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. EPA issues, administers, and enforces RCRA hazardous waste permits, or portions of permits, that contain conditions based upon the Federal program provisions for which the State has not received authorization. Upon the effective date of this authorization, EPA will suspend issuance of any further permits under the provisions for which the State is being authorized. Any permits, or portions of permits, that were issued by EPA prior to the effective date of this authorization will be terminated pursuant to 40 CFR 124.5(d). Those permits, or portions of permits, issued by EPA not terminated pursuant to 40 CFR 124.5(d) will either: (1) Be modified to allow for an earlier expiration date pursuant to 40 CFR 270.41 (a); or (2) be administered by the State until the permit is reissued. North Carolina is today seeking authority to administer the following Federal requirements promulgated between November 8, 1984, through June 30, 1987:
