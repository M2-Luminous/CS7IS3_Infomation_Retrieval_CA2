No One Likes It"] [Text] A "roundtable" to discuss a draft Russian Federation Labor Code took place at the Trade and Industry Chamber yesterday. Taking part in the meeting were Federal Assembly deputies, officials of the president's and government's staffs, representatives of business circles and trade unions, as well as law scientists. The draft code was presented by Sergey Panin, chief of the Ministry of Labor legal administration. According to Mr. Panin, the drafters tried to take into account all suggestions and critical amendments that had come in after the fundamentals of the Labor Code had been discussed. At the present stage the draft law consists of three parts: the Principles of the Russian Federation Labor Legislation; Minimum State Guarantees of Russian Federation Citizens' Labor Rights; and Protection of Workers' Labor Rights. In accordance with the text of the draft, "the main objective of state policy in the sphere of socio-labor relations is the provision for every able-bodied person of conditions making it possible for him to maintain the necessary living standard by his work." The code incorporates the principle of delimitation of powers between the central bodies and the power structures of Federation components in the field of regulation of socio-labor relations, outlines the fundamental rights and duties of the employee and the employer, and envisions mechanisms for the resolution of labor conflicts. Mr. Panin deemed it necessary to point to the fact that an "appreciable lowering" of the level of social guarantees compared to the previous legislation indicated in the text of the draft does not signify their real lowering, while this only makes the social protection mechanism more specific and streamlined. At the same time, participants in the discussion subjected the draft to sharp and largely scathing criticism, pointing out its inconsistency and unconstructiveness. A degree of summing up was done by Valeriy Rastorguyev, spokesman for the Federation Council social policy committee, who pointed to the fact that in its present shape the Russian Federation Labor Code had small chances of passing through both chambers of the Federation Assembly.
