According to these reports, Ardzinba said he is rather skeptical about Georgian-Abkhaz consultations set for 11 January. In this connection, the Georgian Foreign Ministry has issued a statement which says, in particular: Ardzinba's radio address shows not only his skepticism, but is also an attempt to poison the atmosphere in advance of the forthcoming [Geneva] talks and, if possible, to wreck them. His judgements are a testimony of this. He says Abkhazia is no longer part of Georgia, that Abkhazia has won the war, that conditions are set by the winners, and that it is only possible to talk about a treaty between Abkhazia and Georgia as two equal entities. The history of the conflict in Abkhazia has many examples proving that Ardzinba and his supporters are used to trampling on and scrapping agreements they have signed themselves. It is enough to mention the fate of the Moscow and Sochi agreements. Such perfidy has become for them an effective and common means of carrying out their intentions. In his New Year address to Abkhazians, Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze said: The democratic Georgian state is giving you not only a guarantee of preserving your national identity but also a guarantee of development and improvement, as well as appropriate political, economic, and other guarantees. We promise this to these people, as we do to anybody else who lives in Georgia. We promise them freedom, civil rights guarantees, and anything else which is accepted in the modern civilized world. This was part of the statement by the Georgian Foreign Ministry, the full text of which will be published in the press.
