[Rabinovich] What is important is not that I have been in this post for a year, but that it is the first anniversary of the Clinton administration and Israel's relations with this administration. I prefer to look at it that way. It was a very good year for these ties, springing from the administration's basically friendly approach and the understanding formed between the two states on the peace process. It is true that the understanding began in the final months of the Bush administration, but it could not find expression then because the administration was fighting unsuccessfully for its political life. Another factor is the chemistry, or the good relations, between the President, the secretary of state, and other senior officials in the U.S. Administration, with Israeli leaders. It could perhaps be exemplified by the fact that when Foreign Minister Peres visited Washington last week he almost did not have to deal with bilateral issues, since these are being dealt with and their situation is fine. That is perhaps the best way to describe the relations at the end of the Clinton administration's first year in office. [Perl] What bilateral issues are you referring to? [Rabinovich] A year and a half ago there was confrontation over the loan guarantees and the aid was put into question. Up to several months ago there were still restrictions on technological cooperation between the two states, which did not permit us to compete in the U.S. market. The current situation is that we have received a package of aircraft -- F-14A's and F-16's -- following the prime minister's visit here in November, the refurbishing the Air Force's working fleet, the replacement of its spearhead, and I can go on and on. [Perl] Can we say that the main contributing factor is the presence of a sympathetic administration which is ideologically closer to the present Israeli Government, or to the existence of the peace process, or to some combination of the two? [Rabinovich] It is a symbiotic process in which the basic sympathy and common outlook on the peace process and the fact that the Middle East is viewed as one of the areas of success for the administration's foreign policy, are all aspects which feed on each other. You can perform an intellectual exercise and try to give more importance to one of the elements at the expense of the others, but I do not see any point in it. [Perl] Is there a single component within the framework of relations that makes up the backbone, and if it becomes problematic then the entire system becomes problematic? [Rabinovich] No, I think that one of the secrets of the success of the special relationship between the United States and Israel is that it is a basket containing various things, so that even when part of the system does not function properly at various times, it manages to survive thanks to its other parts. There were times when the Pentagon or the White House were friendlier than the State Department or the other way around, and there were times that Congress was considered Israel's safety net in the bilateral ties. The Jewish community is, of course, a permanent asset. The international situation keeps changing. In the '50's, for example, at the peak of the Cold War, Israel was considered a burden. During the late '60's and '70's it was an asset. Every time there was a dominant element and other elements which had an impact on relations. That is one of the secret of their charm. [Perl] Assuming he is confirmed as deputy secretary of state, how do you see Strobe Talbott's role in the peace process and relations with Israel in view of the initial jarring notes concerning his nomination? [Rabinovich] His position (to date he has been the State Department's ambassador-at-large for Russia and the former Soviet republics -- author's note) should be given the same importance that is attached to the role Dennis Ross plays in our region. Talbott was successful in his job as a regional expert, and a man who has been successful in one region should be expected to do the same in another region or in another job. I expect Dennis Ross to continue playing a leading and decisive role in the Middle East, while Talbott sees to general organizational and policy matters in the State Department, not necessarily pertaining to the Middle East. Clearly, the deputy secretary of state will also deal with the Middle East, which is a key issue in the administration's foreign policy. However, I believe that Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Special Ambassador Dennis Ross will continue to do most of the work in this region. I do not want to make any personal comments about Talbott, who is in the midst of a hearing and confirmation process. However, I can say that our paths crossed in the year that he has been doing this job and our work together was very pleasant and effective. [Perl] Upon assuming office, the Clinton administration described its role in the peace process as that of a "honest broker" or a "full partner." The description has not changed, but the substance has. First there was an attempt to terminate the separate rounds of negotiations in Washington and treat the talks as one package, and now we are back to rounds of talks. The latest round was held on the level of delegation heads and as far away from the media as possible. The Americans were seen working behind the scenes. Has the administration's role changed and, if so, how? [Rabinovich] Obviously, the role changed because the process and circumstances changed. Clearly, after the signing of the Declaration of Principles in Oslo and the ceremony in Washington the peace process is not what it was before. Looking back, the members of the peace team did a lot of work on the Palestinian track last spring in Washington. Some of this work contributed to the success in Oslo. Oslo cannot be explained without Washington. The situation has changed because the main talks on the Palestinian track are being held elsewhere. The administration does not get involved because it does not want to become an arbiter between the Palestinians and us. However, both sides update the administration and keep it in the picture. The administration is more active today on the Syrian track than on the Palestinian one. As the peace process makes headway and agreements are attained, I expect there will be other developments and work procedures will change. Indeed, the administration is no less involved today. The President himself became involved in the Syrian track when he met al-Asad in Geneva. [Perl] The Americans submitted their own draft proposals on the Palestinian track. Should we expect them to do the same on the Syrian track? [Rabinovich] They did that only when the sides solicited it. We do not yet need it at this point, and the Americans will definitely will not impose themselves by submitting compromise proposals. [passage omitted] [Perl] During his visit here last week, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres mentioned for the first time that in view of "the exorbitatnt price" the Syrians are demanding for peace, he expects them to bring most of the Arab world into the circle of reconciliation with Israel. Is this a new element in the negotiations with the Syrians? [Rabinovich] It is not a new element, but a new emphasis; by way of making the best of a bad deal. In other words, if the Syrians claim they are the key to a comprehensive agreement and if they claim, quite justifiably, that they have influence over other countries, a breakthrough with Syria should be expected to lead to a reconciliation or to peace with most of the Arab world. The Americans will definitely want to be involved in such a process. They know about this idea, they think it is an excellent one, and they will be happy to help. [Perl] Has it been raised in the talks with the Syrians? [Rabinovich] Not yet. [Perl] Has al-'Allaf heard about it? [Rabinovich] He most certainly has, seeing that it was voiced publicly. However, it is too early to discuss it. We will be able to discuss it in a more concrete manner when we are closer to attaining an agreement. [passage omitted] [Perl] Vice President Al Gore termed the meeting between Clinton and al-Asad "a huge breakthrough." Dennis Ross said this week that it was not a breakthrough but only "a beginning." What caused the "amendment" of the U.S. assessment? [Rabinovich] I believe perspective is a wonderful tool. Now everybody sees Geneva in a different perspective. [Perl] Was the reassessment caused by the death of al-Asad's son, owing to the fact that it may have held up developments in the aftermath of the meeting? [Rabinovich] I do not think Basil's death changed the way in which the Geneva meeting is seen. The effect of this development cannot yet be assessed by anybody. In the meantime, we have discussed the Geneva meeting with the Americans. It is no secret that we were less enthusiastic about it than the Americans. Now, with a perspective of three weeks, they see it as the beginning of something rather than as the middle or end of something. [Perl] The negotiations resume next Tuesday. What can we expect in the 13th round of talks with the Syrians? [Rabinovich] President Clinton stated this week that Syria must demonstrate its willingness and the seriousness of its intentions with regard to peace with Israel. He was referring to the so-called public diplomacy which should be part of the negotiations. The fact that the President made such a statement definitely carries weight. The Syrians are not indifferent to what the Americans say. I definitely do not live with a sense of urgency. The Syrians must elaborate on their position concerning the two issues currently on the agenda: the security arrangements and the time factor. [Perl] In short, how would you sum up this past year and what do you yourself wish for your second year? [Rabinovich] I end this year with a good feeling. We made many small steps as well as a major breakthrough. I would like to see another major breakthrough this coming year.
