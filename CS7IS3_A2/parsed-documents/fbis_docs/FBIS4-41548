The head of the cabinet expressed confidence that there already exists the necessary prerequisites for shifting the emphasis of Western financial support for reform in Russia. Traditional loans whose repayment is directly guaranteed by the Russian Government should be abandoned in favor of targeted financing for specific projects, based on collateral and other ways of ensuring that loans are repaid, he remarked. Chernomyrdin singled out five main areas on which the Russian Government will focus as it implements policy on attracting large-scale foreign investment. First, it will strive to ensure that legislation regulating the activities of foreign investors is as complete and settled as it should be. Second, it will seek changes to the tax system designed to stimulate production and investment. Third, it will pursue a vigorous investment policy, in the context of which it intends to allocate most centralized financial resources on a competitive basis, promote mixed (state and private sector) funding, provide government guarantees for investment and improve the system of insurance for capital investment. Fourth, competition in industry and, especially, banking should be given the utmost encouragement. Fifth, foreign investors will be given the legal information they need. The prime minister referred to legal enactments regulating enterprises with foreign investment that are in the pipeline. He said that draft laws envisaged a number of major changes to the tax position of foreign investors. Enterprises with foreign investment are expected to be exempted from profits tax for five years after registration. Restrictions on operations connected with the movement of capital are likely to be lifted and foreign investors (i.e. enterprises with 100 percent foreign capital) will be granted the right to own land on which they build new enterprises, installations, or production facilities. Furthermore, enterprises with foreign investment will be allowed to keep all the hard currency earnings from exports of their own goods. Machinery, technological equipment, spare parts, raw and other materials, components,and semi-finished goods that enterprises import for their own production needs will be exempted from tax levies and customs duty.
