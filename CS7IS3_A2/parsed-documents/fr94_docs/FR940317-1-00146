In addition, as outlined in 32 CFR 537.23, the RJA is authorized to direct the MTF to withhold release of medical records until the injured party provides the statement and other information required by ยง536.226(a)(2); the RJA may not, however, direct the MTF to withhold medical records if the injured party's attorney merely refuses to enter into a representation agreement. In appropriate cases, the claims office should intervene in pending litigation. (d) If the injured party's attorney improperly withholds or disburses money collected on behalf of the Government, the RJA should immediately initiate action to recover the money owed through litigation or through State disciplinary proceedings after appropriate coordination in accordance with AR 27&hyph;40 and AR 27&hyph;1. (e) Claims personnel may obtain an assignment from the injured party or his attorney for the reasonable value of the care that the United States provided if this will facilitate collection. The absence of an assignment does not affect the Government's independent right under the FMCRA, however, and an assignment is normally not necessary. ยง536.227 The MTF Third Party Recovery Program (TPCP).
