The Foreign Committee believes air strikes do not represent a solution in themselves if the warring sides do not reach agreement. Consequently it recommends the opposing sides to accept the NATO resolution as an emphatic call for the search for a durable solution to the crisis, the Foreign Committee resolution reads. The NATO ultimatum requires the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their artillery from surrounding Sarajevo and turn them over to UN control by February 21. If they do not comply they face bombing by American, French and British aircraft.
