ACTION: Notice; Extension of Proposed Rule comment period. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the public comment period of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for amendments to 25 CFR part 256, is extended for a period of thirty days. The extension, requested by Indian leadership, will provide sufficient time for contemplation and comment. DATES: This notice, effective upon publication in the Federal Register , will extend the comment period from June 6, 1994 to July 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Acting Chief, Division of Housing Assistance, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Mailstop 2525&hyph;MIB, 1849 C Street, NW, Washington, DC 20240. Telephone (202) 208&hyph;5427. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs published a Proposed Rule which amends 25 CFR part 256, Housing Improvement Program (59 FR 16726). The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposes a revision to the distribution method for Housing Improvement Program (HIP) funds from a housing inventory basis to documented eligible applicants. Based on the total number of eligible applicants submitted by all tribes, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) will distribute FY 1995 HIP funds proportionally and transfer these funds into the Tribal Priority Allocation (TPA) for each tribe. Beginning in FY 1996, individual tribes will make their own determination of funding levels for HIP within their TPA funding allocation. A technical correction is also made to eliminate Category C, Downpayments which are inconsistent with the intent of the HIP. The income levels in the January 1992 issue of 25 CFR 256 were established to ensure that the program served truly needy individuals. A revision is proposed to eliminate individuals who own a home acquired under Federal housing assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through an Indian Housing Authority from being served under HIP. They would not meet the eligibility requirements of HIP since they have already been served by a Federal program. Comments and requests received from Indian people indicate that additional time is needed for the public comment period to facilitate adequate and proper review of the Proposed Rule. All comments received during the initial and extended comment period will be given full consideration. We believe that the extended public comment period will provide an adequate opportunity for tribes and tribal organizations to provide comment and input into the final rule. Dated: May 25, 1995. Faith Roessel, Acting Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;13965 Filed 6&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;02&hyph;P
