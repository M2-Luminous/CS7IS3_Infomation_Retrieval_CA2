Nothing has leaked out of this meeting, but the topics to be discussed were the following: salaries, employees, and a final solution to the crisis. The members of the private sector who had participated in this meeting said the discussions were constructive. Bernard Craan reaffirmed that the objective of the movement by employers' associations is the lifting of the embargo. [Begin recording] I believe that what we employers are doing is a rational step. We are just expressing our exasperation, and saying aloud what everybody has been saying in a quiet voice. It is time for the protagonists of this crisis to sit, think, and find the solution the country needs so this embargo can eventually be lifted and so we can again begin working normally toward the establishment of a fair society and a state of order. I think I am just saying what everybody else is thinking. I do not see why I should be afraid. We have made contact, we keep making contact, but the results of thr contacts cannot be disclosed until they have been completed. We cannot unveil our strategy and say what we are going to do and how we are going to do it. It would be thoughtless on our part. [end recording] It should be recalled that a second meeting between the employers' sector and the labor union sector is scheduled for today.
