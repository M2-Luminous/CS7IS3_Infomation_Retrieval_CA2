A press conference of Colonel-General of Aviation Petr Deynekin, commander-in-chief of the Air Forces and head of the Russian delegation, dealt with what our aircraft builders will demonstrate at this exhibition. Also participating in the press conference were Valentina Tereshkova, the world's first woman astronaut; Yuriy Starodub, deputy chairman of the State Committee for the Defense Industry; Pavel Trishin, deputy general designer of "Rosvooruzheniye"; Vice-Admiral Leonid Golovko, arms chief for the navy; and Sergey Belousov, general director of the Russian exposition. The military-technical cooperation of Russia with the countries of the Latin American continent goes back more than 20 years, but never before have we participated in air shows here. FIDAE-94 is the debut for Russian aircraft builders and it is a good chance for them to announce their presence loudly in the markets of Latin America. Time will tell to what degree they are successful in taking advantage of this. Right now we are actively preparing for the air show. The fighter-interceptors Su-27UBK and Su-30MK and the transport aircraft Il-76 arrived in Chile under their own power, having covered more than 16,000 km through the air. The air giant An-124 "Ruslan" landed in Santiago two days earlier. It had on board light frontal fighters MIG-29 and MIG-29UB for the air show. The main delegation will fly to Latin America on 17 March on the long-range airliners of the Ilyushin firm Il-62 and Il-96-300. They expect 400 firms and companies from 34 countries of the world to take part in the FIDAE-94 aerospace exhibition. The largest aircraft building firms of Russia, the United States, France, England, Germany, Italy, Canada, and many other states have set up their displays on specially equipped pavilions and exhibition areas covering about 60,000 square meters. The directors of all leading aviation companies of Latin America have been invited to the air show. Among the honored guests of the air show are Col-Gen of Aviation Petr Deynekin, commander in chief of the Russian Air Forces; Valentina Tereshkova, first woman astronaut; Vladimir Kuzmin, general director of MAPO [Moscow Aviation Production Association]; and Mikhail Simonov, general designer of the ANPK [Aviation Scientific Production Complex] "OKB Sukhoy" [Sukhoy Experimental Design Bureau]. The organizers of FIDAE-94 have no doubt about the success of the air show. Its success is predetermined by the participation of Russia in the air show, as Axel Cabrera, Chilean consul in Russia, said. According to the forecasts of specialists, the aerospace exhibition in Chile will be visited by more than 600,000 people, including 3,000 marketing agents and merchants specializing in the aviation business. "Rosvooruzheniye," a recently established state company for the export and import of arms and military equipment, took on most of the work in the organization of the Russian section at the FIDAE-94 air show. In Chile, Russia intends to demonstrate the latest developments and also the series production of more than 50 design bureaus, research institutes, and industrial enterprises. Altogether, more than 100 different models of aviation equipment and arms systems will be presented. The participants in the exhibition will be able to familiarize themselves with an entire family of Russian delivery sytems, antiaircraft missile systems, surface ships and submarines, surface skimmers and with various air and naval arms, radar complexes, and firearms. But the hit of the air show will still be combat aircraft. The commander in chief of the Russian Air Forces does not rule out the possibility that some foreign pilots will even be given the chance to fly our fighters. MAPO, one of the oldest aviation production associations in Russia, is presenting series models of the light frontal fighters MIG-29 and MIG-29UB in Chile. Beginning with the air show in Farnboro in 1988, our MIG's have been demonstrated at practically all large international aerospace exhibitions, where they gained the reputation of being the best light fighters. They recently affirmed this reputation in Italy, where they carried out instructional air battles between the MIG-29 and the American F-15, F-16, and F-18. Our fighters gained a convincing "victory" in them. At the air show in Chile, MAPO is proposing to its potential partners not only combat aircraft themselves but also guaranteed servicing under world standards. And it is hardly likely that anyone at the current air show will be able to compete with the fighter-interceptors Su-27UBK and Su-30MK of the scientific-production aviation complex "OKB Sukhoy." The mere fact that they flew to Chile with just a few intermediate landings was a sensation in the aviation world. Chile is not only an air power but a naval power as well. Hence, it is understandable why naval themes will also be widely represented in the Russian section of the FIDAE-94 show. In particular, there are submarines, the "Murena" and "Zubr" landing craft on air cushions, which are capable of transporting different tracked and wheeled vehicles along with their crews (as much as 130 tonnes), the patrol boats "Saygak" and "Muflon," a system of tactical strike missile weapons.... The experience of the previous exhibitions and air shows has shown that firearms are particularly popular there. Visitors at FIDAE-94 will have the chance to get to know the new Kalashnikov assault rifles AK-101 and AK-102 (caliber 5.56 mm), the underwater pistol SPP-1M (caliber 4.5 mm), a noiseless assault rifle, a sniper's rifle, and other weapons. Air shows are costly. Participation in FIDAE-94 will cost us at least $600,000, even under the most modest estimates. But it is necessary to spend money for this, because there simply is no better way to make ourselves known and to present our goods in person. By the way, we have already passed the critical point in the reduction of Russian military exports. The figures for 1993 are higher than for 1992. At the present time, Russia's share in the total volume of world arms exports is 5 percent.
