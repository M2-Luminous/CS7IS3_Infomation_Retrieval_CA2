Discussion of the Proposed Amendment By letter dated October 31, 1994 (Administrative Record No. VA&hyph;839), Virginia submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Virginia proposes to amend §480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.102(e) to clarify the Virginia regulations that are applicable when coal processing waste and underground development waste is used as backfill material for mined-out areas. If approved the proposed amendment will settle interpretational differences between Virginia and OSM relative to how the coal mine waste regulations apply to waste materials placed in backfills. The text of the existing regulation is presented below with proposed changes italicized: Section 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.102␣Backfilling and Grading: General Requirements * * * * * (e) Disposal of coal processing waste and underground development waste in the mined-out area shall be in accordance with §480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.81 and 83 as provided in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this section, except that a long-term static safety factor of 1.3 shall be achieved. (1) Disposal of coal processing waste and underground development waste in the mined-out area to backfill disturbed areas shall be in accordance with 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.81. (2) Disposal of coal processing waste and underground development waste in the mined-out area as a refuse pile and not to backfill disturbed areas shall be in accordance with 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.81 and 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.83. The Division may approve a variance to 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.83(a)(2) if the applicant demonstrates that the area above the refuse pile is small and that appropriate measures will be taken to direct or convey runoff across the surface area of the pile in a controlled manner. * * * * * III.
