Accompanied by Chen Huanyou, secretary of Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and governor of Jiangsu, Premier Li inspected some grain production centers and large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in the cities of Lianyungang, Huaiyin, Yangzhou and Zhenjiang. He also visited the homes of farmers and held discussions with local cadres and residents. He said that he had personally seen the development and changes during the reform and opening-up drive in Jiangsu, and he praised the province for having conscientiously carried out the principles and policies of the central government, having achieved a rapid economic development, having remarkably improved the urban and rural people's living standards, and having made important contributions to the state. During the process of economic development, he stressed, the localities should keep in mind the local interests on one hand, and serve the needs of the whole country on the other. He said that many of the country's large and medium-sized enterprises were getting along well, for they have high-level technology and management and their products sell well in domestic and overseas markets. But, he added, there were also some enterprises with low economic efficiency and other problems caused by various factors. "We should have full confidence that the large and medium-sized enterprises can be well-operated and also pay close attention to the existing problems in the large and medium-sized enterprises," Premier Li said. He pointed out that agriculture was a big issue in the overall situation of the national economy and for social stability. "It is necessary to pay more attention to the development of agriculture, and the position of agriculture as a foundation can not be shaken, particularly at present when agricultural efficiency is still low," he stressed. He expressed the hope that while stabilizing grain production, Jiangsu would further develop a diversified economy and promote the development of rural collective economy and rural industrial enterprises. When listening to the reports of Jiangsu party and government leaders, Premier Li said that in the past two months, the rate of price increases had tended to drop. However, he added, to stabilize prices was still an important task of governments at all levels. Accompanying Premier Li during the inspection tour were leading members of departments of the State Council.
