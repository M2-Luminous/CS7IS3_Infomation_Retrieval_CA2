For two weeks the prime minister had been expected to shake up his seven-month-old cabinet, ostensibly to better tackle economic reform, but apparently intended to oust Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. The MAINICHI SHIMBUN blamed the confusion and instability in the government on Hosokawa's tendency to do the "unexpected" rather than on his tactical errors, including most notably his abandoned welfare tax and the current crisis over cabinet reform. It was only natural that Hosokawa gave up the cabinet reshuffle plan in the end, the MAINICHI said. The YOMIURI SHIMBUN wondered if the prime minister understood that his tendency is the cause of the stagnation in government. Hosokawa's impulsiveness in decision-making is also to blame for the drop in public support for the government from 72.4 percent last month to 58 percent most recently, the YOMIURI suggested. The YOMIURI reasoned that it is natural for the prime minister to want to create an "economic reform administration" to deal with the issues of recession, budget and trade frictions with the U.S. It added, however, that opposition at the heart of the administration has crippled the government just as budget deliberations are set to begin in the Diet. The MAINICHI opined that the passing of next year's fiscal budget to deal with the current economic sluggishness should have taken precedence over plans to reform the cabinet. The MAINICHI concluded that no matter how one might consider cabinet reform as an exclusive responsibility of the prime minister, Hosokawa should first sound out the intentions of the coalition members and make adjustments before carry out restructuring.
