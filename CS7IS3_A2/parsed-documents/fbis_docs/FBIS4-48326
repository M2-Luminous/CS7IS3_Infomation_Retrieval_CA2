The latest in a resurgence of violence on the East Rand, the killings prompted the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional government to propose community policing be introduced in the region. Police spokesman Capt Janine Smith reported the IFP's chairman at Simmer and Jack Mines near Katlehong, Wilson Buthelezi, 43, and Katlehong Peace Committee member Muzi Sithole, 31, were shot dead when men with AK-47 rifles opened fire on their taxi at 5.30PM on the road between Zonkesizwe and Palmridge. The attackers fled in a white Toyota Corolla. Reacting to the killings, IFP East Rand regional organiser Thabani Dlamini said in a statement: "We call on the African National Congress East Rand region to meet with us so that we can work hand-in-hand to defuse the anger of the people of our region who have suffered so much in the recent violence through these senseless killings". Mr Dlamini said neither organisation gained anything from the violence. "We are distressed by the wave of violence sweeping through the East Rand townships, particularly Tokoza and Katlehong, and we call upon everyone in these communities to do everything possible to rebuild peace." PWV Public Safety and Security Minister Jessie Duarte called for urgent attention to be given to the implementation of policing that included the involvement of self-defence units, SABC radio reported. Ms Duarte was speaking after a visit to Tokoza, where 12 people were massacred at the weekend. The IFP has attributed the flare-up in violence to new soldiers not knowing the location of trouble spots.
