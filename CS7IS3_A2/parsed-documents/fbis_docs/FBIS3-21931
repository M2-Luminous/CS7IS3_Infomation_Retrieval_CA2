The U.S. Government has accused Ramirez of conspiracy to introduce drugs into that country. "Our client is definitely innocent. He was manipulated by U.S. undercover agents, and that will be corroborated in due time by Ivan Fisher, the attorney who is handling the case in the United States," Ramos has explained. After stating Legislator Ramirez must not be stripped of his parliamentary immunity, Ramos added there is absolutely no documented evidence his client has committed an offense in our country. When questioned on the fact Ramirez is being investigated both in the United States and in our country, Ramos said Panamanian law mandates when it is presumed or feared an offense has been committed in the country, the Attorney General's Office must begin an investigation. "Regarding this case in particular, in which a personality of the significance of Anel Ramirez is involved, it is first necessary, however, for the Attorney General's Office to provide sufficient evidence to initiate a case. And in this process, as will be known later, there is really no merit. There is not enough juridical grounds to begin a case, an investigation. They have not even mentioned witnesses. Moreover, in this process Anel Ramirez is the only detainee," Ramos has said. After explaining her client, Anel Ramirez, did not deliver drugs or money, Ramos said undercover agents did everything. She stressed Legislator Ramirez' participation has not even been determined. Ramos has said there are not even alleged coconspirators, as judges in the United States have determined. They have not been arrested, nor has their situation been established.
