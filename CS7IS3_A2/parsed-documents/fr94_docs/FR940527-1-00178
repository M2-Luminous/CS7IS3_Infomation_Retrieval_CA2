FR940527-1-00178 FR940527-1-00014 In this context, we note that §413.40(d)(3) allows an excluded hospital or unit whose costs exceed the rate-of-increase limit to receive the lower of its rate-of-increase ceiling plus 50 percent of reasonable costs in excess of the ceiling, or 110 percent of its ceiling. In addition, under the various provisions set forth in §413.40, excluded hospitals and units can obtain substantial relief from the rate-of-increase limit for significant, yet justifiable, increases in operating costs that exceed the limit. At the same time, however, by generally limiting payment increases to the growth rate in the hospital market basket, we continue to provide an incentive for excluded hospitals and units to restrain the growth in their spending for patient services. In this proposed rule, we would establish new exclusion criteria for long-term care hospitals that define a minimum level of independence a new hospital must have to qualify for exclusion from the prospective payment system (see section VI.A. of the preamble). We anticipate that this change would slow the proliferation of such hospitals in the future. The likely result of this change is that some patients who might otherwise have been treated in long-term care hospitals that are excluded from the prospective payment system will instead be treated in prospective payment hospitals. Thus, their care will be paid for under the prospective payment system rather than under the TEFRA provisions of section 1886(b) of the Act. Although we cannot quantify the impact of this change on Medicare payments to hospitals, we anticipate that it would result in a small decrease in aggregate payment levels. We are proposing to remove from the regulations the ``1986 malpractice rule'' as explained in section VI.B of the preamble. This proposal is a technical change that is necessary to conform the codified Medicare regulations to the various authorities that have previously established that the malpractice rule is invalid. This proposed conforming change would not, standing alone, have significant economic effects. VI. Quantitative Impact Analysis of the Proposed Policy Changes Under Prospective Payment System for Operating Costs A. Basis and Methodology of Estimates In this proposed rule, we are announcing policy changes and payment rate updates for the prospective payment systems for operating and capital-related costs. We have prepared separate analyses of the proposed changes to each system, beginning with changes to the operating prospective payment system. The data used in developing the quantitative analyses presented below are taken from the FY 1993 MedPAR file and the most current provider-specific file that is used for payment purposes. Although the analyses of the changes to the operating prospective payment system do not incorporate any actual cost data, the most recently available hospital cost report data were used to create some of the variables by which hospitals are categorized. Our analysis has several qualifications. First, we do not make adjustments for behavioral changes that hospitals may adopt in response to these proposed policy changes. Second, due to the interdependent nature of the prospective payment system, it is very difficult to precisely quantify the impact associated with each proposed change. Third, we draw upon various sources for the data used to categorize hospitals in the tables. In some cases, particularly the number of beds, there is a fair degree of variation in the data from different sources. We have attempted to construct these variables with the best available source overall. For individual hospitals, however, some miscategorizations are possible. The simulations estimate total payments under the operating prospective payment system given various combinations of payment parameters. Any short-term, acute care hospitals not paid under the general prospective payment systems (Indian Health Service Hospitals, hospitals in the New York Finger Lakes demonstration project, and hospitals in Maryland) are excluded from the simulations. Payments under the capital prospective payment system, or payments for costs other than inpatient operating costs, are not estimated here. Estimated payment impacts of proposed FY 1995 changes to the capital prospective payment system are discussed later in this impact analysis. The proposed changes discussed separately below are the following: •The effects of eliminating the separate rural standardized amount by setting it equal to the other urban amount, as required by section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) of the Act. •The effects of the annual reclassification of diagnoses and procedures and the recalibration of the DRG relative weights required by section 1886(d)(4)(C) of the Act. •The effects of changes in hospitals' wage index values reflecting the FY 1991 wage data. •The effects of changing the transfer payment policy to a graduated per diem and revising the definition of transfers to include cases going from hospitals or units paid under the prospective payment system to hospitals or units that are excluded from the prospective payment system. •The effects of geographic reclassifications by the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board that are effective in FY 1995. •The effects of phasing out payments for extraordinarily lengthy cases (day outlier cases) by 25 percent (with a corresponding increase in payments for extraordinarily costly cases (cost outliers)) and establishing a fixed-loss threshold for cost outliers, in accordance with section 13501(c) of Public Law 103&hyph;66, as well as the effects of increasing the marginal cost factor applicable to cost outlier payments from 75 to 80 percent. •The total change in payments based on estimated FY 1995 total payments relative to estimated FY 1994 total payments. To illustrate the impacts of the FY 1995 proposed changes, our FY 1995 baseline simulation model uses: the FY 1994 GROUPER (version 11.0); wage indexes based on FY 1990 wage data; the current transfer payment policy; no effects of FY 1995 reclassifications; and current outlier policy. To illustrate the effects of eliminating the rural standardized amount, the rural amount in the FY 1995 baseline is updated by the same update applied to the urban amounts (1.1 percent), to maintain the current differential. The FY 1995 baseline also includes the higher disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments as described above and the elimination of the special protection for Medicare-dependent, small rural hospitals (MDHs). Outliers are estimated to be 5.1 percent of total DRG payments. Each policy change is then added incrementally to this baseline, finally arriving at an FY 1995 model incorporating all of the proposed changes. This analysis then compares the percent changes in payments per case due to each change. This allows us to isolate the effects of each change from the overall change in payments from FY 1994 to FY 1995. Several policy changes that would occur during FY 1995 are not modeled separately but are shown as combined changes from FY 1994 to FY 1995. These changes are: •The proposed update factor applied to the standardized amounts (other than the differential update to the rural amount that is modeled in Column 1).
