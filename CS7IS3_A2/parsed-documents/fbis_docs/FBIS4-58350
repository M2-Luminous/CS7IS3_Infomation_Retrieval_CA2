While Syria leads the steadfastness against aggression and occupation and while our people in the West Bank face the fiercest kind of persecution and murder, the Gulf Arabs' clear treachery is emerging. Qatar wants a gas project with Israel; Oman receives an Israeli delegation for a water conference; there is another conference in Bahrain tomorrow; and the Gulf Arabs' obvious treachery continues. These conferences are nothing but conspiracy itself and a stab in the back. They have nothing to do with the Arabs' traits, chivalry, and loyalty. They have nothing to do with lifting injustice from the oppressed and helping a brother. Instead they represent treachery. If Washington believes that through the Sultanate of Oman and the emirates of Qatar and Bahrain it can achieve normalization between the Arabs and Israel and, in turn, encircle steadfast Damascus, it is seeking a false peace, seeking to support and perpetuate the occupation, and seeking support from nominal Arab parties who will collapse at the first encounter. Neither the dagger of the sultan of Oman nor the bondmaids of the Qatari amir and the mercenaries of the Bahraini amir will have any effect on the conflict with Israel. All this is no more than a cartoon show that will disappear in the first round of the conflict. The conflict is over Syrian land. It is between Syria and Israel, between Lebanon and Israel, between Palestine and Israel, and between the Syrian people and the Israeli occupier. The Gulf Arabs have no right to decide on any measure concerning the Syrian- Israeli conflict; rather they should provide every support for Damascus, Beirut, and the intifadah, because those form a real shield against Israeli ambitions in the whole Arab world. Israel wants to devour and divide the Arab world; it wants to deal with certain parties unilaterally and flirt with others. All this is part of an Israeli plan to control the future of Syria and the Arab world. Every nationalist and every Arab is today urged to contemplate and read the Israeli policy and get to know its dangers. There are two ways to do this: First, to defend the rights and prevent Israel from enslaving us; or secondly, to accept Israeli enslavement. In that case all Arabs will have to subject their fate to the Jewish evil which seeks to govern us and dominate our future and wealth. If only the Arabs would realize the danger of the Israeli serpent sneaking into the best part of their house. Then they would chop its head off instead of giving it a warm welcome, as is happening in Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain. We are engaged in a fierce conflict with Israel, which is occupying Palestine and parts of Syria and Lebanon. The essence of the conflict is the land and until this land is recovered, things like this have no description but betrayal. It remains for us to ask: Where was Sultan Qabus' dagger during the Arab-Israeli conflict?
