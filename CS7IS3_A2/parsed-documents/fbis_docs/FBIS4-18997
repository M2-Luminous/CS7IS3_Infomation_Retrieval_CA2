Claes had been invited to the RTBF [French-language Belgian Radio and Television] news broadcast. "I hope that these agreements are not dead but I imagine that the wounds are such that some time will be necessary to recreate a climate allowing meetings and negotiations to be restarted." Having said that, Claes continued, "to be honest, I see no other solution. I believe that the Hutus and the Tutsis, and the different political parties must inevitably meet in a huge effort of conciliation which must aim to lead to the formation of a national government of reconciliation, in a national Parliament of reconciliation, and which must also lead to the merger of the two armies followed by a large-scale demobilization." "I see no other solution, there is not other solution," the minister insisted. Nevertheless he recognized that there were, "next to the ethnic confrontation which has a long history, internal political divisions and also groups which have far more specific interests and want the current situation to last.... Many (things) are based, I fear, on arms and drug dealing," he added. When asked about the Belgian presence within the UN force, Claes repeated, as the prime minister and he had declared on Monday in Parliament, that it was necessary to enlarge the UNAMIR's [UN Mission in Rwanda] mandate, which was too restricted. "But I have my doubts about the willingness of the Security Council to enlarge that mandate," he said. However, Claes defended the Belgian participation in the UN mission, at the request of the two parties, the government and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]. And without wanting to comment on Belgian aid cooperation in the future, Claes said: "I believe that in any event we do not have the right to abandon the African continent, from the ethical point of view it is not defendable. Second, I believe that cooperation policies must go further than purely humanitarian emergency aid. Third, I believe that these policies must continue to be based on the respect of human rights and the development of democracy, even if Western democratic forms are not necessarily those which can function in Africa...." "It is not because we have had some failures in democratization initiatives that we must allow ourselves to be discouraged and give up," the minister concluded.
