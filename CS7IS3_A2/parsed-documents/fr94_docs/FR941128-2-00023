NMFS published an Interim Final Rule (50 CFR parts 215 and 216, General Authorization for Scientific Research, 59 FR 50372, October 3, 1994, establishing a General Authorization for scientific research activities that involve only Level B harassment of marine mammals. Level B harassment is defined as ``any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which has the potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not limited to migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering but which does not have the potential to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild.'' Research activities that are likely to involve only Level B harassment are identified as photo-identification, behavioral observations, and vessel and aerial surveys. NMFS has confirmed that the General Authorization applies to the proposed scientific research as described in the application. Dated: November 21, 1994. P. A.
