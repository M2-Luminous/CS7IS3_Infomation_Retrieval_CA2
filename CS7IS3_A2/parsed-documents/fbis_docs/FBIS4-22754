Official inflation indices continue to amaze the observer with their order and downward trend. It will be recalled that in February inflation did not exceed, according to these data, 10 percent, and in March--9 percent. Sergey Dubinin, acting minister of finance, expects a further drop in the rate of inflation. Viktor Gerashchenko came out with a statement that the Central Bank will possibly lower the rate of refinancing to 100-110 percent in the second half of the year, that is, by a factor of two. On Friday a memorandum of the government and the Central Bank on economic policy was signed. It supports benchmarks of 7 percent monthly inflation by the end of the year set by the prime minister. And the IMF, in the person of the administrative director, treated the policy of the Russian prime minister kindly, promising to express his approval of the policy being conducted at a meeting of the board of directors: The government has maintained its monetarist priorities in the fight against inflation. Meanwhile, the grounds for choosing this policy, and indeed Russian inflation itself, deserve a lot of attention. What, nonetheless, is the real rate of inflation in Russia? Most likely, no less than 15 percent (taking into account the so-called "debt" prices). Inflation is calculated by the government center for economic conditions by sectors. The increase in consumer prices in the market is really less than 10 percent per month. But the increase in prices for services to the population in March totaled about 15 percent, and the increase in energy prices--13.9 percent; moreover, this indicator even seems surprisingly low for energy sources--by comparison with the previous month of this year. Thus, as before in the fight against inflation, production and the agro-industrial complex, which deal in the sluggish consumer market, are the most suppressed--they are affected by demand restrictions and the competition of imports. "The obviously increased" producer prices that, on the one hand, are being squeezed by an almost stable ruble and imports and, on the other hand, energy sources, judging by everything, are not used in calculating inflation, inasmuch as formal calculations on them are not conducted, but only "mutual indebtedness emerges." Proving to be extremes, industry and landowners do not perform the role of extras (the agro-industrial complex, together with the coal miners, draw on the budget generously); however, with industry the government prefers to resolve problems individually. What is left of plants everywhere and the increase in hidden unemployment are reflected in the White House only by meetings on problems of the giants like ZIL [Likhachev Automobile Plant]. Demand restrictions, whether being conducted by virtue of the inertia of the government machine or because of a sincere conviction of their necessity (it was Fedorov who shamed the Red directors), have led to the formation of hidden inflation; that is, an overhang of a mass of accounts between enterprises (nonpayments) not reinforced by money. A situation reminiscent of the summer of 1992 is being created when, after the Gaydar "squeeze," the sum of nonpayments amounted to 2.5 rubles [R] for each ruble enterprises had. Today this figure is 30-40 kopeks less; that is, the ratio is more than 1:2! "Unaccounted money" not only continuously makes a mess of the budget for tax revenues (in the first quarter less was collected than predicted by a factor of three), but it also generally removes the feeling of the severity of economic policy. For those who have not forgotten the inflationary "splash" (i.e., the emergence of tendencies that were not taken into account and that were not counted as inflation before mutual offsets) in the fall of 1992, the government's dreams of vouchers and other attempts to give the appearance that money can be done without in payments are quite indicative. And if Sergey Dubinin does not succeed in making this monetary overhang zero without eliminating industry as a class (after which, naturally, their debts to one another will disappear, and "debt prices" and inflation will be calculated by the movement of prices on the consumer market, where imports that are influenced only by import duties and the ruble rate of exchange dominate), given the assistance of an immediate all-Russian distribution of vouchers and the development of commercial credit, then even Viktor Gerashchenko will go down in the history of the Russian state as the grave digger of native producers, despite all his earlier services in their defense. Because if there is no method of resolving the problem of nonpayments without increasing the monetary mass, then it will not be resolved, because the method of resolution contradicts the policy of the government, and this means digging a hole for the economy. (But the government with the Central Bank has already sworn in a memorandum not to produce mutual offsets; under pressure from Yeltsin, import duties are about to be revised.) An overall illusion, engendered by official figures, not only replaces reality in the estimate of inflation itself but also becomes a picture placed for us in the window depicting an idyllic scene in the economy everywhere. We can vouch even less now that the dollar exchange rate established by the Central Bank reflects reality. After the introduction in Moscow of the new tax collection at the MMVB [Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange], the volume of trades there fell by a factor of three to four, and the main transactions are conducted now on the interbank market. Talks about economic integration in the CIS remain just that--there are no concrete results even with Belarus. "Experts" propose to conduct agrarian reform until the sowing campaign and to establish a system other than the American federal reserve system (only in the United States is there such a variant of the Central Bank). Privatization is being conducted according to the old scheme, although with greater deviations than previously--both in Moscow and in the regions. No mention has been made of an industrial and complex social policy, it also does not exist in the budget, bankruptcies are expected like common manna, and Oleg Soskovets is already being shot down by "little tin soldiers." A paradoxical situation is developing: The forces that, it is generally admitted, previously used slogans of liberalism as a cover but then did something else are now being covered by this "something else," and they are creating liberalism exactly at a time when the voters and the producers are fighting against it, but the so-called reformers (from among the radicals) have ended up in a parliamentary minority. There are paradoxes and paradoxes, but the creation of the illusion of the success of reforms can be interpreted in two ways. Either Chernomyrdin with Gerashchenko decided to pretend to be Gaydar and Fedorov--or the illustration of the success of economic transformations is needed for political use, whether it is for speeding up the signing of a memorandum on accord and/or the acceleration of integrational processes.
