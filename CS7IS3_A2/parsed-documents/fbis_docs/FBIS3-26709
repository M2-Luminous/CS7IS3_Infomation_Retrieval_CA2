Party committees and government at all levels must attach great importance to rural work and show genuine concern for the livelihood of the peasants to protect and further mobilize their initiative. From 5 to 9 February, Wen Jiabao called on peasants in impoverished villages, areas around the reservoir, and Yu nationality villages in Gutian, Bingnan, Zhouning, and Fuan Counties. He inquired of cadres about the peasants' livelihood and agricultural production conditions. Wen Jiabao said: This year will be crucial for reform of the economic structure. The fundamental tasks in the countryside are: To conscientiously implement guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Central Conference on Rural Work; stabilize the party's basic policy for rural areas; deepen rural reform; further mobilize the peasants' initiative to promote rural economic growth and increase their income; to promote social stability in rural areas; and to lay a solid foundation -- and create an excellent environment -- for the smooth implementation of the major reform measures and the sustained, healthy, rapid development of the national economy. Wen Jiabao stressed: China is a big agricultural country where peasants account for 80 percent of the population. Exercising effective leadership over work in rural areas and strengthening the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy will have a direct bearing on the overall situation of economic construction and on the overall stability of society. Leadership at all levels in charge of rural work must always have the peasants in mind, show concern for them at every turn, depend on them in everything, and seek to increase the benefits of the peasants in everything they do. We should respect the peasants' creative spirit, pay close attention to their immediate interests, help them solve their difficulties in daily life, and do a good job in guiding, protecting, and mobilizing their initiative. At present, we should do all we can to promote the rural economy, increase the peasants' income, continue efforts to reduce burdens imposed on peasants, improve public order in rural areas, and provide technical and information services to peasants. We must care about the people in old revolutionary base areas, areas inhabited by minority nationalities, poverty-stricken areas, disaster-ridden areas, and areas around the reservoir, and help them in making arrangements for production and livelihood. Wen Jiabao said: The season for spring plowing is around the corner. We must prepare well for spring production by helping the peasants formulate and implement production plans and by organizing ample supplies of means of agricultural production like chemical fertilizers, chemicals, farm machinery, and diesel oil in order to reap another good harvest; and to ensure amply supply and stable prices of vegetables, grains, and edible oils.
