ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of New Hampshire. These revisions were submitted in response to EPA's promulgation of new ambient air quality standards. The intended effect of this action is to approve revised National Ambient Air quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter based on PM 10 and other associated regulatory changes. This action is being taken in accordance with section 110 of the Clean Air Act. DATES: This Final rule will become effective October 18, 1994, unless notice is received on or before September 19, 1994, that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Linda M. Murphy, Director, Air, Pesticides and Toxics Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region I, JFK Federal Building, Boston, MA 02203. Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours, by appointment at the Air, Pesticides and Toxics Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region I, One Congress Street, 10th floor, Boston, MA; Air Docket 6102 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460; and Air Resources Division, Department of Environmental Services, 64 North Main Street, Caller Box 2033, Concord, NH 03302&hyph;2033.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 13, 1989, the State of New Hampshire submitted a formal revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP). The SIP revision consists of changes to New Hampshire's Air Quality Rules. New Hampshire also requests redesignation of two municipalities from nonattainment for total suspended particulate (TSP) to unclassifiable. Background On July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24634) EPA promulgated revised National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter which was based upon the measurement of particles having a mean aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less (PM 10 ). The revised standards replace TSP with PM 10 as the standard for ambient air quality. States were required to make revisions to their SIPs to reflect this change. EPA classified certain areas of the United States as Group I or Group II for PM 10 (52 FR 29383). Areas not so classified are Group III areas. The State of New Hampshire is a Group III area. In the case of a Group III area, EPA expects the State's current air pollution control requirements are sufficient to attain and maintain the PM 10 standards. In such cases, the State need only submit revisions to its current SIP which adopt the new PM 10 standard and make other minor adjustments. New Hampshire Submittal On July 13, 1989, New Hampshire submitted formal SIP revisions. These SIP revisions change two sections of New Hampshire's air quality rules. Env-A 303 of the New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules refers to ambient air quality standards. New Hampshire's submittal adopts the NAAQS for PM 10 as the criteria pollutant for particulate matter for primary and secondary air quality standards and deletes the now obsolete TSP NAAQS. New Hampshire also revised Env-A 1001, Open-Air Burning, to remove a reference to TSP. New Hampshire's submittal also requests that the cities of Berlin and Manchester be redesignated from nonattainment to unclassifiable for TSP. This change is consistent with and encouraged by the final rulemaking of July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24682), because it eliminates the need for TSP to be monitored in addition to PM 10 . Both areas are expected to meet applicable PM 10 standards. Review of the New Hampshire Submittal EPA reviewed the New Hampshire Submittal to determine if it meets the requirements of the Clean Air Act, EPA regulations, and applicable policies. The submittal meets the requirements found in the July 1, 1987, Federal Register (52 FR 24672), and EPA policy contained in the PM 10 SIP Development Guideline (EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;86&hyph;001), dated June 1987, with a supplement dated July 1988. The State of New Hampshire held a public hearing on the proposed changes on March 16, 1989. There were no public comments. On April 21, 1989, the amendments to rule Env-A 303, were approved by the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules at a public hearing, and received final adoption by the Air Resources Division, Department of Environmental Services. On May 24, 1989, the amendment to rule Env-A 1001 received the same approval. New Hampshire's submittal clearly defines PM 10 and sets primary and secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM 10 defined in accordance with appendix K of 40 CFR part 50. Legal authority to enforce these rules is contained in New Hampshire Law RSA 125&hyph;C:4. The State does not plan to delegate authority to any local agencies. New Hampshire's submittal calls for a network of ten (10) PM 10 monitoring sites. This network replaces the TSP network. Changes in New Hampshire's Rules New Hampshire's SIP revisions amend two rules: Env-A 303 and Env-A 1001. Env-A 303, specifically section Env-A 303.01, defines primary and secondary ambient air standards. New Hampshire's revisions define primary and secondary standards for particulate matter, consisting of PM 10 , measured at an annual arithmetic mean of 50 μg/m3, and a maximum average 24 hour concentration of 150 μg/m3, which may be exceeded on a number of days equal or less than an average of one per year as determined in accordance with Appendix K of 40 CFR Part 50. Env-A 1001 specifies when open-air burning will be permitted or prohibited. The only change proposed would replace the phrase ``Total Suspended Particles (TSP)'', with the word ``particulates''. The revised rule forbids open burning in areas designated nonattainment for particulates.
