Stepanov has said he intends to propose at the first session of the Federation Council January 11 to elect instead an executive secretary, as well as three co-speakers, each from the republics, autonomies, territories and regions who would in turns chair the House sessions. Stepanov has said that such a structural framework will help to achieve real, not just declared, equality of all subjects of the Russian Federation. Stepanov believes there is no such equality so far, because as distinct from the Russian republics, territories and regions do not have their own constitutions and their heads are still appointed by the president. Stepanov said that as an MP he would like to abolish Unitarianism in the Russian Federation and provide genuine federalism, when the component parts in the state have equal rights as is the case in the United States, Switzerland, Germany, and some other countries.
