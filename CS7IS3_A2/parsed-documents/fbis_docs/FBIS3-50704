Traces of blood and much destruction was found upon arrival at the municipal palace. The same holds true in the case of the local radio station and two hotels where the attackers were holed up. The bodies of nine aggressors were found in a sewer at the municipal market. The aggressors had tried to take away the bodies through the sewer system, which served as their escape route. The aggressors had resisted the Army for more than 48 hours from this point. It should be noted that some groups of attackers still remain in hiding in Ocosingo and occupy certain buildings, especially privately owned homes, where occupants are being held hostage.
