The Muslim attempts at breaking through were successfully repelled and, according to Colonel Dragisa Masal, commander of the Visegrad Tactical Group, in these battles a score of Muslim soldiers were killed while there were no casualties in the ranks of the Serbian Army. We have learned from intelligence sources of the Serbian Army in Rogatica that battles were again waged in Gorazde today between forces loyal to the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo and those who favor seeking a peaceful solution through agreements with the Serbs. Shots are being heard in the town during the entire day today and, according to the radio messages that have been monitored, there have been casualties on both sides. In a general panic, the civilian population of Gorazde is leaving the town and trying to go toward Sarajevo via Orahovice and Grebak. According to well-informed Serbian military sources, Abduselam Sijeric (Belam), the Muslim commander responsible for the death of more than 300 Gorazde Serbs, was seriously wounded in inter-Muslim battles in Gorazde. Forces loyal to Izetbegovic under the command of Serif Buljubasic, which are mostly comprised of Muslims who had arrived from [word indistinct], are accusing Gorazde Muslims of an unsuccessful beginning of the long-planned offensive against Serbian positions in the direction of Cajnice, Rogatica, Srbinje, and Ustipraca. Open clashes between Muslims in Gorazde took place after this morning's raids in the town and arrests of military draftees who had not responded to summons to mobilization, as well as the execution of several deserters who were supposed to serve as examples to others. The meeting held today between Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, and Major General Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of the general staff of the army of the Srpska republic, with General Michael Rose, commander of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, touched upon the current situation in Gorazde and the obligations of the army of the Srpska republic and UNPROFOR toward the peace process. As Gen. Milovanovic said after the meeting, special attention was devoted to protected zones in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the obligations that UNPROFOR should meet in Srebrenica and Zepa. Also discussed at the meeting was the realization of obligations taken in the Sarajevo region. Gen. Milovanovic pointed out that obligations are mostly met according to the agreement between representatives of the army of the Srpska republic and UNPROFOR from the meeting held on 9 February. In reply to journalists' questions regarding the situation in Gorazde, Gen. Rose said that he does not know for sure what is happening in that town and that he cannot rely on reports by television stations such as CNN. He announced that, with a view to getting a more complete insight into the situation in the region, he will personally travel to Gorazde on Wednesday [6 April]. The meeting between Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the Srpska republic, and Andreas (Kuhn), representative of the International Red Cross Committee, is under way at the building of the presidency of the Srpska republic at Pale.
