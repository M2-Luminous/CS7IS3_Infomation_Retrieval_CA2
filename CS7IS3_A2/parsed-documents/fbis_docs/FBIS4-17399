According to him, North Ossetia is shutting off all prospects for the negotiation process. In the situation that has emerged, Khamchiyev believes the entire responsibility for the failure of the latest round of negotiations between the leaders of the two republics rests upon the top leaders of North Ossetia and Russia. Given that all possible means for a peaceful settlement have been virtually exhausted, it is expedient at the next sitting of the Federation Council to consider the question of introducing amendments to the Russian president's decree on introducing a state of emergency and to introduce direct federal rule on the territory of Prigorodnyy Rayon.
