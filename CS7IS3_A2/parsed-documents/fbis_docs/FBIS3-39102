The allegation is that President Clinton warned the Prime Minister in a 30-minute telephone call on Wednesday [9 February] that if Britain blocked the strategy, the United States commitment to NATO might be seriously undermined. But senior officials denied that anything of this sort occurred during that phone call or elsewhere. The conversation was "entirely one on good terms." In fact, Britain was happy to go along with this policy. Even so, there remain fears among some Tory MPs that Britain and the West are in danger of becoming embroiled in a civil war by adopting a policy which could prolong the conflict, they fear, rather than curtail it. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has said that Britain approached this policy with great caution. But he insists he is convinced that it will produce more good than harm.
