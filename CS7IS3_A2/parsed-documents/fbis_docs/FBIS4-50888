FBIS4-50888 "drchi099_w_94015" FBIS-CHI-94-099 Daily Report 23 May 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Macao Net Outflow of Funds Results in Overall Deficit Net Outflow of Funds Results in Overall Deficit HK2305095094 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 23 May 94 p 32 HK2305095094 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [Text] Low interest rates and China's credit tightening caused a significant outflow of funds from Macao last year, according to a study by the Macao Monetary and Foreign Exchange Authority. The authority's 1993 monetary trend analysis noted that "real negative interest rates" had driven funds from Macao's banking system into Hong Kong's stockmarket. And China's austerity measures, which affect Chinese businesses in Macao, had led to a liquidity squeeze. Details of the unpublished report were leaked to the Portuguese-language weekly Comercio de Macao over the weekend. The report says that for the first time in many years, Macao recorded a balance of payments deficit last year because of a net outflow of capital. It also points out that bank lending increased by 38 percent last year over 1992, showing the dynamism of the enclave's service and construction sectors. A quarter of domestic credit last year was taken up by mortgage loans. Banks in Macao will today raise savings-deposit and 24 hour call-loan rates by half a percentage point and time-deposit rates by 0.75 percentage points. The prime lending rate is also expected to rise as Macao banks usually follow Hong Kong banks closely. Most major Hong Kong banks put up the prime rate by half a percentage point to 7.25 percent. Macao's banking sector comprises six local banks, 13 banks incorporated abroad, one off-shore bank, a post-savings bank and the Monetary and Foreign Exchange Authority. The Bank of China (Group) controls more than half of Macao's banking business. The Macao government plans to turn the enclave into a sub-regional banking centre in the Pearl River delta, mainly serving its Chinese hinterland, which includes Zhuhai. Macao's total private banking-sector assets grew year-on-year by 27 percent to 107bn patacas at the end of last year, the Macao Monetary and Foreign Exchange Authority announced in a 1993 year-end report on Saturday. Domestic credit grew 38 percent to 31.4bn patacas, while net foreign assets slipped 12 percent to 28bn patacas. M1 money supply decreased year-on-year by 1.8 percent to 21bn patacas, while M2 money supply rose 7.1 percent to 54bn patacas. The circulation of patacas, Macao's sole legal tender, has grown at an annual rate of 11.6 percent, reaching 1.08bn at the end of last year. The pataca, issued by Portugal's Banco Nacional Ultramarino at the behest of the Macao Monetary and Foreign Exchange Authority, is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar at a rate of one pataca against HK$0.97.
