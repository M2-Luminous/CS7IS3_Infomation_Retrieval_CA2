Granillo Ocampo pointed out: "Within the framework of good relations, Argentina is seeking a solution that considers the interests of both parties." The ambassador to the United States, who has come to Argentina to lecture to Cordoba and Entre Rios businessmen, conceded: "There is pressure but Argentina has signed the GATT agreement, which seeks to define standards of economic relations and to guarantee fair and free trade between nations." He explained that, by GATT standards, Argentina meets the requirements of the international community "at a minimum level." He made it clear that "if we want a special association with the United States by way of NAFTA, a special efforts will be required." Regarding the possibility that Argentina may join NAFTA, Granillo Ocampo noted: "It is a multi-party negotiation in which we must weigh what we have to give against what we will receive in order to see if it is beneficial for us." In an interview published in the daily EL CRONISTA COMERCIAL, Granillo Ocampo underlined that "if the Pharmaceutical Patents Law is enacted, we will have a better chance of joining NAFTA, but our incorporation will not be automatic: Nor will we be automatically excluded from it if we fail to pass the aforementioned law." The Argentine diplomat pointed out: "President Bill Clinton is scheduled to submit a definite proposal to Congress on 1 July. One of the requirements [for joining NAFTA] will be the patents law." He made it clear that "no country meets all the requirements." To conclude, Granillo Ocampo said: "As in any negotiation, when one reaches the end of the line, one looses interest in being a party to that agreement."
