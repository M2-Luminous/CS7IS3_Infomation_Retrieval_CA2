He was speaking here today at the signing of the document with the leadership of the European Union. In the agreement, according to the Russian leader, the conditions and stages were precisely and clearly spelled out for Russia's return to economic Europe, moreover, "as an equal partner," as Yeltsin particularly stressed. This weighty document, comprising over 80 pages and 10 sections, had been prepared by expert specialists for signing for about two years. Giving an appraisal of the agreement and the current economic and political situation on the continent, the Russian president noted that: The global political confrontation came to an end some years ago. But the consequences of the Cold War, according to him, continued to poison the international atmosphere. We have all begun to experience the growing threat of confrontation of a different kind. The system of closed trading within the framework of the former USSR and the CEMA quickly collapsed in the new conditions. The liberalization of economic life in Russia prompted our manufacturers to seek new markets in Europe. This, in Yeltsin's view, was creating an unpredictable situation in the trade in goods and services, in investment activities and so on. With the signing of the agreement, this threat is by-passing Europe, the Russian president emphasized, drawing particular attention to the fact that the European Union had rejected discriminatory approaches in economic ties with Russia. For its part, Russia, Yeltsin declared, had made a strategic choice in favor of integration into the world community and, primarily, with the EU. Today Russia is transforming itself into one of its most important partners. In the opinion of the head of the Russian state, it is precisely Europe that is being called upon to teach the world an important lesson -- a lesson of real cooperation and a lesson of true unification of efforts in the field of the economy, ecology, and in settling conflicts. In this connection Yeltsin drew the attention of the EU leaders to the fact that Russia has a vital interest in stability in the West and in the center of Europe. We are actively cooperating with European institutions in attempts to settle the Yugoslav crisis, and the EU and all the European countries, the Russian leader stated, can rely on Russia in this sense. Addressing the leaders of the EU countries, Yeltsin said that he is relying on their appropriate attitude, and that of all the CSCE partners, as regards stability in the east of the continent. Advocating a deepening of the processes of integration and a broadening of the EU, the Russian leader expressed the opinion that this would yield fruit if it does not lead to the isolation of a lesser Europe in a greater Europe, and if a similar approach is shown with regard to the processes of integration within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States. In order to build a truly unified Europe and in order that the 21st century should become the first century of peace for our continent, Yeltsin stressed, the whole path of coordination of interests must be travelled to its end. Every stop half-way, he stressed, could mean that all previous efforts have been wasted. The signing of the agreement on partnership and cooperation between Russia and the European Union has enabled Russia and the EU to enter a qualitatively new stage of mutual relations. The prospects for stage-by-stage economic integration have been defined by joint efforts. The crux of it, according to the Russian president, is an improvement in the conditions for the access of Russian goods into the EU markets, a dynamic advancement toward a free exchange of goods, capital and services, and the creation of a national regime for setting up companies and for their activities. The signing of the agreement took place in St. George's Church and, as the Russian leader pointed out, this is more than just happy coincidence. May St. George the victorious, he said, help us to vanquish the remnants of mistrust between one another and to find a solution to common problems.
