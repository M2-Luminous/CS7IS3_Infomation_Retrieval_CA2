This capability has been earned at great technical economic and political cost. As time passes, Pakistan will be subjected to even stronger pressures to compromise on the nuclear issue and roll back or even abandon its nuclear programme. National interest demands that we retain our nuclear option as long as India does as it may take India a considerable time before it agrees to subscribe to the Non-Proliferation Regime for Sough Asia as has been proposed by Pakistan. During this period Pakistan has to maintain its nuclear capability. The question is now can we sustain our nuclear option. Realistically speaking, pressures on Pakistan will mount and not decrease with time. The US commitment to non-proliferation is toughening and not receding. World public opinion is turning against nuclear weapons even in the hands of nuclear powers and certainly more and more against the so-called near-nuclear weapons states such as India, Pakistan and Israel. There is hardly any difference of views among the nuclear-haves that further proliferation has to be contained. So we will have very few or no allies to back us up. We may even be on our own. The assumption that once a country acquires nuclear capability it cannot be eroded or taken away is rather naive and an illusion. While it takes considerable technical skill and political determination to achieve this, in the first place it needs even greater effort to retain it later on. France was a nuclear rebel until the 1980s but the changed international situation and pressures from its partners in Europe and across the Atlantic compelled it to conform to the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] South Africa was able to build a small nuclear arsenal by defying international embargoes over a long time, but found it politically impossible to hold on to it and had to surrender 8 or 10 nuclear bombs it had built. Ukraine, with its 1,600 nuclear warheads, ranks as the third nuclear power in the world and has sophisticated long-range missiles to deliver them to any part of the world. Yet it cannot even service this arsenal. Its economic and security compulsions have forced it to give up this formidable capability. Even the UK finds it harder and harder to hold on to its modest stockpile of nuclear weapons in spite of its imperial longings. It appears that its is relatively less difficult to climb the nuclear ladder but much harder to hang on after getting there. We should not underestimate the challenges we will face in sustaining our nuclear option and must prepare ourselves to do all that it takes to keep it. While it will become increasingly hard for us to retain our nuclear option it is relatively easy to lose it. The quickest way to do this would be to increase our nuclear rhetoric to win greater public applause at home. This nuclear jingoism which our politicians and technologists have engaged in to win cheap popularity has been extremely costly to the nation. It has sent completely wrong signals abroad and played into the hands of our opponents. It also provides a ready excuse to India to continue with its massive nuclear programme. It is, therefore very important that both the government and the opposition and all responsible leaders of various parties exercise restraint when talking about the nuclear issue. This is needed particularly at a time when the US Congress has started debating a revision of the Foreign Assistance Act which could hopefully dilute the Pressler Amendment and provide an opening for the US President to resume US Pakistan cooperation in the economic and defence fields. Even if the Pressler Amendment is somehow miraculously withdrawn or circumvented it will only be a temporary relief. The nuclear issue between the US and Pakistan will not be resolved as the US will continue to pursue its objectives through other means. India will persist in strengthening its nuclear muscle and reach posing a growing threat to our securing. The stakes will get higher and higher. The strategy we should develop must be one which enables us to keep the nuclear option open for a long time. This means we should take immediate steps to reduce our vulnerability to outside pressures and build up the strength and stamina to resist coercion. Politically we need a renewed commitment to our nuclear programme and to maintain the nuclear consensus. The Government and Opposition have to speak with one voice so that there is no rollback and no unilateral compromise. This demands a measure of political maturity on all sides. We have to take the nuclear issue out of the political areas so that it is above petty politics. Economically, Pakistan is extremely vulnerable. Our dependence on foreign economic and financial aid has to be reduced. We have to put our economic house in order. This requires making tough and unpopular economic decisions which is not an easy matter for any political government. But we can not expect the aid donors to underpin our economy so that we enjoy the luxury of wasting funds at home and continue to postpone economic reforms. Without a strong economy no country can ever maintain a nuclear option. In the defence field, we are highly dependent on foreign military supplies equipment and hardware. India meets 80 per cent of its defence needs through indigenous production while we are critically dependent on imports. We have to build our own defence industry. It will require a bold new approach to mobilise our internal technical and human resources, involve the private enterprise and establish the essential infrastructure for our defence industry which we have neglected so far. All weapon systems, including nuclear devices, lose their effectiveness over time. New technological advances render them obsolete. Defence preparedness is not static. It has to be renewed and upgraded year after year. This needs both local R&D and access to new and emerging technologies. Unfortunately, our technological base is very small and is, in fact, not growing. We do not have the skilled manpower systems and replace the imported ones whose cost is increasing and the political price becoming prohibitive. Getting dual-purposed and sensitive technology from abroad is getting more complicated. Over the last 15 years. We have lost access to R&D [Research and Development] laboratories and hightech establishments abroad where Pakistanis are not admitted. Some people at home have made wild claims about our attainments and raised doubts about our intentions which have served to close doors on our students studying abroad. We may well have lost two precious decades in updating our knowledge and getting into the main stream of the latest technology because we could not resist the talking too much and raising slogans of technological defiance when we have yet yet to develop a sound technological and scientific infrastructure. Time has come for us us to get sober and get down to work. In the early years of our nuclear programme speed (or apparent speed) was of paramount importance. Like others we indulged in ad hocism and ignored the rules of the nuclear game; and we are paying for it. The others learnt from their mistakes and quickly set up institutions to tighten control over all aspects of nuclear activities and developed well considered policies. We are persisting in our old random ways which expose us to greater political, financial and technical risks. Instead, we should benefit from the experience of others and quickly develop and institute our own Control and Command System so that the nuclear capability we are supposed to have remains at the command of the State and not at the whims of the individuals who as politicians, technologists and policy makers, may use them for their own ends. We have to send a convincing message to the world at large that we, too, are capable of accepting and exercising nuclear discipline and possess the maturity to control what we have with as much responsibility and restraint as others. A country should have well-defined nuclear objectives which should be pursued through a flexible nuclear policy which takes into account the fast moving dynamics of the evolving world scene. Even the superpowers have responded to changing circumstances by adapting themselves rather than remaining rigid. We should know what we want in the long run and achieve it through our ability to negotiate with others without surrendering our principles. Nuclear weapons are losing their legitancy as weapons for warfare but they are useful as deterrents and as instruments of negotiation to attain security goals. Pakistan has to find a way to convince Washington that the country specific amendment against Pakistan is indeed counter-productive, and that US and Pakistan interests require that Pakistan is not forced to give up the nuclear unilaterally but only in a regional framework of security and non-proliferation. In brief, our continued retention of the nuclear option over a long period will need much greater skill and acemen than we are used to. We have to muture a nuclear consensus at home so that the political will remains undiminished and people make the sacrifices which are called for. We have to strengthen our economy, modernuise and broaden our scientific and technological base, strengthen our conventional defence and industrial capability, refine our control and command system, calrify our nuclear goals and policies, restrict our rhetoric and improve our nuclear diplomacy. We have to build up our internal strength and stamina to retain what we have and build on it further to meet the inevitable challenges ahead.
