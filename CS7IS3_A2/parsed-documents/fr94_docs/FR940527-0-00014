FR940527-0-00014 FR940527-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;09&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8920; AD 94&hyph;11&hyph;04] Airworthiness Directives: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries MU&hyph;2B Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to certain Mitsubishi Heavy Industries MU&hyph;2B series airplanes. This action requires adjusting the engine underspeed governor minimum stop (ground idle) and the airframe condition control linkage, modifying the tachometer indicator markings, fabricating and installing a placard that specifies a minimum idle speed, and incorporating Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) revisions. An accident of one of the affected airplanes where the propeller hub assembly failed and the propeller separated from the airplane prompted this action. Accident investigation analysis indicates a reduction in fatigue strength of the propeller hub because of high vibration frequencies during ground idle speed. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent propeller hub arm assembly failure because of high vibration frequencies during ground idle speed and possible separation of the propeller from the airplane, which could result in loss of control of the airplane. DATES: Effective June 10, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 10, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before July 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket 94&hyph;CE&hyph;09&hyph;AD, room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Information that relates to this AD may be obtained from the Beech Aircraft Corporation, P.O. Box 85, Wichita, Kansas 67201&hyph;0085; or Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., 5&hyph;1 Marunouchi 2 Chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo Japan. This information may also be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket 94&hyph;CE&hyph;09&hyph;AD, room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.

Riddle, Aerospace Engineer, FAA, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, 1801 Airport Road, room 100, Wichita, Kansas 67209; telephone (316) 946&hyph;4144; facsimile (316) 946&hyph;4407. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A recent accident of a Mitsubishi Model MU&hyph;2B&hyph;60 airplane where the propeller hub assembly failed and the propeller separated from the airplane prompted the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to investigate the vibration frequency of these airplanes during ground idle operation. Accident investigation analysis indicates a reduction in fatigue strength of the propeller hub because of high vibration frequencies during ground idle speed. These high vibration frequencies, if not corrected, eventually will result in the above-referenced propeller hub assembly failure and separation of the propeller from the airplane. After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above, the FAA has determined that (1) certain precautions (in addition to those taken by previous AD actions and during initial certification of the airplane) should be taken to minimize these high vibration frequencies during ground idle speed; and (2) AD action should be taken to prevent the above-referenced conditions. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Mitsubishi MU&hyph;2B series airplanes of the same type design, this AD requires adjusting the engine underspeed governor minimum stop (ground idle) and the airframe condition control linkage, modifying the tachometer indicator markings, fabricating and installing a placard that specifies a minimum idle speed, and incorporating Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) revisions. The ground idle modification is required to be accomplished in accordance with the Allied Signal Garrett Maintenance Manual (Report No. 72&hyph;00&hyph;95 for TPE331&hyph;10&hyph;501M or Report No. 72&hyph;00&hyph;27 for TPE331&hyph;501M or &hyph;511M), chapter 72&hyph;00&hyph;00, General-Adjustment/Test; and chapter 76&hyph;10- 01, Control Linkage Assembly, Maintenance Practices. The airframe control linkage modification is required to be accomplished in accordance with chapter 6, §9.2, of the applicable Mitsubishi MU&hyph;2 maintenance manual.
