Rather, it is the outcome of faith and strong Jordanian convictions that a unilateral deal cannot produce a durable peace. Worse still, a unilateral peace deal poses more danger than a state of no peace at all. The prime minister added: Hence the firm Jordanian position and determination that the solution must be comprehensive, just, and durable. Besides, the solution must enjoy the support of all concerned Arab sides. During a meeting with representatives of publications issued by political parties, Dr. al-Majali went on to say: The only viable and sustainable option is the peaceful solution that we are striving to achieve. Any other solution would remain vulnerable and pose greater threats. He indicated that Jordan has long been opposed to unilateral deals. That is why it has come under various kinds of pressure to make it abandon its principled stand toward the issue. In this regard, the prime minister reaffirmed that Jordan's steadfastness in the face of pressures and its firm positions in this regard have earned it the respect of all, although its position might not necessarily be in the interest of all parties. Answering a question on the successive Israeli Government attempts to export its crises; that is, on whether there is a link between the Israeli attempts to brand Jordan as a terrorist state and the blockade enforced against the Port of al-'Aqabah, the prime minister said: First, we would like to say that Israel's attempts to export its crises are unacceptable. However, as is well known, many world parties pursue this approach. But the important question in this regard is the following: Should we succumb to the Israelis' wishes regarding resolving their crises at our expense? The prime minister answered this question, saying: We are completely opposed to this. This may be connected to the blockade enforced against al-'Aqabah, particularly if one is to relate interconnected developments. In general, Israel has nothing to do with the blockade enforced against al-'Aqabah. However, a connection might be found between the two if one is to employ a long-term perspective. In the course of his answers to the questions posed by reporters, the prime minister noted that the al-'Aqabah siege is part of the Gulf war. The Gulf war elicited the blockade. This is how we see things at present. We have withstood the blockade enforced against al-'Aqabah for the past three years. If we are to make an estimate of the losses we have sustained as a result of this, we would say that this blockade has cost us almost $1.2 billion, a large amount in Jordanian market calculations. It is not a trivial matter that can be underrated. The prime minister added: For our part, we have continued our efforts to explain this state of affairs through our contacts with various world states, such as Britain, France, and other states. Our purpose in this regard has been to explain the dangers that could be created by this state of affairs. In this regard, we have also held intensive contacts with the U.S. Administration and the UN Security Council's Sanctions Committee. We explained to them the magnitude of our sufferings under the blockade. We hope to reach a solution to this problem soon. In reply to a question on the progress made in these contacts, Dr. al-Majali said: It is widely known that ship inspections are currently conducted in high seas. The inspection process has something to do with numerous procedures regarding the storage of commodities inside ships. Because of the complications entailed in this, we have lost 24 shipping lines. Thanks to the contacts I have just noted, we have received an offer from Lloyds Register, a nonpolitical and non-profit international corporation, according to which its officials will be stationed in al-'Aqabah. When customs officials open cargo containers, Lloyds Register officials could examine the cargo to ensure that there are no violations of the sanctions. In other words, this would not be a full-blown inspection. Besides, such measures would not undermine national sovereignty. Of course, they [not further identified] sought to bring navy officers and personnel to the port to conduct the inspections there. This is unacceptable. We have read reports that the government abandoned sovereignty over al-'Aqabah. Indeed, this is a regrettable development, because we cannot accept anything of the sort. Responding to a question on inter-Arab coordination, and whether there is a unified Arab position regarding the next phases of the peace process to be conveyed to the U.S. secretary of state during his upcoming tour of the region, the prime minister said: It is truly regrettable that the events and crises which should have made the Arabs more tolerant and more cohesive have failed to do so. We feel that the Arab negotiator would have been in much a better position had the Arab stands been concerted and united. Dr. al-Majali said: Jordan's position is constant. During the past and current crisis, Jordan's stand has remained the same. This stand will not be changed by any future crises. We absolutely believe in the importance of a comprehensive solution and of coordination. We work toward that end. But if coordination is not realized, this will not be our fault. We always offer coordination with our brothers--Palestinians, Syrians, Lebanese, and other Arab brothers. Our objective is to end the estrangement so that the Arabs have a stronger negotiating position and so that we can attain our rights. We constantly offer coordination, but we do not have the strength or might which would enable us to lead others in this direction. In response to a question on his assessment of Jordanian-Palestinian relations, Dr. al-Majali said: Certainly, those relations are special, both morally and practically. But it is known that the other side has various factions with various political orientations. Naturally, our relations should be with a specific side. It is unreasonable that relations be established with various and different sides. Therefore, we have decided that our relations will be with the PLO, which is recognized by the Palestinian and Arab people and most world states. We exclusively deal with the PLO [among other Palestinian factions], exactly as we deal with any other sisterly Arab state. The prime minister said: We support the PLO in whatever would make it capable of fully restoring its rights. Therefore, we hope that the political organization will enter the Palestinian territory and that a Palestinian entity will be established over the Palestinian territory. We hope that the Palestinian people will attain their right to self-determination, so that they will be able to decide on whatever type of relationship that they would like to have with us. Even in the name of patriotism, it is unacceptable that any formula for any future relationship be imposed on the Palestinian people while they are still under occupation. Just like us, they must be given the chance so that we together can decide on the formula of this relationship. This is especially true since past Arab unity experiences have ended in failure because they were imposed from above and were isolated from the grassroots. The prime minister continued: Here in Jordan, we are sincerely open toward any kind of relationship with the Palestinian brothers and other Arab brothers in general. We are open to any kind of relationship. We also always seek to have strong relations with our brothers. Therefore, we believe that under the current circumstances, it is in the interest of the brother Palestinians and the Arab-Israeli negotiations in general that the Arabs raise the level of coordination among them. Otherwise, the future will be more serious than the past. In this vein, Dr. al-Majali said: Apathy, disagreement, and disunity mean that the Arab nation will eventually find itself in a situation imposed upon it by others. On the other hand, accord, concerted stands, and closed ranks are the real guarantor of the Arab nation's interests. They provide the means with which the dangers of the designs that are being concocted against the Arab nation and its coming generations can be thwarted. Regarding the issue of Jerusalem within the framework of the peace process, Dr. al-Majali said: The brothers in the PLO agreed to discuss the issue of Jerusalem in the second phase. I believe that Jerusalem is the major problem and, given the current state of Arab fragmentation, the results would not satisfy people. Hence, I sincerely call for abandoning these differences at the present stage because there can be no peace without Jerusalem. Arab reconciliation and unity of ranks are needed now. Answering a question on the PLO's representation of the Palestinian people, the prime minister said: The PLO is 30 years old now. All Palestinians -- opposition and others -- now agree that the PLO represents the Palestinian persona; it is like any other government. The Palestinian issue is a major one and the Palestinian people exist inside and outside the occupied territory. Since it is difficult to hold elections so as to elect a Palestinian leadership, it would be in the general interest of the Palestinians to postpone differences. Following the establishment of a Palestinian entity the Palestinian brothers will be able to elect whoever they want. Answering a question on the recent events aimed at undermining Jordan's stability and the sides that stand behind them, the prime minister said: External sides gave instructions or tried to convince certain people that the situation in Jordan is not right and that religious duty calls for changing this situation. Dr. al-Majali said: Some of those who tried to carry out acts that are detrimental to the country's security were trained abroad to use arms. Some others are naive people, because the person who blows himself up while trying to plant a bomb somewhere is a naive person. He said: Those people exploited the fact that many sides want to see instability in Jordan for many purposes. Asked why the views of the opposition are not highlighted in the official media, the prime minister said: The Jordanian Government takes into consideration both views. The government has its official media and you have your media, and I do not believe we intervene in your affairs. To reiterate the government's faith and endeavors to highlight conflicting views, the prime minister said that the government is determined to work continuously to listen to other opinions and even to open the official radio to it.
