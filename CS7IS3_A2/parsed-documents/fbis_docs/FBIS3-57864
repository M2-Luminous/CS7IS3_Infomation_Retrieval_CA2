The FDP will focus on performance and plans to further elites to a larger extent. According to party chairman Klaus Kinkel, the political debate will be focused on the preservation of the state ruled by law and on combating unemployment. To create jobs, a "modernization thrust" of the economic sector is required, as described in Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt's (FDP) paper on Germany's economic base. In the discussion of the coalition on internal security, "a few things" cannot be had with the FDP. Kinkel mentioned as examples the great bugging campaign and CDU/CSU floor leader Wolfgang Schaeuble's proposal to use the Bundeswehr in conflicts at home. The FDP will, however, complete all projects adopted by the coalition "in a fair way and as agreed upon." They include the amendment of the asylum law and the nursing insurance. The FDP will not accept a change of course in European policy. Those who believe the Germans could "leave the European policy course are wrong," said Kinkel. The foreign minister announced "massive controversies" with the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. He said he would put the blame for increasing foreign policy difficulties on the SPD, which rejects an amendment to the Basic Law for Bundeswehr combat missions outside the NATO area. In environmental policy, the FDP will distinguish itself from the Greens, whose environmental policy ideas "fail to take market economy considerations into account." Generally, Kinkel believes that 1994 will be a difficult year for his party. "Much will be at stake" for the FDP. He called upon the liberals once again to demonstrate calmness and cohesion. Kinkel rejected North Rhine-Westphalian FDP Chairman Juergen Moellemann's proposal to reduce the federal cabinet this year. He said such a change should not be considered shortly before Bundestag elections. The government must now "do a good job."
