The message points out that Bulgaria's position on the crisis in former Yugoslavia is a consistent and principled one. Bulgaria opposes the direct participation of Balkan countries and countries bordering on former Yugoslavia in eventual military measures aimed at establishing peace in the region. The Bulgarian president thinks that even partially lifting the arms embargo for the fighting sides would tend to exacerbate the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The message assesses the ultimatum of the NATO Council as the last and radical warning for forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina that do not accept the UN Security Council resolution and hinder peace negotiations. In conclusion, President Zhelev expresses confidence that after signing the Partnership for Peace, relations between Bulgaria and NATO will enter a new and more sound stage that will also positively affect relations with Turkey.
