Having signed a friendly and cooperative agreement, China is in a position to greatly influence North Korea. It has been learned that while he was in Beijing, Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa met with Chinese state leaders, including PRC President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng, and asked them to persuade North Korea to fully accept international nuclear inspections. Prior to the Japanese prime minister's Beijing visit, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited Beijing last week and agreed with the Chinese side to jointly cooperate on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. Now, the countries concerned have formed an international cooperation system to check North Korean nuclear development. As noted by Qiao Zonghuai, PRC Ambassador to the ROK, it is the Chinese official position to oppose the international community's strong steps against North Korea, including UN Security Council sanctions. We would like to stress a point, however, that the North Korean nuclear issue will have a serious impact not only on the Korean peninsula, but also on all East Asian countries, including countries surrounding the Korean peninsula. Japan -- which shows the most sensitive reaction to the North Korean nuclear issue -- has said on many occasions that it cannot but develop nuclear weapons if North Korea's nuclear development is not checked. Also, it is showing signs of strengthening its military capacity, such as by forming a regional security network, to deal with North Korea's development of long-range missiles. If the North Korean nuclear issue remains a factor of unrest in this area, regional economic cooperation -- including Japanese-PRC economic cooperation, which is to be announced following Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit in China, and ROK-PRC economic cooperation -- will be seriously affected and this will adversely affect China's reform and opening policy that it is now actively carrying out. We would like to stress the role and responsibility of China, which is one of the leading countries throughout the world, rather than the regional economic cooperation in East Asia, including the support for China's openness. As a permanent member state of the UN Security Council, which is aimed at global peace, China should assume international responsibility for the North Korean nuclear issue. If the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security Council and, as a result, the international community imposes sanctions on North Korea, China -- which opposes international sanctions against North Korea -- will be placed in a difficult situation. Therefore, it is better for China to persuade North Korea to meet the demands of the international community. This will also meet the demands of China for the settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue through peaceful methods and dialogue. China will not use "the North Korean nuclear issue card" multi-laterally to improve relations with foreign countries, we urge it to persuade North Korea to accept nuclear inspections. This is because we are concerned that the North Korean nuclear issue may cause constant unrest in peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, as well as East Asia, including China. To avoid such unrest, it is imperative for China to participate in the international cooperation system carried out by the ROK, the United States, and Japan and to carry out its responsibility and role as a great power in the international arena.
