Igarashi told a press conference after the day's cabinet meeting that the ministry will call executives of housing makers, contractors, and trading houses in early April to hear their opinions on the restrictions. The results of the hearings will be referred to when the ministry works out deregulatory steps in these areas. Easing of the curbs on housing imports is viewed as a necessary step to bring down Japan's relatively expensive house building costs. The ministry has drafted an action plan to reduce the Japanese costs by one-third by 2000.
