The statement said that the shaykhs and notables of the Ba Kazm tribe, who played an honorable role in resisting colonial rule and evil powers over the past 25-year rule of the secessionist gang, declare their adherence to unity and constitutional legitimacy. This reflects, the statement added, the principled positions they have announced in early 1991, when they met with brother President Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. During that meeting, the statement noted, they pledged to support and defend unity. The statement added that the treasonous, agent, and secessionist gang within the Yemeni Socialist Party and its allied hirelings, feeling that they are now in their death throes, are fabricating alleged and baseless cables of congratulations to deceive the public opinion through cheap tactics. They have used the name of the Ba Kazm tribe, given its profound influence and role, in an attempt to influence the positions of other tribes, forgetting that unity and Yemen are dearer and more chaste than all filthy money. The Ba Kazm notables concluded their statement by extending their greetings, appreciation, and absolute allegiance to the symbol struggler Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and expressing support for constitutional legitimacy, the leadership, and the governorate represented by Abyan Governor struggler 'Ali Shaykh 'Umar, and the forces vindicating legitimacy and unity. God is great. Victory and pride to unity, constitutional legitimacy, and Yemen.
