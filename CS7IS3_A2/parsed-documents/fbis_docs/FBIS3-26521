On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, he expressed Lunar New Year greetings to scientific and technological personnel throughout the province, saying: Reviewing the past and looking to the future, we feel deeply the importance of scientific and technological work. Scientific and technological personnel in Qinghai have made great contributions to economic construction and social development. Our economy needs to be developed, and our science and technology need to be invigorated. As Qinghai is economically and culturally backward, the role of science and technology is particularly important. To narrow the gap between technologically advanced regions and ourselves, we must, in many aspects, rely on advanced science and technology, develop and expand the ranks of scientific and technological personnel, and improve the quality of the entire laborers. In the new situation of establishing the socialist market economic structure, science and technology also face a test. [passage omitted]
