Information released by the bureau today showed that China's birth rate was 18.09 per thousand and death rate 6.64 per thousand, which meant a natural population growth rate of 11.45 per thousand. Statistics indicated a remarkable increase in household income. In urban areas, the figure per capita was 2,337 yuan last year, a real hike of 10 percent over the previous year, while in rural areas it was 921 yuan, a three percent real increase. But the Bureau pointed out that differences in income level between provinces and between urban and rural households were expanding and that living standards of a host of households declined. The Bureau said in a statistical communique that the reform in the field of labor and employment had been accelerated, leading to the improvement of the employment service system. By the end of last year, employment agencies in China totalled 13,000 and 7.05 million people found jobs in cities and towns. The urban unemployment rate was 2.6 percent last year, it said. China's workers and staff numbered 150.4 million by the end of 1993, 2.48 million more than a year before, while workers in private enterprises and individual workers numbered 11.16 million, an increase of 2.78 million.

Some 41 million people in need received relief from the government. At the same time, the social security network extended to nearly 32 percent of rural townships, 97,000 community service facilities in urban areas were established and workers' pension insurance was expanding. China paid special attention to environmental protection. By the end of 1993, the number of environmental protection workers was 81,000. Seventy-seven nature protection areas were set up, 10 of which became members of the man and the biosphere international protection network. China has set 313 standards in order to keep the environment clean and safe. In 1993 alone, 2.54 billion yuan was invested in 5,737 projects to fight against environmental pollution, the Bureau said.
