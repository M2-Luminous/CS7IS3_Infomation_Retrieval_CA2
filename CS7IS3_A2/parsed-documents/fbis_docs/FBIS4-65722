Of the l,317 valid votes cast, 604 went to the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] candidate Roman Herzog. The SPD [Social Democratic Party] candidate and North Rhine-Westphalian Minister-President Johannes Rau received 505 votes. The FDP [Free Democratic Party] candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher received l32 votes. The east German civil rights campaigner Jens Reich received 62 votes, and the candidate of the right-wing Republicans, Hans Hirzel, received 12 votes. There were two abstentions, and two votes were invalid. Thus a second ballot is required where once again an absolute majority for the election of the new federal president is needed. A simple majority is sufficient in a third ballot.
