Estonia has been expecting this visit to lead to a positive outcome: A clear pledge from Russia to withdraw her troops from here by the end of August. [passage omitted] Now that the Russian foreign minister has met President Lennart Meri, the Russian side, too, has been emphasizing that it is necessary to change the level of the talks delegations. The Russian side's current positions were clarified to Estonian radio by Galina Sidorova, adviser to Andrey Kozyrev. [Sidorova, in Russian with superimposed Estonian translation] The meeting, which lasted as long as two hours, demonstrated in the Russian side's opinion that ice has begun to shift. We see this meeting as a kind of favorable political impetus. One cannot call it a move forward, though. We have formed the opinion that Estonia is prepared to display an understanding of our attitude to the issue of the Russian military pensioners who live in Estonia. The Russian position continues to be the same: The military pensioners' issue must be resolved together with the agreement on troop withdrawal. Russia continues to think that guarantees for social protection must be extended to all military pensioners; all military pensioners must be able to live on an equal footing if they so wish. Much depends now on the next move, which is the meeting of deputy foreign ministers as representatives of the two countries' leaders. Concrete documents would then be under discussion, and it would become clear to what extent Estonia is prepared to make concessions. If an agreement is reached, it is possible that the Russian troops will be withdrawn by 31 August. I repeat, that is only in case an agreement is reached. [passage omitted]
