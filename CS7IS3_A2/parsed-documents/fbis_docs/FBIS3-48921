It covered 30,000 households chosen at random using techniques of the International Labour Organization, thus making the survey comparable with similar studies in other European countries. The survey cost two million leva, one million of them being provided by the state. If three million are raised next year, statisticians will be able to conduct several surveys of this kind to reveal the dynamics of unemployment in the country, Mr. Milcho Mladenov, an NSI department director, said. 814,000 people out of a 3.8 million population in active age are unemployed, the NSI statistics show. This figure is higher than those reported so far because it includes all people over 15 years of age who are looking for jobs. Practically, the group includes 51,000 pensioners and 13,000 learners who would like to work. Most unemployed have low educational qualifications: 385,000 have primary or lower education, 137,000 have finished secondary vocational schools, and 44,000 are university graduates. Women are more badly hit by unemployment than men. Almost 400,000, or 38 percent, of the unemployed are between 25 and 44 years of age. Unemployment in the rural areas runs at 19.5 percent, which is 6 percent higher than the urban centres. 55 percent of the unemployed have become redundant as a result of staff cuts, 11 percent failed to find themselves jobs after finishing their education and 7.8 percent -- after their dismissal as conscripts from the Army. 63 percent of the unemployed have had no jobs for more than a year and a half, 14 percent have been looking for job opportunities for half a year or a year, only 6 percent have been jobless for less than a month.
