At that time the president ordered and asked for the support of all the security forces, the Army, as well as the police, to help bring calm to the Guatemalan people. The fact the child is back at home with her parents is the result of the work of all the Guatemalan security forces at all levels, at midlevel and top-level. I am talking about the operation and the strategy that was developed. It is important for you to know this is the result of the first phase of the joint operations we are conducting. The Army's patrolling the outskirts of the city has forced the bands of criminals to move their hiding places. This move helped the police, supported by military intelligence and all the Guatemalan security forces, find the group that was holding Georgina, return her safe and sound, without the payment of a ransom, and bring this incident to a happy conclusion. I would like to add the honest people's cooperation played a vital role in this case. We got information from neighbors and people who observed strange or dangerous comings and goings. This contributed to the return of happiness to a family. The family is together again today, thank God. In conclusion, I would like to inform the local press, and, through you, the Guatemalan people, this is the result we expected. Many times the amount of disclosed information is limited, because we do not want the criminals to know what we are doing. We can talk about it today, because the outcome was a happy one. We ask for your understanding and cooperation. Mr. and Mrs. Rosse and their two daughters are now together; they are safe. The president of the Republic, who has been in constant contact with us, is very pleased with the outcome. I am also very pleased with the outcome, as are all of those who were closely following this case. I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the support we received from military intelligence and the police. They were the ones who rescued Georgina. [Reporter] How many people were arrested, and what are their names?

[Reporter] [Words indistinct] state security force? [Parinello] Negative. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Parinello] According to the Penal Code there is no death penalty for this crime, but if it were up to me, I would request the death penalty for kidnappers. [Reporter] Are you going to request the death penalty? [Parinello] I have to do what I was appointed to do. This will be a matter the court will handle. The court will decide what will happen to those criminals. The criminals are now in the hands of court authorities. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] the girl was rescued? [Parinello] Pardon me?
