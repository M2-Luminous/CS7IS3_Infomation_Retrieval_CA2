Norway Point Development which includes: (1) Two existing earth dikes, 1,460 feet long and 500 feet long yielding a total length of 1,960 feet; (2) an existing abandoned fishway; (3) an existing beartrap gate section, 120 feet long, containing three beartrap gates, each 26 feet long by 27 feet high; (4) an existing mass concrete multiple barrel arch spillway section with removable needle beams, 320 feet long; (5) an existing reservoir with a surface area of 1,700 acres and a total storage volume of 27,550 acre-feet at the normal maximum surface elevation of 671.6 feet NGVD; (6) an existing reinforced concrete and masonry powerhouse, 86 feet long by 49 feet wide, containing (a) two vertical shaft Francis turbines with a combined hydraulic capacity of 1650 cfs, the first manufactured by Wellman-Seaver-Morgan Company and rated at 3,350 hp and the second rated at 1,400 hp, and (b) two General Electric generators, rated at 2,800 kW and 1,200 kW, providing at a total plant rating of 4,000 kW; and (7) existing appurtenant facilities. Hubbard Lake Development which includes: (1) An existing reinforced concrete spillway section, 20 feet long, containing two needle beam controlled bays; (2) two existing 45 foot long earth embankment sections, each overlapped on the upstream and downstream sides with concrete wing walls extending from both sides of the spillway; (3) an existing reservoir with a surface area of 9,280 acres and a total storage volume of 57,000 acre-feet at the normal maximum surface elevation of 710.5 feet NGVD; and (4) existing appurtenant facilities. Upper South Development which includes: (1) Two existing earth embankment sections, 220 feet long and 40 feet long for a total length of 260 feet, (2) an existing reinforced concrete spillway section, 40 feet long, containing (a) four needle beam controlled bays, and (b) concrete wing walls on the upstream and downstream sides overlapping the earth embankments on both sides of the spillway; (3) an existing reservoir with a surface area of 7,000 acres and a total storage volume of 55,000 acre-feet at the normal maximum surface elevation of 731.0 feet NGVD; (4) two proposed submersible Flygt Corporation turbines with a combined hydraulic capacity of 170 cfs, each equipped with a siphon penstock and an elbow draft tube; and (5) existing appurtenant facilities. B. Hillman Hydro Project Ferc No. 2419: This project consists of: (1) An existing earth fill section, approximately 50 feet long; (2) an existing concrete gated spillway section, approximately 38 feet long, containing (a) three needle beam controlled bays, (b) a concrete training wall extending upstream of the spillway along the right side, and (b) a reinforced concrete apron, constructed along the downstream toe of the spillway; (3) an existing non-overflow section which includes part of the Hillman grist mill house, 26 feet long, constructed of upstream and downstream concrete gravity walls with pressure grouted earth and rock fill between the two walls; (4) an existing concrete uncontrolled spillway section, 27 feet long, (formerly the intake structure of the grist mill in the early 1900's); (5) an existing non-overflow section, 20 feet long, constructed of upstream and downstream concrete gravity walls with pressure grouted earth and rock fill between the two walls; (6) an existing reservoir with a surface area of 160 acres and a total storage volume of 500 acre-feet at the normal maximum surface elevation of 747.2 feet NGVD; (7) an existing reinforced concrete and masonry powerhouse, 17 feet by 21 feet, containing (a) a vertical shaft Francis turbine with a hydraulic capacity of 270 cfs, manufactured by James Leffel Company, and (b) a vertical shaft generator, manufactured by Westinghouse and rated at 250 kW; and (8) existing appurtenant facilities. The applicant proposes increasing capacity at the Upper South Development by 200 kW as well as increasing the capacity at the Four Mile Development by 600 kW, with the addition of three new generators, respectively. The applicant estimates that the proposed total installed project capacity would be 8.25 MW with a total average annual generation of 8.26 GWH. The dam and existing project facilities of each development are owned by the applicant. Project power would be utilized by the applicant for sale to its customers.
