Was it because Hungarians support your program so much, or rather because they wanted to express their opposition to the activities of the present coalition? [Szekeres] I think that there were three reasons for this outcome. First, vast numbers of people were indeed dissatisfied with the government's policy and style thus far. Second, the liberal forces were not able to offer an appropriate alternative to the coalition. And third, the four years that have passed were enough for the people not only to become familiar with our program -- they observed the behavior and approach of the party in various situations -- but they knew what they could expect from the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. We offered numerous examples showing that we have many experts at our disposal. I believe that we scored additional points for the degree of openness we presented. [Lubczyk] At news conferences both you -- in the absence of Gyula Horn, who is in the hospital, you are acting as the party's number one man -- and your colleagues in the leadership of the MSZP state that you stand a good chance of forming the next government. [Szekeres] We are realists and pragmatists. When we consider the possibility of forming a coalition with the Free Democrats, we know what the liberals can achieve, particularly in the area that is most important to the country: in the economy. On many issues our programs are convergent or similar. We would like to govern the country in a style different from the style presented by the current coalition with the Democratic Forum. We believe that this should be done through dialogue with the people; we also think that the people should be respected. Among our people, there are still latent forces, which are enormous. They must only be liberated and utilized in the interest of the country, which is in a crisis. [Lubczyk] What then, is most important in the economy? [Szekeres] Our fundamental goal is to stimulate and boost production, curb inflation, create new jobs, and consistently decrease the number of unemployed people. We also want to change the approach to the terrible social conditions in which considerable numbers of our people live, especially elderly persons. [Lubczyk] What about foreign policy? [Szekeres] Further integration with West Europe, tightening cooperation with our closest neighbors, and caring about the fate of the Hungarian minority abroad. [Lubczyk] Do you include Poland among your neighbors? [Szekeres] Unfortunately, we do not have a common border; however, I would like to emphasize that we really want to have good relations with your country. [Lubczyk] In an interview with RZECZPOSPOLITA, Ivan Peto, leader of the "Free Democrats," did not rule out the possibility of entering into a coalition with you. However, he pointed to numerous differences in your two programs, which means that negotiations might be rather difficult. [Szekeres] Well, we are different parties and so there must be differences. We will have experts hold interparty discussions and, if need be, we will look for compromises. We have set an initial period of six months to reach an agreement and work out a program of cooperation that I believe would be good and feasible. [Lubczyk] Mathematical calculations suggest that you might form the new government alone. Do you not want to do that? [Szekeres] Only a coalition guarantees a stable and strong government. Cooperation with the "Free Democrats" would broaden the social support for our future undertakings. If we do not find a partner or partners, we will have to take on this difficult task alone. I do not think, however, that we will be doing this alone. [Lubczyk] You said "partners." Who else would you take into consideration? [Szekeres] Certainly the parties of the present coalition are out of the question, but we have not abandoned the Federation of Young Democrats, "Fidesz." [Lubczyk] Despite the fact that you were so fiercely attacked by their leader, Viktor Orban? [Szekeres] You know, a coalition is not a married couple. [Lubczyk] You are probably the only group which did not put forward its own candidate for prime minister before the elections. [Szekeres] And we did the right thing. We wanted to show that what we wanted was not concrete posts and perches. When the final results of the elections are known, we will do this without such great emotions. [Lubczyk] I have come across opinions among many Hungarians that a very good candidate, who might be acceptable for many parties, would be Miklos Nemeth. [Szekeres] Nemeth is indeed enjoying great popularity in Hungary. In January, we discussed with him his participation in the elections. He said then that his contract with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development would expire in the summer of 1995 and that he would not like to break it. We believe that after that he will take part in the political life of the country once again. [Lubczyk] However, today the situation is different than the situation in January. If the MSZP Congress asked him to do so, I do not think he would refuse. I know that he came from London and cast his vote in Budapest. [Szekeres] I have not spoken to him. Until the second round of elections is complete, we will not discuss the issue of a possible candidate for prime minister. [Lubczyk] Your voters also mention Laslo Bekesi and Gyula Horn. [Szekeres] Really, no decisions on this issue have been made. [Lubczyk] You often say that your party is a "pragmatic party, without an ideology." How would you briefly characterize the MSZP? [Szekeres] This is the correct name for what we are doing. We are living in a crucible of transformations, we are arranging things anew, as it were. Today it is a mistake to create an ideology that one must adjust to at a later time. I believe that a party such as ours should tread firmly on the ground, should be close to the problems of our people, should try to resolve them, so as to make this difficult life easier. Of course, we call ourselves a socialist party because we are striving for social justice. We want to be with those whose lives are difficult; we want to fight for them. [Lubczyk] The name of your party includes the word "socialist." What is your understanding of the word? [Szekeres] Solidarity with the people who -- as they say -- live from the work of their hands, fair distribution of duties, and the creation of equal opportunities.
