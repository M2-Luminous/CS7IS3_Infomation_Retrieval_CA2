According to the notices, the firms inflated contract fees for the construction projects from 1984 to 1990 through a constructors' group at the U.S. naval station at Atsugi, Kanagawa Prefecture. If the named firms, which include the Maeda Corp., Nishimatsu Construction Co. and Tokyu Construction Co., do not reply in 10 days, the demands will be filed as a suit in court, the notices said. The notices allege that the group engaged in illegal trade activities that injured the United States. The president of the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors (JFCC), Kenji Maeda, remarked "there is no evidence of bid-rigging, because no orders were received." "The talks among contracters that were indicated was to administer quality," said Maeda, who also heads the Maeda construction firm.
