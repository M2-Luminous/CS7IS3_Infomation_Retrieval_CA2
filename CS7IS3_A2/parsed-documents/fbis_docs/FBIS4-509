FBIS4-509 "drafr070_c_94048" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Hostel Residents To Use `Own Military' for Protection Hostel Residents To Use `Own Military' for Protection MB0904130494 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1224 GMT 9 Apr 94 MB0904130494 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Report by E Oelofse] [Text] Johannesburg April 9 SAPA -- The National Hostel Residents Association [Nahora] says that from today it will be deploying its "own military" at hostels throughout South Africa and that the South African Defence Force [SADF] will "no longer be welcome at the hostels". In a telephone statement to SAPA on Saturday [9 April], Nahora spokesman Thulani Simon Mlotshwa said the decision had been taken because of events on March 28 in Johannesburg where Zulus were "butchered by Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, ANC armed wing] members who were assisted by security forces". Moreover, hostels had been raided after the March 28 massacre but not the African National Congress Johannesburg HQ which building had been at the centre of the violence, Mr Mlotshwa noted. "This, proves the partiality and bias of the so-called security forces," he said. On Friday the East Rand Buyafuthi hostel was targeted by SADF troops who allegedly shot and killed Inkatha Freedom Party leader Jeff Sibiya, who, said Mr Mlotshwa, was involved in promoting peace in the area. With this in mind, Nahora had decided it would be better to deploy its own military structures in defence of hostels and hostel residents. "From today our enemies had better be on their guard because we will be replying to all letters sent to us. We cannot sit with our arms folded while our heels are being bitten by mice."
