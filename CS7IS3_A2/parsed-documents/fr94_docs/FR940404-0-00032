FR940404-0-00032 FR940404-0-00014 II. EPA's Approval of Colorado's Petition for 1992 and 1993 On October 16, 1991, Governor Roy Romer requested EPA to amend the federal RVP standards for the Denver-Boulder ozone nonattainment area. The specific change requested was to relax the 7.8 psi standard for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area to 9.0 psi area for 1992 and 1993. The Governor further requested that the 7.8 psi standard take effect beginning in June of 1994, unless the State of Colorado specifically requested via the Colorado Ozone Maintenance State Implementation Plan (SIP), that the 9.0 psi standard be retained. EPA thus treated this petition as a request for a two-year relaxation of the volatility standard for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area to 9.0 psi until 1994. On May 12, 1992, EPA proposed to approve the State of Colorado's petition to relax until 1994 the gasoline volatility standard for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area. EPA reviewed the State of Colorado's petition and found that the request to relax the federal volatility standard for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area until 1994 from the Phase II standard of 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi was justified based on the petition itself, the evidence submitted on behalf of Governor Romer, and EPA's own analysis of the costs of implementation of the 7.8 psi standard and the environmental need for the 7.8 psi standard. The petition and available evidence sufficiently demonstrated that retention of the 7.8 psi standard would impose significant costs on consumers and industry relative to a 9.0 psi standard, and that the 7.8 psi standard was not necessary for emission control until 1994 in light of the current transitional status of the Denver-Boulder area. EPA also determined that an analysis by Colorado to demonstrate that sufficient alternative programs were in place to insure future attainment of the ozone standard was not necessary due to the State's consistent attainment of the ozone NAAQS since 1986. Finally, Colorado provided further assurances that a two-year relaxation of the standard would provide sufficient time for the State to complete an ozone maintenance plan. Such a plan would allow the State to determine if 7.8 psi gasoline was necessary for continued attainment in future years. Thus, at that time, the State could determine if a permanent change in the standard was necessary. On April 30, 1993 9 the EPA approved Colorado's petition. The relaxation was therefore determined to be justified under section 211(h) of the Act. 10 EPA received three comments in response to this proposal. For the reasons discussed in the April 30, 1993 final notice (and in greater detail in the NPRM), EPA approved the State of Colorado's petition. 9 53 FR 26067 (April 30, 1993). 10 Under section 211(h), EPA must set a national summertime gasoline volatility standard of 9.0 psi beginning in 1992. EPA must also establish more stringent volatility standards ``in a nonattainment area as the Administrator finds necessary to generally achieve comparable evaporative emissions (on a per-vehicle basis) in nonattainment areas taking into consideration the enforceability of such standards, the need of an area for emission control and economic factors.'' III. Colorado's Petition To Relax the RVP Standard for 1994 and 1995 On September 15, 1993, Governor Roy Romer sent a letter to Jack McGraw, Acting Administrator of EPA Region VIII, requesting that EPA amend the federal RVP standards for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area. Specifically, Governor Romer requested that EPA extend the relaxation of the RVP standard of 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi granted for the 1992 and 1993 summer ozone season to the years 1994 and 1995. The Governor further requested that the 7.8 psi standard take effect beginning in June of 1996, unless the State of Colorado specifically requests via the Colorado Ozone Maintenance SIP that the 9.0 psi standard be retained. EPA thus will treat this petition as a request for a two-year relaxation of the volatility standard for the Denver-Boulder nonattainment area to 9.0 psi until 1996. If the Governor's request were granted, the phase II volatility standard of 7.8 psi would not become effective until 1996. Thereafter, the 7.8 psi standard would be implemented unless EPA receives and approves a subsequent request from the Governor to continue the relaxation or a maintenance plan is submitted and approved that demonstrates no future need for the 7.8 psi gasoline to achieve attainment. Governor Romer's request results from the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission's (the Commission) recommendation to relax the RVP standard. The Commission endorsed the relaxed RVP standard based upon testimony provided at a public hearing on August 19, 1993, and after consideration of the environmental and economic impact of the 7.8 psi federal standard. A transcript of the testimony and comments submitted at this hearing are available in the docket for this rulemaking. 11 In forwarding this request to EPA, Governor Romer is following procedures stated in the preamble for the Phase II volatility rule. As mentioned in Section II, requests for changes to the federal volatility standard must include the following: (1) documentation of the local economic impact of the otherwise applicable standard and (2) an indication that sufficient alternative programs are available to achieve attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. 11 Docket A&hyph;94&hyph;01.
