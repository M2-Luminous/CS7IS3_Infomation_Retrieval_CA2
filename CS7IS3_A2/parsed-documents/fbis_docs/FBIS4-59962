Saini] [Text] The United States pushing for India signing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] on agreeing to a regional variant has for long been an irritant in the growth of relations between the two countries. [sentence as heard] The American attitude has been that full scope safeguards in the subcontinent are necessary to ensure that tensions between India and Pakistan do not erupt into war with the possibility of a nuclear exchange. The American policy failed to recognize three vital elements of the situation in South Asia. If India had wanted to develop nuclear weapons capability, it would have done so right after the peaceful test at Pokhran in 1974. Secondly, Pakistan has been clandestinely developing nuclear weapons capability even when claiming that it does not have any nuclear bombs. Another crucial aspect ignored or not given due weight by the American policymakers was that India's security concerns were not confined to the threat from Pakistan alone. The Clinton Administration's latest report to the U.S. Congress on progress toward regional nonproliferation in South Asia, which came just on the eve of the prime minister's visit, is in a way a step forward from earlier reports. It recognizes that while dealing with weapons proliferation in South Asia, the United States and others have to take into account regional security threat perceptions, including those extending beyond India and Pakistan. The report indicates adoption of a more realistic attitude by the United States toward the objectives of stopping the proliferation of nuclear and other mass destruction weapons in South Asia. But, so far as the question of supply of more weapons and equipment like F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan is concerned, the United States is still sticking to its earlier plan to give these aircraft to Islamabad in return for capping of Pakistan's nuclear program. It fails to recognize that supply of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan is only going to trigger off an arms race in the subcontinent. So far as India is concerned, it has made abundantly clear in the past that it will not sign the NPT, as it is discriminatory. It seeks to divide the world into nuclear haves and have-nots. The Clinton Administration report indicates that there is scope for India and the United States discussing the NPT issue further so that differences in their perceptions can be narrowed down. In any case, the Narasimaha Rao-Clinton talks on Thursday will enable the two leaders to see each other's viewpoint more clearly.
