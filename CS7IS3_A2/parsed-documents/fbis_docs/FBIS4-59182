At the meeting the president welcomed the idea of exchange of views between Iranian and Kuwaiti scientific delegations as a valuable and beneficial move. Stressing that it should continue, he said it helps to strengthen science and culture ties between the two countries. Referring to the problems facing the region, particularly since the Persian Gulf war, the president cited the following as the negative effects of the war: The way that America and some western countries have taken advantage of the situation to justify their illegal presence in the region; the difficult living conditions of the people of Iraq; and moves of the West in instilling fear through adverse propaganda representing Iran as an enemy of the countries in the region, creating an atmosphere of mistrust in order to sell western arms and military hardware, and raising a hue and cry by exaggerating peripheral and divisive issues in the region. The president added: If the interests of the regional nations, and not the world powers, are considered in cooperation between Persian Gulf littoral states, and issues are reviewed in a sincere atmosphere and with cooperation, the unfavorable conditions in the region would be solved by the countries in the region. In reply to a question by a Kuwaiti writer about the present situation in Iran, the president said: Iran's future is very clear to us. Thanks to the patience and hard work of our good people and the efforts of our sympathetic officials, we have carried out important fundamental and infrastructural work since the war imposed by Iraq, which is unprecedented in all eras of Iran's history. He added: Currently many of the raw materials for industry, including metals and petrochemicals, are produced domestically. Large-scale industrial projects -- from the research to the operational stages -- are being implemented with domestic materials and experts. You witnessed at close hand the knowhow and expertise of Iran's specialists in the field in the course of extinguishing the oil well fires in Kuwait. The president declared Iran's preparedness to help neighboring countries. [passage omitted]
