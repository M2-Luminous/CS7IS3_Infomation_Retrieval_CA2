Shokhin had been assured direct access to the prime minister. He will not have to report to deputy prime ministers. Shokhin also said that Finance Minister Boris Fedorov was awaiting a reply to his conditions for staying in the government. Shokhin, who had spoken with him on the telephone Thursday morning, believed that Fedorov could join the government if just one of his conditions, dismissal of Viktor Gerashchenko from governorship of the Central Bank, was met. Fedorov had earlier said that he would not stay in the government if Aleksandr Zaveryukha remained a deputy prime minister. Shokhin thought that if Fedorov left the government, his duties would be taken over by one of his deputies, for example Sergey Dubinin, or former finance minister Vasiliy Barchuk. Shokhin said that the protracted formation of a new cabinet was tantamount to a governmental crisis.
