Tehran said last Wednesday that a listening device had been found late April inside a wall at the Iranian embassy in London. Britain has refused to comment on the affair. Naderi, a member of parliament's foreign affairs subcommittee, told ABRAR newspaper there was a possibility "of any kind of conflict" with London, but that the National Security Council would have to give its opinion first. "If the British government does not come up with a convincing explanation over the spying, a break in relations is possible," he said. Tehran has strongly protested against the bugging and said it would "weaken relations with Britain." Several newspapers here have urged the government to reconsider economic ties with Britain, which is Iran's fourth biggest trade partner.
