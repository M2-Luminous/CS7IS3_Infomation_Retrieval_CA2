Austria was asked to provide a certain type of stacker trucks, which the Austrian Army does not have. Purchasing such devices would have cost millions of Austrian schillings. Another UN request, to train Pakistani troops in an Austrian training area, proved impossible for technical and legal reasons. The Pakistani UN soldiers should have been trained on old GDR tanks that are being used by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] in Bosnia. But as Austria does not have such tanks, the army would have had to import them and train Austrian instructors to use them first, so as to be able to train the Pakistanis. Foreign troop maneuvers on Austrian territory would also have required a state treaty between Austria and the UN. This could not have been concluded within a few weeks, as would have been necessary, the Austrian Government said.
