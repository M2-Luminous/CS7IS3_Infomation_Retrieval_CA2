Hurd yesterday began a four-day visit to Brazil to promote relations between the two countries. In Brasilia tomorrow, he will meet with President Itamar Franco, with Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero, and with Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. At Bandeirantes Palace, in southern Sao Paulo, Hurd met with Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, with whom he addressed the plan for privatization the Sao Paulo potable water service. Hurd added that Great Britain has successfully privatized the electric power and potable water sectors. "As a result of this," he went on, "British enterprises have direct experience in privatization management, and a new class of entrepreneurs who specialize in denationalization." Hurd said the British Government will consider reopening official export credits for Brazil, which were suspended four years ago when Brazil stopped amortizing its debt to the Paris Club.
