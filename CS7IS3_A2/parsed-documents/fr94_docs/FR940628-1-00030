FR940628-1-00030 FR940628-1-00002 Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;207&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to add an airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11, &hyph;2A12, and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes, was published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 5966). That NPRM would have required a test of the engine throttle quadrant to determine if the throttle lever bypasses the idle stop into the shut-off position, and modification of the throttle quadrant or replacement of the throttle quadrant with a modified unit. That NPRM was prompted by reports of unintentional engine shutdown on Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2A12 and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes. That condition, if not corrected, could result in inadvertent shutdown of an engine while the airplane is taxiing or in flight. Subsequent to the issuance of that NPRM, Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, advised the FAA of an additional unsafe condition that may exist on these, and additional, airplanes. While performing a test of the engine throttle quadrant, one operator discovered that a quick, sharp pull of the throttle lever, combined with contamination of the surfaces of the idle stop plate and pawl, could result in inadvertent run-through of the lever past the idle stop and through the shut-off position. If this were to occur while the airplane was in flight or while taxiing, it could result in the inadvertent shutdown of the engines. Canadair has issued Challenger Service Bulletins 600&hyph;0629 (for Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11 series airplanes) and 601&hyph;0410 (for Model CL&hyph;601&hyph;2A12 and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes), both dated November 1, 1993. These service bulletins contain new procedures for conducting a check of the idle stop function of the throttle quadrant and procedures for cleaning, retesting, and/or replacement of the throttle quadrant, if necessary. These service bulletins also contain instructions for installing a modified throttle quadrant. Operators that have previously accomplished the check and/or modification of the throttle quadrants in accordance with Canadair Challenger Service Bulletin A600&hyph;0615, dated June 10, 1992 (for Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11 series airplanes), and Service Bulletin A601&hyph;0374 (for Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2A12 and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes), Revision 1, dated September 30, 1992, must re-check and replace in accordance with the new service bulletins. The new service bulletins list part numbers of additional affected throttle quadrants, and serial numbers of additional (Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16) airplanes that may also be subject to the addressed unsafe condition. Transport Canada Aviation classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;92&hyph;23R1, dated March 31, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a check of the idle stop function of the throttle quadrant, and repair or replacement of the throttle quadrant if the check fails. In addition, this proposed AD would require the eventual replacement of the throttle quadrant with a new model. The proposed actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the new service bulletins described previously. Additionally, the applicability of the proposed rule would be expanded to include additional airplanes that are subject to the addressed unsafe condition. Since these changes expand the scope of the originally proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment. The FAA estimates that 150 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. The proposed functional check of the throttle quadrant would take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed functional check on U.S. operators is estimated to be $8,250, or $55 per airplane. The proposed installation of a modified throttle quadrant would take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed installation on U.S. operators is estimated to be $82,500, or $550 per airplane. Based on the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $90,750, or $605 per airplane. This total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
