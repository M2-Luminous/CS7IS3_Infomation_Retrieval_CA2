The statement made by Romania's President on 11 January 1994 -- a statement that was released immediately after the conclusion of the Brussels summit of the North Atlantic Council -- represents the official acceptance by our country of the Partnership for Peace, as a new form of cooperation between NATO and the democratic countries situated to the east of Alliance, designed to lead to consolidating security and stability in Europe. Romania's Government notes with full satisfaction and accepts the invitation addressed by the North Atlantic Council to the interested states, including our country, to participate in the Partnership for Peace, considering it as a preliminary stage for Romania's eventual admission to NATO as a fully fledged member. Romania's Government declares that it is ready to sign the basic document on the participation to a new form of partnership as soon as possible, and asks the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take urgent steps in this direction. At the same time, the government has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of National Defense to work out a draft document on Romania's participation, which will identify the measures that our country intends to adopt in order to implement the political goals of the Partnership for Peace and will specify the military and other means that our country might use for activities within the Partnership for Peace framework, after consultations with the specialized commissions of the two chambers of Romania's Parliament. The government will submit the draft document to the approval of the Supreme Council for the Country's Defense. On the basis of this document and of a partnership program to be worked out by NATO, the sides will proceed to negotiating and signing the individual Partnership for Peace program between Romania and NATO, which will be submitted for ratification to the country's Parliament, in accordance with constitutional provisions. Likewise, proceeding from the provisions of the invitation to participate in the Partnership for Peace, the government asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of National Defense to appoint their civilian and military representatives to the Alliance's headquarters in Brussels and to the coordinating cell of the Partnership for Peace at SHAPE [Supreme Headquarters of Allied Powers Europe] in Mons, Belgium. Romania's Government believes that the provisions of the basic document on consultations with NATO in the event of a direct threat to the partner states as well as the provisions of the Declaration of Principles adopted by the North Atlantic Council in Brussels on 11 January 1994 unequivocally take into consideration Romania's vital security interests. At the same time, the government considers our country's participation in the Partnership for Peace an essential component of the global process of Romania's integration into the Euro-Atlantic structures, a key goal of Romanian foreign policy. The government particularly values the national consensus that has emerged among the parliamentary political forces on the issue of accepting the invitation for Romania's participation in the Partnership for Peace -- the Romanian Government's statement reads in conclusion.
