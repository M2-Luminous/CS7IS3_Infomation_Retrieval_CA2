Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of information and minister of state for cabinet affairs, made a statement whose text reads as follows: The Jordanian Government has followed the serious and sudden stepping up of statements by Israeli officials, particularly the Israeli prime minister and the foreign minister, against Jordan and its government in light of the increasing acts of violence in the occupied Arab territories and in Israel and the intentional escalation in the official Israeli media in the wake of these statements, including the issuance of warnings and threats to Jordan that military action would be taken against its security and sovereignty. The Jordanian Government views these sudden statements with surprise and disapprobation. These statements point an accusing finger at Jordan under the pretext that it allowed a Hamas spokesman to make statements from Jordan on the 'Afula and Hadera operations. This method, which has become more frequent than at any time in the past, is nothing but an abortive attempt which demonstrates the Israeli Government's inability to distribute its responsibilities for dealing with the aggravating conditions. It is an Israeli Government attempt to brand Jordan with terrorism, tarnish its reputation, and undermine its sincere desire and effective efforts to realize just, permanent, and comprehensive peace in the region. Jordan has endeavored on all levels to warn against the dangers of violence that results from the continuation of the Israeli occupation of Arab territories and the consequences of its practices, represented by collective punishment of the residents of the occupied territories and by daily curfews and killings, something which escalates the circle of violence and counterviolence, in addition to Israel's faltering stands in the peace process, its attempts to evade substantive issues, its practice of inventing excuses and indulging in detail, and its denial of rights. Needless to say, Jordan has no need to defend itself or its record of not approving the option of violence or terrorism. Neither does Jordan need anyone to remind it of terror's consequential killing of innocents and civilians and disruption of the peace process. Jordan has suffered much from terror and paid a heavy price in blood and resources. Jordan has not and never will let its territory be used as a springboard or passageway for violence or planning it, proceeding from a principled stand reflecting a concern for the lives of innocents, human rights, democracy, and the peace process. The Jordanian government has noticed that the Israeli prime minister said that the Jordanian television showed an interview with a spokesman for Hamas. No such interview was broadcast by the Jordanian television -- neither after the 'Afula attack nor after the Hadera attack. Indeed, it was the Israeli television newscasts that featured such interviews. While emphasizing its concern for and commitment to the peace process and its call for promoting the intensive and continuous endeavors to realize the cherished peace, the Jordanian government categorically rejects methods of intimidation and of threats to use force. Based on its position which calls for peace and as a worker for the realization of peace, for stability in the region, and for an end to the conflict in it, Jordan will not submit to methods of pressure, coercion, or intimidation. Jordan calls for pooling all efforts and supports all calls that have been issued for accelerating the peace process and finding solutions for substantive issues. This will extricate the region from the circle of violence and realize peace, security, and stability for its peoples. Having always abided by, respected, and implemented unanimous Arab decisions; and out of its respect for the will of the Palestinian people in their free choice of the PLO as their sole, legitimate representative, Jordan reaffirms that it deals with the PLO in its capacity as the sole party authorized to negotiate on behalf of the Palestinian people and undertake its responsibilities on Palestinian territory. Jordan shall continue to deal with the PLO on this basis and shall not allow Jordanian territory to give prominence to any organizations contrary to this reality or influencing this reality and weakening the PLO's ability to achieve the ambitions and aspirations of the Palestinian people on Palestinian soil.
