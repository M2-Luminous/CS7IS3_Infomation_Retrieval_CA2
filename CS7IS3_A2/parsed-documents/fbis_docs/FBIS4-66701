Russia will help India modernise T-72 tanks and other Soviet-designed weapons, according to commander-in-chief of the Russian land forces Col.-Gen. Vladimir Semyonov, reports ITAR-TASS. He announced this after the final round of talks with Indian army chief Gen. B.C. Joshi yesterday. Gen. Joshi left for home this morning after a nine-week official visit to the country. The Russian general also did not rule out leasing some types of weapons for two or three years to India, he however, did not elaborate. Observers recall that India had taken a nuclear powered, submarine from Russia on lease in the eighties. While talking to ITAR-TASS, Gen. Joshi expressed India's willingness to continue military-technical cooperation with Russia and said 70 percent of arms with the Indian army were Soviet-designed. He also talked of India's problems in getting the spares. According to the Russian media, Gen. Joshi had shown interest in purchasing the latest T-72 C tanks, self-propelled artillery guns and military aircraft. However, the Indian embassy here denied the report saying such negotiations are conducted at a much lower bureaucratic level.
