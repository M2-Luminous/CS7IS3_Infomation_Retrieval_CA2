An official note from the Cuban Government states it is awaiting a decision from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which could authorize three of that country's companies to initiate telecommunication services to Cuba. The information, reported by the official newspaper GRANMA, says these are norms established by the State Department for U.S. long-distance telephone companies. The note specifies Havana-based EntelCuba [National Telecommunication Enterprise of Cuba] signed recently separate agreements with three U.S. companies from Washington, Oklahoma, and Mississippi. GRANMA has reported the parties have agreed to establish a distribution rate of $1.20 per minute, divided by 50 percent between the Cuban and U.S. companies. The note explains before 1991, when Hurricane Andrew interrupted telecommunications between the two countries, Cuba paid, for humanitarian reasons, all costs of the service, which originated in Cuban territory, without receiving a single cent of what was legally and justly its share. It explains that since 1966, as a result of the blockade, there have been accounts in U.S. banks totaling $100 million, resulting from operations various governments have carried out to prevent the telephone company from paying Cuba. Negotiations between EntelCuba and the U.S. companies began during the second half of 1993, after the current U.S. Government authorized the resumption of traffic and the payment of Cuban telephone services.
