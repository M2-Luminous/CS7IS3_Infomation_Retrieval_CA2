He said: At present, in the struggle against anti-human affairs and the creation of an independent movement, the Islamic Republic has gained valuable and long-term experience which could become a model for the freindly and peaceloving countries of the world. Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: Iran's foreign policy does not pursue any other objective but prosperity for the oppressed nations and the promotion of Islam, and is not contaminated with those selfish policies currently practised in the arrogant world. Referring to the Hebron mosque incident, the president said: Since the formation of Zionism in the world, there has been more wars, economic pressure, destruction of man-made and natural resources, and more instances of harm to popular regimes and revolutionary states. This issue must be investigated and studied by diplomats so as to adopt a proper stand against it. Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed confidence that the Islamic ummah, through extensive participation in the international Jerusalem Day rallies, will demonstrate another proper response in the face of this horrific crime. At the start of this meeting Foreign Minister Velayati presented a report on special courses for training foreign diplomats.
