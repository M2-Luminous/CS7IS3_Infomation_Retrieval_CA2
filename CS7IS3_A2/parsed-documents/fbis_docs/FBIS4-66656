The chairman of the organizing committee, Mr. Mahmoudi, stated that this national march would be one of "all workers and citizens who are opposed to terrorism" and "are for civil peace." The route for the march, it was said, goes from Martyrs Square to May Day Square. "Eighty-seven (87) associations have joined in this initiative, which is of a nongovernmental, nonpartisan nature," said members of the organizing committee, which is made up of the UFCA (Union of Algerian Financiers and Accountants), the AJA (Association of Algerian Journalists), the AAA (Association of Algerian Architects), the association of imams, the national association of telecommunications engineers, the Association in Memory of Mohamed Boudiaf, and the national coordinating board of womens' associations. The organizing committee is also in contact with the UGTA (General Union of Algerian Workers) so as to link the main trade union organization with this initiative, it was added. Furthermore the committee anticipates launching an international caravan including artists and cultural figures who will give talks to make international opinion more aware of the situation in Algeria, and in the future sponsoring charitable events to bring in gifts to benefit families which have been victims of terrorism. The caravan will go, it is hoped, if sufficient means are collected, to Brussels, Paris, Rome, Montreal, Washington, and Tunis. The committee will also speak with the ENTV and the ENRS (television and radio) to organize a May Day telethon to assist families that have been victims of terrorism.
