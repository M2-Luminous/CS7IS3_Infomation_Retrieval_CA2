Bosnia, Haiti, Somalia -- these three case studies of "postmodern" foreign policy following the Cold War reveal a pattern showing neither priorities nor interests. "Anything goes," seems to be the motto of this President who takes less pleasure in foreign policy than any of his predecessors since the isolationist twenties. But now Clinton has reached the border of postmodern foreign policy, and this border goes right across the Korean Peninsula. On the other side of this border is North Korea, the last Stalinist fossil, which makes even Castro's Cuba appear a model of an open society. Kim Il-song, the 82-year-old permanent dictator, has confronted Clinton with an impudent nuclear challenge that could develop into a "definite crisis" of his presidency -- like the Cuban missile crisis in the second year of Kennedy's presidency. For two years now, Kim Il-song has staged a nuclear gamble according to the motto: "Where is the bomb?" Inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are hoaxed or locked out, while Pyongyang threatens to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which would abruptly mark the end of any inspection. In the center of the most recent escalation are 8,000 fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor core. In other words, if the inspectors cannot access the rods, they cannot say how much plutonium has been "bred" and how much bomb-grade material can be extracted and secretly put aside following the cooling-off phase (approximately a month). By rough estimates, the rods are good for five or six atom bombs. Filling the cup to the brim, Pyongyang simply reacted to the United States' threats of sanctions by stating: "Sanctions will promptly mean war, and war will be merciless." Clinton cannot leave this poker game now to deal with the health reform at home or the financial trouble in which his wife, Hillary, is involved in connection with the "Whitewatergate" affair. What is at stake is not just the United States' credibility, but also a pillar of the postwar order -- the nonproliferation regime, which has ensured for more than 30 years that the number of official nuclear powers does not exceed five, and the number of unofficial ones does not exceed two. Some would-be bomb builders (such as Sweden or South Africa) gave up, while others (Iraq) were forced to do so. The crux of the matter is this: If North Korea goes to the end of the road upon which it embarked in 1989 and which it has continued since then, this would mark the end of containment. The signal would be that the United States as a superpower and the "international community" (meaning China, Russia, Britain, and France) are not even able to enforce an interest that unites them all -- nuclear nonproliferation. Those waiting for such a signal are no lambs -- Libya, Iran, Iraq, Algeria, Pakistan. In addition, a North Korean bomb would entail a South Korean and a Japanese bomb. Clinton is not to be envied. His presumptive allies are no allies. China suddenly talks about "blood friendship" with North Korea and even strictly rejects any sanctions. Russia wants a conference of the big powers, which would, however, be intended to serve its own status rather than as punishment for Pyongyang. Japan is afraid, and South Korea hesitates, even though they are both threatened most by Kim Il-song's bomb. By the way, sanctions do not make sense with a country that has adopted autarchy as its policy principle. There are only one and a half levers. The half-lever is the sum of $1 billion that Koreans in Japan transfer to their home country. The whole lever consists of the oil products (75 percent of its total demand) that North Korea buys from China. No gasoline, no war -- however, Beijing will not use this lever. Would "bribery" help, meaning economic aid or diplomatic recognition? Hardly, because, first, relevant offers have long been on the table, and, second, the construed picture of a hostile outside world is the breeding ground on which the stone-age dictatorship lives. Those who are serious about the containment of atom bombs must face a sad reality, which requires military countermoves. A minimum is the demonstrative enforcement of the United States' presence in South Korea and the Japanese Sea. If Kim Il-song threatens war, he must know that a war would fall back on him and would destroy him. This would at least be helpful for an assessment of the reality, of which even dictators are capable. Under this umbrella, Clinton could prove that he is able to concentrate on what is essential in foreign policy. Combined with persistence, U.S. resolve could even work diplomatic miracles and could forge an alliance among Beijing, Moscow, Seoul, and Tokyo, which would show Kim Il-song that he is isolated. One thing is, however, impossible -- to wring one's hands and look on as, at the threshold to the third millennium, Korea opens the door to a world in which any second-class dictator would play with the bomb.
