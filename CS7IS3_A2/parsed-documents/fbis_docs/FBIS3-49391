All are aware of the bad situation of human rights in Kosova. I know that the issue of Albanians is more profound and it is not limited only to human rights," Vesna Peshic, chairman of Civil Alliance Party in Belgrade said in an interview with the independent newspaper DITA INFORMACION. Vesnia Peshic, professor of philosophy and sociology at the Belgrade University, is considered by Milovan Gjilasi, the most renowned Yugoslav dissident, as the only representative of the opposition that should be appreciated. Mrs. Peshic wrote in the book A Goridan Knot, should it be cut or...? that thus far it has been spoken of Albanians raping the Serbs but statistics show of the opposite. Because of this attitude Mrs. Pashic was declared traitor by the Belgrade government.
