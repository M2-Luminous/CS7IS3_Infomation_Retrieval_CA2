Europe has also expressed its support for the French operation. [passage omitted] And now the situation in Kigali: Violent fighting took place again this morning, but subsided in the afternoon. However, the United Nations was not able to continue its humanitarian missions. (Pierre Mehu), the UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] spokesman in Kigali, has some explanations: [(Mehu)] The situation is still very tense. [Words indistinct] we were not able to evacuate the orphans from the Saint-Michel orphanage; we were to take them to the King Faisal hospital today, but we couldn't because of the bad security conditions. [Correspondent Ghislaine Dupont] Do you have the impression that the Rwandan Patriotic Front is still very hostile to the French intervention operation? [(Mehu)] I would say that their hostility has subsided. Colonel Frank Mugambage, who is the leader of the delegation at the cease-fire talks, gave a news conference yesterday. He said that the Rwandan Patriotic Front may reconsider its position--not renounce, but reconsider its position--if the French initiative is limited to the humanitarian side of things. [Dupont] Does UNAMIR have any contact with those behind Operation Turquoise? [(Mehu)] Well, telephone contact has been established. The commander of the general force, Dallaire, is to meet the commander of the French intervention force over the next few days.
