He also stated that he was withdrawing his support from this cabinet. "15 months after taking the lead this government has got nowhere with privatization and has failed to carry out the priorities of its programme for which it was appointed by parliament. No real investments have come to Bulgaria during this period and we are still at the bottom of the list as far as foreign investments in Eastern Europe are concerned," the president pointed out. He said that not a single project had been carried out or even launched, and cited projects for which even competitions had been opened: a Kalotina -- Kapitan Andreevo motorway (linking the western and the southern border), a tunnel under Stara Planina (which divides northern from southern Bulgaria), a new airport in Sofia, and a new bridge over the Danube (the only existing bridge links Rousse with Giurgiu). According to the president, the land reform has come to a standstill and in reality only 25-30 per cent of the land has been returned to its owners. "And, to top it all, here is the financial destabilization: fluctuations that have to do with the rise of the dollar and the prices, which undermine social stability," he added. "Under these circumstances I cannot but reconsider my attitude to this government and withdraw my support from it," the president stated. It is not the president, it is parliament who decides what government will be ruling this country, he said. "But when the actions of the government start to threaten peace and stability, I cannot regard that with indifference," Dr Zhelev pointed out. His personal attitude to Professor Berov is unchanged: "He is an honest, upright, decent and ethical person". "The point is that this government is much to the liking of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) as it gets a chance to do what it has always wanted to: govern without shouldering the political responsibility for it," said the president. He stated that he was not holding any talks on the formation of a new government, for that is beyond his prerogatives. He said that it was normal for the parliamentary and non-parliamentary forces to seek to meet with him.
