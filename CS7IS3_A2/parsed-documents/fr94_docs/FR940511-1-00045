FR940511-1-00045 FR940511-1-00011 2. A new ยง381.9 would be added to read as follows: ยง381.9 Available U.S.-flag service for 1994. For purposes of shipping bulk agricultural commodities from U.S. Great Lakes ports during the 1994 shipping season, if direct U.S.-flag service, at fair and reasonable rates, is not available at U.S. ports in the Great Lakes, a joint service involving a foreign-flag vessel(s) carrying cargo no farther than a Canadian port(s) on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with transshipment via a U.S.-flag privately owned commercial vessel to the ultimate destination, will be deemed to comply with the requirement of ``available'' commercial U.S.-flag service under the Cargo Preference Act of 1954. Shipper agencies considering bids resulting in the lowest landed cost of transportation based on U.S.-flag rates and service shall include within the comparison of U.S.-flag rates and service, for shipments originating in U.S. Great Lakes ports, through rates incorporating a foreign-flag leg from U.S. Great Lakes ports to a Canadian port on the Gulf of St. Lawrence and a U.S.-flag leg for the remainder of the voyage. The ``fair and reasonable'' rate for this mixed service will be determined by considering the U.S.-flag component under the existing regula- tions at 46 CFR part 382 or 383, as appropriate, and incorporating the cost for the foreign-flag component into the U.S.-flag ``fair and reasonable'' rate in the same way as the cost of foreign-flag vessels used to lighten U.S.-flag vessels in the recipient country's territorial waters. Dated: May 4, 1994. By order of the Maritime Administrator. James E. Saari, Secretary, Maritime Administration.
