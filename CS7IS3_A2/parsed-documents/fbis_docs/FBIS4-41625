He considers them as visits by the head of state, who wants to acquaint himself with the state of affairs in Ukraine, he said this after his arrival in the republic of Crimea due to the unprecedented drought that has struck the peninsula's steppe areas. According to old residents, they have not seen such a dry summer during past 20 years. President Kravchuk was received at the Dzhankoi airport by Crimean Supreme Soviet Chairman Sergey Tsekov and other officials. But President of the Crimean Republic Yuriy Meshkov was not seen among them. During a press conference on the tarmac, Leonid Kravchuk said he does not regard this as a big tragedy. The Ukrainian president told journalists that he intends to personally acquaint himself with the situation prevailing in the area due to the drought, and decide what help is needed by the people and farms. When asked about his chances of once again being elected president, Leonid Kravchuk replied that every person has his chances, but they are determined by the electorate, who come to cast their votes. Regarding the Black Sea Fleet problem, Leonid Kravchuk said that his stand remains unchanged. According to him, statements made by certain political leaders about not dividing the fleet and decide bases, do not stand up to criticism. "The fact is that this view pint is not shared by Russia and, in particular, by President Boris Yeltsin." "Besides this, the president emphasised, there is a law adopted by Ukraine's Supreme Soviet, which states that the fleet be divided and bases for ships must be determined. And I, as head of state, must carry out this," he said. Speaking of basing ships, Leonid Kravchuk emphasised that the Black Sea Fleet base should not be designated as the city of Sevastopol, but as Russia's Black Sea base in Sevastopol. According to him the Ukrainian Navy, apparently, will be based in Balaklav.
