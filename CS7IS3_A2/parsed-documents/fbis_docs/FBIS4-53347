FBIS4-53347 "dreas095_d_94027" FBIS-EAS-94-095 Daily Report 8 May 1994 South Korea Pardons During National Holidays Discontinued Pardons During National Holidays Discontinued SK0805061694 Seoul YONHAP in English 0551 GMT 8 May 94 SK0805061694 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 8 (YONHAP) -- There will be no special pardon for imprisoned criminals this year in commemoration of Buddha's birthday next week, the Justice Ministry said Sunday. The government will minimize the number of felons released from special amnesty granted during national holidays every year and refer the convicted criminals to the regular release on the 20th of every month, the Ministry said. Ministry officials said the change is due to rising number of repeat offenses by those who have been released on holiday amnesty. There was also concern that the release of security law violators was weakening the seriousness of the law, they said. Special holiday amnesty released approximately 100 more criminals than during monthly pardon. The change in government release is expected to reduce the number of pardoned criminals by 400 to 500 a year.
