FR940505-0-00081 FR940505-0-00024 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Parts 217 and 227 [Docket No. 940418&hyph;4118; I.D. 031894B] Sea Turtle Conservation; Restrictions Applicable to Fishery Activities AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Temporary rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS establishes all inshore and offshore waters from Cape Canaveral, Florida (28 ○24.6 ’ N latitude), to the North Carolina-Virginia border (36 ○30.5 ’ N latitude) as the leatherback conservation zone and notifies owners and operators of shrimp trawlers operating in that zone that short-term area closures may be required if high abundance levels of leatherback turtles are documented. NMFS will close those areas to any shrimp trawler required to have a turtle excluder device (TED) installed in each net that is rigged for fishing unless the TED installed is a NMFS-approved Taylor TED or a Morrison TED with either of the two NMFS-approved modifications made in May 1993. This temporary rule is necessary to reduce mortality of endangered leatherback sea turtles incidentally captured in shrimp trawls. Specific area closures will be announced in the Federal Register , on the NOAA weather channel and in newspapers and other media. Shrimp trawlers in the leatherback conservation zone are responsible for monitoring the NOAA weather channel for closure announcements. Shrimp fishermen may also call (813) 893&hyph;3163 for updated closure information. Owners and operators of shrimp trawlers operating in closed areas with modified TEDs must register with the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, and may be required to carry an observer and provide information on trawling hours, gear modifications and turtle captures if requested by the Regional Director. DATES: This rule is effective from April 29, 1994 through May 31, 1994. Comments on this rule and consideration of any extension of this rule must be submitted by May 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Requests for a copy of the environmental assessment for this action and comments on this action should be addressed to Dr. William W. Fox, Jr., Director, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, room 8268, Silver Spring, MD 20910. Comments on the collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act should be directed to the Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910, Attention: Phil Williams, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for NOAA. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Phil Williams, Acting Chief, Endangered Species Division (301) 713&hyph;2322, or Charles A. Oravetz, Chief, Protected Species Program, NMFS, Southeast Region, (813) 893&hyph;3366. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background All sea turtles that occur in U.S. waters are listed as either endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973. The Kemp's ridley ( Lepidochelys kempii ), leatherback ( Dermochelys coriacea ), and hawksbill ( Eretmochelys imbricata ) are listed as endangered. Loggerhead ( Caretta ) and green ( Chelonia mydas ) turtles are listed as threatened, except for breeding populations of green turtles in Florida and on the Pacific coast of Mexico, which are listed as endangered. The incidental take and mortality of these species, as a result of fishing activities, have been documented in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic seaboard. Under the ESA and its implementing regulations, it is prohibited to take sea turtles. The incidental taking of turtles during fishing in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the southeastern United States and in the Gulf of Mexico is excepted from the taking prohibition if specified sea turtle conservation measures are used. Existing sea turtle conservation regulations (50 CFR part 227) require most shrimp trawlers to have a NMFS-approved TED installed in each net rigged for fishing throughout the year. The use of TEDs significantly reduces mortalities of loggerhead, green, Kemp's ridley, and hawksbill sea turtles. Because leatherback turtles are larger than the escape openings of most NMFS-approved TEDs, use of these TEDs is not an effective means of protecting leatherback turtles. The existing sea turtle conservation regulations allow the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries (AA), NOAA, to restrict fishing activities in order to conserve a species listed under the ESA (50 CFR 227.72(e)(6)(ii)). This action may be taken if the AA determines that restrictions are necessary to avoid unauthorized takings that may likely jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species. The provision is particularly applicable to leatherback turtles, where despite the use of TEDs, taking by shrimp trawlers can occur. In accordance with the endangered status of leatherback turtles, NMFS considers preventable take of leatherbacks to be inappropriate. If the leatherbacks are relatively abundant in areas where shrimp trawlers are fishing, restrictions to minimize the take of leatherbacks must be imposed.
