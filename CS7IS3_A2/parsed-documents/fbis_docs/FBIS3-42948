When I and my wife Lena made our way out of the charred and blackened "White House," which had been shot up, I was greeted by a television cameraman of the ABC company. "Hey, Mike," he shouted. "What was it like inside?" I angrily told him. Never previously when I had returned home had the chief of ABC's Moscow bureau requested an on-the-spot interview. But that evening, as several days later also, millions of Americans saw the first witness to describe his vision from inside the House of Soviets building of the crime of the century blessed by our American president. When I arrived in New York, therefore, there was already considerable interest in the true picture of what had happened in Moscow those tragic October days. And this was in direct contrast to what had been portrayed by the pro-Yeltsin news media on the payroll of American big business. In San Francisco I saw full coverage of these events, some of which had been shown on Russian television also. President Yeltsin's shooting up of parliament with tank guns was presented to the American people as a forced response to the rebellion of "renegade legislators"! Never prior to that particular time when I arrived in New York had WBAI Radio, which is popular in the United States, sought an interview with me. On this occasion the interest in me was enormous, and I was invited to take part in a 90-minute interview. More precisely, this was my dialogue with this station's Moscow stringer. In San Francisco I was interviewed by the correspondent of another popular radio station--KPFA. And this interview also aroused great interest. Maria Glardin from the Media Center, which serves 40 radio stations of the United States, Canada, and New Zealand, conducted a two-hour interview with me. Thus, thanks to these television and radio appearances of mine, at least the Americans (not, alas, Russian people, who are informed by television and radio which is controlled by Yeltsin's team) were able to learn the truth about the bloody carnage in Moscow. I spoke, in addition, at meetings in New York, Chicago, Gary (the center of the steel industry), San Francisco, and Los Angeles. And everywhere people were moved to the bottom of their hearts. And it was by no means a question of my eloquence. People were affected by the greatest tragedy of the 20th century, which Russia is experiencing, itself! Many of those in my audience had been to the Soviet Union. They had seen this country's sole privileged class--children. They had visited the practically free kindergarten and summer pioneer camps. They had made the acquaintance of students, who had not only acquired a free higher education but who were, in addition, being paid grants not devoured by hyperinflation. They had experienced such a blessing as the possibility of strolling the streets of Moscow at night without fear or risk. Some of them had been members of a delegation of working America at the May celebrations in Red Square. And now, not far from Red Square, officers and soldiers of the Soviet Army, which had been the admiration of the world and which had saved mankind from fascism, were participating in the slaughter of their own people! One elderly woman from San Francisco uttered words that are etched in my memory forever. She said: "I saw on television how thousands of Muscovites looked on calmly as tanks shot up the parliament building. What has happened to Soviet people?" This question awaits an answer from Russians themselves and other peoples of the former Soviet Union. And I believe that this answer will be forthcoming. I have attempted in my book "Perestroyka: Its Rise and Fall," which has just been published in the United States (the title of its Russian edition is "Quo Vadis, Rus?"), to provide an explanation for this. And we Americans also are required, in turn, to answer the just as painful question: "How was it that the progressive community of the United States failed to raise its voice in protest against the evil deed perpetrated in Russia?" And I have to emphasize particularly in answering these and similar questions that I have the most profound respect for the courageous defenders of the Russian parliament and Constitution. And I know that the majority even of those who avail themselves of information from the biased pro-Yeltsin publications feel that the whole truth concerning these events has far from been spoken as yet. Was this not why Yeltsin's supporters suffered a crushing defeat at the 12 December elections? And is this not a sign that the mass of the Russian people disagree with both the capitalization and the Americanization of their country? This was understood even by Senator Sam Nunn, the head of the influential Senate Armed Services Committee. He was very candid in his comments on what happened in Russia: "The experience of the Russian people's familiarization with capitalism has convinced them that it is like the law of the jungle." And the leading American weekly THE NATION was even more candid and curt: "Capitalism is returning to Russia up to its knees in blood" (25 October 1993). "Results of the elections in Russia: New image smashed to smithereens"--this was the heading that THE NEW YORK TIMES gave a report from Moscow on 15 December 1993. From all that I saw, I concluded that the Clinton administration will do everything in its power to impose capitalism on Russia. It has a dual purpose here: first, to strengthen capitalism in Russia, which means the complete eradication of socialism; second, to guarantee that Russia not surmount the disintegration imposed on it by the Yeltsin-Kravchuk-Shushkevich conspiracy. And this means primarily that the restoration of a renewed USSR will be prevented. With Yeltsin or without him (and U.S. imperialism recognizes that it will never have another chance), this is its main goal. I believe that the Clinton administration understands the need for greater flexibility in its relations with the political forces in Russia. But it would be a serious delusion to confuse this flexibility with the main aim: the spread of the laws of the capitalist jungle to Russia and other former republics of the USSR. The Clinton administration has latched onto the impressive victory of Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party at the recent elections to start howling about the fascist threat in Russia. The hypocrisy of such a campaign is obvious. Where there were, indeed, real fascist-type threats expressed not in inflammatory words but in deeds--Yeltsin's violation of the effective Constitution, his dissolution of the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of People's Deputies, the shooting up of the House of Soviets, which cost the lives of at least 1,000 persons--where were the U.S. statesmen then? Where was our American parliament when the Russian parliament was calling on it to speak out in defense of the rights of parliament and the Constitution? As I can see, the ultranationalist and provocative rhetoric of Zhirinovskiy is playing into the hands of U.S. imperialism, providing cover for its aggressive policy. In actual fact, it is concerned by no means by the ultranationalism of Zhirinovskiy. It is intimidated by the growing patriotic movement against the collapse of the millennial Russian state, against the selling off of Russia bit by bit to the United States and Western capital. It is declaring a "threat" the legitimate aspiration to the restoration of a renewed USSR and to the defense of Russian national interests and the human rights of the 25 million Russian people who have become stateless persons. They [as published] are beating the drum, trumpeting the fascist threat in Russia to justify their high-handed interference in Russia's affairs (which, in turn, is fostering ultranationalism!). They are focusing attention on Zhirinovskiy in order that, in comparison with him, Yeltsin might look "good." But it would be a mistake to underestimate both the danger of ultranationalism in Russia and the capacity of U.S. imperialism for using the provocative rhetoric of Zhirinovskiy to galvanize the myth of the "Russian threat." It should be remembered in this connection that the American people were fed the tale of the "Russian threat" for seven decades. Finally, my trip to the United States enabled me to take part in the work of the National Leadership of the Communist Party of the United States when the international solidarity of the world communist movement was being debated. An appeal signed by Gus Hall, a veteran of the Communist Party and its leader, was adopted. It said, in particular: "We are well aware that our own imperialism creates a threat to peace, social progress, and national independence throughout the world....and their appetite has grown considerably in connection with the disintegration of the Soviet Union." Hall welcomed the recent regional meetings and the international symposium, but observed that it was not the high level of communist unity at which world realities had to be met. The question of the nature and causes of the opportunism that has eaten away at certain socialist societies also is on the agenda at these meetings. There was also an appeal for the discussion at the international level of the events occurring in Russia. As it said, "We are convinced of the durability and revival of the parties that the bourgeoisie has pronounced dead."
