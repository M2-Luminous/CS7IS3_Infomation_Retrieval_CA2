They were freed overnight Wednesday after the Syrian military command in the al-Biqa' Valley threatened to arrest Hizballah militants in retaliation, the officials said. The men were seized in the Ba'labakk region after three of them were seen taking photographs outside the home of Hizballah's former secretary general Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli. Two of the men were identified as Lebanese expatriates who had returned to their home villages after long stays in the Gulf state of Qatar and the United States. Security sources said the seven could have been taken in a Hizballah sweep to investigate the kidnapping on May 21 of pro-Iranian guerrilla leader Mustafa al-Dirani who was seized from his home in a raid by Israeli commandos. Moslem fundamentalist leaders have charged that the commandos were assisted by local accomplices. Hizballah has been on alert since June 2 when Israeli warplanes killed 32 guerrilla trainees on a base near Ba'labakk. Israel hopes al-Dirani can supply vital information on missing Israeli airman Ron Arad shot down in south Lebanon in 1986.
