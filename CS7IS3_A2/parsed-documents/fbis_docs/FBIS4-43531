FBIS4-43531 "drweu118_a_94007" FBIS-WEU-94-118 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 AUSTRIA U.S. Congress Visit Denied U.S. Congress Visit Denied AU1906114994 Vienna DER STANDARD in German 18-19 Jun 94 p 7 AU1906114994 Vienna DER STANDARD German BFN [Report signed "cs": "Attacks Before the FPOe Congress"] [Text] Vienna/Linz -- Just in time before the beginning of the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] congress, with which Joerg Haider wants to take the offensive again, new accusations against the FPOe chairman were disseminated on Friday [17 June]. Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] Federal Manager Josef Cap quoted from an article in the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU which accuses Haider of contacts with a group that is classified as right-wing extremist in the FRG. U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli -- the Democratic representative from New Jersey is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and involved in human rights issues -- has warned his 434 colleagues in the House of Representatives against meeting with FPOe Chairman Joerg Haider. In a memorandum Torricelli pointed out that Haider had praised the employment policy of the Third Reich. He should "not be honored by a visit to Congress." Haider did not comment on this matter. FPOe officials are surprised that a visit to Congress is supposed to be prevented, which Haider neither intended nor had asked for. Rather, his visit to the United States next week is aimed at meeting Austrians living abroad in New York and talks with U.S. foreign policy experts about a potential Austrian membership in NATO. This goal of the FPOe is to become both the topic of the party congress and the central issue in the election campaign, FPOe Secretary General Karl-Heinz Grasser told DER STANDARD. The congress, at which Haider wants to propose one or two new deputies, should also engage "a bit in coming to terms with the past." He will mention Erwin Hirnschall's "behavior that was damaging to the party." Hirnschall had rejected Haider's offer to present his arguments in favor of EU membership during Haider's own appearances and had, instead, criticized the party line in the "Press Hour" television program.
