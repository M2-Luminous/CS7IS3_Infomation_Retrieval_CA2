The increase is to take into account the possibility of a large shortfall in tax revenue and a widening gap with the fees of private universities, ministry officials said Wednesday [9 February]. The ministry intends to apply the new fees to those who enter state universities in April 1995. The plan, if approved, would be incorporated into its budget proposal for fiscal 1994, which starts in April. The fees of state-owned universities were hiked in fiscal 1991 and 1993 by 36,000 yen each. Private universities have raised fees almost every year, with average fees for students majoring in liberal arts standing at 587,900 yen a year, those majoring in engineering at 787,900 yen and those majoring in medicine at 2,444,700 yen.
