Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky discussed various topics in the government procurement category, including the sensitive issue of using "quantitative criteria" to gauge the openness of Japan's market, a Foreign Ministry official told reporters. The official did not go into detail, except to say, "mutual understanding has been deepened." Wednesday's meeting was largely devoted to reviewing lower working-level talks that ended Tuesday, the official said. Japan understands the spirit of a U.S. agreement to restart the long-suspended framework talks is "still alive." The U.S. pledged in the May agreement to refrain from seeking "numerical targets" to assess the Japanese market. The government procurement talks comprise medical equipment and telecommunications equipment.
