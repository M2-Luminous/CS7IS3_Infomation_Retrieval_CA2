Noting that the South side has not shown any response to the North's proposals for the repatriation to the North of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, prisoners of war now under detention in South Korea, and of Kim Chi-hyon, a daughter of Kim Pyong-chu who was an unconverted prisoner, now suffering from a serious illness, the message says: This cannot be deemed a righteous behavior of the Red Cross men whose essential mission is to show noble humanitarianism by saving human beings from misfortunes and helping them. Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan who were taken prisoners by the U.S. Forces side while engaging in guerrilla activities in the South Korean area during the Korean war are obviously prisoners of war in view of the international law, and your side is obliged to send them back to our side. This notwithstanding, your side is dealing with their issue according to the "National Security Law" of South Korea which is now being denounced by the international community. This is, indeed, a wrong act of interpreting and applying the international law in a self-centred way. Moreover, your side is behaving as if it were interested in humanitarian issues, while disregarding the question of repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, a more urgent matter than the problem of separated families. This is an extremely improper act. Failing to manifest any intention to give medical assistance to Kim Chi-hyon now in a critical condition, your side turned down our offer to fetch and treat her here. This cannot be construed otherwise than an attitude of neglecting the duty and mission of the Red Cross men. The Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society sincerely advises your organization not to follow the South side's authorities who pursue North-South confrontation but to remain faithful to its duty as a Red Cross organization.
