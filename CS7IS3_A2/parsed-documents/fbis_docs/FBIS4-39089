This document was adopted by CSCE member states in 1990, and France is its depositary. The Kirghiz president emphasised that the Paris Charter is based on principles of maintaining stability and security in the world, and triumph of democracy and human rights, the main values, which must help human civilization make progress, so that in the XXI century mankind does not have to know war, sufferings and dangers which we are encountering now. "I signed this document with a clear conscience, as we in Kirghizia affirm the same ideas of personal freedom, political and economic liberties, priority to protection of rights, interests and dignity of mankind," he said. Asker Akayev especially noted France's important contribution to the development of European partnership, establishment of contacts between the West and the East, its role in preparing and signing the final document of the CSCE Treaty signed in Europe and the Paris Charter for a New Europe. Having signed the Paris Charter for a New Europe, France has become a full-fldged member of the vast international community," President Francois Mitterrand said at the signing ceremony. This document marks the end of the "cold war" and division of the world into two confronting military blocs, and, thus, has opened `new times' in relations between states, he emphasised. The two heads of state signed a treaty of understanding, friendship and cooperation between Kirghizia and France, as well as a number of other bilateral agreements on the develoment of cooperation in political, economic and cultural fields. Asker Akayev noted that Kirghizia attaches great importance to these documents, because "French foreign policy has always distinguished itself by its well-foundedness, wisdom and insight." Francois Mitterrand's recent visit to Central Asian republics bears a striking testimony to this fact, he said. According to the Kirghiz president, this was a call to leading powers of the world to see to it that Central Asian countries developed as democratic, secular and civilized states. "I am convinced that only this path can lead to progress and prosperity of Central Asian states," Asker Akayev said.
