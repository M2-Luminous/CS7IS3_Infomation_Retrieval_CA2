FR941006-1-00023 FR941006-1-00007 C. Impact on the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this proposed rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. D. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this proposed rule, and in so doing certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Because this proposed rule changes the way in which the data is transmitted to HUD, and all costs associated with implementation of the electronic transmission will be considered allowable project operating costs, the proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact. E. Regulatory Agenda This proposed rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and therefore was submitted to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives under section 7(o) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act. F. Catalog The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance numbers for the programs covered by this proposed rules are 14.850, 14.855, 14.856, and 14.857.
