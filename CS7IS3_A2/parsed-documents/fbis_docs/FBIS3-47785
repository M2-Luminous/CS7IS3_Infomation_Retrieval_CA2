The commander of the UN Protection Force in Macedonia suggested to a Japanese delegation last week that Japan could dispatch SDF personnel to the region to serve as unarmed military observers. The mission, which left Japan on January 7 and returned January 17, investigated possible areas for an expanded Japanese contribution to the international peacekeeping efforts under way in the former Yugoslavia. Takemura told a news conference that mission head Shunji Yanai reported that the commander told him "in a general manner of speaking" that "it would be good if he could have (personnel) dispatched from Japan." Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's foreign policy bureau, reportedly did not immediately respond to the request. Takemura said he had instructed Yanai to "respond with discretion so as not to cause misunderstanding." Yasushi Akashi, the Japanese national who heads UN peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia, also asked the mission to send personnel to the UN mission in the region. Yanai said Akashi did not specify whether he sought military or civilian personnel.
