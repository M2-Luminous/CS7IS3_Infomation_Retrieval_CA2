Lack of political will showed itself in poor allocations of finances to these agencies and a legal cover riddled with [word indistinct] and loopholes that gape so wide that entire battalions of offenders slip through them. A glaring legal omission being the jurisdiction of speedy law court does not cover FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas]--hot spots for drug production and trafficking. The accumulative effect of the lopsided political will and a Swiss cheese legal set-up reflects in poor follow-up of registered cases, lower seizures, and a social climate that offers no resistance to narco money. Given the fact that around two-thirds of the heroin produced in Pakistan is consumed within the country and that the number of drug addicts is on the rise, reduced seizures do not mean that production or trafficking of narcotics has been curtailed--as some members of the Narcotics Control Division would have the public believe. From 2,900 kilograms (kg) of heroin seized in 1992, the figure has fallen to 2,179 kgs in 1993. And when compared to 5,677 kgs of heroin seized in 1991, the quantity seized has more than halved. Number of cases registered have also fallen sharply--from 23,494 in 1992 to a mere 10,296 in 1993. Quantity of opium seized has also fallen by around 1000 kg. In 1992, 3,422 kgs of opium were seized, but the figure slid down to 2,421 kgs in 1993, and from 2,850 cases registered the number was reduced to 1,448 in 1993. In the case of the charas, the quantity seized reduced from 188,123 kgs in 1992 to 138,097 kgs in 1993. While the number of cases registered in 1993 were 9,618 as compared to the 20,847 case registered in 1993. Successive governments tried to prove their commitment towards eradicating the drug menace by making all sorts of speeches. However, no-one worked to develop an effective legal framework to effectively check this menace. The caretaker government of Moin Qureshi, promulgated an Ordinance, whereby the death penalty would be awarded to the drug offenders: namely the Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Ordinance, 1993 whereby the assets of an accused awarded punishment lesser than life imprisonment are also liable to forfeiture. The law against narcotics offences relating to trafficking provided for maximum punishment of life imprisonment. The government has decided to amend the law in order to award death sentence for the drug traffickers or financing the trafficking of narcotics or offences relating to import or export of drugs from Pakistan and inter-provinces. Narcotics offences are mainly dealt with under the following laws: The Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930; The Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979; The Customs Act, 1969; The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1989 (Act V of 1898); The Police Act, 1861; The Opium Act, 1957; The Opium Act, 1878; and The Anti-Narcotics Task Force Ordinance (XII of 1993). There are 14 [as published] agencies on Federal and provincial level that are involved in the enforcement of the above-mentioned laws. Apart from the provincial police departments, provincial Excise Departments and the Frontier Constabulary of NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] all other law-enforcing agencies come under the ambit of the Federal Government. The services of the defence forces can also be utilised for the purposes whenever the Federal Government decides. Given the fact that there is such a large number of varied agencies involved and seven different laws to deal with narcotics offences. It is not a wonder that a complete confusion prevails. An offence registered under the Hadd cannot be punishable by death penalty and an injunction of the speedy courts is not applicable to the federally and provincially administered tribal areas; while different laws apply to the carrier and to the offender who finances the trafficking. Lack of efficient coordination between the various government agencies involved, the [word indistinct] inherent in partial application of the laws, coupled with the fact that money and political pressure can delay/change/erase the cases is used by the offenders to their maximum advantage. Also the Narcotics Control Board cannot spend the kind of money the offenders use while fighting legal cases against them. In one case, while the Ministry used around Rs [rupees] 3 lakh, the offenders spent a hefty Rs 33 lakh--and went scot-free. Not only are the agencies short of manpower but the personnel is also not provided with adequate personal security to deal with dangerous offenders. While the agencies are unable to coordinate their actions, the drug barons are equipped with the advanced electronic gadgets for surfeiting the movement of the agencies. The law-enforcing agencies have failed to control the smuggling of acetic anhydride, the chemical used in making heroin. Previously, it was imported in abnormal quantity but after its import was restricted, it started being smuggled in from India. Recently a group of Rangers was booked for smuggling the chemical from India. In a bid to give a modicum of sanity to the to the mess, the President and the Prime Minister [PM] have asked for recommendations to formulate a national drug policy which contains a comprehensive legal package. It is stated to be a long-term policy. The PM's camp wants to make it a consensus legislation which would fetch them points both at home and abroad. To restrict the inflow of drugs in their country the United States of America made clear its dissatisfaction regarding the performance of the local anti-narcotics agencies a few years back and announced the funding of a special tasks force. The Ordinance for the force was repeatedly promulgated and a number of officers from the services other than those involved in drug combat were selected, but the force could not take off. However, according to sources, the Americans reduced their funding and in the second half of last year, the Army was asked to take over the proposed organisation. A serving general is now heading the force, which is still to commence active operations. Unless anti-drug operations are supported by the political will of the rulers, not much headway can be expected in combating this menace. There needs to be social uprising against the narco barons and their influence in political, bureaucratic and professional bodies must be exposed. Otherwise we will enter the 21st century drugged out of our senses.
