[passage omitted] [Begin Paek speech] [passage omitted] Kang Sok-sung, member of the WPK Central Committee and director of the Party History Institute, will deliver a report. [applause] [passage omitted] [Begin Kang speech] [passage omitted] Our party and the government of the Republic have made every effort to achieve the fatherland's reunification based on the principle of national independence in conformity with all the people's desire and the demand of the times. However, our generous [aryang innun] proposals for the fatherland's reunification and all the people's aspiration for the reunification have not been realized because of the U.S. and South Korean authorities' splittist line and war maneuver. The U.S. imperialists are adhering to the military adventure to crush [apsalhagi wihan kunsajok mohom] our socialist cause, stirring up the anti-Republic pressure commotion in the international arena over our nuclear problem. Obsessed with war frenzy [chonjaeng kwangjunge hwanjangi toen], the Kim Yong-sam group is going to resume the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise by bringing U.S. nuclear war equipment such as Patriot missiles into South Korea, mentioning strong-arm countermeasure against us in collusion with outside forces. It is also openly promoting [kochwi] a war mood for northward invasion while talking about assuming a prompt dashing-in posture in the event of an emergency [yusasi chukkak torip taese]. The U.S. imperialists and their followers are frantically running wild to isolate and suffocate our Republic and to crush [apsal] our socialism over the nuclear issue. Any pressure or threat, however, cannot work with us. They cannot resolve the issue by adhering to such a method, and this only drives the situation towards catastrophe [sataerul pagugero molgogalsu issumnida]. The United States and the South Korean authorities should behave discreetly, facing all facts squarely. [passage omitted]
