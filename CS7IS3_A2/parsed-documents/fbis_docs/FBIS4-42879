The Germans have become skeptical since reunification and the British have always been so. The Danes said "no" to Maastricht on one occasion; in France, Europe just made it in the referendum. However, with just two weeks to go to the Strasbourg European Parliament elections, Europe fans have at least one consolation. The turnout will be particularly high. Eight out of 10 people eligible to vote said that they would "definitely" go to the polls; a further 15 percent said that it would be "very" likely or "quite probable." Only 5 percent do not want to vote at all; even in England, the number of people who do not want to vote only accounts for 6 percent of the electorate. What is the motivation of those radicals who do not want to vote? Almost a quarter of them across Europe said that the "election is unimportant" or "my vote does not count." Almost every fifth of those who are reluctant to vote do not know what is at stake. Essentially, what one should assume is that the future of European integration is at stake. Should one proceed along the Maastricht path, should one do so more slowly, or should one just go back? This indicates a high degree of skepticism about Europe. In all 12 EU countries, 40 percent of those polled still say that they would like "less" integration. Half of those polled want "more," but there are some unexpected differences among individual member states. The figure for Britain is not surprising: Over 60 percent opt for "less integration." Of course, the Germans, who were once so favorably disposed toward integration, have now become "British": Six out of 10 of those polled want "less" of a community, while those who are in favor of integration have fallen to about a third. The Germans and the Anglo-Saxons are in one boat -- that is the biggest surprise to come out of the poll conducted by SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG and six other European partner newspapers during the second half of May. The leading Europhiles are the Italians, closely followed by the Spaniards and the Dutch. Even the "Gaullist" French exceed the Germans in their support for integration. Another way of measuring the support for integration is offered by questions on the powers of the European Parliament and the EU Commission. Do these supranational institutions have too much or too little power? If someone says "too little," then it can be assumed that he wants a stronger European state. In this respect, the European Parliament fares slightly worse than the community as such. Exactly half of the European electorate wants "more integration," but only 46 percent believe that the European Parliament has too few powers. Does it have too much power? That is the view -- this could have been foreseen -- held by the British (58 percent), but also by the Irish (43 percent), and the Greeks (37 percent). The percentages for these countries are similar with respect to the question of whether the EU Commission has too much power. The EC Commission has always seen itself as the engine behind integration. Of course, it cannot draw too much strength from the poll, because the European public is undecided: The camps that say the commission has too much or too little power are of about the same strength (about 30 percent). In short, the poll does not provide much ammunition for those who want a faster rate of progress on the way to a "closer" Europe. The picture is clearer with regard to expansion -- there are significant differences between the various groups of candidates for admission. Put bluntly: "Those who are like us can come in, but we are not so sure about those who have a different political and economic tradition." Almost four-fifths of the 12-member community welcome the admission of Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Switzerland whereas not even 10 percent oppose that. That indicates a clear "yes" to expansion. The picture is more complicated in the case of the Central European applicants Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. Only half of those polled want to have them in the European Union [EU] and a third oppose their membership. With an approval rating of 60 percent, the Germans are above the EU average, but they are still significantly behind the Italians, who have turned out to be the East Europeans' best friends. What about the issue of a European currency? The answer is on the one hand yes and on the other hand no. Half believe there will be a currency union composed of at least three currencies by the year 2000 and the other half does not want to believe that. Only the British stand out in this respect. Two-thirds believe -- or, to be more precise, fear -- that they could be confronted with a European currency in the next few years. In a very indirect way, the poll sought to gauge the basic political climate in Europe, the question being "who trusts whom?" The results confirm a well-known picture: The French and the Germans trust each other the most. The French and the Germans trust the English, followed by the Italians, the least. However, cracks are appearing in the Franco-German marriage. Almost just as many French (17 percent) mistrust the Germans as trust them (20 percent). However, the Germans do not consider the French to be formidable opponents: Only a tiny number mistrust the former "archenemy." Are the Europeans prepared to do more about the Balkans other than talks and reason? The clear answer is: "no." Not even a fifth of those polled support aerial bombardments; exactly 16 percent support the deployment of ground troops. The German picture corresponds precisely to the European one. The conclusion is that there are only European majorities on two issues. Almost everyone wants to go to vote and about 80 percent support the expansion of the EU to include the Scandinavian and neutral states. The question of Europe's future -- should we continue along the path leading to the united states of Europe? -- remains open: Exactly half say "yes," 40 percent want a looser union, and the rest do not know what they want.
