Zlenko, who arrived on a one-day visit to Slovakia today at the invitation of Slovak Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik, stresses the need to conclude the agreements on investment protection and the prevention of double taxation between the Ukraine and Slovakia. "The Ukraine attaches great importance to the establishment of economic and trade relations with the Slovak Republic," he says. Zlenko warns against ethnic and nationalist separatism which represents a problem for Slovakia also. He said Slovak-Ukrainian cooperation could help neutralise these phenomena, strengthen mutual relations and ensure stability in the region. Zlenko says that the Crimea conflict should be solved by legal means in harmony with the Constitution. The efforts of the Crimean Republic at broader cooperation with the Commonwealth of the Independent States (CIS) are determined by political, economic and historic circumstances. "The Crimea is an integral part of the Ukraine and, therefore, Ukrainian laws are valid there," Zlenko says. He spoke in favour of a security system open also to those countries which do not belong to the security structures of the North Atlantic Alliance or the CIS. Currently there exist no security guarantees for these states and their own strengths are not sufficient to stand up to any "pressure of external forces," Zlenko said. "The Ukraine is a European state," said Zlenko, pointing to the Ukraine's striving to joint European political, financial and "other" structures. "The Ukraine has declared that it will be a state without nuclear weapons in the future," Zlenko said, adding that that was a choice of a "certain form" of neutrality from any military blocs.
