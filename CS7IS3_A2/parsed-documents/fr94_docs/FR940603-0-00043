FR940603-0-00043 FR940603-0-00018 3. Compliance Advisory Panel Section 507(e) requires the State to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) that must include two members selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the State legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. The State has met this requirement by establishing a CAP which includes these appointments. The enabling legislation also outlines general policies and procedures for administering the CAP. As of April 1, 1994, five of the seven CAP appointments had been made. All CAP appointments will be completed by June 1994, but no later than November 1, 1994. In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP, the Act delineates four responsibilities of the Panel: (1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree and severity of enforcement actions; (2) to periodically report to the EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act; 2 (3) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and (4) to develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. The State has met these requirements by requiring the CAP to meet these responsibilities. In addition, the AQSBAP and the SBCAO staff will provide support to the CAP in its efforts to carry out these responsibilities. 2 Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP to report on the compliance of the SBAP with these three Federal statutes. However, since State agencies are not required to comply with them, EPA believes that the State PROGRAM must merely require the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering to the general principles of these Federal statutes. 4. Eligibility Section 507(c)(1) of the Act defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that: (A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; (B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; (C) Is not a major stationary source; (D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and (E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. Michigan's Small Business Clean Air Assistance Act similarly defines the term ``small business,'' and expands criterion (C) to include major stationary sources which are major because of their location in a nonattainment area. To avoid discouraging businesses from seeking assistance, Michigan intends to use a flexible definition of small business when implementing the program. The type of service and the amount of resources necessary to carry out the service will dictate whether a broad or narrow eligibility definition is used. This is consistent with section 507(c)(2) of the Act. The State of Michigan has provided for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that both do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants and do not meet the eligibility provisions of sections 507(c)(1) (C), (D), and (E) of the Act. In response to such a petition by a stationary source, the Director of the MDNR may define a source as a ``small business.'' This is consistent with section 507(c)(2) of the Act. The State of Michigan has provided for exclusion from the ``small business'' definition for any category or subcategory of sources that the State determines to have sufficient technical and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the Act. The Director of the MDNR may exclude such sources after consultation with the EPA and the Small Business Administration and after providing notice and opportunity for public hearing. This provision is consistent with section 507(c)(3). III. Final Rulemaking Michigan has submitted a SIP revision implementing each of the required PROGRAM elements required by section 507 of the Act. The PROGRAM will be fully implemented by November 15, 1994. Because the EPA considers this final rule noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it today without prior proposal. This rule will become effective on August 2, 1994. However, if we receive notice by July 5, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse comments, then the EPA will publish: (1) A notice that withdraws the action, and (2) a notice that begins a new rulemaking by proposing the action and establishing a comment period. This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators). A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. Under the revised tables this action remains classified as a Table 2. On January 6, 1989 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on the EPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing, or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), the EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;
