My Good People!' -- As Far As We Know, the Applause Was Actually Booing"] [Text] In connection with mass-media allegations about the presence of Mr. Virgil Magureanu, director of the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI] in Targu Jiu -- some of which are purely tendentious and slanderous -- the SRI Press Bureau is authorized to release the following: 1. The SRI director's presence in Targu Jiu on the afternoon of 18 February was exclusively linked to the activity of the respective SRI county branch in 1993. There is no political connotation to the meeting between the SRI director and Mr. Miron Cosma [leader of the Mining Trade Union Confederation of Romania]. The purpose of the meeting, which took place at the SRI headquarters in Targu Jiu at the latter's express request, was to brief our institution on the actual situation in the field. 2. The SRI director's gesture of addressing himself to the crowd of miners gathered in front of the Lignitul [Brown Coal] Public Corporation headquarters in the town -- which many considered "spectacular" -- was solely motivated by the desire to diffuse the still explosive state of spirit prevalent among many of the miners there and to assure them that the relevant institutions will be given a correct briefing on the situation. 3. Consequently, we can see no justification to the allegations about an so-called intervention in a labor conflict or to those implying that one thus stood to gain some political advantage to the detriment of others. No promises were made aside from passing the correct information to the relevant state authorities. To back our position, we herewith publish the text of the speech made by the SRI director on that occasion: "My good people, "I did not come here to earn some cheap popularity points. Please listen to me, rather than applaud. "Therefore, I beg you to listen to what I have to say, rather than applaud me, since, with all your problems here, one hardly feels the need for applause. "Second, the last thing this country needs is for people to die and fight. This country needs honest work and the defense of all rights, primarily yours. "There is no need for you to fight or die to defend your leader. Nobody is threatening him. "We took note of the fact that there are many irregularities pointed out by your delegation. "We also know that a miners' delegation is now in Bucharest explaining the situation to the people there. "I assure you that I will report what I saw and heard here to the appropriate authorities, up to the highest level. "It is never to late to do justice, if this is what the people want. "Nobody stands to gain anything if they are trying to obtain by force what they can very well obtain through legal means. "You have sent your leaders to talk to us and to all those with a say in resolving the situation. Now, you must be patient for two or three days. "One needs these few days of respite, if we are to establish the guilt and responsibility of various people. Nothing can be done overnight." The SRI Press Bureau can make the video recording of the speech available to any interested party. The SRI Press Bureau.
