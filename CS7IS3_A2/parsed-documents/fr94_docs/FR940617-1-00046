FR940617-1-00046 FR940617-1-00012 Data on the safety and effectiveness of alcohol formulated in an emolliented vehicle for use as a surgical hand scrub, health-care personnel handwash, and hand degermer were submitted to the Miscellaneous External Panel (Refs. 2 and 3). However, the data were not reviewed or categorized for these uses during that rulemaking. In reviewing alcohol for short-term uses, that Panel stated, ``ethyl alcohol acts relatively quickly to decrease the number of micro-organisms on the skin surface. Each minute that scrubbed hands and arms were immersed in approximately 77 percent ethyl alcohol by volume was found to be equivalent to 6.5 minutes of scrubbing in water; if the skin was scrubbed with the alcohol, the rate was further increased'' (47 FR 22324 at 22328). The Panel found ethyl alcohol safe and effective for use as a topical antimicrobial preparation in concentrations of 60 to 95 percent by volume in an aqueous solution. The following indications were proposed: (1) ``For first aid use to decrease germs in minor cuts and scrapes.'' (2) ``To decrease germs on the skin prior to removing a splinter or other foreign object.'' (3) ``For preparation of the skin prior to an injection.'' (See the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC alcohol drug products for topical antimicrobial use, in the Federal Register of May 21, 1982, 47 FR 22324.) The submissions (Refs. 1 and 2) included effectiveness data and labeling for a currently marketed product containing 62 percent ethyl alcohol formulated in an emolliented vehicle and dispensed as a foam used ``*␣*␣* to degerm hands *␣*␣*.'' The agency has reviewed these data, derived from effectiveness testing as a surgical hand scrub (glove juice test) and health-care personnel handwash, and finds that they meet the procedures in the testing guidelines in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1242). Statistical analyses showed microbial reduction to be highly significant. A glove juice test showed that alcohol foam reduced the baseline number of bacteria present in normal skin flora, after first use, by 1.87 logs, and, after continued use for 5 days, by 2.36 logs. The reduction of the baseline number of bacteria was maintained for up to 6 hours under surgical gloves. A health-care personnel handwash effectiveness test showed microbial reduction on test subjects' hands, artificially contaminated with Serratia marcescens ( S. marcescens ). Microbial reduction averaged 3.3 logs after 5 treatments and 3.63 logs after 25 treatments. In vitro data, derived from studies using S. marcescens as the test bacteria, showed that alcohol properly formulated in an emolliented vehicle and dispensed as a foam, significantly reduced the number of test bacteria, in 10 percent serum, within 15 seconds. Based on these data and the conclusions of the Miscellaneous External Panel (47 FR 22324), the agency concludes that alcohol, when properly formulated, is effective for use as a surgical hand scrub and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash. Because it is well established that alcohol alone does not provide persistence, the agency notes that a preservative agent in the vehicle provided the persistent effect to maintain reduction in the baseline number of bacteria for 6 hours as required to demonstrate efficacy as a surgical hand scrub drug product. The agency is including alcohol in proposed §333.410(a) (antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash), §333.412(a) (patient preoperative skin preparation), and §333.414(a) (surgical hand scrub), as follows: ``Alcohol 60 to 95 percent by volume in an aqueous solution denatured according to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms regulations in 27 CFR part 20.'' Further, the agency finds the Miscellaneous External Panel's proposed Category I indication for OTC alcohol drug products, i.e., ``for preparation of the skin prior to an injection'' to be an appropriate indication for patient preoperative skin preparation drug products. Based on that Panel's recommendations, the agency is including this indication as an additional claim for alcohol drug products in §333.460(b)(2) of the proposed monograph. In addition, based on that Panel's similar recommendations for isopropyl alcohol (47 FR 22324 at 22329 and 22332), the agency is proposing this indication for OTC isopropyl alcohol drug products in §333.460(b)(3). As discussed in section I.N., comment 28, the agency is proposing new effectiveness criteria for drug products labeled for this use. The monograph will also state that an alcohol drug product must be properly formulated, such as the product in an emolliented vehicle dispensed as a foam discussed above, to meet the test requirements in §333.470. This means that alcohol when intended for certain uses must be able to demonstrate effectiveness by certain tests proposed in this tentative final monograph, as follows: (1) Antiseptic or health-care personnel handwash_§333.470(b)(2), (2) patient preoperative skin preparation_§333.470(b) (3), and (3) surgical hand scrub_§333.470(b)(1). As discussed in section I.B., comment 5, the term ``antiseptic handwash'' in lieu of ``hand degermer'' is being proposed in the monograph as the statement of identity for this type of product.
