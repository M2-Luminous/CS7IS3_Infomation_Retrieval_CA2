The U.S. Justice Department said that Ames and his wife were arrested on Monday during a joint operation conducted by the CIA and the FBI. According to the information of the Justice Department, the Ames had been spying against the United States since 1985 and had received more than $1.5 million for that, which they deposited in bank accounts in the United States and abroad. Yuriy Kobaladze, head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service press office, whom an ITAR-TASS correspondent contacted by telephone this morning, declined to comment on the case of the arrest of the U.S. couple accused of spying for Russia. However, he remarked that "this question should be put, rather, to the CIA." At the same time it seems that there's no point in blowing up a political scandal out of this episode. After all, even in a changing world, intelligence remains intelligence with the specific means and interests that are peculiar to it. Incidentally, the leadership of the United States and other Western countries have confirmed on several occasions that they have no intention of curtailing intelligence activity against Russia.
