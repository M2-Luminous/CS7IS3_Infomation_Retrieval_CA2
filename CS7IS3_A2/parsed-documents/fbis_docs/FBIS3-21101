It is destined to characterize the company of the year 2000. It is not the first time that this image has been used to define what Olivetti has been doing. It was first used when Olivetti moved from mechanics (typewriters and traditional calculators, older people will remember the mythical Divisumma) to electronics. It was used for the second time when Carlo De Benedetti was making his greatest stand and the company made its dynamic entry into computer science. And the third? "It has just started," they explain at Ivrea. So much so that it has not taken on a definitive form yet. But the road is open. And it is the road of multimedia, that is the road to an ever closer integration of computer science and telecommunications. It is easy to talk. In reality it is a sort of 180-degree turn, that involves the same company culture, but that is quite difficult to explain. The Olivetti management has tried to do so on various occasions. For example when they decided to participate in the race to become the second administrator of the Italian cellular telephone network, and more recently when they launched the "Domus Life" line onto the Italian market. This is a personal computer that can receive television transmissions, read audio and video CD-ROM disks, and connect up with other users to exchange video games. It can even reproduce the background music for "karaoke," the musical entertainment of the moment. Ivrea is concentrating a lot of effort on this product. According to the French newspaper LE FIGARO, there will be a market for about 1.3 million of these machines in Europe in 1996 when families throughout Europe will own a total of 19 million personal computers. Olivetti hopes to sell 200,000 over the next two years. But this turn in the direction of the new business is not excluding others. In fact Olivetti will continue to build and sell its traditional products, although this will be done within a different organizational framework. The sectors have been merged and subdivided in a new way to facilitate the application of the new strategies. The Olivetti group is divided into four large areas: products (personal computers, printers, office equipment, and accessories); systems (complete information packages, for example the networks used by banks and the post office administration); services (maintenance, engineering and customer assistance also for products produced by competitors); finally, telecommunications and multimedia systems, with the Omnitel consortium for cellular telephones which is 51-percent controlled by Olivetti and which also includes the companies Bell Atlantic, Swedish Telecom, and Shearson Lehman for the financial part. Many things are brewing, and the company is not keeping these projects tucked away in a drawer. On the contrary the draft agreement signed with the unions on Monday, 17 January, on cuts in production, discussed them at length. At least 20 of the 38 pages making up the document, which was signed by the minister of labor, are dedicated to prospects and industrial strategies. Olivetti intends making a new start based on its refound "social peace". This peace has come at the end of a long period of cuts in the work force; the group had 60,000 employees throughout the world in 1989 and less than 37,000 remain today. But the streamlining, together with all the other interventions (financial, industrial and organizational), has been insufficient to put the accounts of the holding company back into the black. This is understandable in the light of the dramatic situation of a year ago. The losses registered on the balance sheet for the 1992 financial year totaled more than 650 billion lire. The same company sources recognize that in effect, if it had not been for the reserves and the other extraordinary accounts that have been utilized, the losses would have totaled more than 800 billion lire. Furthermore, for the second consecutive year there has been a fall in revenues, with consolidated sales confined to eight trillion lire. These are serious difficulties that reflect the serious situation the computer science sector is still experiencing throughout the world. Carlo De Benedetti has returned to manage Olivetti himself and has recently called Corrado Passera to his side as managing director. Together they have planned out a therapy for recovery that has these three goals: 1) to start to grow again, 2) to reinforce the financial position, 3) to balance the accounts. This is all to be achieved in the relatively short period of not more than two years. Half of this time has already passed and perhaps the schedule needs to be updated, particularly as far as the income statement is concerned. In fact the partial balance is only positive as far as the first two aspects are concerned. Revenues have started to rise again, and a few days ago the first unofficial figures showed that at the end of 1993 consolidated sales had reached 8.6 trillion, an increase of 7.5 percent. According to the men from Ivrea, market quotas have been regained in Europe, particularly in personal computers (also thanks to the enrichment of the range of products, passing from one to four lines) and, most important of all, the volume of sales has increased enough to compensate for the drop in prices. Then the devaluation of the lira has certainly helped as far as revenues expressed in foreign currency are concerned. The second goal, the financial one, has also been achieved. Not that the situation was particularly difficult a year ago. The relationship between debts and assets could have been taken as balanced. But it was necessary to put "hay in the barn," also in consideration of the burden that was to come from future cuts in the work force. Therefore, overcoming the skepticism of many of his collaborators, De Benedetti launched an increase in capital of 900 billion lire. An operation that the stock exchange easily digested and that allowed Olivetti to reinforce itself on this front too. The third goal remains, that of achieving a balance. Here the news is not so good. Without doubt there will be an improvement resulting from the initiatives that ended during the year, such as the dismissal of nonstrategic activities (from Teknecomp to the Triumph Adler buildings in Germany). However, the losses for 1993 will still be high. Analysts estimate that the losses will be between 400 and 500 billion lire. So it is unlikely that the forecasts made two years ago will be met. The 1994 financial year is all that remains to find budgetary equilibrium again and objectively this is not long enough. In any case, they have not lost hope in Ivrea, and they are working to get as close as possible to this result. What instruments are they using? At Olivetti they explain: "We must increase the supply and then we must arrive on the market more quickly. The average life of a product is six months today. Furthermore, all the efforts are aimed at widening the offer. This year we will produce 40 new personal computers and 50 are planned for next year." But multimedia is the real challenge. "The marriage between computer science and telecommunications is the real business of the future. This is what the life of a group like ours depends on." This is the third revolution. Will De Benedetti and his team be able to happily lead the way to this haven?
