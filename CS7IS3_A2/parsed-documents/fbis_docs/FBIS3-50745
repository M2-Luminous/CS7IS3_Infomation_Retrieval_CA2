On its flank, the market base has expanded. In 1990, 300,000 units per year were being sold, while the figure today easily exceeds 600,000. And this sector faces an increasingly clearly defined concentration with a limited number of brands. Only seven of the 17 brands on the market account for 70 percent of the sales. In recent days, the 18th brand has been added, and it seems certain to claim the lead for itself. Philco, the reigning champion in the television and car-stereo sectors, has now ventured into the refrigeration field. It has purchased 30 percent of Helametal, which produces the Peabody refrigerators. But the people at Philco hasten to explain that it is not a question of absorbing the firm, but rather of adding to their holdings. To speak the truth, the most serious operation took place some months ago within Philco itself, when the head of the Argentine Industrial Union (UIA), Jorge Blanco Villegas, bought 37 percent of the company's stock from the Plata Commercial Company (Soldati). This package, added to the shares controlled by his sister Silvia, gave him control of the stock. Silvia Blanco Villegas is the majority stockholder in Inversora Antartica [Antarctic Investments], a company that is affiliated with the SOCMA (Francisco Macri's holding company) and is the owner of the other 37 percent of the Philco stock. The rest of the shares are in the hands of Japan's NEC. Once the president of the UIA had consolidated his control of Philco, the expansion into the refrigeration sector began. This is the sector that has traditionally located its plants in the provinces with developing industry. That is the case for Helametal itself, which in addition to a plant in Buenos Aires, has another in Catamarca. The enterprise is continuing to manufacture Peabody refrigerators. This brand has a market share of between eight and 10 percent. But it is now also producing the models with which Philco reentered the refrigeration sector after an absence of almost a quarter of a century (it had produced freezers until 1970). Six models, five of them domestic, and a more sophisticated one imported from Korea, are included. Those responsible for launching the new products are sending a kind of double message. On the one hand, they say they spent almost $3 million on the advertising campaign, as well as an amount they do not want to specify on purchasing the Helametal stock. But they will swear to anyone who will listen that they did not go into the refrigeration market to beat out the smaller or more inexperienced firms. "For us, settling our debts will suffice. At least for the time being," Fortunato Gacceta, the commercial manager of the firm, says cautiously. We asked how much had been spent on equipment. "About $400,000. The serious investments will come later." They took the competition into account. They know that Philco is a heavyweight in the so-called "brown line" (televisions and video and audio equipment). They take it for granted that when they added their refrigeration line, it was not to become one of the minor manufacturers, but to fight for the lead. CLARIN asked Daniel Sciaroni, who heads McLean, S.A. (Patrick and Saccol), if his firm was taken by surprise by Philco's action. "We expected it, but we also positioned ourselves. We invested $20 million in a new plant, in Caseros, whereby we are doubling our production. Between the plant in Caseros and that in San Luis, we will be producing 1,500 refrigerators a day within a few months." They are saying at McLean, Patrick, and Saccol that together, they have the lead in a market involving 600,000 refrigerators and 200,000 freezers per year. They say that the next most important firm is Whirlpool, the multinational North American firm that bought its refrigeration line from Philips two years ago. But they say that the entry of Philco into the market changes the game. "Philco has an industrial strategy, as we do. It produces for the domestic market, and in addition it exports some of its products. Its production will not go unnoticed," a spokesman for McLean standing behind his superior said. We asked who would be affected first. "It will surely be the smaller producers. There are 11 refrigerator brands that, taken together, account for no more than 30 percent of the market. One of these firms will surely be the first to fall."
