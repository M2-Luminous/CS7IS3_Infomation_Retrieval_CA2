A Japanese Social Party delegate said that in a meeting with a delegation led by Kubo Wataru, secretary general of Japanese Social Party, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said on 17 May that "it is possible for North Korea to take a very extreme method [kuktanjok pangbop]," and that "the Western countries should fully consider such a situation." Regarding the replacement of fuel rods at a five-megawatt reactor, which has aroused strong protest from Western countries, including the United States, Vice Foreign Minister Tang said: "North Korea seems to show a hard-line attitude, but, actually, there is room for the settlement of the nuclear issue." Accordingly, he has strongly hinted that North Korea has not yet carried out the work of replacing fuel rods at its nuclear reactor. The Japanese Social Party official said that Vice Foreign Minister Tang said China is now actively making efforts for the success of North Korean-U.S. talks. This is the first time China has openly expressed that it has played a behind the scenes role in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. Also, the Japanese Social Party official said Vice Foreign Minister Tang expressed that while President Kim Il-song was in China he said to Chinese leaders on many occasions that North Korea has no intention of developing nuclear weapons, nor does it have the funds or technology necessary, or the need to produce them. Regarding this, a Chinese high-level source said that "considering the special relationship between China and North Korea, breaking the promise made between the leaders of the two countries would not be easy," and that "the Chinese leadership believes that President Kim Il-song will keep his promise." He has also clearly expressed that China adheres to a negative position on North Korea's nuclear development.
