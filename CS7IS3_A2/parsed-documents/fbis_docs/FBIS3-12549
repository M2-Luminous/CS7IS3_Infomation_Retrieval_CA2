AL-AHRAM warns that the coming stage might witness further tension in the territories and that extremist elements on both sides will get involved. Israel must show more flexibility in handling the circumstances if it wants peace and if the region is meant to see that peace in the foreseeable future, it says. The paper calls on the Israeli Government to confront the Israeli terrorism with the same enthusiasm and firmness with which it confronts what it terms terrorist operations by Palestinians. The paper adds that the Israeli settlers' terrorism has exceeded all bounds. AL-AKHBAR says the Israeli Government will be unable to wash its hands of the blood staining them. The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre will remain a sign of disgrace that time will not erase, no matter how hard Israel tries to absolve itself of the responsibility, the paper says. It adds that the Israeli Government's insistence on refusing to disarm Jewish settlers--despite all the crimes and those that will take place--reflects how Israeli officials belittle the lives of the Palestinian people, the legitimate owners of the land. AL-AKHBAR adds that the UN Security Council is asked to send an international team to investigate this massacre, uncover its real motives and circumstances, and determine the extent of Israeli army involvement. The Council must also send international troops to protect the inhabitants of the occupied Palestinian territories to avoid a recurrence of such a heinous crime, the paper stresses.
