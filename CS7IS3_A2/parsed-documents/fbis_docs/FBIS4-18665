The remarks of the Bundesbank on the subject of price competitiveness are "inconsistent," complains the document. In its December report, the bank still spoke of a 10-percent deterioration in the competitiveness of German enterprises since the middle of 1992 vis-a-vis enterprises from 15 European countries and of difficulties for German exporters on account of the revaluation of the mark. But in its February report, the bank claimed that there were no more problems with competitiveness. The reason for the inconsistency of the Bundesbank's statements is that the bank based its calculations of exchange rate variations on different time periods. But the question remains whether the Bundesbank is merely performing a political task and attempting to prevent attacks. What is conspicuous is that the European Union Commission has also given the competitiveness of German exporters a worse assessment than the Bundesbank. In an internal report published in January, the commission underlined "a significant reduction" in Germany's competitiveness by 12 percent against the remaining European Union countries since September 1992. The Economics Ministry thinks the Bundesbank is playing down this fact. The ministry itself reckons that the revaluation of the mark has hit German exports "hard," a situation made even worse by seasonal weaknesses of trade partners. Last year (January to October 1993), German exports fell by 23 percent against the same period in 1992, a decrease of over 70 billion marks vis-a-vis the European Union countries. Vis-a-vis Italy and Spain, which had devalued their currencies, the decrease was even more than 30 percent. The latest positive developments in export figures are pleasing, but one must bear in mind the low starting position. In any case, the improved figures appear positive mainly vis-a-vis those countries where the latest currency exchange operations (devaluations vis-a-vis the dollar and yen) are considered to have played an important part. According to the ministry, there is "much to indicate" that the German export business has not yet fully digested the revaluation vis-a-vis European currencies. Therefore, the improvement to the situation will not be enough to make good the export losses. In order to contain the consequences of the revaluation, a forced devaluation strategy must be avoided at al costs. The document agrees with the Bundesbank on this last point.
