The efforts of Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his deputy Vitaliy Churkin, who tried to persuade the Serbs not to enter into confrontation with the world community and to end the siege of the city, declared a "safe area" by the United Nations, have proved to be in vain. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic have not fulfilled a single one of the promises which they lavished on Russian diplomats. And now it is too late to discover whether Belgrade deliberately misled Kozyrev and Churkin, or whether the political leadership have lost control of the Bosnian Serb troops, which now obey only General Ratko Mladic, dubbed in Russian diplomatic circles "the Serbian Makashov" [general prominent in October coup attempt]. Addressing journalists on his return from Bosnia, Vitaliy Churkin looked extremely disappointed. Never before have such hardline words against the Serbs been heard from his lips. He called on the Russian authorities to break off all contacts with the Bosnian Serbs, who, in his words, were using Moscow's intercession as a cover, and were simply stalling for time: "The Bosnian Serbs should understand that in Russia they are dealing with a great power, and not a banana republic. Russia must decide whether to allow a group of extremists to exploit the policy of a great country to achieve their goals. Our answer is unequivocal -- `Never.'" "If the Bosnian Serbs fire just one more salvo against Gorazde, a huge crisis will erupt which will plunge the Serbian people into catastrophe," Churkin warned, intimating that in the prevailing situation there can be no question of lifting international sanctions against Yugoslavia. And although on Tuesday morning Anatoliy Krasikov, leader of President Yeltsin's press service, tried to soften the impact of Churkin's words, calling his assessment "a personal view," it is hard to imagine that recent events will have no influence whatever on the policy of Russian diplomacy in the Balkans. Damage has been inflicted on the prestige not only of Churkin and Kozyrev, but on that of Yeltsin himself: The world has seen that even the Serbs -- "our historical allies and brothers in the faith" -- have disregard Moscow's opinion. Hopes for a peaceful settlement to the Bosnian crisis remain very limited. UN General Secretary Butrus-Ghali has requested that NATO use its aircraft to defend the Muslim enclaves in Bosnia, and U.S. President Bill Clinton held a conference with his advisers 19 April, examining the possibilities of a military operation against the Serbs. And although Yuliy Vorontsov, Russia's permanent representative to the United Nations, again opposed air strikes without prior consultations in the Security Council, no one supported Moscow. There is a growing conviction in the West that, now that the Bosnian Serbs have demonstrated how easily they break their commitments, it is hardly possible to bank on dialogue with them. The easing of sanctions against Belgrade, which only recently seemed entirely realistic, is postponed indefinitely: Where are the guarantees that, as soon as sanctions are lifted, the Serbian authorities will not return to their previous policy? In that case the international community would be left powerless. In order to punish Yugoslavia again, Russia's support is essential, which can practically be ruled out in view of the changes which have occurred in our political life in the past year. Contradictory reports are coming from the region of Gorazde. According to the testimony of UN and International Red Cross spokesmen, the city is "effectively taken." If news agencies are to be believed, Gorazde's death throes are continuing; the Serbs are subjecting the enclave to mass bombardment, but have not yet established control over it. If the reports that the city has not yet been taken are confirmed, in the opinion of IZVESTIYA's interlocutors in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in that case, the Serbs still have a last chance to avoid a NATO air strike and at least partially recover Moscow's trust -- by calling an immediate cease-fire and withdrawing their troops from the besieged city. If this does not happen, all the signs suggest that Russia will in no way be able to help either Radovan Karadzic or his soldiers...
