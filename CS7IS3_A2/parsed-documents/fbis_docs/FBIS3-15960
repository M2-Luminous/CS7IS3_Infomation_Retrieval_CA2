Pishchayev on interview with State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin on his return from the United States; from the "Vesti" newscast -- Rybkin remarks recorded] [Text] [Pishchayev] When State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin returned [from the United States], journalists wanted to know first of all how the United States had reacted to former President Nixon's meetings in Moscow with the opposition in Russia. [Rybkin] We met President Clinton and Vice President Gore straight after this and did not notice any particular reaction. [Pishchayev] Noting Yeltsin's refusal to meet Nixon, we asked if Ivan Rybkin was planning to see this guest during his unofficial visit from across the ocean. [Rybkin] There is a reception at the embassy this evening in connection with Nixon's visit and Mr. Pickering, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, has invited me. But at 1800 there is a meeting of the Duma council and it will be awkward for me to leave. Perhaps one of my deputies will go. [Pishchayev] On the subject of the results of his U.S. visit, Ivan Rybkin said he had brought back with him a package of agreements on cooperation in different fields between Russia and the United States. As for our being allocated additional financial aid: [Rybkin] No one can help us more than we ourselves. The main thing is that we are not prevented from working to the maximum of our abilities. This is what we talked about, about the fact that, deliberate or not, there are hindrances from the U.S. side. [Pishchayev] He also said that the recent Ames scandal -- the Russian spy couple within the CIA -- had been discussed during his visit. The Duma speaker said certain changes could be noticed in the U.S. attitude to this problem. He added: [Rybkin] I am fed up with the fuss over these spies whose loyalties, whose ideology, so to speak, is not clear. When I was asked about this, I said: You have some very old people in your country, you could probably find a 90-year-old who was indoctrinated by the Tsarist secret police. Would Russia have to answer for this?
