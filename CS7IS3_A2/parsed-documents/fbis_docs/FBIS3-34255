Vivekanand] [Text] Amman--An official U.S. delegation is expected to arrive here soon for further discussions on Jordan's proposal to move sea-based searches of cargo to the port of al-'Aqabah, informed sources said Friday [4 February]. They said the team would hold talks with senior officials on the mechanism and modalities of the proposed land-based inspections and report back to the Clinton administration, which has yet to take a policy decision on the issue. The proposal was tabled during His Majesty King Husayn's visit to Washington in the third and fourth weeks of last month. Officials said the initial U.S. response was positive. The plan calls for Lloyds Register of London to set up a base at al-'Aqabah to inspect all incoming and outgoing cargo for violations of the international sanctions against Iraq. Until now, the inspections were conducted by U.S.-led warships patrolling the Red Sea, causing severe economic losses for Jordan, whose own imports are subject to the costly delays and higher freight charges levied by shipowners. According to the sources, Lloyds Register representatives visited Washington last week to discuss the proposal in detail with administration officials. Comments from U.S. naval officials in the Gulf indicated that the proposal was being circulated in U.S. military circles. "It would be a step down for us," said Lieutenant-Commander Bruce Cole, spokesman for the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command headquartered in Bahrain. "We might leave one ship there for spot checking in the early stages." The U.S. Navy usually maintains three ships in the Red Sea, focusing their attention on the Tiran Straits, the gateway to the Gulf of Aqaba. Other members of the international coalition which contributed forces to fighting Iraq out of Kuwait in early 1991 take part in the inspections on rotation. The inspection forces, which took up place in August 1990 immediately after the U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions against Iraq, have so far intercepted 19,350 ships, the bulk of them in the Red Sea. Of these, 8,450 were actually boarded and inspected by American or coalition naval officers and 440 were denied total entry. According to the sources, the next step after the American mission's visit to Jordan would be formulating a final mechanism to be in place at al-'Aqabah and recommending it to the U.N. Sanctions Committee. Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali, who addressed the committee in New York on Jan. 27, has said, without specifically mentioning the proposal for land-based inspections, that he found the committee members willing to address Jordan's concerns. According to Cmdr. Cole, the proposal also includes punitive measures against vessels found trying to violate the sanctions against Iraq. "The (shipping of cargo) insurance would be forfeited if a ship is found to be in violation of the U.N. sanctions," instead of the diversions to nearby ports that was the maximum, penalty faced by ships boarded and inspected at the Tiran Straits, Cmdr. Cole said. Shipping sources do not expect the new system to take effect in less than six months. It is also not clear who will bear the cost of Lloyds Register inspections. However, the sources said, if worse comes to worst, Jordanian importers would pay the cost if only because that will be much cheaper for them than continuing to pay the extra $500 per 20-feet container and $15 per-tonne freight that they pay for al-'Aqabah-bound cargo. "The total amount that will be paid to Lloyds will be less than 10 per cent of the overall Jordanian loss under the present conditions," said a shipping source.
