Reasons for the decline are: 1. Grain output declined in 1993, and the market price of grain increased. At present, the price of corn in rural markets is 1.00 yuan per kilogram, and mixed feed is 0.96 yuan per kilogram, increases of 20.5 percent and 21.5 percent respectively over the same period in 1993. The cost of raising hogs exceeds profits. 2. According to some counties, in general 30 percent of the rural labor in one county has left to find work outside Sichuan. In some counties rural households not raising hogs account for about 65 percent of total households. 3. At present the slaughter of hogs and circulation links are out of control. Careless slaughter has resulted in sales of diseased pork on the market, and the spread of epidemic disease throughout Sichuan, which severely affects the stability and development of hog output. At present the procurement price of hogs is 4.50 yuan per kilogram, and the price of hogs entering factories is 4.90 yuan per kilogram, increases of 33.9 percent and 49.4 percent over the same period in 1993. It is estimated that in the first quarter of 1994 Sichuan will procure 2,100,000 hogs, sell 800,000, and ship 1,400,000 hogs to other provinces, decreases of 15.2 percent, 18.4 percent, and 28.3 percent from the same period in 1993.
