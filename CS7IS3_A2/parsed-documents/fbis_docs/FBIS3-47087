The freighters, dubbed as Techno Super Liner (TSL), which can sail at a speed of 90 kilometers per hour with a cruising range of some 1,000 kilometers, will be completed in June and March respectively, the sources said. The two types of TSL -- a hovercraft freighter and a hydrofoil freighter -- will be capable of delivering 1,000-ton cargoes from Tokyo to the major islands of Hokkaido and Kyushu in half a day, they added. The 1,590-ton prototype of the hovercraft freighter measures 70 meters by 18 meters. This is half the size of the projected freighter to be commissioned in the mid or late 1990s, they said. The 30-ton prototype of the hydrofoil freighter measures 17 meters by 6 meters. This is one-sixth of the size of the projected freighter, to be commissioned around the same time. The sources characterize the TSL as a cargo shinkansen bullet line that runs through the sea. More than 10 prefectures, including Hokkaido, Aomori and Kagoshima, have already asked the ministry to designate them as major ports of call for the TSL. The hovercraft freighter will be tested in Tokyo Bay immediately after its completion in late June. It is now being manufactured as a joint project between the ministry, Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Co., and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., the sources said. The hydrofoil freighter, manufactured by another ministry-commissioned group of five major shipbuilders, led by Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., will be tested in Osaka Bay after its completion in late March, they said. If the project is commercialized and there is sufficient demand for the service it would give a boost to the shipping industry, as the freighters could deliver a greater volume of cargo than trucks or planes. Both freighters cost more than 15 billion yen. It is expected among industry circles that the completion of the two types of freighters might make it possible to deliver cargo from Tokyo to Asia's newly industrializing countries in a day or two, at one-tenth the cost charged by conventional container vessels.
