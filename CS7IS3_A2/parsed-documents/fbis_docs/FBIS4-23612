The talks started at the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda headquarters at the Amahoro Hotel at 0900 and ended its proceedings at 1630. The talks will resume on 13 June at 1000 in the morning. The talks are within the framework of efforts aimed at achieving a cease-fire. The Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] delegation was led by Colonel Frank Mugambage while Col. Marcel Gatsinzi led the Government Army delegation. The talks focused on the cease-fire document. But so far, the conditions set by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] have not been met by the other party to the negotiations. An example among the many others is that up to now the killings carried out by the government forces in collaboration with the Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development] continue to intensify instead of being brought to a halt which is what the RPF has demanded. There are also the propaganda programs of Radio Rwanda and Radio-Television Libre des Mille Collines which continue to incite the people to kill one another and to send them to the killing battlefields. Col. Gatsinzi, the leader of the government Army delegation, denied spreading lies on foreign radios during the meeting, an allegation made against him by the RPA delegation. He also denied disclosing the contents of the negotiations, which is also not allowed. The meeting will resume on Monday, 13 June 1994.
