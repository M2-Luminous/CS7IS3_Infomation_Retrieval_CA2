FR941116-0-00056 FR941116-0-00011 AOPL and ARCO 44 argue that the information regarding officer salaries requested on page 104, Principal General Officers, is not needed by the Commission. On further reflection, the Commission agrees, and the changes proposed to page 104 will not be adopted. 44 AOPL, pp. 18&hyph;19; ARCO, pp. 14&hyph;15. AOPL and Marathon 45 recommend that the information proposed on pages 230&hyph;231, Analysis of Federal Income & Other Taxes Deferred, and pages 108&hyph;109, Important Changes During the Year, be combined with pages 122&hyph;123, Notes to Financial Statements. AOPL also suggests that the information proposed for collection by the NOPR on pages 230&hyph;231 should be limited to present GAAP reporting requirements. The Commission does not agree. As to AOPL's suggestion that the information required on pages 230&hyph;231 be presented in accordance with GAAP reporting requirements and combined with the Notes to Financial Statements, the Commission considers the deferred tax schedule on pages 230&hyph;231 to be a necessary supporting schedule to the financial statements. Although the notes to financial statements are the appropriate place to disclose significant financial effects on a company of recently enacted income tax laws and regulatory actions, the deferred tax schedule is designed to present details, using a uniform format, on each significant item which causes a temporary difference between taxable income and pretax accounting income. This schedule, like the Form No. 6 carrier property and operating expense account schedules, permits a detailed analysis of the various charges and credits which comprise the balances of the current and noncurrent deferred income tax assets and liabilities. The latter are presented in the financial statements only as a single asset or liability balance for current and noncurrent deferred income taxes. Moreover, the information contained on pages 108&hyph;109 may not be appropriate for notes to financial statements, such as properties added or changes to franchise rights. These pages are for reporting of different types of information than changes to the financial condition of the pipeline, even though they may impact the financial condition. 45 AOPL, pp. 18&hyph;19; Marathon, p. 3. AOPL and Marathon 46 recommend that page 350, Employees and Their Compensation, be deleted. The Commission agrees, since the information as to salary expense is available in a different format elsewhere in Form No. 6. 46 AOPL, p. 19; Marathon, p. 3. Based on the comments received on the NOPR and review of the current schedules in Form No. 6, the Commission will make several changes to the annual report for oil pipelines. To simplify the Form No. 6 data, the Commission will delete information not relevant to the Commission's regulatory responsibilities under the ICA. The Commission will also modify certain Form No. 6 financial statements to a comparative format by requiring two years of data to enhance their usefulness and to conform the Form No. 6 data formats to the formats of FERC Form Nos. 1 47 and 2 48 (Form Nos. 1 and 2) for electric utilities and natural gas pipeline companies, respectively. 47 Annual Report of Major Electric Utilities, Licensees, and Others. 48 Annual Report of Natural Gas Companies. The Commission will change the format of several schedules to accommodate electronic filing and reporting requirements for Form No. 6 similar to that used for Form No. 1. When a rule adopting an electronic filing requirement is issued, electronic filing of Form No. 6 information, similar to that for Form No. 1, should reduce the reporting burden for both large and small pipelines. Financial information reported electronically should also aid the Commission in conducting reviews of the pipeline companies and the rates charged. The Commission will eliminate unneeded schedules or individual data elements, and will modify certain schedules so they will contain more useful and relevant data. A sample copy of the revised pages in Form No. 6 are attached as Appendix B.
