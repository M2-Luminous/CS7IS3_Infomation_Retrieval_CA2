The problem of ensuring a "green light" for this drive is to be resolved by the National Security Council and the Cabinet of Ministers, DIENA was told by Odisejs Kostanda, a member of Defense Commission. He also said that the commission will see to it that this prioritization is accepted at the highest level of state policy. To implement this policy, it will be necessary to introduce several changes to legislative acts, and create a material and technical basis for the fight against organized crime. The Cabinet of Ministers will have to adopt proposals to reorganize the police. Eventually, it is envisioned that a special department for fighting crime and narcotics, a prosecutor's office, and a separate court structure will be introduced. At present, Latvian law does not contain a definition of "organized crime," therefore neither the Prosecutor's Office nor the Ministry of Interior Affairs can supply precise data on results of the fight against this phenomenon. It is also difficult to estimate the true scale of organized crime, because only one quarter of all reported crimes are solved -- last year, that figure was 27.9 percent.
