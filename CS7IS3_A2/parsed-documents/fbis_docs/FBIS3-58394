The basis of the alliance is and remains the firm security link between North America and Europe. President Clinton expressly reaffirmed the further concrete presence of U.S. soldiers in Europe, and this was highlighted as being particularly important by all participants at the talks. At the same time, the alliance supports without reservation the emergence of a European identity in terms of security and defense, as stipulated in the Maastricht Treaty. The Western European Union will, in future, be able to rely on NATO resources for independent operations, and these decisions were taken in full agreement with our American partners. The central questions were the restructuring of our relations with the countries of Central, East and southeastern Europe, as well as the successor states of the Soviet Union. During the dramatic years of transition in these countries the people have looked to the West for support. We have repeatedly encouraged the reform states to introduce democracy and the market economy. That means in consequence that we have to do everything we can to support these processes. In addition, we cannot allow these people to feel that they have to live in a gray zone in terms of security. We Germans, appreciate particularly keenly the worries of our neighboring countries. For this reason we want to deepen political and military cooperation with these countries in order to build a new relationship which results in a Partnership for Peace. At the same time, this conference in Brussels has sent a clear signal that NATO is open to new members in future. The Partnership for Peace, based on practical and concrete measures, goes well beyond mere dialogue. For example, there will be joint exercises, perhaps as early as this year, as well as joint training for participation in international peace missions. A decisive element of the partnership program is the offer to engage in consultations with partners if they fear a direct threat to their territorial integrity, political independence, or security. For the German Government, invitations and programs connected with the Partnership for Peace are not diplomatic cliches but a very seriously step, a dynamic process on the way to later NATO membership. We are of course aware that, in the present situation, it is not possible to name a concrete date. We also do not want to and must not open up any new rifts in Europe. The security and stability of our continent is indivisible. This means that we want to build a close partnership, above all with Russia and Ukraine, in order to create jointly a security system for the whole of Europe. In order to create a peaceful future for Europe, it is vitally important that existing borders are not violated and the rights of minorities are protected. Therefore, the summit has welcomed unanimously the initiative of the European Union for a stability pact in Europe as an important ingredient in promoting security and stability. Yesterday we discussed very intensively the situation in Russia, and not just prior to President Clinton's visit here. The performance of extremist forces at the recent elections is a serious warning signal, not only for the Russian leadership, but for all of us. We agreed that, notwithstanding the justified concern about this development, we must not allow ourselves to be deflected from continuing to support the reform policies in Russia and also President Yeltsin's reform policies. During our talks we gave a lot of attention to the war in former Yugoslavia. A great tragedy is unwinding before our very eyes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The summit has again called on the warring parties to put an end to violence and to solve the problems at the negotiating table. This also includes the efforts made over the past few days in Bonn that unfortunately did not lead to the hoped-for breakthrough between Croatia and Bosnia. My colleague Klaus Kinkel will tell you about this when I have finished. NATO unanimously supports the peace efforts of the United Nations and the European Union. This includes the determination of NATO to enforce the UN mandate through air strikes if necessary. At the suggestion of our colleagues from Great Britain, France, and Canada, following the talks yesterday evening, the following urgent requests to the United Nations have been incorporated in the summit communique: Firstly, the urgent work and plans required to secure the replacement of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] contingent in Srebrenica provided by Canada to date, and secondly, to examine how Tuzla airport can be opened for humanitarian relief operations. Furthermore, I would like to point out that with regard to other subjects, NATO has reaffirmed its readiness to support the international peace missions of the United Nations and the CSCE. A new element here is the offer to European non-NATO members to take part in such missions; I will cite Sweden and Finland here. Secondly, NATO intends to adapt and change its leadership structures so that it can greatly improve its expanded cooperation with the Western European Union and its support for international missions. Thirdly, NATO is increasing its political and defense efforts against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I would like to stress, in particular, that this two-day meeting in Brussels has shown me how much NATO as a whole and the European Union complement each other in their efforts to help safeguard peace and freedom and bring about security and stability in Europe. Over to my colleague, Herr Kinkel.
