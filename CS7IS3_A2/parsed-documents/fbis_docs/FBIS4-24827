As a mountainous province, Guizhou is rich in hydropower and coal resources. It now has a generating capacity of more than 2.8 million kw. Xiang Dehong, director of the electricity bureau of the province, said that more than ten power projects with a total generating capacity of 5.63 million kw will be constructed from 1995 to the end of this century. As its neighboring east Chinese provinces suffer power shortages, the province aims to jointly build power stations and plants with these provinces and supply more electrical power to them. At present, several such projects are under construction and two power transmission lines to Guangdong Province have been completed and another one is being built. A transmission line to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is also under construction. As the power industry develops, the electricity-consuming mining and metallurgy industries are becoming the mainstays of the province's economy.
