According to an official of the International Department of the People's Bank of China, ADB loans to China this year are expected to top 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, about the same as last year. The 140-million-dollar loan will have a maturity term of 25 years and carry an interest rate of 6.7 percent. It will mainly be used to build gas facilities in Chengde and Tangshan, two cities in north China's Hubei Province which have long been plagued by air pollution caused by burning coal instead of gas. Since China obtained ADB membership in 1986, it has received a total of 3 billion U.S. dollars' worth of loans from the organization, most of which have gone to projects in infrastructure construction, environmental protection and programs to relieve dire poverty.
