Aleksandr Sterligov, the leader of the opposition Russian National Assembly, and Sazhi Umalatova, chairperson of the so-called permanent presidium of the USSR Congress of People's Deputies, had mentioned the possibility of nominating Ryzhkov for presidency in their public addresses. Ryzhkov told Interfax that Sterligov and Umalatova expressed their personal views when they spoke of him as a man who could rally all opposition forces for the forthcoming presidential elections. He admitted that numerous people think that he might be helpful in consolidating society to an extent. Ryzhkov assumed that his name was mentioned because people were tired of radicalism in any form, from Yegor Gaydar's shock therapy to Zhirinovsky's promises. Ryzhkov said that he had never shared extreme views but stayed somewhat left of the center. He did not believe the opposition-spread rumors that Boris Yeltsin intended to call pre-term presidential elections next fall or to extend his and the Federal Assembly's terms. Ryzhkov, 64, was the USSR's prime minister in 1985-90. Now he heads the Moscow Intellectual and Business Club and chairs the board of the Tveruniversalbank.
