Antonio Ledezma, second vice president of the Senate, said he learned about the statements made by the U.S. representative through the national media. In this regard, he pointed out that it is in poor taste for the U.S. Congress to criticize its government for purchasing the black liquid since the United States has been purchasing Venezuelan oil for many years, even when modern technology did not exist. [Begin recording] [Ledezma] Our gasoline is a good product, as tests and experts confirm. It contains less toxic elements, even less than the percentage that will permitted in 1995 and 1997. [Unidentified reporter] What do you believe is behind this attitude of the U.S. Congress? [Ledezma] It is not an attitude of the U.S. Congress. On behalf of Venezuela and on behalf of the Venezuelan Congress, I am going to condemn the statements made by this congresswoman, Representative Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, who has said that our oil is dirty. [end recording] Finally, Senator Antonio Ledezma announced that the Senate will approve additional credit to help the Government of the Federal District face the current hospital crisis.
