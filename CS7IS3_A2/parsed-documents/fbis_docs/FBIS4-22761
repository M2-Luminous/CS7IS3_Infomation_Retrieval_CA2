Like its American progenitor, this plant had a root system on which potato tubers grew, whereas the surface part was graced with tomatoes. I do not remember the name of this selective breeder, but I know for sure that the hybrid he produced was called the PUKS or, if the abbreviation were to be expanded, "Path to Socialism." Of course, you have guessed that this is about the notorious "Chonkin" by the venomous writer Voynovich. Due to well-known causes and events, our people gave up the PUKS after August 1991. We are now producing a new hybrid, likewise unknown to science, which is officially called "Path to Capitalism," PUKK in short (of course, with two k's at the end). All of us, from the president to the common kitchen maid, are producing PUKK willy-nilly. Although no one knows what the underground-surface part of this hybrid will look like, everyone has already managed to fully partake of its fruit. It may very well be that, due to our doing everything the other way around, the tomatoes will end up in the underground segment while tubers will ripen amid rustling tops. Yegor Timurovich Gaydar may be rightfully called the main selective breeder of the Russian PUKK. Despite the entire fantastic nature of the project, PUKK has turned out to be a tenacious hybrid. Despite Gaydar having been removed from his favorite agronomic experimentation for a second time now to the sound of gun salvos in front of the White House, his PUKK has managed to strike root in the very thick of the Russian economy, regardless of who is in charge of the selective breeding effort at present. They say that this is a sick economy. They frequently liken it to a precipice which we need to jump across no matter what. We would have jumped across with our characteristic enthusiasm, but for three things accompanying PUKK that are getting in the way: inflation, the nonpayments crisis, and a universal recession in industry. Mass unemployment promises to be the fourth evil. The government swears on a daily basis that it is fighting these misfortunes that are threatening to blow up our society in every way possible. By all signs, the evil would have been vanquished had it not been for the agrarians and miners taking turns at being bothersome. The most intelligent and learned people, from G. Yavlinskiy to B. Kurkova and Granny Vanga from Bulgaria, propose fast-acting prescriptions for fighting inflation. The discontented segment of the population (members and candidates for the underclass) associate the three evils plaguing the Russian economy with PUKK and Gaydar. We must acknowledge at this point that in this instance, intuition does not fail our public. All kinds of abusive words have been hurled at Yegor Timurovich in recent years! "Lab chief" is the gentlest of the swear words. Meanwhile, Gaydar smiles coolly. He feels superiority over the crowd of ignoramuses. None of them has understood and appreciated the titanic feats accomplished in two years by the father of the Russian PUKK. At best, our irritated philistine has noticed a commercial stand opposite his house and begun to patronize it on a regular basis in order to buy Dutch sausage, Greek oranges, a jar of Brazilian coffee, or a bottle of Royale at any time without standing in line. As long as you have money, purchasing the erstwhile goods in short supply is now everyone's privilege. It appears that everything is just fine now as far as Greek oranges are concerned. Now let us try to figure out the things that are not at all in plain view but are hidden, like tomatoes, in the underground segment of the present-day political economy. Those who brand the Gaydar team with infamy for being incapable of creative actions in the economic sphere are making a big mistake (or perhaps are not being entirely truthful). Nonetheless, the blood-curdling cries of conservatives who would like to take the country back to PUKS are still being heard. Their charges sound trivial: "They have dragged the economy into a global crisis, but do not know themselves how to get out of it." Comrade conservatives, you are in error! Gaydar knows everything. The reform has not failed, as we are being persistently told at present; it is rather being successfully completed. The endeavor on which Yegor embarked two years ago has already been accomplished in the rough. The building has been erected; what remains is to take down the scaffolding and start finishing the building. In all of that, you, the credulous philistines, have been intimidated for over two years in every way possible with horrendous shock treatment. However, we have done without physicians. This was merely a feint. Highly professional butcher-surgeons from the International Monetary Fund performed the surgery with precision: We did not even manage to shriek. The postoperative pain made itself known when 9.5 out of 10 Russians found out that the big, tasty-smelling pie of state property has been virtually carved up, and none of them personally was in any danger of tasting that delicacy. The ideological anesthetic wore off later, and then the opened-up society sensed the smell of PUKK: The once united Soviet people ended up divided into poor and rich. In the process, a narrow stratum of chosen ones ended up in the sun of a capitalist paradise on the other side of the precipice, while the rest--sovietized creatures, that is, the superfluous, unnecessary, and for this reason dangerous elements of society--are still awaiting the miraculous leap across the precipice which was promised by the prophets of 1991. Miners, collective farmers (under whose feet the ground is literally giving way at present because it will be taken away at any minute) ended up among the sovietized creatures, or the superfluous ones. Retirees, the military (with the exception of the loyal elite), workers of the military-industrial complex, and the working intelligentsia also ended up as such. Therefore, the surgeons have done their job without publicizing the results. The rest was up to ideologists, those who console and distract. They are trying hard, especially on TV. The main point is to be persistent, to tirelessly drum into your souls and minds a few magic formulas on a daily basis. You never sweated previously, but if they recommend to you a patented deodorant day in and day out, you will wake up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night on some occasion and, to the sound of music playing in your sick head, utter: "Khlavin Cosmetics, Israel, Ben Gurion Boulevard." With the same importunate inevitability, specialists in political advertisements will impress upon you, gentlemen, former Soviet and currently superfluous people, that you have not lost all that much by acquiring PUKK. After all, the completely illusory guarantees of the old Brezhnev-Soviet Constitution were taken away--such as the right to low-paid labor and second-grade recreation on a trade union voucher, and unskilled medical services. What else was there? Oh, yes: the prospect of being given the "Labor Veteran" medal and a free "Khrushchevian slum" with a view of the belching smokestacks of a plant before one retired. In addition, it was demonstrated to the superfluous people on TV, on 4 October of last year, that the state which had previously protected them from thieves will now protect the peace and comfort of the new elite from them, from the Sovietized creatures whom nobody has any use for. They are now impressing on all the superfluous people that the difficulties they are experiencing are temporary in nature. The brainwashing department that has now replaced the agitation and propaganda arm of the CPSU Central Committee gently induces us to think that inflation is the main enemy (next to the Reds-and-Brownshirts) at this stage in history. If we overcome this perfidious evil, the Russian people will live no worse than the British in their vaunted Lemonia (as is known, this geographic discovery was made by Vasiliy Aksenov). However, how is inflation to be overcome, along with the other evils of the period of transition? The segment of society on whose backs the chosen ones have gotten across to the other, promised side of the precipice live with this burden on their minds at present. Prescriptions for the struggle have already matured in many brilliant revolutionary minds. As far as the miners are concerned, they are prepared to act straightforwardly. These guys know how to get to the top of their "game" in a cavalier manner. Were they not the ones to yell in 1989 louder than anyone else: Give us PUKK, and down with the commies? Now they are also yelling: "Gaydar is gone, down with Chernomyrdin and the president to boot! Since the war, 40 governments have changed in Italy, but now they gorge themselves on spaghetti with Uncle Ben's sauce every day. We will keep toppling prime ministers and presidents until such time as we elect those who know how to cancel inflation, corruption, and nonpayments by a single decree." To the sound of such inflammatory rhetoric, a certain well-known gentleman who is counted among the fascists is already walking about and stroking his gilded belly. If we disregard emotions, it would be worthwhile to think hard: Yegor is, of course, a "lab chief" and the "Mephisto of the Russian economic reform." But how did he manage to produce a budget that patched so many gaping holes literally with nothing, literally out of thin air, without being distracted for a second from his principal objective? This is where we learn Gaydar's main secret. The Russian PUKK which he has reared and cherished has three sources and three components, as Marxists said at one time. You will be very surprised, but these are inflation, the nonpayments crisis, and a paralysis of the state industrial system. While our liberals and conservatives fought the ills of the economy at get-togethers and on the pages of the press, Yegor Timurovich knew for sure that the treasury was empty, that he would not be given credit from overseas, and that his path toward the market, i.e. capitalism, could become yet another utopia under the real conditions of Russia--the existence of a monolithic community of directors and labor collectives which guarded so-called all-people's assets like the apple of their eye--unless the mechanism of antieconomics operated to counterbalance these forces. Yegor Timurovich was not an indecisive tearful Bolshevik, one of those who are scared by the forthcoming difficulties. Very soon the entire industry of Russia was on its last legs due to inflation and the universal plague into which the nonpayments crisis had turned. There were no orders. Working capital and credit ran out. There was nothing to pay wages with. This turned out to be enough for the directors, the erstwhile sworn enemies of the elements of the market, to turn into the most faithful allies. It was not without their assistance and the interested consent of labor collectives that universal privatization was completed within mere months. The once prosperous standard-bearers of Soviet industry were auctioned off at scrap prices. The predominant group thought that they had become masters: After all, they struck an advantageous deal and got control of half the plant free of charge. However, what is to be done next about these shares and about the plant, which has no orders? The new-fangled owners do not know it. Instead, this is known by the tycoons of private financial corporations, although they are in no hurry to make an appearance on stage. To some, inflation is worse then the plague. However, to Yegor Timurovich and the future owners it has become a mighty lever of Archimedes. The crisis ruined many people; but others managed to accumulate powerful capital of their own without producing anything at all. People who had access to loans, licenses, and quotas grew rich playing for the fall of the exchange rate of the ruble against the dollar. Drawing on inflation and other companion phenomena, the father of the Russian PUKK conducted the historical process of primary accumulation of capital in Russia in two years. Mother Europe needed hundreds of years to accomplish this. To be sure, Gaydar's adversaries have one argument against PUKK which is irrefutable in a way. They say that, first, Gaydar abandoned regulation in the economy, relying only on the elements, and second, neglected a program for social protection of the dispossessed. The opponents are in error yet again in this instance. Prices, and even the entire economy, were regulated by the printing press. I believe that Yegor Timurovich was secretly rubbing his hands with glee in all this: His provider, inflation relieved the government of many of its past debts and obligations: Payments happened to be made with another kind of rubles. In the process, Gaydar said publicly: "Guys, I had nothing to do with it. You were the ones to demand that the delayed wages be paid, you demanded new bonuses; so as a result you got an inflationary cycle not planned by the government." Now about the social protection program. Who said that Gaydar has forgotten the poor, the impoverished, and the indigent, retirees, and war veterans? Indeed, inflation swallows our money. However, it is a veritable boon to the socially unprotected strata of the population. After all, it is precisely through inflation and delayed payments that Gaydar has taken away from some (we might say from all of us) in order to give to others (that is, once again to almost all of us). Besides, under Russian conditions cataclysmic inflation is even a humane means to implement unpopular reforms. The previous rulers reached into our wallets and passbook accounts from time to time, justifying themselves bashfully. However, as a rule, such one-time expropriation induced universal shock. Khrushchev raised meat prices (to 2.6 rubles per kilogram) just once, pointing to prices abroad. He was not forgiven for this fault of his as long as he lived. Brezhnev introduced the annual date of 1 April as a merry state holiday during which it was allowed to "temporarily" raise individual prices. He was not forgiven for that either (and not at all for his senile weakness and the golden stars), even after his death. Prime Minister Pavlov froze our savings for a few weeks once, but where is he now? Unlike all his unpopular predecessors, Yegor Timurovich created a system for continuous rather than just one-time action. Everything we have managed to receive in the form of wages, bonuses, retirement benefits, profits, and dividends is now siphoned away from us every second of every day rather than just once a year. We cannot name anyone personally as the robber. After all, it is inflation, something like Gogol's elusive nose which once abandoned the face of a St. Petersburg official and lived autonomously and independently in the surrounding space. Gaydar has left the stage, but the nose continues to cruise and circulate, sometimes surfacing in a provision of yet another edict or under the guise of an important statesman. In the process, all of us are frequently left holding our noses. In general terms, inflation now amounts to a powerful accelerator of the collapse of state property and the establishment of private property. The need for this catalyst will no longer exist when the process is completed (in 1991 we called ourselves supporters of market reforms, i.e. PUKK, almost to a man), when private owners of all plants, minerals, and land come along. Inflation will disappear, and a hard currency will appear. There will also be firm laws protecting the gains of the owners. Believe me, the long-awaited international capital will then appear on the Russian stage, too. Russia has not appreciated its great man, Yegor Gaydar. Rather than drift as the waves and currents command, he made the clumsy, heavy ship of our domestic economy sail into the wind, against hostile whirlwinds, tapping in the process the energy of the winds and whirlwinds themselves. The people on the deck are groaning and cursing. Rolling makes some sick. Some are threatening the helmsman with mutiny. However, gentleman, you are forgetting that in 1991 you were the ones to give the ultimate assignment to the captain: "Give us PUKK!" So, we are sailing to the promised country of Lemonia in keeping with it. The captain is filling the social order accurately.
