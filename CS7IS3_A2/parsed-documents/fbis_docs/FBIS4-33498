This is why not a year passes without the Islamic Republic being listed among the world's bloodthirsty and arbitrary regimes and without its being criticized on a world level. Some of the most heart-rending crimes by this regime are perpetrated against combatants who disagree with the clergymen and are opponents of the regime. During the 15 years of the regime's existence, hundreds of Iranian citizens have been thrown into the torture chambers of the Islamic Republic because of their political beliefs and have received long prison terms, while thousands have received the death penalty. Here we do not intend to refer to all these crimes and to the inhuman acts that have become ordinary in the dungeons of the Islamic Republic. These crimes have been revealed on many occasions. Revelations have been made of heart-rending acts such as the mass murder of political prisoners, extortion, depriving them of the right to a lawyer, summary trials, rape of girls before their execution, dozens of kinds of psychological and physical tortures, and leaving the world uninformed of the situation of the political prisoners and so on by presenting no documentary proof. Actually very few are unaware that all types of crimes have been perpetrated in clerical Iran against political prisoners. Thus, in this article we intend to only list the duties that the families and relatives of the political prisoners, our country's masses, opposition parties and organizations, and world humanitarian groups and organizations have toward these political prisoners. If we accept the fact that the struggle against dictatorship and strangulation is a holy mission--and we do--and if we believe in the fact that the Islamic Republic is the full-fledged enemy of human rights and freedoms and the strangler of these rights and freedoms--and we do--both we, those who live in Iran and face the bullying and arbitrariness of the clerical regime, and the humanitarian circles and organizations and, in general, progressive humanity, the human values and criteria of which the Islamic Republic is ridiculing, we will have certain duties to perform as far as the political prisoners in Iran are concerned. We would first like to list the duties of the families and relatives of the political prisoners. We know that for some time now the clerical regime has wanted to pretend that there is no such thing as a political prisoner in Iran and that the combatants who are under arrest have been cast into prison on charges of ordinary crimes. For this reason, the relatives and families of the political prisoners should use every possible means to contact opposition organizations and to give them any information that they have on their dear imprisoned ones such as their name, age, educational background, profession, political activities and stands, the date and place of their arrest, and whatever they know about their trial. They should try to hand over the necessary information and documents on their imprisoned relative to representatives of the Human Rights Commission and Amnesty International when they visit Iran. If possible, they should make their voices heard by the foreign mass media and by those humanitarian organizations and groups that are ready to reveal the crimes perpetrated by the Iranian rulers. Many of these duties do not concern only the families and relatives of the political prisoners. Each and every respectable and sensitive person should consider himself a next-of-kin of the political prisoners and to consider it his duty to inform the people and political forces of Iran, as well as the world, of the situation the imprisoned freedom-lovers are in. The duty that our country's masses have in relation with this is even heavier. While revealing these crimes and giving the necessary information to the competent circles, they should also be active in another field. They should become a backbone and a mouthpiece for those families who are facing numerous psychological and material problems because their daughter, son, or the head of the family has been arrested. The more the masses sympathize with the families of the political prisoners and strive to remove their problems, the more they will be resisting the executioners and the prouder they will defend their demands which are the demands of the majority of the people in our country as well. A political prisoner should feel that if he has welcomed torture and death for the sake of fulfilling the demands and the freedoms of the people of the country, the people too are appreciative, and they are not indifferent toward their families and their sacrifices. More important yet, our compatriots should organize protest movements related to the political prisoners and demand that the regime end their behind-the-scene trials, publish the number of political prisoners and a report on the true situation of the prisoners, allow political prisoners to meet with their families and relatives on a regular basis, provide suitable health and food facilities, and allow them access to radios and newspapers, and the books that they wish to read. All the staged acts that the Islamic Republic of Iran is carrying out in connection with the political prisoners should be neutralized, and especially when representatives of organizations defending human rights come to Iran to assess the situation of human rights, our compatriots should try to organize antiregime protests and to inform these representatives of the dire situation that the political prisoners in Iran are facing. Iran's political forces that are engaged in a struggle against the regime should inform world public opinion of all the documents and information that they acquire through their members and supporters and through the people of our country in connection with the political prisoners. Many of these forces have some sort of propaganda means such as radio stations, newspapers, and so on. Therefore, while publishing such information and documentation, they should pay more attention to directing and encouraging the masses of our country and to further informing them of the duties that they have toward the political prisoners. During the past few years, all the antiregime forces have strived to inform the world abroad of the situation of the political prisoners in Iran. Undoubtedly, if there is more cooperation and coordination among the opposition organizations and personalities and if a common plan is laid out, their efforts and the activities in this field will be more widely reflected and there will be more solidarity than is seen on the global level today. Until now, Amnesty International, the Middle East Watch, the Human Rights Commission, the UN General Assembly, and many other world pro-human rights groups and organizations have revealed the unprecedented crimes that the Islamic Republic of Iran has perpetrated and is perpetrating against the political prisoners. But the repeated condemnation of the Islamic Republic by these organizations and groups has not put an end to the massacre of political prisoners in Iran or, at least, helped to bring about a major development in relation to them. One of the reasons for this is that the governments of the world have not attached great importance to the views and stands of pro-human rights organizations on the Islamic Republic and, ignoring the antipopular nature of this regime, they have continued their political-economic relations and cooperation with the Islamic Republic. It is by taking these facts into consideration that pro-human rights organizations and all sources, forces, and personalities who consider their struggle against the massacre of freedom-seekers in Iran to be their humanitarian duty should mobilize world public opinion and place governments under pressure to stop transactions and cooperation with the Islamic Republic, and to isolate this regime in the world on charges of fighting against freedom and crushing freedom-lovers. We hope that everyone will help to serve the political prisoners of Iran.
