The agreement was signed after talks between Azeri Defense Minister Mamed Mamedrafi, Armenian Defense Minister Serzhik Sarkisyan and Samvel Babayan, the military leader of Nagorno- Karabakh. Under the agreement, that was mediated by Russia, Azeri and Armenian forces will stop firing at midnight (2000 GMT) on May 25 and begin a withdrawal, thus forming an exclusion zone. The agreement calls for the warring sides to pull back to form an exclusion zone some five to 10 kilometers wide within which 49 observation posts can be established. The three officials, along with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, agreed to start posting observers in the region on May 24. Peacekeeping forces from the Commonwealth of Independent States - the bulk of them 1,800 Russians - will also be sent to the area of conflict. In principle, Armenian forces will then start pulling out of most of the Azeri territory they occupied in a series of sweeping offensives last year. The agreement is to be presented to Russian President Boris Yeltsin this week for his approval, ITAR-TASS reported. Nagorno-Karabakh, an autonomous region within Azerbaijan, is populated largely by Armenians. The war for control of the region is the most protracted ethnic conflict in the former Soviet Union. A senior Azerbaijani official disclosed on Saturday that an estimated 20,000 Azerbaijanis have been killed and a further 50,000 maimed since a separatist movement was launched in 1988, which led to the declaration of an independent republic in the region in September 1991.
