Jovanovic gave the interview when he made a brief stop in Budapest during his travels. In answer to a question, he said the peace and security of the Balkan peninsula should be created, but not to the detriment of the Serbs. When asked whether the democratization process of Serbia, which the international community expects from the settlement of the South Slav crisis, has begun or not, Jovanovic said: "The process of democratization is well advanced in Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia, that is Serbia, is the only country in Eastern Europe which has held three parliamentary elections. If the declaration of the people's wish is the chief standard of a society's democratic character, then in our case there are no grounds for such verdicts, whereby the democratization of Yugoslavia is insufficient." As regards his evaluation of Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's recent visit to Belgrade, Jovanovic said: "It is a particularly welcome fact that Jeszenszky's Belgrade visit was held in the spirit of mutual confidence. We believe that this implies the beginning of a process, which will result in the intensification of mutual confidence, political relations and the various cooperation forms."
