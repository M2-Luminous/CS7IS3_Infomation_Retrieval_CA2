A ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE reporter interviewed Dong Shukui on this. Dong Shukui is deputy director of the Foreign-Related Taxation Department of the State Administration of Taxation and is visiting Hong Kong. Dong Shukui said: At present, detailed rules for collecting land value-added tax are being formulated in earnest and they will certainly be published this year. Dong Shukui pointed out: Detailed rules for collecting the land value-added tax will soon be promulgated. They may be promulgated in the first half of this year and their promulgation will probably not be delayed until the end of the year. The detailed rules will certainly give full consideration to the issues which real estate investors are concerned about. It is known that collection of land value-added tax will only begin after the promulgation of detailed rules for collecting land value-added tax. Vice Construction Minister Li Zhendong disclosed not long ago that detailed rules for collecting land value-added tax tentatively state that no land value-added tax should be levied on real estate projects whose contracts were officially signed before 1 January 1994, and all real estate projects whose profits do not exceed 20 percent of the cost should also be exempted from land value-added tax. Land value-added tax should be levied on real estate development projects investing in ordinary residential housing and other low-profit housing only if profits exceed 40 percent of costs. Li Zhendong also said that detailed rules for collecting land value-added tax would be promulgated in the near future.
