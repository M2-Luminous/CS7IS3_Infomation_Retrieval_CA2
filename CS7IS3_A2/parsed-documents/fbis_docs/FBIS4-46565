After completing the Tula Mechanical Institute in 1950, he worked at the Central Scientific-Research Institute of Precision Machine Building (city of Podolsk in Moscow Oblast). He was named the chief, and chief designer, of the Design Bureau of Instrument Building (KBP) in the city of Tula in 1962. He has been General Designer since 1983. A number of weapons prototypes that have entered service with the ground, air and naval forces were developed at the KBP under the scientific supervision of Arkadiy Georgiyevich, and with his direct participation. The principal ones are the Fagot, Konkurs and Metis antitank systems, the Kastet, Shepena, Bastion and Refleks tank guided weapons systems, weapons systems for the BMP-2, BMP-3 and BMD-2 infantry fighting and assault vehicles, the Krasnopol guided artillery weapons systems, the Tunguska and Kortik automatic aircraft cannons and the GSh-30, GSh-30-1 and GSh-6-30 automatic cannons. Arkadiy Georgiyevich has been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor for his great contribution to the creation of domestic weapons. He has been awarded four orders of the USSR, and has received the titles of Laureate of the Lenin and State prizes. Arkadiy Georgiyevich is a doctor of technical sciences and a professor; he was elected a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1984, and a full member in 1991. [VPK] Arkadiy Georgiyevich, the design bureau that you head develops weaponry for the ground forces, PVO [air-defense] troops and air and naval forces. How do you evaluate the level of that weaponry? [Shipunov] I would like to preface my answer with a small introduction. A re-organization of the Design Bureau for Instrument Building [KBP] was carried out in 1958-62, and its specialization--antitank missiles--was defined. That narrow specialization, in my opinion, limits the creative opportunities of the design collective. I have thus tried since the very beginning of my work at the KBP to expand the spectrum of armaments being developed, which fosters competition that provides an impetus for the developers and forces them to seek out better engineering ideas. This makes it possible to have high scientific, engineering and technological levels. The areas of tank guided and air-defense weapons, armaments for infantry fighting vehicles (BMPs) and guided artillery shells and systems have thus been appearing gradually at the KBP. An "old" area--automatic cannons--has also been restored. It should be noted, in recalling the past, that the turn to missile technology was the correct one, but exaggerations started immediately, as usual. Many of the artillery KBPs were shut down, and the scientific, design and engineering personnel were sent off to other work. Four or five years passed, however, and it became clear that an army cannot exist without artillery. The artillery areas were "restored" by decrees and the corresponding orders, but the personnel had been lost and the collectives had dissipated. It is easy to destroy scientific collectives, but difficult to create them. The artillery personnel were able to be retained at our design bureau. Much credit for that belongs to Vasiliy Petrovich Gryazev, who was the most major designer in the world of automatic weapons. The deliberate and inadvertant destruction of the country's military-industrial complex (VPK) is also underway today. It will be impossible to restore the VPK if we pass a certain point in its destruction. And if there is no VPK, there will not be a modern army in Russia either. Several stages in the development of the armaments being created by the KBP can be delineated. The first is the creation of a standardized family of guided weaponry for tanks, antitank weaponry and BMPs.

There are as yet no missiles in the armies of other countries that are guided by laser beam. The high level of standardization ensures the relatively low cost of production of the guided missiles. The second development stage is the set of weaponry for the BMP-3. The work has proceeded with some difficulty, since changes in the tactics for waging battles were required therein. The new type of BMP can operate as an independent entity without tanks and artillery, since the 100mm gun with relatively low ballistics fulfills the role of close-support artillery, the 30mm cannon and machineguns together with the assault force perform the role of the classical BMP, and the guided missile launched through the cannon barrel is a guided weapons system. The BMP-3, combining the qualities of artillery, tanks and BMPs, thereby satisfies the requirements for mobile operations and, consequently, those of the newly created mobile forces, to the greatest extent. To this should be added the fact that the combat vehicle should possess certain qualities of command-and-control vehicles, so as to reduce the percentage of purely supporting military hardware in a group of forces. This is very important for the VDV [airborne assault forces] and for the mobile forces as a whole. Comparative testing was conducted in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of infantry fighting vehicles from all the developer countries. The BMP-3 was the winner. A major contract has been signed with the UAE. The third area is the creation of close-support air-defense systems for the ground and naval forces. It is completely obvious that these systems should be created according to an ideology that is different from that of medium- and long-range air-defense systems. The intention has arisen at the KBP, for the first time in the world, to create autonomous air-defense systems that would combine surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery with target acquisition and control equipment. Ten years ago, in the face of colossal opposition from extremely influential individuals, the Tunguska system was created; it was highly regarded by specialists from foreign countries, including the United States. The Tunguska system was developed both in the direction of its own intrinsic improvement, and for its employment in various branches of the armed forces. The Kortik air-defense system, for instance, was created on the basis of it for the Navy. The fourth development area at the KBP is automatic cannons. These are part of air-defense systems, and are in service with the Air Forces. Our 23mm and 30mm automatic cannons, including the twin- and six-barrel GSh-6-23 and GSh-6-30 cannons, have been installed in domestic combat aircraft. I would like to note, taking advantage of the situation, the invaluable assistance that was been rendered to me and our design bureau in the creation of new types of weaponry by GRAU Chief Marshal of Artillery P.N. Kuleshov, Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces Marshal of the Soviet Union V.I. Petrov and artillery commander Marshal of Artillery V.M. Mikhalkin, as well as the military scientists from the NIU [Scientific-Research Directorate] of the Ministry of Defense.

[Shipunov] The development of weaponry, as is well known, depends on views on the waging of war. A tilt has occurred today toward the waging of war with the use of conventional weaponry and the widespread use of mobile forces. The problem of arming the mobile forces arises therein. The ideology of arming the mobile forces, in my opinion, should be founded on the choice of a uniform and light mobile base. The weaponry itself should be relatively light, and not require additional supply trains for ammunition. This could be achieved via the widespread incorporation of high-precision weaponry. The range of types of combat vehicles should be cut back at the same time, not by means of directives but rather because they can perform a larger number of various firepower tasks. In mobile troop units it is necessary to use technical solutions to reduce to a minimum the number of support units; that is, a large percentage of the equipment should consist of weapons systems. [VPK] What is the status of your enterprise today? What are you doing to ensure its viability? [Shipunov] We are currently living badly, since we remain a state enterprise, but the state has virtually no concern for our existence. We do not know what our prospects are for the near future, we do not know what our financing will be. We are living under conditions of uncertainty.

Credits for conversion are given only to the manufacturing plants. What has been accumulated at our enterprises has never existed, since the rules that prevailed before did not permit it. Now we are being forced take the capitalist road in the absence of the initial accumulation. Again a "decree on conversion from socialism to capitalism." Orders from the Ministry of Defense of Russia are providing only 30 percent of the level required by the KBP today. Scientific research has effectively halted, and experimental design is based on past work. The amount of scientific research should be 30-40 percent of experimental design, but that is in all of the developed countries; here it is in single-digit percentages. Orders from the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation should be increased to 40-45 percent of enterprise capacity in order to preserve our KBP, its field and its work in progress. At a lower level, it is to the firm's disadvantage to maintain specialized laboratories and testing and auxiliary services. We are thus looking for new customers. We have signed a contract with the Ministry of Internal Affairs. A biocenter is being built at the KBP and medical apparatus is being developed, in particular based on the CO[.sub]2[/] laser. The design bureau has designed top-notch prototypes of excellent sewing machines that are in no way inferior to Japanese models. We are also trying to obtain credits for the creation of large-series production. [VPK] What difficulties are being encountered by the KBP in gaining access to the international market? [Shipunov] This is a complex issue. We do not yet have a law pertaining to intellectual property. The developer thus receives a very small portion from the producer and seller of a weapon in the international market. It is quite difficult to make money from the weapons trade in general, anyway. The system for selling weapons today is too cumbersome and slow. It should be simplified. The protection of the interests of the state in the sale of weaponry should be dome through an annually renewable list of models that are permitted for sale, and a determination of the list of nations where the sale of those models is prohibited. The list should be authorization for the owner of a good to conclude contracts, which should be concluded in the name of the enterprise. We are ready to bring existing governmental structures in first and foremost as intermediaries, to find buyers and conclude contracts on terms advantageous to the enterprise. The last three or four years of inaction have led to sharp cutbacks in the markets for the sale of weaponry. The design bureau is also limited in the sale of licenses, since there are a host of obstacles everywhere, and science itself is in a grievous state. It is generally known that a series-produced weapon does not pose any particular secrets. What still exists in the heads of the scientists, engineers and designers must be preserved. We would be investors and buyers ourselves if we were not being held back. We have prepared a large program with China for the performance of joint development. The assistance of the government is required for its realization. The KBP is taking active part in international exhibitions. We showed the Tunguska ZPRK [air-defense missile system] at the Mosaeroshow-92 exhibition. Many models were presented at the exhibition in Abu Dhabi. [VPK] What can you say with regard to conversion? [Shipunov] Our country has a wealth of experience in the pursuit of the conversion of military industry--first after the end of the war, and then during the times of N.S. Khrushchev. The conversion was well planned by the state in both instances. The process of conversion took three or four years and had an enormous economic impact, while there were no drops in production, price rises or worsening of the standard of living of the population. The planned pursuit of conversion is needed today as well. There could be difficulties at individual enterprises, but not in all of industry. There should be clarity in relation to military orders, mobilization capacity and sources of financing for military industry, including through the sale of arms, an orientation toward the product ranges and volume of the output of civilian products, and the organization of cooperation in the output of consumer goods.
