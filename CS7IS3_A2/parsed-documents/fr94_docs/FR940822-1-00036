FR940822-1-00036 FR940822-1-00006 The proposed rule would also require that the licensee reduce any residual radioactivity to as close to indistinguishable from background as reasonably achievable. ALARA considerations are to include all significant risks to humans and the environment resulting from the decommissioning process, and licensees are to demonstrate why further reductions below the limit are not reasonably achievable. Depending on the site-specific ALARA analysis, any dose level less than or equal to 15 mrem/y may be considered ALARA. However, in many situations, licensees who have little or no site contamination should be able to readily achieve a dose level well below the limit. The NRC will provide guidance as to how such licensees can demonstrate compliance with ยง20.1404(a)(ii) without having to perform sophisticated analyses to demonstrate that residual radioactivity levels at their sites are ALARA. This should substantially reduce the administrative burden on licensees who have little or no site contamination (e.g., licensees that use only sealed sources or short lived radioisotopes). There are approximately 17,000 NRC and Agreement State licensees, many of which are small businesses, that are expected to benefit from this guidance without any compromise to public health and safety. The Commission recognizes that demonstrating that radionuclide levels at a site are indistinguishable from background is a complex task involving sophisticated sampling, measuring, and statistical analysis techniques. The difficulty of the task can vary substantially depending on a number of factors including the radionuclide in question, the background level for that and other radionuclides at the site, and the temporal and spatial variations in background radiation at the site. Therefore, in order to assist the licensee in making these determinations, the Commission will publish specific guidance on acceptable methods which can be used by the licensee to demonstrate that the concentrations of specific isotopes at the site are indistinguishable from background. The Commission will also publish guidance on acceptable methods for estimating annual TEDE to the average member of the Critical Group. This guidance will include a discussion of the type of scenarios and exposure pathways which should be considered, and computer models for estimating the annual TEDE to the average member of the critical group. The computer models will be screening models that employ generically derived conservative assumptions and factors. However, licensees will be able to substitute assumptions and factors more appropriate to a particular site if they can demonstrate that these factors and assumptions reasonably reflect the existing and projected conditions at the site. Licensees may also use other models or methods for estimating TEDE, provided they can demonstrate to the Commission that these models or methods provide reasonable estimates for the site to be decommissioned. This guidance is described in NUREG&hyph;1500 ``Working Draft Regulatory Guide on Release Criteria for Decommissioning; Staff Draft for Comment.'' The Commission requests comment on the appropriateness of the approach and the methodology described in NUREG&hyph;1500. As can be seen from Figures 7&hyph;1 through 7&hyph;11 of the GEIS, it appears reasonable to expect that a number of licensees will be able to remediate their sites to dose levels below the 15 mrem/yr limit at reasonable cost. However, these same analyses indicate that in most cases there are large incremental costs associated with reductions below 3 mrem/yr, and that the incremental costs are due primarily to the cost of demonstrating compliance rather than the cost of additional remediation. Therefore, when attempting to achieve doses below 3 mrem/y, costs can increase substantially with little or no additional reduction in risk to public health or the environment. Section 7&hyph;5 of the GEIS also indicates that levels of residual radioactivity which produces a dose of 3 mrem/yr are generally difficult to distinguish from natural background because they are comparable to local variations in background radiation and substantially smaller than national variations in background radiation. As a result, the staff draft regulatory guide (NUREG&hyph;1500) proposes that, in order to minimize the burden of documentation and analysis in such cases, the Commission would consider documentation that the TEDE to the average member of the critical group from all radionuclides distinguishable from background does not exceed 3 mrem/y as sufficient for demonstrating compliance with the ALARA requirement. The Commission invites comment on this provision in the guide. The proposed rule would broaden the definition of decommissioning to include release for restricted use in addition to release for unrestricted use. The underlying approach for restricted release is that the risk for a member of the public should be limited to acceptable levels, irrespective of whether that individual is exposed during the conduct of some occupation or in residential or recreational activities. Thus, the conditions for restricted release are premised on restricting the use of the site so that average individual doses do not exceed the 15 mrem/yr dose limit. While the circumstances of the exposure (i.e., the duration or pathway) may thus be varied, the underlying risk limit remains respected for any critical group of individuals. Licensees unable to meet the requirements for unrestricted use would be allowed to request permission to release sites for restricted use with subsequent termination of the license if they can demonstrate that the following conditions have been met: (1) Further reductions in residual radioactivity are not technically achievable, the cost of achieving further reductions would be prohibitively expensive, or further reductions would directly produce environmental or public harm that is clearly excessive compared to the health or environmental benefits achieved through these reductions now or in the future. The Commission has proposed this provision as the fundamental basis for determining when a restricted termination of a license will be appropriate. Technical achievability, prohibitive expenses, and excessive environmental or public harm are the three areas in which the Commission believes that alternative considerations should be examined as part of the overall process of determining the most appropriate action for a site. Clearly, if remediation is simply not possible given the technological capabilities in existence at the time of decommissioning, some other types of alternatives must be appropriate. In terms of excessive costs, the Commission recognizes that there may be situations where removal and disposal of large quantities of material is simply not reasonable from a cost standpoint. An example of this type of situation that has already been addressed is the disposal of mill tailings, where a separate set of standards has been developed, including provisions for institutional control. The third condition, excessive environmental or public harm, has been included in recognition that although remediations may be technically possible and within the overall resources of society, the net damage, through removal and disposal of materials, alteration of ecosystems, or displacement of populations, could be too great to not be undertaken. Considerations of this nature are best determined through public participation, which is provided through provisions for a Site-Specific Advisory Board. The third condition also provides for the possibility that the net environmental impact of completely remediating a site and then constructing an entirely new site to perform a similar activity may be inappropriate. An example of this could be the continued use of a site for electrical power generation, where a number of existing facilities, such as the turbine and electrical distribution system could be used with a different energy source. This approach would need to be examined on a case-by-case basis, and a determination made regarding the appropriateness of remediating the site for unrestricted use vs some type of restricted use in order to conserve environmental resources. (2) There are adequate provisions for institutional and/or other passive controls to provide reasonable assurance that the TEDE from residual radioactivity to the average member of the critical group will not exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) per year. Institutional controls would have to be enforceable by a responsible Government entity or in a court of law in response to suits by affected parties. This provision specifies the fundamental dose limit for considerations of restricted termination. The core requirement is that an individual should not be exposed to a greater level of risk than that established for unrestricted use releases. Thus, the application of restrictions must be able to reduce the average dose to the appropriate critical group to the same 15 mrem/year value used as the limit for unrestricted use. However, in the restricted use situation, the critical group will be different from the critical group that would need to be considered in the unrestricted situation. For example, a restriction might be imposed that would prevent residential applications or agricultural uses of the facility. These restrictions would mean that critical group would have different exposure characteristics (e.g., 8 hours per day while working in a building) and thus, a larger quantity of radioactivity could be allowed to remain onsite for the same dose. (3) There is sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume and carry out responsibilities for any necessary control and maintenance of the site. Acceptable financial assurance mechanisms will include:
