After the talks the two ministers held a news conference. In a brief statement the Ukrainian minister said, among other things: [Begin Zlenko recording, in Ukrainian with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] The main result of our visit to Croatia is the fact that after discussing issues of mutual interest, we achieved near identity of views on numerous problems. We also agreed on the main guidelines concerning the development of our relations and on a need to resolve some concrete issues. Apart from this we agreed on a legal framework for ways of resolving these issues, and decided what we could start working on in the near future. Interstate expert groups will meet to try and resolve certain issues. However, and this is most important, we are all convinced that the Croatian people view the Ukrainian people with sympathy and this forms a basis for the future comprehensive development of cooperation between the two countries. Our future concrete tasks include the preparation and signing, very shortly, of an agreement on friendly cooperation, expected to take place at the time of Premier Granic's visit to Kiev. We also agreed -- because of a failure to implement the agreement on trade cooperation signed three years ago -- to prepare another such document with more realistic objectives. We hope that this is already a substantial progress in our relations. [end recording] In his statement Croatian Minister Mate Granic stressed the following: [Begin Granic recording] It is perhaps worth saying that Croatia and Ukraine have no open questions and that political relations and goodwill are at present way above economic cooperation. It is clear that both countries are preoccupied with their own problems. For Croatia, the most important question at present is the reintegration of the occupied territories in the legal system of Croatia. Ukraine is more preoccupied with economic issues. I believe, however, that we will achieve a more substantial development of economic relations, for which we have realistic chances. [end recording]
