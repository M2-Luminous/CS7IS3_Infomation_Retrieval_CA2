This change of mind was visible 15 days ago at the Canto Grande Prison when a group of inmates started to shout "Viva the armed struggle and the Gonzalo [Abimael Guzman] Thought," instead of singing the national anthem, which was apparently something they had agreed to do. This disagreement in the negotiating line seems to have been started by Victor Catano, an important military commander imprisoned in Yanamayo, and none other than Maritza Garrido Lecca, another inmate. It was then that the imprisoned Shining Path leaders began to demand a Second Congress to discuss the bases for negotiating with the government. Faced with these revelations and discouraged by Guzman's confession that the peace process would only be a "strategic and momentary withdrawal" (LA REPUBLICA 25 Jan 94), President Alberto Fujimori changed his mind and now says the event obviously cannot be carried out without his consent.
