"It is with horror and shocked disbelief that we heard that the UN secretary general, Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, has recommended to the UN Security Council to accept the French offer of military intervention in Rwanda supposedly to stop the continuing massacre of civilians," said a statement issued by PAM secretariat Thursday in Kampala. The statement dated 22nd June and signed by Dr Taj al-Din 'Abd- al-Rahim, the PAM general secretary, said the organization is horrified because it could not believe that Ghali [as received] could recommend the intervention against the background of "similar unilateralist military intervention by the United States in Somalia and the tragic consequences of that misadventure." "It will seem to us that both Dr. Ghali and the United Nations cannot learn from one mistake. Maybe the UN secretary general thinks two tragic mistakes are better than one. But at what cost?" The statement asks. The release says PAM is shocked because the secretary general is an African with decades of political experience both as foreign minister and prime minister of Egypt. "With that experience one would have thought he would be better informed in advising the United Nations and the Security Council to be cautious and sensitive to the needs and concerns of Africans." [passage omitted] PAM accused the UN secretary general of taking decisions on Africa saying "his stewardship at the United Nations so far, has witnessed the most insensitive and outrageous decisions on matters concerning Africa, of which his current endorsement of French military intervention in Rwanda is a tragic example." The statement says there are many Africans who think Ghali has been exercising his powers, without any sense of responsibility." The ease with which he seems to accede to any Western unilateral designs on Africa makes it very difficult to refute such critics. He seems unable to ask why each time the United States and her Western allies order him to jump, his only query seems to be: How high?" PAM believes that the historical link between France and Rwanda would compromise "any moral or political concern that France may now be feigning". It blamed France and Belgium for "perpetration of brutal rule and systematic genocide in Rwanda." In the three-page statement, the Kampala-based organization said it believes that France has a hidden agenda to repossess the Central African state as a French colony, prevent the rebels of Rwandan Patriotic Front from military victory and create another Liberia type of stalemate in that country.
