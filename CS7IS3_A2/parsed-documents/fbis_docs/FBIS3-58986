"I will go through this difficult period," he stressed. Thus, the president will give a speech at a ceremony of the pope's UN representative in Vienna on the occasion of World Peace Day under the slogan "Year of the Family." "I will naturally underline the value of the family, but I will also point out that I have seen in my personal life recently how these values can be endangered easily," Klestil told DIE PRESSE yesterday. The main speech at the ceremony, organized by Nuncio Squicciarini, will be delivered by State Secretary Cardinal Sodano from the Vatican. In the interview with DIE PRESSE, Klestil left no doubt that he does not have any intention of resigning because of this private matter.
