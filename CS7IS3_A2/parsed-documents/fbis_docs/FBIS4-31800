"However, I again call attention to the fact that it is one thing to sign a coalition agreement, and another thing to exercise a coalition government. I should know the agreement in detail in order to be able to formulate a full-value opinion. In any case, efficiency is the only measure of government activity. The question is how the veto possibility and the coordinating mechanisms will be put into practice," Boross said. In his first reaction, Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] Chairman Laszlo Surjan pointed out that Sandor Keresztes also suggested the creation of the position of deputy prime minister to the late Jozsef Antall, but things did not work out at the time. "I was not surprised by the success of the first phase of the coalition coordination talks. I have never doubted the creation of this coalition," Laszlo Kover, head of the parliamentary group of the Federation of Young Democrats, said. Laszlo Kover pointed out that, given the fact that no exchange of views has yet taken place in his party about the agreement, his words only reflect his own opinion. "I was the only politician who drew the attention of the public and the media already before the elections to the emergence of a coalition between the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. These two parties are incapable of governing without each other, and the fact that the MSZP came out as a bigger winner does not change this," said Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of the Independent Smallholders Party. Torgyan stressed that he cannot start evaluating an agreement that he does not yet know in detail but, according to the first information, his opinion is that the coalition cannot function this way. According to Lajos Fur, chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, it is extremely important that Hungary should have a really stable government and he is convinced that the past four years have been successful in this respect. In connection with the current situation, Fur said that, given the proportion of the election victory, it seemed that there would be stability in governing. However, in connection with the guarantees that emerged in the course of the negotiations, Lajos Fur increasingly thinks that there are reasons for concern.
