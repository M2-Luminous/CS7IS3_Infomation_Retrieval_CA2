The former rabbi is now preaching Islam in a mosque in Morocco after he abandoned his Jewish faith. The newspaper, published in Jeddah, did not mention the name of the rabbi nor when he fled to Morocco. Jewish religious circles around the world are greatly concerned about the issue and some Zionist groups have called on the Zionist regime in occupied Palestine to demand the extradition of the former rabbi and to put him on trial for deserting his faith.
