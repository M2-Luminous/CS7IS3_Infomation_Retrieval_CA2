Pacific Fleet Protests Against Its Commander's Dismissal"] [Text] Maritime Kray -- This is the second week running that there has been a sound of firing amid a range of hills near the Maritime Kray village of Novonezhino, where the Pacific Fleet Air Force arsenal is located. The sound is made by engineers collecting and destroying the missiles, bombs, mortars, and shells that were dispersed in the wake of the 14 May explosion.... Things are worryingly deserted for many kilometers all around -- there are deserted houses with broken windows, militia cordons.... In Defense of the Admiral At the same time, the Pacific Fleet is being rocked by other explosions covering ships, combined units, and ground, air force, and hydrographical services over a huge area -- explosions of protest against the dismissal of Admiral Georgiy Gurinov, commander of the Pacific Fleet. Telegrams and letters are being sent to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev from officers' collectives appealing for the decision to remove their commander to be reviewed. This is a hitherto unheard-of phenomenon in military circles. Petitions have been fearlessly signed by all 142 of the Fleet's admirals and staff officers, officers' assemblies at the Admiral Makarov Naval College, and around 3,500 officers, ensigns, and sailors in the nuclear submarine fleet.... Veterans from the Pacific Fleet and the city of Vladivostok have come to the commander's support, along with the Council of Soldiers' and Sailors' Mothers.... Grachev's telegram to the Pacific Fleet stated that Adm. Gurinov had been dismissed for "...serious shortcomings in his organizational activity relating to leadership of the Fleet." The accusation was formulated in the relatively classic way -- it can be used to remove any commander, including a flag officer. And at any time, if we proceed on the Dostoyevskiyan basis that "...absolutely anyone can be blamed for anything." Just how far does Gurinov's guilt square with this very severe punishment? Why have Pacific Fleet sailors been taking a moral stand in defending their senior admiral en masse -- going against the unwritten list of bans that prevents people speaking up for their commander before his superiors? In order to understand this, we need to compare the situation in the Pacific Fleet a year ago, before Gurinov arrived, with the way things are now. Difficult Inheritance Last May, when IZVESTIYA was introducing Adm. Gurinov to readers as the Pacific Fleet Commander, we noted that he was inheriting a lot of naval problems. We need only recall the monstrous neglect and complete chaos at the Fleet's training schools on Russkiy Island, where four sailors died of starvation, cold, maltreatment, and illness. The then command was very much involved in commerce. Pacific Fleet auxiliaries suddenly turned up off foreign shores in the hands of very dubious firms. The Fleet was constantly rocked by accidents and people would be killed. The combat training indicators were very low.... The Pacific Fleet is the kind of cumbersome organization that takes years to get to know and get to grips with its problems. Gurinov managed to change a lot in one year. This is not my opinion -- it is the view of prestigious military and naval specialists (around 100 of them) who, on the instructions of the Defense Ministry and the Naval High Command, recently carried out comprehensive checks of all the local services and combined units. Speaking at the time at a press conference on the results of the checks, Igor Kasatonov, Deputy Commander in Chief of the Navy, made a high assessment of the Fleet's combat readiness, had some warm words to say about its commander, and referred approvingly to the morale climate in combined and other units.... Military matters are a subtle area -- they are not something you discuss with "all and sundry." But here is, for us, an important and accurate piece of information -- under Adm. Gurinov's command the Pacific Fleet significantly improved all the main objective indicators of its activity (its operational-tactical and headquarters training), strengthened military discipline, reduced its accident rate.... Ships that had been languishing offshore finally put to sea, and the combat training plan was completely fulfilled. We would note that the current command is steering the Fleet through the turbulent maelstroms and deadly shoals of our common life -- which is by no means improving. We should ponder on the fact that since the start of the year the Pacific Fleet has not been allocated even 25 percent of the minimum amount of appropriations it had requested. There is not even enough money to pay wages. There are no funds to deliver provisions and fuel to remote Fleet centers scattered around the coastline and islands. Ships return from combat standby duty and the crews should be sent on leave, but it is impossible -- there is no money to buy tickets from Aeroflot. Housing construction for officers has virtually ground to a halt -- in May, for instance, only 350 million rubles [R] of the R18.5 billion required for these purposes were allocated.... Despite these and many other circumstances beyond its control, the Pacific Fleet is, to use military language, "fulfilling its mission" and carrying out its difficult job, which has now lost all its romance. So what exactly happened between April and early May to make Pavel Grachev suddenly describe the Pacific Fleet as the worst in the Armed Forces and call its commander unsuitable? That is a puzzle not only to the men of the Pacific Fleet. Why, they ask, are some people keeping their commands when performance and morale are plummeting, while others lose their jobs at a time when, despite everything, they have the situation "under control"? Since not the slightest attempt was made to offer a reason for the Pacific Fleet commander's removal, this gave rise to a lot of assumptions. The usual intrigues -- including military intrigues -- are suspected in Moscow's corridors of power. But more often people say that the reason for the admiral's dismissal is connected with the explosions at the Novonezhino arsenals. Special Danger Zone Every morning I turn on the radio in suspense to hear what has blown up where. If there is no such report, I breathe easier -- we have gotten away with it. But in general, there are so many accidents, particularly here in the Far East, that it sometimes seems as though they are being churned out by some diabolical factory with a view to depriving us of our spiritual peace. It would be better not to know what kind of dangerous stuff is hidden away from view in the harmless-sounding "prohibited areas" that are scattered across all parts of the Far East, even to be found in cities shaded by nearby woods. About a year ago a retired military man who had "nothing to lose" -- since he was emigrating that very day to live in one of our nearest-neighbor countries -- came into the IZVESTIYA correspondents' center and said that there was a chemical weapons arsenal in Khabarovsk behind a green-shaded corner as you turn toward the Krasnaya stream. One faulty bomb is all it would take to do away with this city of 700,000. We who live here would like to know how reliably these most dangerous weapons are guarded and by whom. But unfortunately, when we are talking about arms, particularly of such a dangerous type, social forces become socially impotent. We find ourselves in servile dependence on Defense Ministry generals and we are forced to reassure ourselves with the mantra: "They have a clearer picture." Admittedly, in this instance the people of Khabarovsk can be reassured: In preparing this article, I phoned Lieutenant General Valeriy Samsonov, chief of staff of the Far East Military District, who told me that the chemical weapons arsenal had been removed from Khabarovsk. But how many other arsenals are left? The military told me that, when the thousands of tonnes of bombs went off at Novonezhino, they prayed that the missile fuel dumps nearby would not go up by accident or (it does not bear thinking about!) some smoldering rocket would not fly off to Bolshoy Kamen and hit a submarine with a nuclear reactor. As is now clear, the sheer chance that the explosions in Vladivostok and Novonezhino happened on the same day -- 14 May -- two years apart is seen by many people as neatly preordained, and even the possibility of sabotage is not being ruled out. Our usual lack of organization has been evident in our investigation into the cause of this latest disaster. But more of this later; for now we will try to see how many weapons and munitions have been amassed in the Pacific Fleet alone, who guards them, and in what way. I have obtained the document -- a submission from the Military Prosecutor's Office -- "On Eradicating Violations of Legislation on the Storage of Weapons, Ammunition, and Explosives." This is the fruit of a two-month (February-March last year) investigation into the Pacific Fleet's arsenals carried out not only by prosecution personnel but also by specialists from the Navy High Command's Missile and Artillery Armaments Directorate. Here are some selected extracts from the document: "...The bulk of the arms checked do not accord with the requirements of the guidance document on ensuring the safekeeping of weapons and ammunition. The premises in which they are stored are not made of reinforced concrete or of brick with reinforced concrete roofs and floors. Many dumps are too full and the ammunition is not stacked safely. Appropriations for the construction of new dumps are not being allocated. Not a single paragraph of the long-term plan for the construction of technical security facilities in 1991-1995 has been carried out. As a result, most of the installations checked have homemade alarm systems which cannot provide reliable security. Almost half of the wooden boxes in which the weapons and ammunition are stored are unsuitable, stacks of shells of different calibers have collapsed, shells are scattered around and many of them are rusty, yet they are not being written off or destroyed...." We would note in passing that these outrages were happening before Adm. Gurinov even arrived to command the Fleet, so that according to normal logic he should not be held responsible for them. As a rule, the arsenals were replenished irrespective of the real needs of the Pacific Fleet or of what its commanders wanted. There are plenty of examples of this, but we will take the most immediate -- the Novonezhino arsenal. Rear Admiral German Ugryumov, Pacific Fleet chief of military counterintelligence, told me that at the time of the explosion around 2,000 standard carloads of aviation ammunition of various yields and calibers had built up there -- almost three times more than the potential storage norm. A considerable proportion of this dangerous cargo was dispatched here, on the orders of the Defense Ministry leadership, from...the Baltic. Maybe the shores of the Pacific were in particular need of bombs, missiles, and shells that were superfluous to the Baltic? It turns out that they were transported across the entire country so as to be...destroyed here. It is ideas like that, not a lack of ideas, that constitute real stupidity. Ammunition to be recycled accounted for more than 70 percent of what was stored in the Novonezhino dumps. How much is at other dumps? This is a big secret, but people in the know have told me that Defense Ministry officials have long regarded the Russian Far East as a huge dump for radioactive material and explosives. The local authorities are stubbornly trying to ensure the adoption of a national program for the destruction of unnecessary armaments. The government assures us that there are no funds available at the moment, while...throwing away much bigger sums on endlessly "overcoming obstacles." For instance, Svetlana Parinov, chairman of the Maritime Kray Economics and Planning Committee, reported that the Novonezhino explosion would cost the treasury at least R31 billion. This amount does not include the losses suffered by the Fleet. Add to this the colossal expenditure on the clear-up operations after the explosions at the Vladivostok arsenal two years ago and innumerable "trivial" accidents of which Russian readers are no longer informed because they are considered so routine.... Who has worked out how much money will be needed to guard and maintain "dead" -- decommissioned -- nuclear submarines? Their missile launchers are removed, but their nuclear reactors remain in place. These need to be constantly monitored by highly skilled specialists in order to prevent a disaster. These craft have been waiting to be recycled for years, and they are being joined by new submarines all the time.... Their crews, disbanded on paper, have been forced to continue their now simply stupid, although extremely responsible service. If such fabulous expenditure is to be avoided, the government should clearly come up with the funds to set up facilities to destroy unnecessary arms. But clearly we should start by organizing reliable security at the arsenals. The way this is currently organized is graphically visible from the same prosecution submission: "...Weapons and ammunition dumps in the Pacific Fleet are mainly guarded by squads of paramilitary security force riflemen which, owing to their low pay, are not fully staffed and experience considerable manpower turnover. Absences without leave and drunkenness are widespread among the security staff...." Now let us imagine the old men and women compelled out of great necessity (who would agree to guard weapons dumps far from home, without any uniforms or normal food, for a miserable salary?) to guard things on which not only human life but the continued presence on the map of entire cities depends. And this is happening at a time when criminal structures are doing everything to get their hands on weapons. The Boys Wanted a Little Silver... Let us return to the Novonezhino explosion. It is now clear that it was not the result of an agricultural fire, as all the press had initially reported. The accident was caused by two sailors from the arsenal's security subunit. The motives and circumstances of the incident were set out in such a contradictory way by the newspapers that I turned for the most accurate information to Boris Larichev, Pacific Fleet deputy military prosecutor, who is conducting the criminal case. Here is what he said: "That day Seamen D. and A. were not on patrol. D. had heard that aircraft missile battery units contained silver, and, after he had whispered the information to his comrades, they infiltrated the dump. They found the missile stacks and, not knowing where the battery units were located, started unscrewing something with a bayonet. This turned out to be a tracking flare -- it ignites when the missile is fired and burns for around 20-25 seconds. Ignition can be triggered by friction or a blow, which is what happened -- D.'s blade cut through the foil covering the tracking flare and it ignited right in D.'s hand. The sailor was burned, and then the whole rack caught fire. The guys were scared, ran to the guardhouse, and then took cover with the entire guard behind some mounds...." This is what the Fleet got from these stupid young men who had reinforced their untoward tendencies at vocational and technical college. Now they face Article 251 "footnote" of the Russian Federation Criminal Code -- "violation of the regulations governing the handling of weapons and items and substances posing a heightened danger to those in the vicinity...." This article provides for terms of imprisonment ranging from three to 15 years. The courts will probably consider the fact that, thank God, nobody died during the explosions to be an extenuating circumstance. This time we got away with it. Now let us enquire just what sort of order reigns in that security detachment if the sailors could "fumble about" in the arsenal entirely unmolested. The fact is that there was hardly any security provided at all for a huge number of terrible weapons. There were only 16 guards on duty instead of the 64 there should have been. No observation was being carried out from guard towers and no checks were being done at checkpoints. Contrary to regulations, these measures were replaced by patrols of sailors armed only with bayonets around the four-km perimeter of the arsenal. Yet it was storing not just aviation ammunition but various small arms, which are so attractive to the criminal world and those connected with it. Here at the Novonezhino dumps forged documents had recently been used to steal 41 Kalashnikov assault rifles, 31 Makarov pistols, 140 grenades, and over 20,000 rounds.... The crime was committed with the participation of Major Votinov, former chief of the arsenal, and other officers and staff from law-enforcement organs. These weapons are now being confiscated from the mafia and hired killers.... The Fleet and the people of the Far East know that Gurinov had begun to seriously restore order at Pacific Fleet arsenals. He issued a stern order to shoot to kill anyone who attempted to infiltrate military arms dumps. The decision to dismiss him leaves people confused and bitter.
