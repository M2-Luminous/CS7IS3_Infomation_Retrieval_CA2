Serra, Kantor, and MacLaren held a private meeting earlier this morning to set in motion the Free Trade Labor Commission, which is based in Mexico, the Free Trade Agreement Commission on Labor Affairs based in the United States, and the Environmental Commission based in Canada. The commerce ministers' meeting with President Salinas was also behind closed doors, and, as we all know, following this meeting they went over to the Secofin [Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat] building to hold a joint news conference.
