FR941212-1-00046 FR941212-1-00012 (2) Any time, as determined by the Commissioner, during which the applicant for patent did not act with due diligence. In determining the due diligence of an applicant, the Commissioner will examine the facts and circumstances of the applicant's actions during the pendency period of the application to determine whether the applicant exhibited that degree of timeliness as may reasonably be expected from, and which is ordinarily exercised by, a person during the pendency period of an application.< PART 3_ASSIGNMENT, RECORDING, AND RIGHTS OF ASSIGNEE 34. The authority citation for 37 CFR part 3 would continue to read as follows: Authority: 15 U.S.C. 1123; 35 U.S.C. 6. 35. Section 3.21 is proposed to be revised to read as follows: §3.21 Identification of patents and patent applications. An assignment relating to a patent must identify the patent by the patent number. An assignment relating to a national patent application must identify the national patent application by the application number (consisting of the series code and the serial number, e.g., 07/123,456) [or the serial number and filing date]. An assignment relating to an international patent application which designates the United States of America must identify the international application by the international application number (e.g., PCT/US90/01234). If an assignment >of a patent application filed under §1.53(b)(1) or §1.62< is executed concurrently with, or subsequent to, the execution of the patent application, but before the patent application is filed, it must identify the patent application by its date of execution, name of each inventor, and title of the invention so that there can be no mistake as to the patent application intended. >If an assignment of a provisional application is executed before the provisional application is filed, it must identify the provisional application by name of each inventor and title of the invention so that there can be no mistake as to the provisional application intended.< 36. Section 3.81 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: §3.81 Issue of patent to assignee. * * * * * (b) If the assignment is submitted for recording after the date of payment of the issue fee, but prior to issuance of the patent, the assignee may petition that the patent issue to the assignee.
