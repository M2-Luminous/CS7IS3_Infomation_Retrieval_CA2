FBIS4-33363 "drlat108_c_94014" FBIS-LAT-94-108 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 MEXICO Congress Approves Amendment to Electoral Code Congress Approves Amendment to Electoral Code PA0406031994 Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 9 PA0406031994 Mexico City LA JORNADA Spanish BFN [Report by Oscar Camacho Guzman] [Text] Yesterday, the Chamber of Deputies approved an electoral "minireform" that had been agreed upon by the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], National Action Party [PAN], and the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD], thus changing the content of Article 77 of the Federal Code of Institutions and Electoral Procedures (Cofipe) regarding the employment of citizen advisers. The reform allows them to earn income derived from the free practice of their professions, bonuses, and author's and publications' royalties during the time they occupy this post. The reform was approved during talks among the PRI, PAN, PRD, and the Government Secretariat after journalist Miguel Angel Granados Chapa asked the persons who participate in the appointment process to define the nature of citizen advisers and not to turn them into officials, but allow them to retain their function in society," according to an explanation he publicly gave last Saturday. [no beginning quotation mark as published] The reform the Chamber of Deputies approved yesterday does not alter, however, the single paragraph of the Cofife's Article 77 to which only two paragraphs are attached to detail four exceptions allowing citizen advisers to earn some remuneration. A differentiation in the income of the citizen advisers is introduced this way, since only those who work or perform some function for the federal government, states, municipalities, or political parties or those who earn some remuneration from individuals involving dependence or subordination must abandon their jobs. The citizen advisers' income that comes from the "free practice of their profession, bonuses, or authors' and publications' royalties" will have another legal status. This creates the opportunity for them to perform another remunerated activity within the conditions established by the "minireform" in tandem with their post in the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) General Council. Two of the six IFE General Council civilian advisers maintain a labor relationship with an institution. This case applies to National Autonomous University of Mexico staff members Jose Woldenberg, professor of the Policital Sciences Faculty, and Ricardo Pozas, director of the Social Research Institute. Granados Chapa, in turn, is the editor of a magazine; Ortiz Pinchetti [no first name as published] and Santiago Creel have their law offices; and Fernando Zertuche performs editorial work. According to the explanations given to justify this initiative, the goal of this addition is to guarantee "a greater independence and impartiality" on the part of the citizen advisers. The initiative was submitted almost at the end of the session, and in view of the great urgency to have it approved yesterday so that next Friday the citizen advisers can be sworn in legally, the PRI, PAN, and PRD blocs agreed to forgo the congressional ritual, and, based on Articles 59 and 60 of the internal regulations, waived the drafting of the respective report, the first and second readings of the report, the debate, and any future possibility of proposing changes. With this agreement by the PRI, PAN, and PRD, this "minireform," which in effect constitutes the fourth electoral reform of this six-year period, did not take more than 10 minutes of the lawmakers' time and joined the list of initiatives approved at full speed by the PRI legislators, whom the PAN and most of the PRD deputies not only did not criticize but rather supported. There were, however, seven abstentions among the PRD legislators. The Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party cast five votes against it, as opposed to the 269 in votes in favor, by the automatic PRI-PAN-PRD majority. The initiative approved yesterday also amends the Cofife's Article 77 and subparagraph B of paragraph 5 of Article 74 so that they read as follows: Article 74, paragraphs five, subparagraph B: "From this list, the corresponding commission will draft an individual report containing the slate of citizen advisers and alternates. The Chamber of Deputies will elect the citizen advisers by a vote of two thirds of the deputies present. The proposals by the advisers will be voted on based on the procedure outlined by the Internal Governing Rules for the General Congress of the United States of Mexico on its chapter on voting." Article 77: "During their mandate, the citizen advisers of the General Council may not perform any function or job for the Federation, states, municipalities, or political parties. Neither may they accept a remunerated post or employment that entails a dependence or subordination from individuals." "The citizen advisers may earn income stemming from the free practice of their profession, bonuses, or authors' or publications royalties so long as the independence, impartiality, or equity that must govern the exercise of their function is not undermined. They may hold unpaid jobs in scientific, literary, or charity associations. "For any clarification regarding the interpretation of this article, the Federal Electoral Tribunal will be called."
