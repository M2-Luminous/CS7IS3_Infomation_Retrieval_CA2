The main thing in joining is "the reciprocity of partnership and a clear mechanism for implementing decisions," he said, stressing that the recent air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, "when the decision was made not even by NATO but by the U.S. command, showed that a mechanism of this kind does not exist even at the level of the United Nations and the Security Council." Shumeyko drew particular attention to the need for a mechanism "that will emphasize that all states in the partnership are absolutely equal." "Further developments will show how the peace process will evolve," Vladimir Shumeyko said. Under the Russian Constitution, it is the Federation Council that is responsible for the use of troops outside the country.
