Leoluca Orlando, the anti-mafia mayor in the Sicilian city of Palermo, said several of Sicily's Forza Italy candidates for the March 27-28 poll had obtained the backing of top mafiosi. The leader of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), Achille Occhetto, said Friday [18 March] evening during a campaign rally that Berlusconi's party had "been pledged support by Don Piromalli," the boss of the N'Drangheta mafia based in the southern region of Calabria. And Luciano Violante, the chairman of parliament's anti-mafia commission and a leftist candidate in the poll in a Sicily constituency, told AFP that the "political entourage" of Forza Italy was suspect. There was "not necessarily" an agreement between the party and the mafia, he said, but "it seems to me that Forza Italia has not rejected support" proffered by leading figures of Italy's corrupt institutional past "who are trying to make a comeback." Meanwhile Interior Minister Nicola Mancino, a Christian Democrat, told the Neapolitan Daily Il Mattino Saturday that "rumours" that the mafia was poised to pledge its support for Forza Italia "must be verified." Forza Italia's spokesman, Antonio Tajani, dismissed reported mafia links as "pure defamation." The election campaign has shaped up increasingly as a two-horse race between Berlusconi and the PDS, with the latest opinion poll Saturday crediting right-wing parties with 40.9 percent of the poll and parties of the left with 37.7 percent.
