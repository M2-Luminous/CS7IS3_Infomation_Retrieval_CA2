FR940503-2-00059 FR940503-2-00039 March 4, 1994. Assistant Secretary, Conservation and Renewable Energy, United States Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. Subject: Petitions for Waiver and Interim Waiver. Dear Secretary: Please consider this letter as a Petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver, submitted pursuant to Title 10 CFR 430.27. DMO Industries is requesting a waiver from the furnace test procedure which requires a 90 second delay between burner ignition and blower start-up. DMO requests authorization to reduce the 90 second delay to 30 seconds when testing our HDS series, high efficiency, residential gas furnaces. The HDS series includes the following models as listed in the GAMA (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association) certification program: HDS 40MS HDS 50MS (60/50MS) HDS 60MS HDS 60M (70/60M) HDS 70M HDS 80M (90/80M) HDS 90M HDS 90MF (100/90M) HDS 100M HDS 110M (120/110M) HDS 120M DMO is currently switching all controls on this series to a 30 second blower-on delay by a timed controller, which cannot be adjusted by the installer, or service person. Our tests indicate that by using the 30 second delay, AFUE values increase by up to 2.0 points, depending on the model. We feel that this is a substantial benefit to our customers and would like to reflect this through the higher AFUE values. Confidential Test data is available upon request which confirms the above claim. We are confident that both an Interim Waiver and final Waiver will be granted us on the basis that many similar petitions have already been granted on our competitors. A copy of this petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver is being sent to manufacturers who market similar equipment. ␣␣␣Sincerely, Kyu S. Hwang, P. Eng., Manager of Engineering, Research and Development. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10578 Filed 5&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
