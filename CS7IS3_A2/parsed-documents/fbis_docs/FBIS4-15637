Elections were invalid in Vyzovskiy, Moskovskiy, and Saltovskiy constituencies due to a low turnout. In Dzerzhinskiy constituency neither of the candidates received the required number of votes. The elected deputies include Volodymyr Hrynyov (Inter-Regional Bloc of Reforms), Mykola Koshlyakov, secretary of the oblast Communist Party committee, Oleh Dyomin, vice president of the UkrSibInkor association, Oleksandr Karpov, a lecturer of the city's State University, and Oleksandr Chornousenko, head of the Kharkov Oblast branch of the Security Service. Elections were valid in all of the 17 Zaporozhye Oblast constituencies. In Zhovtnevyy and [name indistinct] constituencies of Zaporozhye city, the winners are Yuriy Syzenko, a worker of Zaporozhye electric wagon repair plant, and Viktor Ponedilok, a scientist of Zaporozhye Technical University. Our Chernigov Oblast correspondent reports that elections were valid in all of the oblast's constituencies. The average turnout in the oblast was 73 percent, while in Chernigov city it was just over 50 percent. In Vinnitsa Oblast, people's deputies were elected in 11 out of 16 constituencies which held runoffs yesterday. They include Hryhoriy Nedvyha, an engineer of the locomotive depot, Yevhen Smyrnov, a stage director at Narodnyy Theater, Mykhaylo Parasunko, deputy minister of agrarian policy and foodstuffs, and Oleksandr Stoyan, chairman of Ukraine's Federation of Independent Trade Unions. Our Odessa correspondent reports that over 62 percent of the electorate voted in the oblast. In Odessa, the highest turnout was in Zhovtnevyy constituency (62 percent) and Malinovskiy (60 percent). Unfortunately, in some constituencies, such as Leninskiy and Tsentralnyy, the turnout was only 48 percent. In the countryside, the highest turnout was in Tatarbunarskiy, Filiyskiy, and Razdelnyanskiy rayons. Our Poltava correspondent reports that all of the 15 Poltava Oblast constituencies have reported a valid election. The highest turnout was in the countryside. Thus, in Orzhitskiy, Velikobagachskiy, Zenkovskiy, Mirgorodskiy, and other rayons, the turnout was over 90 percent of registered voters. Somewhat lower was the turnout in Kremenchug and Poltava itself. We are unable to name those elected yet, but there is every confidence that the number of Poltava representatives will be larger this time. Finally, results in the Ukrainian capital. Our presenters on 10 April were unable to quote even preliminary results, saying, however that elections were valid in about eight of the capital's constituencies. Here are the preliminary results of elections in Kiev that we know so far. Out of the 23 constituencies, eight reported a valid election. The elected deputies include Myroslav Horbatyuk, Ivan Zayets, [Minister of Environment] Yuriy Kostenko. I will remind you that people's deputies elected in Kiev on 27 March were Volodymyr Lanovyy and Les Tanyuk. [sentence as heard] All of the Kiev deputies named here are supported by the Ukraina Democratic Association. We have no results yet as to the runoff in Artemovskiy constituency No. 1 where the contenders were lawyer Viktor Medvedchuk and [ex-Minister of Defense] General Kostyantyn Morozov. In two constituencies, Pecherskiy and Podolskiy, neither of the deputies received the required number of votes.
