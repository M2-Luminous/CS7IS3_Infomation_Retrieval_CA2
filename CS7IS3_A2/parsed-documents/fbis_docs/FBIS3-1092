This is the second time such discussions have been held, less than a week after the proclamation of the final results of the second round of legislative elections. It was an occasion for the head of state to analyze the country's political situation with the said political parties prior to the formation of a new government team. The five political parties, received in turn by President Eyadema, are the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT], the Union for Justice and Democracy [UJD], led by Lal Takpandjan; the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] led by Yaovi Agboyibor; Edem Kodjo's Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD]; the Union of Liberal Independents [ULI] led by Jacques Amouzou; and the Coordination of New Forces led by Prime Minister Koffigoh. After the audience Mr. Koffigoh said he discussed the formation of a new government with President Eyadema. [Koffigoh] What I can tell you is that the president continues with his consultations with a view to forming a new government. [Unidentified correspondent] Did you discuss the criteria for choosing a new prime minister? [Koffigoh] You know, the post of prime minister is not a monarchy. It is not the duty of the outgoing prime minister to define the criteria for choosing his successor. This problem must be resolved according to the Constitution. First, we have the prerogatives of the president of the Republic, who has the power to designate the prime minister from within the parliamentary majority. This parliamentary majority also must stand out and make concrete proposals. RPT Secretary General Vigniko Amedegnato gave a profile for the new head of government against the background of the country's new political landscape. He must be a man of dialogue, a very experienced economist with perfect knowledge of the country's economic problems, and capable of redressing the national economy. [Amedegnato] We have considered the current political situation and, as the recent elections indicated, we have some majority political parties, and so, we are not dealing with the case of a single political party. The RPT has already recommended that the next government be a national union government. This is why the RPT holds the view that next prime minister must first be a man of dialogue. He must be somebody capable of conducting a dialogue with all political parties -- irrespective of their leanings. In short, he should, as his predecessor said, be the prime minister of all Togolese. This is why we insist on this second aspect of the issue. The third issue we raised with the president of the Republic is solidity and cohesiveness within the government, which also depends on the existing cohesion between the president and the government. So, we of the RPT want the future prime minister to be somebody who is capable of conducting a dialogue with the president of the Republic, and who can be on good terms with him. So, we think that once this prerequisite is met, it will guarantee peace in our country and at the same time enable us to come out of the critical economic situation, which is harmful to all and from which everybody is suffering. Therefore, it is essential that the prime minister be a dynamic person, a very enlightened economically, and a person capable of bailing the country out of the current economic situation. At the same time he must be somebody who can have dialogue with all the political parties to try and ensure an effective group leadership, and lead a consensus government, and we think he should be someone capable of maintaining a dialogue with the president of the Republic to ensure to greater cohesion within the country's leadership. [passage omitted] UTD leader Edem Kodjo said it is necessary to both consider the political realities and socio-economic constraints as determining factors for the appointment of the head of the future government. [Kodjo] The head of state, in line with Article 66 relating to the designation of a prime minister, has again held consultations with us. I can assure you that the consultations went smoothly. [Correspondent] Did you discuss the criteria to serve as guidelines for the selection of the prime minister? [Kodjo] We tried to develop these criteria a little, and I think what was agreed upon is quite suitable for us. But for the moment we cannot give any details. [Correspondent] In view of the problems facing your country, what in your view are the criteria that can presently enable Togo to resolve these problems? [Kodjo] Well, I am not here to open a debate on this issue, but I think one has to consider both the political equation and the socio-economic constraints. Finally, like those who preceded him, ULI leader Jacques Amouzou hinted that his discussions with President Eyadema were in line with preliminary consultations to nominate a prime minister. [Amouzou] I met the head of state in line with the current consultations he is holding with all and sundry, the leaders of all the political parties including the UDR, and our discussions centered only on this issue. [Correspondent] Did you talk about the criteria that might come into play in the choice of a new prime minister? [Amouzou] Instead of speaking about criteria for individual appointments, I rather think that we should discuss the criteria for the formation of the government which will govern the country. As I have already said about the criteria, I think one must put in place a government which will be open to all sides. For me, this is the lesson that we should draw from the legislative elections we just participated in. One should avoid anything that looks like a policy of exclusion. This is what I just explained to the head of state. I did not discuss individual problems. [Correspondent] There is, all the same, the need for a man who is capable of rallying together all these forces to lead them as a team after the elections. [Amouzou] If this is what you mean, here is my answer. Since you are talking about the prime minister, I think he should be the prime minister of all the Togolese people and not the prime minister of certain parties, factions, or regions. We need a prime minister who pledges security and assurance for everybody, regardless of tribal or regional origin or political leaning. I think these are the basic criteria for the prime minister, who will be called upon to govern the country together with the head of state.
