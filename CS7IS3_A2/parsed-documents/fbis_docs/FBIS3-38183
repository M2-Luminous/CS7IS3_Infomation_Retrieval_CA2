This short sentence, tossed out almost absent-mindedly by Prime Minister Ciampi following his talks with Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, was the key to reading the joint declaration, which might have been a bit unbalanced in its good proposals and readiness if it had not actually been upheld and guaranteed by this "confirmation." Both the Italians and Russians feel that the aim of Chernomyrdin's official visit, which will end this evening, was on the one hand to allow Ciampi to check that the reform process has not been compromised by conservative reticence applied by the new government in Moscow, and on the other hand assure the Russian prime minister that the continuation of the cooperation agreements with Italy would contribute to the reforms. Moreover, Ciampi explicitly emphasized that on the Italian side "everything is linked to political developments in Russia," thus virtually making bilateral economic cooperation a condition. In this way, the joint document turned into a declaration of intent which provides for mutual opportunities and interests in the future for reinforcing all links and agreements, in particular those concerning the energy sector -- both petroleum and nuclear -- "via the rapid conclusion of negotiations on the new agreement to promote and protect investments." "The rapid finalization of this agreement," added the document, "which takes account of the significant progress made by the Russian Federation toward the market economy, will certainly be able to contribute to the growth of reciprocal flows of investment and to the intensification of bilateral relations." An initial sign of the importance Italy attaches to the Russian Federation can be seen in the fact that our country is already in second place, after Germany, in bilateral trade. There has also been a recent agreement between ENI [National Hydrocarbons Institute] and Gazprom -- worth more than $2 billion -- to supply 5.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas between now and 2017. Nevertheless, the path to be followed does not seem short. Chernomyrdin and Ciampi have not actually succeeded in overcoming the stumbling block of double taxation which is crucial to the interest of Italian businesses in joint ventures. No progress has been made in restructuring the former Soviet foreign debt, and the prime minister committed just a vague promise when Chernomyrdin asked him for "Italian support to transform the G7 into the G8." For Yeltsin, who will be in Naples for the July meeting of the group of the most industrialized countries, full membership in this private club would be a personal and political success which would confirm the West's trust in his program and which would indirectly belie the dire predictions made a few days ago by Jeffrey Sachs, his chief economic adviser who has now resigned. Indeed, at the G7 meeting in Naples the Italian-Russian document seems to postpone the final examination and "the occasion to analyze the initiatives under way which aim to encourage Russia's progress toward a market economy." Yesterday's talks at the Villa Madama [Foreign Ministry venue for hosting top-level foreign guests] also tackled the crisis in Bosnia (examined by Foreign Minister Andreatta and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Adamishin) and the Partnership for Peace program launched at the recent NATO summit. On this last point the Italians made an imperceptible slide toward the Russian idea of favoring the CSCE over the Atlantic Alliance for managing security in Europe. Indeed, the joint declaration states that the Partnership for Peace aims to involve the Alliance in an increasingly close and reassuring relationship with eastern Europe with the prospect that this partnership will contribute to the expansion and reinforcement of European stability and to the creation of a single collective system of European security within the framework of the CSCE. With regard to the Yugoslav conflict, while reconfirming Russia's pro-Serb position against any use of force, he stressed that crisis could only be solved "by political means."
