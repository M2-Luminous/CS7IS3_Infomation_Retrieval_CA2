In a statement published by the daily REPUBLIKA today, the committee says that checking regularity of the petition lists by an accounting company is a gross violation of protections of citizens' personal data. The committee urges Kovac, "in line with the Constitution, the legal order, his conscience and his constitutional oath, to enable citizens to realized their basic human, civic, political and natural rights". On Wednesday [16 March], the Presidential Office announced that the referendum on early elections and other questions, pushed for by the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), would not take place, since the constitutionally required 350,000 valid petition signatures had not been attained. The petition drive was launched in late February. On March 2 the Petition Committee handed to the Presidential Office 21,000 lists with 422,054 signatures. However, the Presidential Office found many of them invalid.
