Yesterday's dastardly attack by the Zionist forces on the tomb of Abraham in the town of Hebron in occupied Palestine, leading to the death or injury of around 400 fasting worshipers, has grieved the world of Islam, awakened humanity's conscience, and marginalized the world's other news and developments. We devote today's political commentary to analyzing the various dimensions of that shocking and heart wrenching incident. In our interviews with a number of specialists from the News Research and Analysis Group, as well as Palestine's Islamic Jihad representative in Tehran, we have reviewed yesterday's heart rending incident. To start with, we hear the details of the incident from Brother Abu-Jihad, the representative of Palestine's Islamic Jihad Movement in Tehran. [Begin Abu-Jihad recording, in Arabic, with superimposed Persian translation] The incident was one of the most heart wrenching events in the entire history of Palestine and indeed the history of mankind. In this heart wrenching atrocity, which the Zionists committed with the cooperation and participation of the Army of occupation, hundreds of worshipers were attacked in the Abraham al-Khalil mosque, as they were staging the dawn prayers. The large number of victims indicates that several people were involved in the crime. While the Zionist regime has blamed the crime on a mentally deranged medical doctor, remarks made by the chairman of council of Zionist settlements in defense of that criminal removed any doubt that may have existed about the direct involvement of the Zionist regime in yesterday's operations. Although the tomb of Abraham is constantly controlled and guarded by 40 military personnel, only three soldiers were present at the scene on the day of the incident. We are sorry that at a time when the blood of the Muslim people of Palestine is being shed, some people claim that the Zionist regime is pursuing peace. [end recording] [Announcer] In order to exonerate itself from the responsibility for this atrocity, the Zionist regime has claimed that a mentally deranged person, or a few fanatical Zionists, had perpetrated the atrocity. In reference to this claim, Abu-Jihad says: We believe that the Zionist regime is fully responsible for the crime. By licensing the possession of arms and the reopening of military barracks to train the Jews, the Zionist regime must shoulder the blame for the hostile acts committed by its citizens. Furthermore, the violent behavior of the Zionist regime toward demonstrators, who had come out to condemn the incident, was yet more proof of the Zionist regime's collusion with the criminals. In its first reaction to the tragedy, the American Government announced that it hoped the incident would not effect the process of compromise and negotiations between Israel and the PLO. Ne'matzadeh, a specialist in the Middle East section of the news research and analysis group, says: [Begin Ne'matzadeh recording] In order to throw light on Israel's objectives, one must analyze the political circumstances at the time of the incident. Israel has so far gained whatever it has been seeking to gain from the Gaza-Jericho Accord, and has officially achieved whatever it demanded from 'Arafat. It has gained political legitimacy, international acceptance, transformation of its warmongering and domineering image, influence over the Arab world, formal domination over the occupied land of Palestine, control over borders, roads, passes and Zionist settlements, and finally domestic and international security. Israel, in other words, has been able to make 'Arafat concede to all its demands. It seems therefore, that the Zionist regime considered the present juncture as an opportune time to show its real image to the Palestinians in general, and the rejectionist camp in particular. This violent image is in reality the true and authentic face of the Zionist society; an image that in effect serves to consolidate the foundations of the Zionist regime by placing it in a position of strength vis-a-vis its opponents. Moreover, Israel has specifically targeted the Islamists in yesterday's attacks. This carries a message of serious threat; a message that is backed by the West. [end recording] [passage omitted]
