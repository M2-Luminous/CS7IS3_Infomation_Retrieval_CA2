FR940705-0-00051 FR940705-0-00005 COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION 17 CFR Parts 1, 33, and 190 Risk Disclosure by Futures Commission Merchants, Introducing Brokers, Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors to Customers; Bankruptcy Disclosure AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ACTION: Final rules. SUMMARY: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is amending its rules to permit registrants to deliver to customers a generic risk disclosure statement which will satisfy risk disclosure requirements applicable to domestic and foreign commodity futures and commodity option transactions subject to regulation by the Commission. The Commission also is permitting such statement to substitute for the special disclosure requirement related to futures-style margining of the options premium permitted on certain foreign exchanges. The generic statement may be used by firms subject to CFTC jurisdiction in lieu of the separate disclosure statements that will continue to be authorized by Commission rules. The statement, which was developed in cooperation with various international regulators, also is intended to satisfy the risk disclosure requirements of certain foreign jurisdictions who have implemented the language of this proposed risk disclosure statement in their jurisdictions in accordance with their domestic law. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jane C. Kang, Esq., or Robert H. Rosenfeld, Esq., Division of Trading and Markets, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581; telephone (202) 254&hyph;8955. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 30, 1993, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) approved for publication in the Federal Register amendments to its rules 1.55, 30.6, 33.7, 180.3, 190.06 and 190.10. 1 Among other things, the rule amendments consolidated the foreign futures and foreign commodity options risk disclosure statement required by rule 30.6 with the domestic futures risk disclosure statement required by rule 1.55. 1 58 FR 17495 (April 5, 1993). On May 5, 1994, the Commission also proposed substantial revisions to the disclosure framework applicable to commodity pool operators (CPOs) and commodity trading advisors (CTAs) designed to achieve greater simplicity, focus and clarity in performance history presentation, streamlining other required disclosures and a more concise and readable format for disclosure documents. 59 FR 25351 (May 16, 1994). If adopted, these changes would substitute Part 4 disclosure for rule 1.55 disclosure in certain cases. In addition, rule 1.55 was amended to provide in paragraph (c) that the Commission may approve for use in lieu of the prescribed rule 1.55 disclosure statement a risk disclosure statement approved by one or more foreign regulatory agencies or self-regulatory organizations if the Commission determines that such statement is reasonably calculated to provide the disclosures specified by rule 1.55. Rule 1.55(c) was adopted by the Commission to permit firms doing multinational business to use the same risk disclosure statement for foreign and U.S.-based business, thereby reducing duplicative disclosure requirements without sacrificing important customer protections or obscuring any special risks of trading outside the U.S. 2 2 See 57 FR 46101, 46103 (October 7, 1992). Although initially addressed to the approval of the individual disclosure statements of a particular jurisdiction, the Commission in proposing the amendments to, among others, rule 1.55, stated that the rule contemplates a mechanism for eventually substituting a uniform disclosure format, accepted internationally, that could be used on a general basis and supplemented as warranted for particular kinds of transactions or special markets. 3 3 57 FR 46101, 46103&hyph;46104 (October 7, 1992). The Commission also noted that it was considering development of a ``plain language'' option disclosure statement and requested comment concerning the desirability of developing a simpler options disclosure statement and other possible improvements. 4 Generally, the commenters who addressed this issue supported the development of a plain language generic options risk disclosure statement and also encouraged the Commission to consider incorporating the required options disclosure into the revised rule 1.55 statement. However, the Commission deferred taking such action pending the outcome of international efforts to develop a consolidated futures and options statement. 5 4 57 FR 46101, 46108 (October 7, 1992). 5 58 FR 17495, 17502 (April 5, 1993). In this connection, the Commission stated that certain international regulators were endeavoring to develop a single risk disclosure statement that would be acceptable in multiple jurisdictions for domestic and cross-border transactions in futures and options and stated that: 6 6 58 FR 17495, 17497 (April 5, 1993). The Commission is monitoring developments in this area and anticipates that if a universal statement of this nature is developed, it will consider permitting the use of such a statement in lieu of the new consolidated rule 1.55 risk disclosure statement as well as the options disclosure statement required by rule 33.7.
