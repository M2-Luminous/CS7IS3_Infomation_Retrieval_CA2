Is that correct? [Schmidbauer] Moscow briefed us on the arrest of a Russian citizen who is accused of having worked for the Federal Intelligence Service [BND]. I cannot confirm that at all. I had an exhaustive talk with Safanov, head of the counterintelligence service. We decided that the Russian side will approach us as soon as more detailed information is available. Moreover, I asked BND President Porzner to keep me abreast of things. Mr. Porzner will return prematurely from his visit to Moscow. The next steps will then have to be considered very calmly. It is now the turn of the Russian side. The FRG Government is interested in avoiding political complications. In view of our previous good cooperation with the Russian side, we are confident that all irritations will be eliminated. [Koch] Is this the Russians' revenge for KGB agent Ames in Washington? [Schmidbauer] I do not rule out that the Ames psychosis is spreading among the Russians, since alleged members of other Western services have also been arrested in Moscow. [Koch] After the end of the East-West confrontation, do we still have to spy on each other at all? [Schmidbauer] In the world as it has developed, it is indispensable that the governments procure information. We need the intelligence services for it. The work of Western intelligence services was and is not an aggressive activity. It is legally controlled.
