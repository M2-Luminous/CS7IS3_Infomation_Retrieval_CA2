The Democratic Party said the Goldstone Commission should release specific evidence about their involvement in third force activities. Lieutenants General Basie Smit and Johan le Roux withdrew from their duties 10 days ago but resumed their duties today. The commissioner of police, General Johan van der Merwe, said their positions would be reviewed if new information was received. The ANC said it was unacceptable that police officers who had been implicated in alleged criminal activities should be allowed to return to active duty until the allegations had been properly investigated. Earlier, Justice Richard Goldstone said that more information about the alleged involvement by policemen in third force activities had been received by him and that the information would be handed over to an international team of investigators.
