He first of all extended, on behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, festive greetings and cordial regards to the fellow comrades and friends participating in the party. He Zhukang said: Last year, we took a solid step along the road of reform and development under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line. We conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the 14th party congress, integrated the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics with Jilin's realities, and defined, at the sixth provincial party congress, the strategic goal of building a developed border near-the-sea province. As a result, the people's ideas were enlightened greatly, and their field of vision was broadened. At the same time, the 25 million people of all nationalities in the province were encouraged to seize the opportunity to accelerate development. The whole province, from higher to lower levels, made concerted efforts to make the province prosperous. The land of Jilin was filled with the scene of spring and vitality. Last year, the province's GNP increased by 14.3 percent over the previous year, financial revenues increased by 24.2 percent after deducting the incomparable factors, the targets on pushing the economy onto a new stage were all fulfilled, new headway was made in science and technology, education, culture, art, sports, public health, press, and publication undertakings, living standards of urban and rural residents improved further, party building and the building of democracy and the legal system were strengthened, good results were achieved at the present stage of the anticorruption campaign, and new headway was made in the building of spiritual civilization. He Zhukang said: Our province is now characterized by vigorous economic development, political stability, national unity, and social progress. All these achievements are the results of the hard work of the people throughout the province under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee. Here, on behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial government, I want to express my heartfelt thanks for the hard work and contributions made by fellow comrades here, the vast number of workers, peasants, intellectuals, soldiers, armed police officers and men, public security cadres and policemen, our compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, overseas Chinese residing abroad, and foreign friends. After explicitly setting forth the basic requirements for this year's work, Comrade He Zhukang stressed: To make this year's work a success, we must further emancipate the mind, strengthen the common understanding, enhance the concerted strength, and mobilize the initiative of all fields. The whole province from top to bottom should truly attend to work and pay attention to practical results. Leading cadres at all levels must actually improve the work style and the method of leadership to do more actual work and stop empty talk. In particular, leading cadres should conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and study and master the theory of the socialist market economy. In line with the requirements of unity, high efficiency, administrative honesty, and practical work, leading cadres should be strict in managing the party and the government in order to mobilize the masses to push forward all undertakings. He Zhukang said in conclusion: In this new year, let us more closely rally around the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its nucleus, and advance along the road of the socialism with Chinese characteristics and toward the magnificent objective of building a developed border near-the-sea province in order to win a new victory in reform, opening up, and modernization drive. At the tea party, literary and art workers in the province staged brilliant performances.
