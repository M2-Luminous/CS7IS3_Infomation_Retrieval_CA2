A law on the status of servicemen was adopted practically without debates and a resolution was adopted to submit the law to the president for signing. If the Russian president signs the law, amendments will be made to Russian laws on pensions, freedom of religion, income tax, tax on property and land, law on employment and the land code of the Russian Federation. These amendments will give a number of privileges in social welfare to servicemen and their families, envisaged by the Russian law on the status of servicemen, taking into account the specifics of a military service. In an interview to journalists after the government session was over, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said that all privileges earlier granted to servicemen will remain in force.
