FBIS4-54481 "dreeu084_i_94018" FBIS-EEU-94-084 Daily Report 2 May 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Continuing Tension Reported in Gorazde Continuing Tension Reported in Gorazde `Veritable Chaos Reigns' AU0205111694 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian 1000 GMT 2 May 94 AU0205111694 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Report by Mustafa Kurtovic from Gorazde] [Excerpt] Fascists from nearby hills carried out provocations against all the defense lines on the Gorazde battlefield yesterday. They shelled the commune's outskirts fiercely, and (Zasevi) and Brdarici in particular. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] unit members are again acting without shame as not a single gesture of theirs shows that they belong to peace forces. Thus, in cooperation with the chetnik hordes, they are trying to evacuate ethnic Serb citizens from the very town center, but at the same time they are settling the 3-km zone with people from Serbia and Montenegro. To what extent the NATO ultimatum is being respected can be seen from the fact that three people were wounded in the town and its suburbs yesterday. A general catastrophe is reigning in Gorazde at the moment. People have no food, no water, and no electricity. There are no medicines or first-aid kits. A veritable chaos reigns here. Chetniks are still positioned 200 m away from the town center and any movement by Gorazde citizens means certain death at the hands of snipers. Two UNHCR convoys that arrived in Gorazde recently can suffice for the people to survive one day at the most. [passage omitted]
