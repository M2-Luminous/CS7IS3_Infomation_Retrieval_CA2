The conference focused on Moscow's position on events in Bosnia. He described the situation there as dangerous. The Russian view, he said, is this conflict must be resolved through an equal cooperation between the United States, Russia, and the European Union, but under UN surveillance. Moscow insists that the parties in the war declare an immediate cease-fire and sit down at the negotiating table. Trusin said Russia also demands and urgent lifting of the sanctions against Yugoslavia. In regard to yesterday's statement by [Deputy Foreign Minister] Churkin that Russia ought to break negotiations with Bosnian Serbs, because of their failure to keep promises, Trusin said it was an emotional remark and added his country's attitude toward the Bosnian crisis remains unchanged.
