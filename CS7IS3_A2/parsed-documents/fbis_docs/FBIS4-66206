According to news releases, reforms are being made in categories of tax classification, tax rates, and tax collection policy. A New Tax System Based Primarily on the Turnover Tax System In December of last year, the PRC announced a set of temporary regulations pertaining to tax collection which are used to set up a new system of turnover taxes. This new system which includes a value-added tax, a consumption tax, and a business tax will be replacing the unified business tax system presently in use. These turnover taxes will apply to all enterprises and the products of their operations. These enterprises include state-owned enterprises, collective enterprises, shareholder enterprises, individual enterprises, foreign enterprises, and Chinese-foreign joint ventures engaged in production, marketing, and management operations from which their income is derived from Mainland China. The taxes are levied against this income. After reforms have been initiated, turnover taxes will include the value-added tax, consumption tax, and the business tax which apply to enterprises funded both by domestic and foreign investment. The value-added tax will be levied on commodity traded and import items, a consumption or excise tax on selected consumer goods, and a business tax on productive labor and service industries, where no value-added tax is levied. According to reliable sources, the value-added tax will be implemented apart from the price of an item; that is, basing the tax on the price of goods without including the value-added tax as the tax base. The taxpayer should take all the income from his orders and combine it with operating income to figure the value-added tax. At the same time, a tax credit system should be implemented where tax noted on the invoice may be offset. All steps taken before goods are sold must be priced according to the notation made on their invoices--whether or not the value-added tax was included. All invoices without notation of tax, or if the invoice used does not meet specifications, or if the invoice is not filled out as specified, no tax is offset. After reforms have been made, the basic rate for the value-added tax is set to be 16 percent, though a lower tax rate of 13 percent will apply for basic food staples and agricultural production materials. The PRC expects to levy a consumption tax on some goods that are specially regulated. Products determined preliminarily to have consumption taxes levied on them include tobacco, alcohol, color television sets, videorecorders, automobiles, limousines, jewelry, air conditioners, refrigerators, gasoline, diesel fuel, firecrackers and fireworks etc. The consumption tax, broken down to 12 categories, will be calculated according to the set quota and the set price for the product. The business tax after reforms is directed primarily toward the tertiary industry, in the fields of transportation, finance and insurance, telecommunications, entertainment, construction and various service industries. For high-consumption karaoke music parlors, a high-rate business tax should be levied on them in accordance with local laws, or based on the volume of business generated by them, as determined by the local authorities. New Classes of Tax Added One feature of the new tax system established by the PRC is the addition of some new classes of tax. -- Real estate value-added tax beginning 1 January. Though the PRC will not tax income from rents on land leased out by local authorities, it does require such income to be included in the fiscal budget for management purposes. However, with respect to domestic and foreign enterprises engaged in real estate operations, not only will a business tax and an income tax be levied on them, they will also be subject to a real estate value-added tax. In the real estate transaction, a four-stage progressive tax rate is used on the value-added tax that is levied on the part of the real estate that has appreciated. The lowest rate of this progressive tax is 30 percent; the highest, 60 percent. -- A tax on trades of stock. The stamp tax presently levied on trades of stock is changed to become a tax on stock trades, at a tax rate ranging from 3 percent to 10 percent, that applies to both buyer and seller. -- A real estate tax and a tax on motor vehicle and boat use by foreign enterprises and foreign personnel, with the possibility that the tax rate and taxes may be raised. At the same time, the local real estate tax and the tax on their permits to operate a motor vehicle or a boat will be canceled. -- A public works tax on foreign enterprises, based on their sales income, at a rate of 0.5 percent to 1 percent. An Increased Tax Burden and the Central Government's Tax Income In explaining this new tax system, the PRC states its purpose is to unify the tax laws, equalize the tax load for all, simplify the tax system, assign rights logically, and iron out allottment relationships, to assure financial income establish a tax system that meets the needs of a market economy. However, in reality, it is achieving two goals: One is increasing the tax load, so that taxes collected, in proportion to the total domestic national product, are increased. Second is that of the total amount of taxes collected, the proportion going to the central government is increased. In Mainland China, about a third of the state-owned businesses operate at a loss. Besides problems to do with the system, an important reason for this state of affairs is the heavy tax load which does not allow enterprises to have sufficient capital to develop new products and improve their techniques. In facing such a great deficit, the Mainland Chinese Government does not exert any great effort to reduce expenditures, cut down on its bureaucratic work force, stop the improper use of public funds for meals, trips, entertainment, purchase of luxury cars etc. As it continues this policy of tax increases on enterprises already reeling from lack of vitality, it is like killing the goose that lays the golden egg. Increasing Contradictions Between the Central Government and Local Authorities Another feature of this new tax system that is being implemented is its stab on the local authorities by clearly stating what are central government taxes, local taxes, and joint central-local government taxes. To assure that local authorities will turn in the central government's taxes on time, it has further ordered the establishment of two tax collecting agencies on the local level--one to collect for the central government, and the other, for the local government. Not only does such a move opt more of local benefits to the central government, it also dilutes the power of the local authorities. This move has led to much dissatisfaction among the locals. Some local areas, such as a few in Guangdong Province, have required enterprises to turn in, ahead of time, their central government taxes that are due on 1 January by the end of December to their local tax collection agency. Some local areas are very unhappy with this tax apportionment system and the establishment of two tax collecting agencies, and are dragging their feet implementing this order. It appears that such contradictions between the central government and local authorities on this tax collection matter will become greater as time goes by. It is serious enough that in several meetings, the PRC's vice premier Zhu Rongji has appealed to all local authorities in asking them to understand and support the tax apportioning system and not allow it to abort.

Note 2: First Year (1994): The central government will levy taxes based on its proportionate share of 60%, but it will return to the local authorities the same amount based on each province's obligation for this year. Second Year (1995): The central government returns to the local government 10% of the tax collected in accordance with the proportional 40% retained by the central government. Third Year (1996): The central government collects the full 60% from the tax system.
