(IHI) has developed the molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) under the NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization) Program as part of the New Sunshine Project of MITI since 1987. Recent significant results of MCFC development are two 50kW class stacks and a 100kW class stack, which is the target of the former phase of the MCFC Program. The 100kW stack is now under power generation test at the Akagi Stack and System Square. Following the development of 100kW stack, a 1MW MCFC pilot plant is planned for construction from 1994, under the Program. 1. Large Capacity Stack IHI has been developing an internally manifolded co-flow type stack, in which the fuel gas and oxidant gas flow in the same direction. One of the advantages of this co-flow type is easy to enlarge the cell area in the orthogonal direction of the gas flow without changing the reaction pattern. With this principal, IHI has developed a rectangular cell with 1m<sup> 2</sup> active area, 560mm length by 1,800mm width, which is called ``tatami type'' owing to its shape. The green tape of the electrode and electrolyte is cast by the doctor blade method, and the electrode is sintered in the electric furnace. The separator is fabricated with stainless steel thin sheets by automatic welding machine. For assembling of the stack, a mechanical handling device has been developed in order to make the accurate stacking speedy. Figure 1 shows the history of the stack development at IHI. The recent results of the stack development are presented as follows. Figure 1. Development Program of MCFC Stack 2. 50kW Stack Test Prior to the development of the 100kW stack, two 50kW stacks were developed. The first 50kW stack had the purpose of establishing the tall stacking technology for 50 cells with 1m<sup> 2</sup> and verifying over 50kW power generation (Figure 2 [figure not reproduced]). This stacks power generation test was carried out in spring of 1992, and successfully generated for more than 2,500 hours with good performance. Maximum power output was 55kW with conditioning of 70% fuel utilization and 150 mA/cm<sup> 2</sup> current density. The second 50kW stack was developed to estimate the stack performance with an intermediate holder and to discuss the stack transportation because of the necessity to transport from the IHI site to the Akagi Square for the 100kW stack. This 50kW stack consists of 25 cells on both upper and lower sides of the intermediate holder, respectively (Figure 3 [figure not reproduced]). The stack successfully generated 55.7kW at 150 mA/cm<sup> 2</sup> current density and 84% fuel utilization. Difference of average cell voltage between upper and lower part of the stack was very small. After the initial power generation test, the stack was cooled down and transported around the IHI factory, and then the power generation test was carried out again to confirm no changes in its performance. 3. 100kW Stack Test 100kW stack consists of two blocks of 51 cells with 1m<sup> 2</sup> active area on both upper and lower sides of an intermediate holder, respectively (Figure 4 [figure not reproduced]). This stack was assembled in May of this year (Figure 5 [figure not reproduced]), and the initial power generation test was carried out in the 50kW test facility. The power output was 62kW at 70 mA/cm<sup> 2</sup> and 44% fuel utilization. After the initial power generation test, it was cooled down and transported to the Akagi Square and is being tested at this time. Acknowledgments IHI intends to pour its energies into the early commercialization of MCFC plants. IHI appreciates the support and assistance of related groups, especially those of the AIST, NEDO, the MCFC Research Association and utility companies.
