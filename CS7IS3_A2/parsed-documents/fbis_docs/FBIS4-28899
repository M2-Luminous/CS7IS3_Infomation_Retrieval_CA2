Division chiefs participated in experts' meetings which began in Tokyo on 13 June, but not much progress seems to have been made there. U.S. negotiators have started spreading word regarding their view that "an agreement on the automobiles talks will be set back until the (July Naples) summit or later" (as stated by Walter Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan). Some officials of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], who are in charge of the trade negotiations, have expressed impatience, saying: "Trade talks on the automobiles sector may be settled at a later time than talks on other priority areas such as government procurement and insurance." Ever since the framework trade talks were resumed, negotiations on the automobiles sector have been continued energetically. Division chiefs held meetings on 2-3 June, and sub-cabinet level talks were held on 10-11 June. Division chiefs met again this week. Despite all that has been going on, not much progress seems to have been made in the talks because negotiators have been unable to hold in-depth discussions regarding objective criteria, which is a key issue in the talks. At the sub-cabinet level meetings held late last week, Japanese and U.S. negotiators considered draft accords proposed by each side as a springboard for discussions. However, it is said that the negotiators have "failed to go as far as to be able to merge them [the proposed draft accords]" (as stated by a top MITI official). Another reason for the lack of progress in the trade talks is that "U.S. negotiators have become cautious, fearing that the trade talks may break down" (as stated by the same MITI official). In the backdrop of U.S. negotiators' lingering with the talks, there is a view arising in some quarters of the Japanese Government that "U.S. industrial circles are pressuring the U.S. Government to be more patient so that greater concessions can be drawn out from Japan" (as stated by a government source). This could be considered an advanced U.S. tactic aimed at irritating Japan, and Japanese negotiators may thus find it difficult to respond to the situation.
