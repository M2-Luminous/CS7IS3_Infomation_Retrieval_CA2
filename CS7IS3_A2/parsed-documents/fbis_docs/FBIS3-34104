While Iran a few days ago concluded the largest naval-air maneuvers of their kind in the Strait of Hormuz, it was announced yesterday that Pakistan is in the process of purchasing a very modern assaultsubmarine from Sweden costing $700 million. Kuwait too has announced that it is currently engaged in negotiations to purchase three frigates from France. Even Iraq, which has almost nothing, has announced the formation of a high-level committee to redirect its strategy toward "the Gulf and beyond." Sources in Washington say that Ukraine has contacted a number of states in the region, offering to sell them a substantial part of its share of the former Soviet Navy, especially assault ships [sufun hujumiyah], destroyers, speed boats, and minelayers. Ukraine is also said to have contacted Iran and offered to sell it one Kilo submarine instead of the third submarine Iran was supposed to purchase from Moscow before the latter changed its position. Until the end of the sixties most states in the region had focused on developing their ground forces, basing their strategies on huge tank battles along the lines of the World War II model. But after that all of them turned to the acquisition of modern aircraft, especially after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The new focus on the naval force is linked to the growing capability to launch missiles from ships against targets deep in others' territory. Western experts have accused Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq of trying to develop chemical and nuclear weapons that can be carried as warheads on medium- and long-range missiles. A team of U.S. experts which will visit Islamabad soon is expected to raise this issue with the Pakistani Government. The United States wants Pakistan to cancel the deal concerning the development of missiles with China and to also sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Prime Minister Bhutto has indicated that she may agree to that in return for Washington's help to build her Navy.
