The president first recalled the mission of the National Security Council then spoke on the prevailing insecurity. [Begin Ntaryamira recording] [passage omitted] Even though the authorized services have not yet given figures on the death toll following the tragic events, there are estimates of about 100,000 deaths. There are indications of a decline in the economic and social sectors. The worst thing is that the situation does not seem to be stabilizing. After the killings in Kamenge and Tangara, our country wakes up daily to witness heaps of corpses, destroyed or burned houses in some areas of Bujumbura, and more particularly in Nyakabiga, Cibitoke, Kinama, and Musage. A climate of suspicion has returned to some boarding schools, notably at Cibitoke, Bururi, Kayanza, and in northeastern and eastern parts of the country. There is still a fear of an external attack. In the western and central parts of the country, local leaders report people are receiving training in weapons handling, while the specter of the Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People haunts some people. All the inhabitants of this country, both nationals and foreigners, need peace and stability in order to restore mutual trust and to live together once again. [passage omitted]
