A draft resolution, endorsed by the council of the State Duma, is to be presented at a plenary session. The parliamentarians, while sharing the main provisions of the presidential message, emphasise that the major task of the State Duma is to provide "legislative support for the development of an intergrated and stable democratic society" where the rights of the individual and citizen are respected, an effective economy functions, the principles of federal relations are consistently exercised, and the rights of nations and nationalities are assured". Apart from considering a draft resolution, the Duma intends to review the enactment of its resolution "On a legal basis for elections to the state power bodies of the subjects of the Russian Federation and local self-government bodies and on the ensurance of the electoral rights of citizens." The deputies are also expected to consider a bill "on a procedure for the provision of military and civilian personnel of the Russian federation for participation in peacekeeping operations or in the restoration of international peace and security and other types of peacemaking activities". [Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 0915 GMT on 16 March adds the following: "The State Duma has again failed to adopt a resolution concerning its stand with regard to President Boris Yeltsin's message `On the State of the Nation' after several days of discussion. "In his message delivered at the end of February President Yeltsin called for a stronger Russian state."]
