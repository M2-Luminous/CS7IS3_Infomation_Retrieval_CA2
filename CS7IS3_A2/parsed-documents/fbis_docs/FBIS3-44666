It has now been decided that among the outgoing officials are Li Youwei, party secretary and mayor of the city; Li Zhuanfang (female) and Li Guangzhen, vice mayors; Yang Guanghui, member of the Standing Committee of Shenzhen CPC Committee and head of the propaganda department; and Liang Dajun, member of the Standing Committee of Shenzhen CPC Committee and head of the public security bureau. The informed source disclosed that Fu Rui, son of CPC elder Peng Zhen, will replace Li Youwei as city party secretary. Fu Rui is currently Standing Committee member of the Guangdong CPC Committee and head of the committee's organization department. It is very likely that the office of mayor will be taken temporarily by Wang Zhongfu, the vice mayor. Li Decheng, general manager of the Shenzhen State-Owned Assets Management Company, and Wang Ju, party secretary of Longgang District, will replace Li Guangzhen and Li Zhuanfang respectively as vice mayors. It has been decided that the new chief of the city public security bureau will be He Jinghuan, former director of the political department of the provincial public security bureau. The new head of the propaganda department is Shao Hanqing (female), who has already taken office. The informed source said that the big personnel reshuffle at the leading level in Shenzhen this time is a rarely seen large-scale personnel adjustment since the founding of the special economic zone. The direct cause is that in the past two years, Shenzhen experienced a series of fires and explosions, exemplified by the big explosion at the dangerous goods warehouse at Clear Water River on 5 August 1993 and the big fire in the town of Kui Yong on 19 November the same year. According to information, the investigation report on the big explosion at Clear Water River, [Qingshui He] prepared by the central investigation team, pointed out that Shenzhen City CPC Committee, Shenzhen City government, and Shenzhen City public security bureau all had responsibility for the incident. Since then, news on a reshuffle of the leading levels of Shenzhen have kept coming. The informed source said that the reshuffle this time is precisely an embodiment of the spirit of "taking responsibility," even though several personnel are retiring due to age, such as Li Guangzhen and Yang Guanghui. Li Decheng, who is considered to be one of the candidates for vice mayor, was transferred from the north several years ago. The Shenzhen State-Owned Assets Management Company, of which he is the general manager, is in fact the chief housekeeper of state-run enterprises in the whole city, and has a very important position. He has recently been promoted to the position of member of the Standing Committee of Shenzhen City CPC Committee. It is generally held that he will replace Vice Mayor Li Guangzhen, to oversee the departments of commerce, foreign trade, and ports. Wang Ju, who is currently the party secretary of Longgang District, was a cadre in Shenzhen when Liang Xiang was the boss, and is considered an "elder having served three bosses," and he has continuously worked in the departments overseeing capital construction. He is also a Standing Committee member of the city party committee, and it is believed that he will take over from Vice Mayor Li Zhuanfang, who has overseen urban construction. Shao Hanqing, who is the new head of the propaganda department of the city party committee, has served as assistant to the mayor, and it is generally believed that she will be promoted to the Standing Committee of Shenzhen City CPC Committee upon the official retirement of Yang Guanghui to become the "strong woman" at the most senior level in the city. He Jinghuan, who has taken over from Liang Dajun, has already moved into his office, and his official position is party secretary of the city's public security bureau; it is expected that he will be promoted to the Standing Committee soon, and will be assigned to the post of the head of the public security bureau by the people's congress next year. Among the outgoing officials, Li Guangzhen, Yang Guanghui, and Liang Dajun will retire, and they will probably go to the city people's congress or the city committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, to take some symbolic posts. Li Zhuanfang has yet to reach the age of retirement, and it has been alleged that she will come to Hong Kong to take charge of the Shenye Group Company. It is still undecided where Li Youwei will go after he leaves the posts of city party secretary and mayor. It has been alleged that he will go overseas. He left Shenzhen at the end of last month, and the official explanation is that he is in Beijing to "undergo surgery."
