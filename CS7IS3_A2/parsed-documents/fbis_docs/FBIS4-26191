It has emerged that changes allowing John Swaine to replace the Governor as President of the Legislative Council last year did not complete the process of becoming law until seven weeks after his election. As a result the validity of up to 125 Hong Kong laws, including the sensitive electoral reforms that form the basis of Mr Patten's on-going row with Beijing, has been questioned by legal experts. The Hong Kong Government and the Foreign Office yesterday denied there was any reason for such doubts, but constitutional experts warned that the unprecedented situation had potentially devastating consequences. A clerical error in the Foreign Office meant the necessary amendments to the Letters Patent and Royal Instructions had not undergone essential parts of the process of becoming law, understood to include being signed by the Queen, before they were gazetted in Hong Kong on February 18 and 19 1993. Mr Swaine was elected President on February 19. Constitutional experts said this suggested the gazettal -- and Mr Swaine's subsequent election -- were invalid. Since the amendments only come into effect when properly gazetted, that would mean they are still not in force. It would also mean Mr Patten constitutionally remains Legco President, and raises doubts about the validity of the 125 laws passed under Mr Swaine's stewardship. "This is not just some technical irregularity, it means Mr Swaine is presiding over Legco without any legal authority," said University of Hong Kong senior law lecturer Dr Nihal Jayawickrama, who spent seven years handling such amendments as secretary for justice in Sri Lanka. "Law making is a very formal process. The whole point of the rule of law is that there are steps which have to be taken in the correct order: what they seem to have done is mistakenly take the final step too early, and then tried to fill in the blanks afterwards." Constitutional expert Professor Peter Wesley-Smith, also a University of Hong Kong law lecturer, said only the courts could now decide if the 125 laws were valid. "There's never been a case on anything like this before: it could go all the way to the Privy Council," he said. The Government yesterday denied that the blunder had "any effect on the validity of anything done in Hong Kong". A Constitutional Affairs Branch spokesman admitted "formalities" relating to the Royal Instructions amendment were only completed on March 24, 1993, and the Letters Patent amendment was finalised even later, on April 15, 1993. However, the spokesman insisted this did not affect the amendments' validity since they were approved in draft by the Queen -- the first stage of the process towards becoming law -- at a Privy Council meeting on December 17, 1992, more than two months before Mr Swaine's election. Despite the spokesman's statement, government officials are known to be privately concerned that the blunder leaves local laws open to challenge in the courts, although they insist any such challenge would be unlikely to succeed. It is understood the administration -- which has known about the problem for more than a year -- privately urged the Foreign Office to correct the blunder, but was rebuffed. Constitutional experts said that only a special Act of Parliament, or a fresh Letters Patent listing all 125 laws, would remove the uncertainties caused by the error. Legislators who, until now, have been told nothing about the blunder, are expected to quiz Deputy Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Leung Chin-man about it at a Constitutional Development Panel meeting tomorrow morning. Panel chairman Andrew Wong Wang-fat said while the mistake was understandable, the cover-up was inexcusable. "This is truly a major foul-up," he said. "They should have rectified it as soon as they discovered the error: the more you try to cover up, the graver it becomes. We now have to see how we can validate everything Legco has done since then (February 1993). Until that is done there will always be uncertainty: this puts all the constitutional reform bills in jeopardy." Legislative Council legal adviser Jonathan Daw, also previously unaware of the blunder, said: "The facts, as presented, appear to be of concern and no doubt members will wish them to be investigated." In London, Labour Member of Parliament Gerry Bermingham will this week table urgent questions in the House of Commons, seeking more information from Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd about the blunder. Mr Bermingham, whose attempts to obtain information on the amendments from the British Government have so far been rebuffed, said he wanted "to dispel the cloud of mystery which the Foreign Office seems to have thrown around this subject". "It is becoming increasingly difficult to ascertain the date the orders came into force. Nobody seems to have copies of the original documents," he said, after the House of Commons library informed him copies of the amendments "seem to be missing". "Questions need to be asked as to when the orders were actually signed by the Queen and what, if any, legislation was passed through Legco in accordance with the terms of the orders. If there was, then there must be a serious constitutional question over the legality of such legislation. [no close quotation mark as published] A list of constitutional amendments, recently issued to legislators in Hong Kong, carefully concealed the error but did admit that: "following approval by the Privy Council, a number of formalities have to be completed before the amendments are ready to be gazetted in Hong Kong". Listed as examples were receiving Her Majesty's signature, affixing of the Great Seal and passing under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet". [no begin quotation mark as published] Dr Jayawickrama predicted the Government would resist taking action to correct the blunder, in the hope that no court would be prepared to strike Hong Kong laws down. But he warned this would send the wrong sort of signals to Beijing. "This is very dangerous, these are constitutional matters and you can't just treat them so lightly," he said.
