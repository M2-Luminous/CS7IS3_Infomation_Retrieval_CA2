FR940620-0-00107 FR940620-0-00029 Comment. The NPRM asked whether the proposed requirement for 50 percent permanently installed assistive listening systems met the needs of persons with hearing impairments and on the costs associated with providing permanently installed assistive listening systems. One commenter requested clarification that the other 50 percent must be accessible with portable assistive listening systems. Several commenters recommended a requirement for 100 percent permanently installed assistive listening systems. These commenters cited operational problems such as scheduling and the inability of staff to locate and set up portable systems. Other commenters preferred portable systems because they believe them to be more flexible, cost effective and easier to replace as technology evolves. Other commenters were concerned that other methods to facilitate communication would not be provided. Response. The guidelines facilitate greater flexibility in the types of assistive listening devices a facility may offer by requiring 50 percent permanently installed assistive listening systems and requiring electrical outlets in 11.8 (Electrical Outlets, Wiring, and Conduit for Communication Systems) and allowing the remaining 50 percent of the rooms to utilize portable devices. The provisions for permanently installed assistive listening systems in this section and for electrical outlets, wiring, and conduit in ADAAG 11.8 is intended to enable a facility to maximize its choices in selecting the most effective method of assistive communication equipment to accommodate persons with disabilities. However, the requirement for 50 percent permanently installed assistive listening systems should not be interpreted as the only method of communication a facility is required to provide. For example, computer-aided transcription might be a more appropriate auxiliary aid for a person who is deaf or has a severe hearing loss. The Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA require public entities to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure effective communication for individuals with hearing impairments, unless it would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. (28 CFR 35.160(a) and 28 CFR 35.164). No changes were made in the interim final rule. Comment. One commenter suggested that language be added to ensure that 50 percent of each type of hearing room designated for public use in regulatory facilities be required to have a permanently installed assistive listening system. The commenter thought that different departments such as zoning or motor vehicles may have their own hearing room. One commenter suggested that mediation rooms be required to have a permanently installed assistive listening system. Several commenters recommended a requirement for assistive listening systems with two channel receiver units to allow a second channel to be used for real time video description for persons with vision impairments. Response. Different departments in regulatory facilities may have their own hearing rooms. If the interim final rule required 50 percent of each type of hearing room designated for public use in regulatory facilities to have a permanently installed assistive listening system, it may result in 100 percent coverage. For reasons cited above, the interim final rule allows some degree of flexibility in accommodating persons with hearing impairments. Mediation rooms would be covered under the requirement for hearing rooms. A hearing room or mediation room is a room where deliberation occurs. In most instances, court proceedings are primarily verbal. However, in those instances where an accommodation needs to be provided to both a person with a hearing impairment and a person with a vision impairment, an additional portable system can be provided. Comment. One commenter requested clarification on what type of alteration in judicial facilities would trigger a permanently installed assistive listening system. Response. If existing elements, spaces, or common areas are altered, ADAAG 4.1.6(b) requires that each such altered element, space, feature, or area meet the new construction requirements. For example, an alteration replacing the public announcement system in a courtroom would require the installation of an assistive listening system. An alteration limited to replacing the judge's bench would not trigger the requirement for a permanently installed assistive listening system. However, if alterations of single elements, when considered together, amount to an alteration of a room or space in a building or facility, ADAAG 4.1.6(c) requires that the entire space meet the new construction requirements. Facilities are encouraged to consider each project as an opportunity to further the accessibility of its facility and should not unnecessarily restrict the scope of work so as to avoid the requirements for new accessible elements or construction. Comment. One commenter thought the language ``designated for public use'' was confusing. Response. As provided in the appendix note at A11.9(2), this section does not require permanently installed assistive listening systems in conference rooms restricted to use by employees, consultants and other invited guests. Nor does this section require such systems in a space which is only occasionally or sporadically used for legislative or regulatory business such as a town meeting held in a high school cafeteria. The term ``designated for public use'' refers only to those areas of a facility in which public debate, discussion or regulation takes place. Examples of hearing rooms or meeting rooms in regulatory facilities would include rooms in which hearings are held on zoning applications or waivers or where town council meetings or school board meetings are conducted. On the State level, a hearing or meeting room might be the committee room in a State legislative facility. In judicial facilities, a hearing or meeting room might be the judge's chambers or a mediation room. No changes were made to this provision. Comment. Several comments were received regarding the number of required receivers. Some commenters felt the required number of receivers should not be tied to the occupant load of each covered room. Other commenters were concerned that the proposed four percent may not accurately reflect the size of the population that may use assistive listening systems and cited a paper on ``Hearing Impairment and Elderly People'' issued in 1986 by the Office of Technology Assessment. Response. The four percent figure is based on a Bureau of the Census estimate of the number of persons aged 15 and over who have difficulty hearing what is said in a normal conversation with another person, excluding those who cannot hear at all. See ``Bureau of Census, Disability Functional Limitation and Insurance Coverage'' (1984-85). However, it should be noted that the guidelines are minimum requirements. If there is a greater demand for more receivers, the Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA requires public entities to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure effective communication with individuals with hearing impairments, unless it would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. See 28 CFR 35.160(a) and 28 CFR 35.164. No changes were made in the interim final rule.
