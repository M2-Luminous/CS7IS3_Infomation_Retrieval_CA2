The ranks of officials at the "power-wielding" agencies are one or two grades higher than those of other public officials with similar qualifications and experience, and have long been a target of complaint for the latter. For instance, a newly commissioned public prosecutor, after two years at the judicial research and training institute and then passing the higher judicial service examinations, is given a rank two grades higher than new public officials in other government agencies who passed the higher civil service examinations. Ranks of officials at the NSP and the BAI are also higher than those at other agencies, while field-grade officers of the Armed Forces are two grades higher than their counterparts in the civil service. To rectify this situation, the administrative reform committee will shortly study the downgrading plan, a committee source said, adding the committee is taking suggestions about readjusting the ranks of officials at power-related agencies. Another source said it would be difficult to readjust downward public prosecutors' ranks because they were set on a par with courthouse judges. The ranks of officials at power-related agencies were upgraded under the authoritarian governments of Pak Chong-hui and Chon Tu-hwan in a bid to strengthen their power base.
