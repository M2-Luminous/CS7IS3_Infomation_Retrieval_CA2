The new draft provides increase of privatisation share of each civilian of the republic to 120,000 manats.

According to the program 8,768 enterprises and objects are scheduled to be privatized in 1994. It makes 14.8 percent of all enterprises and objects of the republic, covers 5 percent of all funds and 3.1 percent of all employees working in the state section. Expenses for privatisations will total 400 million manats in 1994, said the Head of the Committee. According to him, "small" privatization, i.e. privatization of enterprises totalling no more than 200 people, is to complete in 1995. Middle and part of large enterprises will be privatized during 1996-1998. Answering journalists question concerning the delay in the adoption of the program, even after it was signed by President, Abdulsalimzade said that there are people in the highest legislative body and in the ministries and among the leaders of enterprises, opposing the privatization program. The high rank employee of the Committee for Property told TURAN that there are two approaches to this problem in the highest circles. "The part of them want to organise wholesale of state property, the others are opposed [to] privatization at all, referring to the war. "Privatization will not take place until they come to common decision", said the employee. Law for privatization was adopted in Azerbaijan on January 7, 1993. Up to today only 5,000 taximotors [taxicabs] are privatized in the country.
