FBIS4-40029 "drsov113_b_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-113 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political Issues Gaydar, Burbulis React To News Conference Gaydar, Burbulis React To News Conference LD1006181494 LD1006181494 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in Russian at 1625 GMT on 10 June broadcast the nine-minute "Details" program which is presented by Nikolay Svanidze, and reports on the news conference given by President Yeltsin on 10 June. It includes brief interviews given to Svanidze by Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar, Gennadiy Burbulis, former Security Council state secretary, and Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays. The video is confined to these items. Gaydar is asked why the reform process appeared to slacken in the summer of 1992 when he was Russian prime minister. He replies that a "powerful anti-reform coalition" had emerged at that time arguing for money to be pumped into the economy as a way out of the crisis. He points out that inflation was at the same level in 1994 as it was then and output was down by 30 percent. He asserts his faith in the need for reform. Burbulis is asked if he has any advice to give Yeltsin today, and he says he would tell him not to listen to those who were saying that "those young democrats, including Burbulis, know nothing and are not capable of doing anything and cannot be trusted behind your back. I would try my best to warn Boris Nikolayich Yeltsin against those well-wishing loudmouths who, in my opinion, have already been very successful in their work." Burbulis is then asked if a recent press report by correspondent Fedor Burlatskiy alleging that "the decision to divide up the USSR was made by a few young politicians, namely yourself and Shakhray, in a bath house" is true. He replies that he was impressed by Burlatskiy's ability to hide under a bath house bench and imitate a tub, and adds that "no one could ever have thought up a formula for bringing down the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union fell apart." Chubays, interviewed in a corridor, is asked for his reaction to Yeltsin's statement that he should leave Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov in charge of privatization in the capital. Chubays says: "Everything is okay. The situation is like this: I am sure that the transfer of authority over privatization to the mayor of Moscow will lead to all those dramatic results that are already taking place in Moscow today, and will naturally now be intensified. Therefore, I believe that the results will be serious, but my position is clear -- I submit to the president." Svanidze then asks Chubays if Yeltsin's statement at the news conference was a surprise. He replies: "Of course not, of course not."
