He began by removing two questions from the agenda since Cabinet members had not had time to acquaint themselves with them, and by recognizing as correct the criticism of the government expressed by the president at a news conference. The report by the deputy minister of economics on the preliminary results of the first six months of this year bristled with figures. On the basis of them, Yakov Urinson drew the conclusion that the government program for stabilizing the situation in the economy is beginning to bring real positive results, and that any talk of the collapse of the economy or of it being on the brink of collapse is groundless. Without denying the claims of the Economics Ministry, Viktor Chernomyrdin nevertheless cast doubt on the figures on which they are based. As it turned out, statistics today follow the imprecision of the statistics of the Soviet Union, with the difference that if previously the indices received by the State Committee for Statistics were exaggerated in the name of the transient red banner, then now they are underestimated in order to avoid taxes, which also confirms the movement of the economy toward market relations.
