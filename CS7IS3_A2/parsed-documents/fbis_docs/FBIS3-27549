Zhu, also governor of the People's Bank of China, made the announcement in a question-and-answer session after delivering a speech on China's economic reforms in a downtown Tokyo hotel. He explained that instead, the government will establish a unified inter-bank foreign-exchange market to transact money. The new unitary and controlled floating exchange-rate system, based on market supply and demand, was introduced on January 1. Zhu said his government will soon announce details of regulations on foreign currency for foreign-funded firms, adding that they will find no inconvenience in purchasing hard currencies as long as they adhere to deals already struck. On the transaction of renminbi by foreign banks, he said it is still too early to allow them to begin such business in China since the country's banks have not yet transformed to full blown commercial activities. "If we say yes over the renminbi deal now, the Chinese banks will cease to exist," he said. He added that the government plans to change the present banking system and restructure all the banks, except the central bank and other specially designated banks. "This will be done along with the ongoing reforms of state-owned enterprises," he added. The vice premier made a cautious reference to the listing of stocks by domestic firms due to insufficient regulations and said his government is currently not considering allowing foreign firms to list their shares in China. Zhu arrived here Wednesday for a nine-day visit and is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and hold talks with Foreign Minister Isutomu Hata later in the day. He will also travel to western and southwestern Japan to take a personal look at corporate activities there.
