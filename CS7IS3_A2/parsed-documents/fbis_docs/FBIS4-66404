FBIS4-66404 "jpjst016__l94002" JPRS-JST-94-016-L JPRS Science & Technology Japan 29 April 1994 MICROELECTRONICS 64M DRAM 64M DRAM Device Processes 94FE0096B Tokyo NIKKEI MICRODEVICES in Japanese Nov 93 pp 29-37--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0096B Tokyo NIKKEI MICRODEVICES Japanese CSO [Text] The 64M DRAM, which mainly employs a stack cell technology, is not unlike the 16M generation of chips in terms of cell technology, but it does offer three different types of cell structures to choose from depending on storage capacity work. Three companies have adopted the suddenly popular thick-stack structure with thick memory nodes. It is the simplest structure, but there is a wide disparity with peripheral circuits. Changing the array configuration, however, has made it easier to link with peripheral circuits. Three companies have adopted a fin-type cell structure, and four others a round cell structure. Meanwhile, three companies in selecting a trench cell structure have switched to the substrate cell plate format. As for wiring, the number of companies using tungsten in the first wiring layer has increased to four. The through holes are formed at the same time as the second wiring layer, so many companies have designed the holes as large as 0.8�. The main lithography used was the i-line method. Companies also mentioned super-resolution and KrF excimer lithography, but by and large these companies combined those methods with i-line excimers in order to keep down cost. The 64M DRAM chips that have just started being shipped employ, for the most part, the same stack cell technology that earlier 16M devices used (cf. Figure 1 [figure not reproduced], and Figure 2). Among the 14 major DRAM manufacturers,[.sup](1)[/] 11 have selected the stack method. <graphic> <capt> Figure 2. Structure of Thick Stack. This drawing is a longitudinal structural view of the thick stack structure adopted by NEC. The adoption of a secondary/primary word line configuration and 2.4� line spacing in the aluminum wiring enabled the circuits to be printed even with a disparity.</graphic> Two of the companies surveyed reported switching wiring configurations from the two-layer aluminum wiring used in the 16M chips to a single aluminum layer and single tungsten layer, and one other company is reported to be studying the idea of switching to that in second generation chips, including the one company which is the fourth adopting this wiring scheme. In terms of lithography, which has a lot to do with equipment cost, most companies opted to continue using i-line lithography, but there were a few companies who chose to use KrF excimer lasers or super-resolution lithography to print fine or deep contact holes. Stack Cell Structure Offers Variety of Structures Most manufacturers have not changed the cell structure of their chips, whether the stack or trench format, since the 16M generation of chips. Manufacturers have given users the choice, however, of three different cell structures depending on the way in which the surface area is worked (cf. Figure 3). The first cell structure is a "thick stack" in which the surface area is built up with poly-Si storage nodes. The second structure is the fin stack in which the opposite side of the storage nodes are also used, and the third cell structure is the round stack in which the storage nodes are round-shaped. Initially, most of the companies surveyed indicated that they wanted to use new materials such as ferroelectric film or films with a high dielectric constant in the chips, but one of the process specialists working in one of the joint developments said that because the material technologies were behind schedule that the companies opted to use different cell structures instead. <graphic> <capt> Figure 3. Changes in Memory Cell Structure. The diagram shows the changes that have taken place in memory cell structures since the 256K generation of chips. A lot of manufacturers have been using the stack method, but there are still many different options available regarding cell structure. [.sup]*1 [/] indicates that the company has combined that with a rough structure in which the capacitor is made with an uneven surface. [.sup]*2[/] indicates estimates made by Nikkei Microdevices.</graphic> Wanting to form bit lines in flat areas, nine out of 11 companies opted to use a combined shielded bit-line structure in which the bit-lines are made to run under the cell (cf. Table 1). The fact that this structure enables better noise resistance kept most companies away from the twisted bit structure which offsets in-phase noise within the array. Table 2.

All companies surveyed want to develop a chip with an image-oriented memory and a dedicated logic circuit, but very few of the companies have any detailed plans as such. [.sup]*[/]: Estimate made by Nikkei Microdevices; 1G: First-generation product; 2G: Second-generation product The three companies that had been using the trench cell switched to a substrate cell plate. Avoiding Process Complexity The three companies that have adopted the thick stack are NEC, Oki Electric, and Matsushita Electric. Mitsubishi is also studying whether to switch to a thick stack in the first generation chips. Oki Electric has integrated this with a rough structure in which the capacitor is given an uneven surface. One company, Fujitsu, adopted the fin stack. It also appears as if Hitachi and Texas Instruments (US) have selected this structure as well. The four companies that have adopted the round stack include Mitsubishi, Samsung Electronics (S. Korea), Gold Star Electronics, and Micron Semiconductor. Micron Semiconductor also combined this with a rough uneven structure. The biggest advantage of the thick stack, says a NEC official, is that it expands the surface area without making the process any more complex. The official went on to say that the 64M chip was made by almost the same process as the 16M chip. In order to make the most of this, NEC has been trying to resolve the disparity problem, which is one of the biggest problems it faces. It has, for example, built the poly-Si up to 0.8� in order to ensure a 25fF storage capacity and 7C[.sub]B[/]/C[.sub]S[/]. This widened the disparity between the array and peripheral circuits, and widened the disparity even further between adjoining cells. As a way of resolving this, NEC changed to an array structure[.sup](2)[/] and widened the line spacing in the aluminum layer forming the main word-lines to 2.4�. This essentially gave it a better focal depth and resolved the disparity problem. The size of the chip is somewhat larger, but NEC confidently said that this was not a problem because it used the same processes as the 16M chips. The companies that opted for the fin and round stacks did so because they could use the same array configurations as before, and also because they could even use the same structure in smaller second generation chips. Mitsubishi, which used the round stack, and Fujitsu, which used a fin stack, reported that the processes presented equal levels of difficulty. Both the round stack used by Mitsubishi that was built up to a height of 0.5-0.6�, and the two-layer fin stack used by Fujitsu that was built to a height 0.4� were lower than the thick stack. Both companies admit that the 64M chips are larger than the 16M chips, but say that they have been able to avoid using any special complex processes. Still Room for Further Changes However, the choice of cell structures is still in flux. Many chip manufacturers are thinking about making structural changes in both the reliability batch of sample chips and in the second generation chips. NEC, which relieved cell pitch and changed the word-line configuration by adopting the thick stack, says in the second-generation of chips that it wants to use HSG (hemi-spherical grain) technology, if possible, in which unevenly formed poly-Si on the surface of the storage nodes is used to increase the effective capacity of the chip by 1.5 times. HSG is used in conjunction with thick stacks having a height of about 0.5�. This does not change the array configurations in the first generation of chips. Mitsubishi is also studying the idea of switching to the HSG method midway through the first generation of chips as a way to effectively reduce cost if it can be done with the thick stack cell structure. Fujitsu, which adopted the fin stack for the 64M chips, is in the process of studying ways to eliminate one of the fins in order to ensure the required storage capacity. As far as film thickness, all companies surveyed are using an SiO[.sub]2[/] conversion film applied to a thickness of 5 nm. Oki Electric confirmed that a 5 nm film thickness presents no problems even with rough surfaces having uneven storage nodes (cf. Figure 4). <graphic> <capt> Figure 4. Excellent Leakage Characteristic in Rough Stack Having Uneven Poly-Si Surface. A rough stack structure is 2.5 times more effective than an ordinary stack in terms of current leakage. The only area where leakage has been shown to increase is where the surface has been enlarged, but even so, the rough stack structure still meets the 10[.sup]-8[/]A/cm[.sup]2[/] specifications for 64M chips with 5 nm oxide film when 1.5V, or 1/2 V[.sub]cc[/], is applied to the chip. Data furnished by Oki Electric.</graphic> Both Toshiba and IBM-Siemens, which opted for the trench format, switched to a substrate cell plate trench. All three of these companies have been working jointly to develop a 256M chip, but the reason why both made the switch at the same time had more to do with the problems that arise when dealing with a trench structure, and not because they had exchanged technologies. In conventional trenches, the trenches need a large area of separation between them to contain leakage. In the trench structure which these companies adopted, the charge is stored within the trench, so that area was reduced. Moreover, since the cell plates are adjoined to the substrate, it is no longer necessary to have plates at the surface be in contact with the capacitors, thus flatness is improved. The problem with this modification, however, is the fact that the storage nodes within the trenches become gates, and a parasitic MOS is formed between the diffusion layer of the trench and the cell plate. In order to minimize the parasitic MOS effect, Toshiba formed oxide film within the trench to a depth 50-100 nm. Another problem with a trench cell is that the electrodes protrude from inside the trenches. Both Toshiba and IBM-Siemens handled this by erecting pillar-shaped electrodes from the inside. This is because it is much too difficult to ensure reproduction using a method of contact from the wall surface of the trench. Toshiba says that this structure produces less soft error than the stack cell (cf. Figure 5). <graphic> <capt> Figure 5. Substrate Cell Plate Helps Reduce Soft Errors. Soft errors were measured using 4M memory cells. Soft errors depend on the structure of the cell, so this comparison is effective only as far as the 64M. Data furnished by Toshiba. The added acceleration is due to americium. It includes both the bit line mode and cell mode. Toshiba said that the cell mode is small, so it will try to improve the bit line mode in the future.</graphic> Adopting Tungsten Wiring To Lower Cost As for embedding the contact holes, Fujitsu and Oki Electric adopted the idea of using tungsten for the first wiring, a process Hitachi had also used in 16M devices, and in doing so, have eliminated the need for the embedding process itself. Hitachi also seems to be leaning toward this method in its 64M chips. The result in each of these cases has been a reduction in the number of processes. NEC is also studying the idea of using this technique in its second generation 64M devices. Other companies are continuing to use the integrated blanket-W etchback process used in 16M generation chips. The manufacturers who have opted to use tungsten for the first wiring layer say performance degradation, i.e. slow access time, is prevented by the increased wiring delay with materials having high resistance. Fujitsu, for example, which adopted tungsten with word-line backing, prevented degradation by modifying the array configuration (cf. Figure 6). In order to inhibit word-line delays, it doubled the number of word-line divisions. By adding two word-line decoders in central locations along the length of the chip, it cut the length of word-line backing in half. Fujitsu went on to say that the enlarged chip area, due to the increase in word-line divisions, was not a significant problem at all. <graphic> <capt> Figure 6. Access Time Not Slowed With Tungsten. Access time is hardly a problem when tungsten is used for the first wiring layer. Using tungsten causes a 3-4 ns delay relative to a 40 ns operating time. The (a) calculations were done by Fujitsu and the (b) calculations by Oki Electric.</graphic> Toshiba, which opted to embed poly-Si, reported serious contact resistance problems. Toshiba did not embed poly-Si directly, but rather put down a barrier metal of TiN to minimize contact resistance. As for through holes, there were some companies who felt inclined to use an embedding method in the 64M chips, but by and large most companies surveyed decided to stay with aluminum wiring. Toshiba, Samsung, and IBM-Siemens were the exceptions. Toshiba opted for the select W method of embedding through holes, and Samsung went with the aluminum reflow sputter method, which it has used since the 4M generation of chips. IBM-Siemens have started using the CMP (chemical milling and polishing) method in their jointly developed 64M chips. Other than IBM-Siemens, all other companies have reverted to 16M technology. Toshiba, though, is looking into the idea of changing to a method in which the through holes are joined to the aluminum wiring directly. This is because it simplifies the process. Fujitsu and Mitsubishi have each said that they have widened the diameter of the holes to 0.8� in order to adopt this process. Flattening is also a problem as shown in Figure 8 [figure not reproduced]. IBM-Siemens and Micron Semiconductor have both opted for the CMP method. NEC says it is studying the idea for second generation chips. Table 2.

Extending i-Line Life as Far as Possible With companies thinking about cost, most opted to use i-line lithography as the main lithography in the first generation 64M chips. These were divided, however, into those who also used super-resolution methods such as phase-shifting or modified illumination, and those who used KrF excimer lasers. Toshiba favored phase-shifting, but did not use that method in the 64M samples. Toshiba stated that it would like to use the half-tone method if possible to do the contact areas when the chips go into mass-production. To do this, it will have to correct the masks. Oki Electric used the modified illumination method to do the contacts. Samsung said it would like to use the ATOM method which it developed on its own. There is growing recognition that short wavelengths are the best means to produce the fine line widths required in present-day lithography. Samsung says that there is a possibility that the use of KrF excimers will continue to expand. The use of KrF excimers is limited on account of cost to critical layers such as gates and contacts, and the remaining layers are done by i-line excimers. Micron Semiconductor has adopted KrF excimer lithography in its first generation chips, and Mitsubishi and Fujitsu are likely to use it starting in the second generation. There appears to be some progress made in using chemically amplified resists for both stabilization and formation as illustrated in Figure 9 [figure not reproduced]. This technology is too much of a financial risk in terms of initial start-up and operating costs. At the present time, it appears to be twice as expensive as i-line lithography (cf. Figure 10). Mitsubishi tends to favor the use of KrF excimers for the five-layer second-generation chips. <graphic> <capt> Figure 10. Analysis of Lithography Costs. The analysis (a) is that of large foreign and domestic LSI manufacturers and analysis (b) is that of Mitsubishi Electric. Mitsubishi expects the cost to print wafers using an excimer laser to be 1.2 times more expensive than by i-line lithography.</graphic> Addendum A Domestic and Foreign Companies Begin Restudying Al Reflow Sputter Technology Top domestic and foreign manufacturers have begun restudying the use of aluminum reflow technology. In addition to re-examining the use of tungsten to lower cost, a lot of interest has been stirred up over the use of aluminum reflow technology since Samsung Electronics of S. Korea introduced it in the 4M generation of products. In September at the 54th meeting of the Japanese Society of Applied Physics, the USLI Device R&D Lab of NEC and the Basic Process Development Division of Fujitsu announced the use of this technology. Hoping to lower resistance of the 0.6� through-holes, NEC compared two films for a barrier metal, namely, one consisting of a 30 nm Ti layer and the other consisting of a 100 nm TiN layer and a 10 nm Ti layer, and for the wiring material, compared AlSiCu with AlCu. Since the resistance with the TiN/Ti layer was more than 10 times that of the 0.1_O_/[square] Ti layer, the Ti proved to be more effective. The reason was because it turned to an alloy when heated to 450-500�C during reflow. The difference due to the change in wiring material was insignificant. Fujitsu tried to lower the process temperature in order to improve the embedding characteristics of 0.4� holes, and to improve the characteristics of TiN that make it defective at high temperatures. When the pressure was set at 10[.sup]11[/] Torr (1 Torr = 133 Pa), it produced embedded through-holes having 0.4� hole diameter and 2.75 aspect ratio. This was because lowering the pressure during the sputter to 10[.sup]-8[/] Torr kept the angle of incidence of the aluminum particles to within 5�. The reflow temperature was further lowered to 250�C. This was due to a partial pressure of 2 x 10[.sup]11[/] Torr being achieved in the residual oxidized gases such as O[.sub]2[/] and H[.sub]2[/]O which impede fluidity. Addendum B Keeping Distortion Discrepancy to Less Than 0.06� by Joint Use of i-Line and KrF Excimer There are still a lot of problems that remain to be solved in terms of increased production cost when it comes to using i-line and KrF lithography together. These include improving the etching resistance characteristic to narrow the difference between i-line distortion and KrF distortion. Fujitsu, which wants to use both lithographies in its second generation of 64M chips, calculated the degree of allowable difference between the two. It reported that the difference between the two must be kept to 0.06� or less (Matsuno, et al.: Proceedings of 54th Conference of Japanese Society of Applied Physics, Monograph No. 27a-SHF-22, Sep 1993). This study was based on the assumption that KrF lithography was used only to print contact holes, and that the resists used were chemically amplified positive type resists. The study compared i-line lithography to a combination i-line/KrF method to see which could ensure a deeper focal depth. The distortion gap between the lens systems appeared as pattern misplacement. The results of that comparison showed that when the difference between the two was greater than 0.06�, a large margin of error had to be allowed in alignment when printing with KrF lithography, and that the holes had to be designed smaller. The focal depth got shallower even with KrF lithography. On the other hand, with a discrepancy less than 0.06�, the combination of lithographies enabled a deeper focal depth. For example, with 0.35� holes, the focal depth was 0.9� when printed with i-line alone. If i-line was used in combination with KrF with a distortion gap of 0.25�, the focal depth was 1.4�. Footnotes 1. The 14 companies referred to here are NEC, Toshiba, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Mitsubishi, Oki Electric, Matsushita Electric, Samsung Electronics (S. Korea), Gold Star Electronics (S. Korea), Hyundai Electronic Industries (S. Korea), Texas Instruments (US), IBM (US), Micron Semiconductor (US), and Siemens (Ger). These include two joint ventures, namely, Hitachi and Texas Instruments, and IBM and Siemens. There is a possibility that Fujitsu and Hyundai Electronics, which announced in October a basic agreement to work together on the manufacture of 4M and 16M chips, may work jointly together in the future to develop a 64M chip. 2. The main/secondary configuration consists of four secondary word lines (polycides) connected to a single main word line (first aluminum wiring layer). The width of a wiring line itself is equal in thickness to the 2.4� aluminum line spacing. When printing, the focus of the fine patterns is set to match the peripheral circuits. As for memory arrays, the difference in arrays causes a loss of focus, but since the patterns are fat, NEC has reported no electrical problems.
