[Shpek] Primarily, in my opinion, we should pay special attention to the owner. History has shown that a state is an inefficient owner. Thus, we should make all possible efforts to change the structure of ownership. The issue of structural reconstruction of our economy is also very acute, as well as the change of forms of property: Enterprises, which are no longer needed for Ukraine in the present and in the future, should take their choice. No, this does not mean that they must be categorically closed. New owners, new people with their own capital will come, and they will be able to inspire them with new life and change their profile. Great hopes are set here on foreign investments, and everything must be done to create the possibility for the best conditions for such investors. [Trotsenko] However, this requires social and political stability. [Shpek] Undoubtedly. It is necessary to form a new parliament and government, which would have vast powers. I am not sure, however, that we will be able to improve our economic situation befor the first six months of this year. We have to be more thoughtful while developing the future model of our economy. Here is one example: The coke-oven industry is currently not paying the coal industry, and miners are not paying power industry workers. What is the solution? In my opinion, we can unite them in an association. The Economy Ministry has already elaborated documents according to which we can establish financial- industrial groups. We should unite enterprises of the coal industry, thermal electric power plants, metallurgical plants, and machine-building plants that produce equipment for these branches, so that they do not increase prices for one another, but are led by common interests. Otherwise, we will not achieve anything. We must be trusted abroad. Today, we are not, and this relates to Ukraine which owns a great portion of the world's blacklands. At the same time, the average milk yield per cow last year was 2,100 liters. How can butter and other diary products be cheaper today? Obviously, our production costs are higher than usual, and the results are well known. Briefly, there are a great many problems. On the one hand, we will be unable to resist a flood of foreign goods, because our technologies are too poor; on the other hand, competition cannot exist without the liberalization of external economic relations, and without competition, our products will never enter world markets. It should be kept in mind, however, that the United States, Japan, and other developed Western countries also protect their producers. Today, we have to find out how to liberalize prices, improve the quality of our products, and reduce production costs. Prices will then be lower, more moderate. [Trotsenko] Our trade deficit with Russia and other CIS countries is alarming. Can you see any ways to overcome it? What, in your opinion, should be done to achieve a trade surplus, or at least reach the zero mark? [Shpek] It is true that we have a trade deficit with Russia. We should remember, however, that Ukraine was extracting 14.5 tonnes of oil in the 1970's [as published]. Later, there was Tyumen with larger deposits, and Ukraine could buy oil and gas cheaper. Now, I emphasize, this has changed, since the Tyumen oil producers have increased their prices to the world level. Estimating that in Ukraine the yield of gas products in oil refining amounts to 57-58 percent, and in the West to 80 percent, it is not hard to guess that we lose one out of every five tonnes of oil we purchase. The inefficiency of our economy, the inefficiency of our petrochemical enterprises, and intensive use of power have led to a situation when the demand for oil and gas does not decrease as sharply as production. Energy should be conserved considerably. We therefore submitted legislation on energy conservation to the Supreme Council, but it was not adopted. As everybody knows, we are always compared with France, in terms of territory, population, and economic potential. But in France the use of power is five times lower than in Ukraine. This allows France to compete at world markets. We are still not able to do so. Here is another example: A Kharkiv plant has recently begun production of tractor engines. This tractor is 20 kg heavier than other countries' models. Thus, more energy is used for smelting, and other processes also consume higher expenditures. Can we sell this tractor on international markets, where Western companies offer their better and environment friendlier products? Neither Bulgaria, nor Mongolia, nor Poland, nor the Czech Republic, nor Angola would buy such equipment. Moreover, there will be no demand for it in our country either. We must be seriously engaged in the development of modern technologies and Ukraine's participation in conversion programs. This should be done wisely however. There are demands that the Pivdenmash company produce trolley buses. Everybody understands that we need such products. But, Pivdenmash is one of the best space industry plants. Perhaps it is useful to continue such production, since there is a great demand for space equipment all over the world. Therefore, during our recent visit to the United States, we discussed this issue with our American colleagues. It was fortunate that the issue was included in the agreement we signed there. The point is that Ukraine wants to, and will, participate in international space programs. We can earn hard currency on our intellectual potential. We must constantly increase exports if we want our trade balance to reach the zero mark. I recall that the late Yustyn Todorovych Lychuk, a hero of socialist work, had the following slogan in his office: "Economy is rich not thanks to many purchases, but wise expenditures." We also should think about wise expenditures, because we cannot live on credit forever. [Trotsenko] Why does a state, which produces great amounts of raw materials, on whose territory a third of the world's blacklands is located, and which has well-developed metallurgy, machine- building industry, and a great scientific-technical potential, have a foreign trade deficit? [Shpek] I will reply in brief: Because of its low economic efficiency. You understand, even when we sell our products at world prices, they sometimes do not compensate our costs. Almost the entire agricultural production has losses, meaning that costs exceed profits. The same situation exists in the chemical industry. One must remember that not the producer and consumer, but the dealer and customer determine economic policy in a market economy. [Trotsenko] Currently, there are many discussions concerning Ukraine's joining the CIS economic union. What will our state profit, by taking such a step? [Shpek] A union means equality. I support equality, but if we join the economic union, and we obtain prices for oil and gas eight times higher than Russian consumers do, what kind of a union is that? We were discussing free trade with Russia. Russia, however, came forward with an amendment according to which free trade does not apply to oil, gas, lumber, and nonferrous metals. What kind of free trade is this? If it is supposed to be free, let it be free. If it is supposed to be a union, let it be a union. But, it is unfair to use one name and another structure.... I am against such unions. This is simply injustice and discrimination. [Trotsenko] After World War II, many countries stood up on their feet thanks to foreign assistance. Huge investments were pumped into their economies, their industries received new technologies. No country has ever entered world markets unaided. Can we do that? [Shpek] Of course, Ukraine cannot do that unassisted. To implement reforms, to introduce structural reconstruction, and to revive our enterprises we primarily need money and time. It is extremely hard for us to earn money now. We therefore have to attract foreign investors and producers. It should be kept in mind that no country in the world can exist without loans. We should adequately participate in the world's distribution of labor. We can receive substantial funds from foreign partners for our reforms and the development of a strong, independent, and united Ukrainian state. If someone thinks that he will be given money, simultaneously restoring the socialist, administrative, command, and planning economy, his hopes are vain, and he must abandon them. We are obliged to develop our country in friendship and cooperation with all our neighbors.
