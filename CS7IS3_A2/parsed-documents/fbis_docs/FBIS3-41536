This was the result of a meeting of representatives from over a dozen international organizations and East Asian nations to coordinate the fight against seawater pollution in East Asia. The project was sponsored by the UNDP and the Global Environment Foundation (GEF). According to the agreement, the IMO, as an executive body of the agreement, will consult with East Asian countries about personnel training, funding, information exchange and the management of experimental zones. The three-day meeting was held in this coastal city in East China's Fujian Province. Three experimental zones were designated -- respectively in Xiamen, Malacca in Malaysia and Batangas in the Philippines -- to provide other East Asian countries with experience for the comprehensive control of coastal waters.
