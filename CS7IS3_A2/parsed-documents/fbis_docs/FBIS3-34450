Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid told MENA that the United Nations should treat the Arab region as a geographical unit entitled to a permanent seat in the UNSC in the event that the latter's membership is expanded in accordance with the proposal made by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that granting a permanent seat at the UNSC to the Arab group would help boost relations between the Arab World, Europe, and the rest of the World. [passage omitted]
