Subpart T_Disaster Set-Aside Program §1951.951 Purpose. This subpart sets forth the policies and procedures for establishing and implementing the Disaster Set-Aside (DSA) Program. The DSA program is available to Farmer Programs (FP) borrowers, as defined in subpart S of this part, who suffered losses as a result of a 1993 disaster. FP loans that may be serviced under this subpart include Farm Ownership (FO), Operating (OL), Soil and Water (SW), Emergency (EM), Economic Emergency (EE), Special Livestock (SL), Economic Opportunity (EO), Softwood Timber (ST), Recreation (RL), and Rural Housing loans for farm service buildings (RHF). Nonprogram (NP) farm type loans may be serviced under this subpart for borrowers who also have FP loans. FP borrowers have until July 1, 1995, to request disaster set-aside and submit a complete application. Partial applications will not be acceptable. Requests received after July 1, 1995, will not be accepted. §1951.952 General. DSA is a program whereby borrowers who are current or not more than one installment behind on any and all FP loans may be permitted to move one Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) scheduled annual installment(s) for each eligible FP loan to the end of the loan term. The intent of this program is to relieve some of the borrower's immediate financial stress caused by the disaster and avoid foreclosure by the Government. §1951.953 Notification and request for DSA. (a) Notification. The County Supervisor will use Form Letter 1951&hyph;T&hyph;1 to notify FP borrowers of the availability of the DSA program and how to apply. All FP borrowers, as defined in §1951.906 of subpart S of this part, who have not been accelerated and who operated a farm or ranch in a county during 1993 in which a disaster occurred and was declared/designated as a disaster area or contiguous county, as set forth in subpart A of part 1945 of this chapter, will be notified within 10 days of the effective date of this subpart. However, those borrowers whose FP loan(s) has been accelerated, or restructured after a 1993 disaster, will not be notified under this paragraph. Notification of the DSA program will not affect the notification requirements set forth in subpart S of this part. (b) Request for DSA. All FP borrower liable for the debt must provide the County Office with the information described in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section on or before July 1, 1995 to request DSA. Borrowers may only be considered for DSA one time. (1) A written request for DSA signed by all parties liable for the debt, and (2) Actual production, income, and expense figures for the production/marketing period in which the 1993 disaster occurred, unless this information is already in the borrower case file. (c) Eligibility requirements. The County Supervisor will determine whether the borrower meets the following eligibility requirements: (1) The borrower's FP loan(s) has not been accelerated. (2) The borrower operated a farm or ranch in a county declared/designated a disaster area as set forth in subpart A of part 1945 of this chapter or a county contiguous to such an area based on a 1993 disaster. The borrower must have been operating the farm or ranch at the time of the disaster. (3) The borrower has acted in good faith as defined in §1951.906 of subpart S of this part. (4) All nonmonetary defaults have been resolved. This means that even though the borrower has acted in good faith, he/she may still be in default for reasons, such as, but not limited to: no longer farming, prior lienholder foreclosure, bankruptcy, not properly maintaining chattel and real estate security, not properly accounting for the sale of security as agreed, or not carrying out any other agreements made with FmHA.
