FR940622-2-00092 FR940622-2-00067 Rules 1606A(d) and 2107(d) are being amended to provide that OCC's confirmation of acceptance of the clearing member's DVP authorization instruction will be carried out through an on-line confirmation message from OCC to the clearing member rather than by OCC's signature on a DVP form. Rules 1606A(f) and 2107(f) are being amended to provide that the clearing member must deliver to its agent bank a C/MACS-generated DVP report that contains the approved DVP instructions instead of the OCC-endorsed DVP form. Finally, an interpretation is being added both to Rule 1606A and to Rule 2107 to provide that should unusual or unforeseen circumstances prevent a clearing member from submitting DVP instructions by on-line data entry prior to any applicable cut-off time, OCC in its discretion may require the clearing member to submit such item by other approved means, including the use of hard copy forms, and/or may extend the applicable cut-off time. As part of the development of the on-line DVP system, extensive testing was undertaken to assess the operational impact of the new on-line system. Based on OCC's testing of the on-line CVP system, OCC has determined that the implementation of the on-line DVP authorization process should not stress OCC's current processing systems. With respect to security, internal and external controls have been put in place to ensure the integrity of the data and the software of the product. Data security is maintained through security software. In addition, OCC's Security Administration Department develops, reviews, and maintains appropriate security guidelines and standards. The integrity of OCC's operating systems is maintained through limited access to central systems libraries. Physical access to OCC's systems is restricted to those employees that require access. Finally, on-line access is restricted to users with authorized log-in IDs and passwords. With respect to contingency procedures, OCC has adequate back-up procedures in place to ensure the timely continuation of DVP processing in the event that any problem develops with respect to the on-line system. For instance, if C/MACS were not functioning properly, OCC could permit a clearing member to enter the DVP instructions at one of OCC's offices or to submit hard copy forms. Furthermore, if a system failure were to prevent a clearing member from submitting any DVP instruction through on-line data entry prior to any applicable cut-off time, OCC could extend such cut-off time by such period as OCC deemed reasonable, practicable, and equitable under the circumstances. OCC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) 10 of the Act because it promotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions by substantially reducing the paperwork associated with the DVP settlement process. OCC believes that this first step in converting the DVP authorization process to an on-line system will make the system operationally more efficient and will reduce the time delays inherent in a system using paper forms. Furthermore, OCC believes that it has sufficiently considered capacity, security, and contingency issues in its development of the on-line DVP authorization system and that the proposed on-line DVP system should in no way pose a threat to the integrity or security of OCC's current processing systems. 10 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F). B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition OCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants or Others Written comments were not and are not intended to be solicited with respect to the proposed rule change, and none have been received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) 11 of the Act and pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4(e)(4) 12 in that the proposed rule change effects a change in an existing service of OCC that does not adversely effect the safeguarding of securities or funds in custody or control of OCC and does not significantly effect the rights or obligations of OCC or persons using the service. At any time within sixty days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 11 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A). 12 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4(e)(4) (1992).
