The two regulations were jointly announced by the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, People's Bank of China, the State General Administration of Customs and the State Administration of Exchange Control. The move is to ensure the smooth implementation of the reform of foreign exchange management and to provide the information needed to strengthen macro-economic supervision over major product imports. According to the new regulations, automatic registration will be in place for such products as rolled steel, billet, scrap steel, used ships, nonferrous metals (copper and aluminium), plastics materials, paper, fruits, and cosmetics. Under the regulations, the procedures for import registration should be followed for categories including general-import trade, imports based on foreign government or bank loans, mail imports and leasing imports.
