By 1700 hours on 6 March only 23.8 percent of the total electorate had voted. Gasworkers, oilworkers, fishermen, and hunters had not gone to the voting stations, because they had been sitting waiting for their pay for a long time. In order to save the situation, the organizers of the campaign were forced to bring into play various methods of influencing voters. Appeals were repeatedly broadcast on okrug radio, while in some places they actually traveled to healthy people's homes with the ballot boxes. Although, as is known, in former times this practice was reserved for invalids and the sick. So the final total for the number of voters rose to 28.7 percent, which was enough to declare the elections valid. Of the six contenders for the Federation Council, Okrug Administration Head Yu.V. Neyelov won by a large margin. Two well-known people in Yamal made it to the okrug parliament: Vasiliy Tikhonovich Podshibyakin, general director of the geological association, and Kh.M. Yezengi, president of the "Yamal For Future Generations" association. But one seat in the okrug Duma remains vacant. This means there can be no quorum. So, in all likelihood, Yamal can expect yet another election.
