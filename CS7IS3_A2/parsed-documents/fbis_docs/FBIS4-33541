Raul was met upon his arrival at army headquarters by Central Army General Joaquin Quintas Solas. Immediately after arriving, Raul placed a floral wreath at the monument honoring the militia school students who fell during the Bay of Pigs invasion. Politburo member Yadira Garcia, first secretary of the party in Matanzas, briefed Raul and his delegation on the economic, political, and social situation in Matanzas, which sparked a debate on topics such as the efforts made in the recovery of the agricultural-livestock sector, which is currently faced with many difficulties. Colonel Cabrera Valdez, deputy chief of the provincial general staff, presented a report on the main areas of the provincial staff's work in defending Matanzas Province. On this first day of his tour, Raul stressed the importance of the people's defense tunnels and other fortification projects which are aimed at defending the population and maintaining the vitality of the FAR in case of an aggression against our country. With regards to this, Raul expressed his belief that Matanzas City, from the work that has been carried out and the possibilities that its natural conditions provide, could become the first capital city of the provinces to have its entire population protected, if it is not beat by Santiago de Cuba. Santiago de Cuba is currently making a great effort in that area, but Santiago de Cuba has more than 400,000 inhabitants. Raul is accompanied by Commander of the Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque; Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, first vice minister of the FAR and head of the general staff; and other high ranking officers.
