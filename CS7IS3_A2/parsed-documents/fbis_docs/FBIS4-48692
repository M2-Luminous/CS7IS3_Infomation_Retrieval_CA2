This took place last week when one of the three Renamo advisers to the Manica provincial government "delivered" the area to Sussundenga Administrator Antonio Moulinho. Next week it will happen in the Dombe administrative region, also in Sussundenga, a populous area of the district, where corn is produced abundantly and where there are diverse wildlife species. Dombe has been under Renamo control since late 1990, when its men entered without considerable resistance and occupied its capital. [passage omitted]
