Thus, our government is studying measures for this. On 31 January, a relevant government official said that "during the 1991 ROK-U.S. annual security consultative conference, the ROK promised the United States that it would take up an additional $10 million in defense expenses when facilities are expanded in the event of Patriot missiles deployment in the ROK." He added that "this amount, however, was calculated on the condition that the missiles will be deployed on a base in Osan that is already being used by U.S. Forces in the ROK. Therefore, if the United States wants to use another base, it is likely that the United States will demand that the ROK be responsible for a considerable amount of additional expenses." The official noted that "it is not clear at this point whether the United States will use the Osan base when it deploys the missiles or not. However, there is a great possibility that the United States will request a new base or a base in another area to deploy the missiles." The official said that "in that case, the afore-mentioned agreement would be nullified. Therefore, the United States will demand a drasticallly increased amount of defense burdensharing by the ROK in the name of securing facilities and the like."
