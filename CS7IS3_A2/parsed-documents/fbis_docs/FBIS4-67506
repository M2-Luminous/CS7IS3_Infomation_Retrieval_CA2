Litus video report; from the ``Dalniy Vostok'' program] [Text] What is to be done with the radioactive waste which has accumulated in great quantities in our kray is an ominous issue which does not seem to leave newspapers and television programs these days. The tanker TNT 5 filled with radioactive water is still moored at Zvezda in Bolshoy Kamen. Furthermore, the condition of the vessel is such that there is no guarantee the death-dealing contents will not spill out into the bay in the near future. This would be an ecological catastrophe. [video shows a nuclear submarine in dry dock, a rusty tanker, a person testing radioactivity in the presence of a naval officer, and a group of people inspecting the tanker] Until recently, the liquid radioactive waste was simply poured into the sea. Now, thanks to the active protests of the world community, such dumping is forbidden. What are weto do? The Japanese Government is offering to help us solve this problem. Representatives of the neighboring states arrived in the Maritime Kray, and together with our government representatives and specialists they visited Bolshoy Kamen, after which they held a meeting at the kray administration. However, this conference gave rise to a strange feeling. The sensation was that the terrible misfortune hanging over the Maritime Kray concerns the Japanese Government far more than the Russian Government. The Japanese say they are prepared to try various approaches, allocate millions of dollars, and build and assemble installations to process the radioactive waste. However, they need assurances. Where, when, and what will be the degree of Russian participation? From Russia there is only incomprehensible haggling and no assurances. [video shows a meeting of Japanese and Russian officials, then cuts to show Litus interviewing Ye.I. Nazdratenko, leader of the Maritime Kray administration] [Begin Nazdratenko recording] You know very well that the people of the Maritime Kray have voted overwhelmingly for the new Constitution. They set a Russian Federation record; 72 percent of Maritime Kray voters cast a ballot. No other part of the country did that. Maritime Kray once again proved its maturity and citizenship. Maritime Kray residents once again underscored that there should be integrity in Russia as stated in the Constitution. The representatives of the federal authorities here today said: you are here, it is your problem and you have to solve it. I get the impression that the Maritime Kray residents are like a dog which is kind and devoted to its master. No matter how much the master abuses, humiliates, or hurts it, this dog always crawls back to its master. It crawls and crawls to prove its devotion to the master. The master, who is in an inexplicable state at that moment, simply kicks it in the face with his boot and pushes it away, saying I do not want you, so go away. The situation here strongly reminds me of this analogy. Just look for yourself! The problems here are your problems, they keep saying. At the same time, they have weighed us down with customs duties, tariffs, and all kinds of conditions on maritime operations. Here we have to implement the state system, laws, and all the rest of it. This worries me very much and makes me guarded, although naturally we will continue to fight for Russian integrity and unity. I am for one president and one political authority in the Russian Federation, and that all territories should have completely equal rights as subjects of the federation in accordance with the Constitution. Presently this is not happening at all. [end Nazdratenko recording]
