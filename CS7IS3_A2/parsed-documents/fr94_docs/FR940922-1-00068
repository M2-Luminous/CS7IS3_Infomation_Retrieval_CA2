FR940922-1-00068 FR940922-1-00009 (2) If the sponsor does not provide certification, the sponsor must disclose the specific financial arrangements made with the clinical investigator, the investigator's proprietary and equity interests in the tested product and the sponsor's company, and describe steps taken to minimize the potential for bias in data submitted in support of product applications. If a statement of certification or disclosure does not accompany an application containing clinical data, the agency will refuse to file the application. The agency believes that clinical investigators are responsible for providing the sponsor with sufficient accurate financial information to allow preparation of complete and accurate statements and is proposing to require that investigators make such information available to sponsors. Disclosure and certification requirements will extend not only to the clinical investigator, but also to the investigator's immediate family (i.e., spouse and dependent children). Although this proposed regulation applies only to submissions for human drugs, biological products, and devices, sponsors also submit data from independent clinical investigators_i.e., clinical investigators who are not the sponsor's employees_in support of submissions such as food and color additives, infant formulas, health claims, and animal drug applications (i.e., studies involving animals that are equivalent to clinical studies). The agency will also propose to apply these requirements to submissions for marketing approval related to human foods, animal foods, and animal drugs in a notice to be published in a subsequent issue of the Federal Register . B. The Certification Statement The agency is proposing in ยง54.4(a)(1) the following language for use by sponsors as a certification statement: With respect to all covered clinical studies [or to specific clinical studies listed below] submitted in support of this application, I certify that (name of applicant) has not entered into any financial arrangement with any clinical investigator, whereby the value of compensation to the investigator to conduct the study could be affected by the outcome of the study. I also certify that each clinical investigator was required to disclose to (name of applicant) whether the investigator had a proprietary interest in this product, or a significant equity interest in (name of applicant), and that no such interests were disclosed. I further certify that the investigator was not the recipient of significant payments of other kinds as defined in 21 CFR 54.2(f). For purposes of this statement, a clinical investigator includes the spouse, and each dependent child of the investigator as defined in 21 CFR 54.2(d). This certification is made in compliance with 21 CFR part 54. C. Rationale for the Proposal In developing this policy, FDA met with representatives of numerous scientific and health care organizations, as well as industry, consumers and other Government agencies. On September 9, 1993, FDA's Science Board convened a public meeting to discuss financial disclosure by clinical investigators. There was general support for development of this policy expressed at the meeting by board members and most public speakers. The following Government groups were represented at the meeting: PHS, the National Institutes of Health, NSF, and the National Academy of Sciences. The discussion included updates by representatives of these government agencies on the development of their policies and rules pertaining to conflict of interest and financial disclosure. Presentations were also made by the American Medical Association, the Society for Clinical Trials, the American Federation for Clinical Research, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Health Research Group, the National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Service Organizations, the Women's Health Network, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, and the Health Industry Manufacturers Association. The Biotechnology Industry Organization submitted a written statement to the Board. In addition, FDA met informally with organizations representing major segments of the regulated industry, consumer organizations, professional societies, and investigators. During the meetings, the following issues were discussed: (1) The identification of financial arrangements that have the potential for generating bias; (2) the extent of disclosure by clinical investigators to sponsors; (3) the impact of public disclosure of clinical investigators' financial interests; and (4) to whom a requirement for disclosure of financial interests might apply (e.g., the investigator's immediate family, significant business partners). Financial arrangements discussed included payments in the form of equity, such as stock and stock options, and compensation tied to the sales of the product, such as royalty interests. From these informal discussions, it appears that in most cases clinical investigators are not asked by sponsors to divulge any financial interest held by the investigators in the sponsoring firm prior to performing a clinical study.
