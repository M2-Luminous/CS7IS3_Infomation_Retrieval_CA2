FR941103-0-00055 FR941103-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF STATE Bureau of Consular Affairs 22 CFR Part 40 [Public Notice 2110] Refusal of Diversity Immigrants AGENCY: Bureau of Consular Affairs, Department of State. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: On March 31, 1994, the Department published a final rule to implement the provisions of sections 201(a)(3), 201(e), 203(c) and 204(a)(1)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, relating to Diversity Immigrants. There was an inadvertent omission in that publication. This final rule rectifies that omission by promulgating a new section 40.105. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Cornelius D. Scully, III, Director, Office of Legislation, Regulations, and Advisory Assistance, Bureau of Consular Affairs, (202) 663&hyph;1184. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Public Notice 1925 at 58 FR 68791, December 29, 1993, proposed amendments to 22 CFR Parts 40 and 42 to implement section 201(a)(3), 201(e), 203(c), 203(e)(2), and 204(a)(1)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, relating to Diversity Immigrants. Public Notice 1973 at 59 FR 15298, March 31, 1994, published the final rule. The Department has belatedly realized that one proposed amendment was not included in the final rule. In the proposed amendments the Department included a proposal to establish a new ยง40.104 incorporating into regulation the statory authority to refuse an application for a diversity immigrant visa under section 203(c) if the applicant does not meet either the education or work experience requirement. Section 203(c)(2) specifies that an alien is not eligible to receive a visa under section 203(c) unless he or she has either at least a high school education or its equivalent or, within the last five years, has had at least two years work experience in an occupation requiring at least two years of training or experience. There is thus a clear statutory mandate to refuse an application for a diversity immigrant visa if the applicant does not meet that requirement, even though this is couched in terms of eligibility requirements that must be met, rather than in terms of a refusal ground. For this reason, the Department proposed to add a new section 40.104 for this purpose. None of the commenters on the proposed regulations commented on this proposed new section, presumably because it was correctly understood to be merely a technical refinement without substantive effect on the interpretation and application of the underlying statutory provisions. For reasons not now clear, proposed section 40.104 was not included in the final rule. Since then the Department has recently promulgated a different new section 40.104 in connection with the implementation of section 506 of Public Law 103&hyph;317, an unrelated provision. As a result, the Department is now publishing the text of what was originally proposed to be section 40.104 as section 40.105. List of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 40 Aliens, Documentation, Immigrants, Refusals, Visas. Accordingly, 22 CFR Part 40 is amended as follows: PART 40_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 40 continues to read: Authority: Sec. 104, 66 Stat. 174, 8 U.S.C. 1104; Sec 109(b)(1), Sec. 131 of Public Law 101&hyph;649, 104 Stat. 4997. 2. Part 40 is amended by adding a new ยง40.105 to subpart K to read as follows: ยง40.105 Applicant for immigrant visa under INA 203(c). An alien shall be ineligible to receive a visa under INA 203(c) if the alien does not have a high school education or its equivalent, as defined in 22 CFR 42.33(a)(2), or does not have, within the five years preceding the date of application for such visa, at least two years of work experience in an occupation which requires at least two years of training or experience. Dated: October 25, 1994. Mary A. Ryan, Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27118 Filed 11&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4710&hyph;06&hyph;M
