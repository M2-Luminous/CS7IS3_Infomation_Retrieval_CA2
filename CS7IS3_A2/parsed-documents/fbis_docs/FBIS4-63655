Speaking of the Tuesday [24 May] meeting of the parliamentary delegations of Ukraine and Crimea in Kiev he voiced hope for its fruitfulness. Unlike the executive branch of power, Meshkov said, the Ukrainian parliament has not taken steps violating the constitution. Answering a question about the most favorable and the most unfavorable course of developments the president said:"The most favorable forecast is that we will resolve our problems over the holiday season, the most unfavorable -- the refusal of Russia to be involved in the settlement of the Crimean problem." At the same time he said that the last option is so improbable that there is no need to worry. Answering a question about the possible reaction of the Crimean administration to the use of force by Kiev Meshkov said the steps of the Crimean leadership are clearly regulated by the Crimean Constitution and laws.
