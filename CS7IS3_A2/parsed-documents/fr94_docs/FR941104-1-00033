FR941104-1-00033 FR941104-1-00006 The mountain areas with south or southwest slopes, such as those generally found in the Howell Mountain viticultural area, receive approximately 20 percent more solar radiation during the growing season compared to the valley floor. Northeast and northwest slopes, such as those that typically occur in the Spring Mountain District viticultural area, receive approximately 20 percent less solar radiation than those found on the valley floor in the proposed St. Helena viticultural area. In addition to these differences related to aspect, the relative absence of fog in the higher altitudes increases the solar radiation there compared to the valley floor which often is covered by early morning fog. According to the petitioner, precipitation has been more important in the formation of topography and soils in the Napa Valley than in the definition of distinct climate zones. Outside of annual physiological water needs which are almost exclusively augmented by irrigation, precipitation directly affects grape vines during late spring and early fall, which are the critical periods of the growing and harvest seasons. Cooler areas, those generally found to the south of the St. Helena appellation, are more negatively affected by such conditions. Soils, Geology, and Physical Geography The proposed St. Helena viticultural area is in the northern Napa Valley and is defined by the petitioner as the valley floor area and lower mountain slopes (i.e., toe-slopes) from Zinfandel Lane in the south to Bale Lane in the north. According to Dr. Elliott-Fisk, the geology of the St. Helena area is characterized by steep mountain fronts composed of the (1) Franciscan Formation (largely sandstones, mudstones and various metamorphic inclusions) overlain by the moderate thicknesses of Sonoma Volcanics on the west side in the Mayacamas Range, and (2) deep flows of Sonoma Volcanics, volcanic vents, and volcanic domes over Great Valley sandstones on the east side in the Vaca Range. Both mountain slopes have been faulted and heavily eroded, with much of this activity believed to be synonymous with the formation of the Sonoma Volcanics in the last 2-5 million years. Dr. Elliott-Fisk further states that the topography of the Napa Valley floor is largely the product of (1) the marine incursion of San Pablo Bay, and consequent marine erosion and deposit, (2) tectonic uplift and land displacement along faults and fold structures (e.g., anticlines), (3) bedrock resistance to erosion, (4) slope stability, and (5) discharge volumes of the Napa River and its tributaries. The proposed St. Helena viticultural area, extending from Bale Lane on the north to Zinfandel Lane on the south, has a fairly uniform, steep gradient (as compared to the entire Napa Valley floor), indicating that it is a zone of erosion of a former more powerful Napa River. The valley in this area is narrow and is almost entirely the product of river erosion, unlike any other stretch of the valley floor. The one break in gradient occurs where the river turns southward near Big Tree Road (just south of Bale Lane) and exerts more force to cut through bedrock. Thus, although alluvial fans extend across the valley floor from their tributary canyons to the Napa River, the fans are small and relatively young compared to the rest of Napa Valley. Sulphur Creek fan is the largest of the group, as it issues from a very large drainage basin. Fans of the eastern side of the proposed appellation are very small, largely due to the resistance of obsidian (i.e., volcanic glass) bedrock here and small tributary basin size. The topographic uniformity of the proposed St. Helena viticultural area is further substantiated by climatological data and bioclimatic maps. Growing degree-days (i.e., temperature regime), according to Dr. Elliott-Fisk, are very uniform along this stretch of the valley floor and lower slopes, averaging just under 3600 degree-days. Mean annual precipitation is 35-38 inches. Just north of the proposed northern boundary of the St. Helena viticultural area (e.g., around Dunaweal Lane), the vegetation changes from Valley Oak Savanna to Mixed Hardwood Woodland. These gradients of climate and vegetation from south to north up Napa Valley, according to the petitioner, further support the designation of viticultural areas, as climate is an important factor influencing vine growth and fruit characteristics, with natural vegetation telling the viticulturalist what vine production will be like.
