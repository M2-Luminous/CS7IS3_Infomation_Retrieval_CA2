The reason for this was Mayor A. Sobchak's directive No. 303-r "On the VECHERNIY PETERBURG Editorial Office," which some organs of the mass media have regarded as a all-out attack on the freedom of the press, while others have seen it as the authorities' natural and inalienable right. The VECHERNIY PETERBURG labor collective has decided to go to court to protest what, in editorial office's opinion, is an unjust verdict by the mayor. At a specially convened press conference, VECHERNIY PETERBURG's Chief Editor V. Mayorov judged the appearance of directive 303-r to be a reaction by the authorities to a series of hard-hitting pieces in VECHERNIY PETERBURG which, in his opinion, gave rise to a desire in the powers that be to tame this recalcitrant publication. He regards as an illegal bureaucratic action the point in the directive in which the mayor gives instructions for a scheme to be produced by 15 April to privatize the newspaper VECHERNIY PETERBURG's property, stipulating that no less than 20 percent of the value of shares be made the property of St. Petersburg for a period of three years. Mayorov considers that if the state does have some right to VECHERNIY PETERBURG's property, it is to the closets and chairs from 1925 and the decrepit typewriters which it actually did supply to the editorial office once. Many perplexing questions have been raised in the minds of VECHERNIY PETERBURG's editorial office by the point in the document signed by the mayor which talks about holding a "city-wide contest for the post of leader of the paper VECHERNIY PETERBURG's editorial office" in the period up to 15 May. Nobody can grasp what powers this "leader" has and why such a post is being established when there is at present a perfectly good chief editor elected by the labor collective, and this is regarded as an attempt by the mayor to make a resolute decision to move staff about in VECHERNIY PETERBURG. But later at a press conference in the Smolnyy, D. Mezentsev, chairman of the city hall committee on the press and the mass media, explained in detail the city authorities' position. He reminded us that the idea of selling shares in newspaper enterprises came into being last fall at a meeting of editors of several St. Petersburg and central newspapers. The mayor's directive of 26 November fixed these views and ruling 303-r was issued to develop the idea privatizing St. Petersburg's newspapers. At the present time, the committee chairman emphasized, VECHERNIY PETERBURG's property and that of other publications in St. Petersburg belongs to the committee for managing municipal property -- that is, it is 100 percent state property. As concerns the city-wide contest for the post of VECHERNIY PETERBURG's leader, it is a question here of a managing director, a manager, and not at all of a chief editor.
