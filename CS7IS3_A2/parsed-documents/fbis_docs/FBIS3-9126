At the end of the marathon debate, just before the vote was taken, Prime Minister-designate Mirko Marjanovic addressed the assembly. [Begin Marjanovic recording] This long debate has strengthened my conviction and my resolve to adhere to the main course of the program and the stable dinar. We do not see an alternative to this program, because by establishing monetary sovereignty and macroeconomic stabilization, it paves the way toward a modern market economy which is the only thing that will lead to a lasting increase of the national revenue, employment, and the citizens' living standard. We are aware of all the difficulties. Do not expect us to conduct a policy which would take us back into hyperinflation or into an administrative economy and society. We believe that this year, the policy of a stable dinar will motivate and economically compel a great number of companies to be more successful despite the sanctions. It is a good omen that the business community itself is now displaying more optimism and is announcing an increase in orders, production, greater use of equipment, and an increase in export. We anticipate that all this, accompanied by a successful agricultural year, will give us the chance to see -- after a hiatus of several years -- a rise in the national revenue, in stable, therefore, not inflatory conditions. As far as our resolve to insist on a stable dinar is concerned, this government will do its part of the job and will cooperate closely with the Federal Government, the Montenegrin Government, and, of course, with the Yugoslav National Bank regarding all issues that fall within their respective domains. The government will treat every failure connected to the program as its personal failure. We shall organize ourselves in such a way that we will be able to follow the implementation of the program on a daily basis and make the necessary adjustments. We shall regularly inform you of this. We accept all criticism and suggestions that can help the implementation of the program. [end recording] In addition to the prime minister, the new republican government comprises five deputy prime ministers, 20 ministers, and another four ministers without portfolio.
