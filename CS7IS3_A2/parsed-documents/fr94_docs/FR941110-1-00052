FR941110-1-00052 FR941110-1-00010 Walla Walla Sweet Onions have a very limited marketing season (June to early August) and prices customarily begin to decline rapidly over the season. Proponents believe an education and advertising campaign would help increase the public's awareness of this specialty onion with the objective of expanding the market and increasing consumption of Walla Walla Sweet Onions. Paid advertising with an identifying mark would assist in clarifying and maintaining the Walla Walla Sweet Onion's image in the marketplace in a way not available through other forms of promotion or publicity. Also, Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers face larger and better funded competition. Testimony indicates that paid advertising is necessary for the industry to be competitive and maintain or increase its market share. Testimony also indicates that advertising could have a positive influence on the demand for Walla Walla Sweet Onions, particularly in times of heavy supply, thereby tending to increase grower returns. Market promotion programs, including paid advertising, for Walla Walla Sweet Onions carried out with funds collected under the proposed program, would be generic in nature and would not use particular name brands, handler or producer names, or favor any particular portion of the production area. In addition, any promotional material or advertising would not be authorized to make false or unwarranted claims on behalf of Walla Walla Sweet Onions. Nor would such material be authorized to include statements that disparage other agricultural commodities. The record does not indicate the amount of assessment funds that may be allotted for research and promotion programs. The committee should have the responsibility to determine the amount of funds spent on each program each year. Such determination should be based on the needs of the industry each year. The amount of funds to be spent on research and promotion programs would be included in the annual budget required to be submitted to the Secretary for review and approval. All research and promotion projects to be conducted under the order in a given fiscal period should be submitted by the committee to the Secretary for approval prior to being undertaken. This will ensure that all projects are appropriate given the order's authority, and that sufficient funds will be available for their funding. Further, the committee should be required to report at least annually on the progress of each project and at the conclusion of each project. Such reports should be made to the Secretary. (e) In accordance with proposed §956.61, the committee should have the authority to recommend regulations to the Secretary, whenever it believes that regulations issued pursuant to proposed §956.62 regarding container markings would be appropriate. Also, the committee should be authorized to recommend to the Secretary the amendment, modification, termination, or suspension of any regulation issued under this part, when deemed necessary. The committee should also be permitted to recommend modification, termination, or suspension of any regulation or amendment thereto to facilitate the handling of Walla Walla Sweet Onions for special purpose handling pursuant to proposed §956.63, regarding handling for specified purposes. The committee should have the authority to recommend to the Secretary rules and regulations for fixing the markings of the containers used in the packaging and handling of Walla Walla Sweet Onions. This could include a logo or other markings that would identify the contents of such containers. Such a logo or other marking would be small enough to be used in conjunction with the handler's own label, so that handlers would not have to incur the cost of having existing labels remade. As set forth in proposed §956.63, there should be provision for handling Walla Walla Sweet Onions in other than fresh market channels differently than those for the fresh market. It would authorize the Secretary, whenever it is found that it would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act, to issue regulations, suspend or terminate assessment requirements, container marking regulations, or any combination thereof, to facilitate the handling of Walla Walla Sweet Onions for other than fresh market uses. Such uses would be for relief or charity, livestock feed, planting and/or plants, salad onions, and all processing uses including canning, freezing, pickling, peeling, dehydration, juicing, or other processing. In addition, shipments for disposal, for packing and storing within the production area or to specified areas outside the production area in Washington and Oregon, or for other purposes which may be specified are included. Requirements for special purpose shipments would be intended to ensure that shipments of Walla Walla Sweet Onions for these uses would not be diverted to the fresh market. Shipments for relief, charity, or livestock feed would not compete with fresh market shipments in the market place. Onion plants are too small to be used as a food product. Salad onions, i.e., immature Walla Walla Sweet Onions of smaller sizes, usually 11/2 to 2 inches in diameter, would not normally be regulated in the same way as fully mature, dry bulbs. Onions for canning and freezing are exempt from regulation under the authority for this part, and onions of such poor quality that they must be destroyed would not be marketable in any case. Shipments for storage both within and in specified locations outside of the production area would be handled as special purpose shipments with suitable safeguards. Such safeguards might be in the form of handler reports and would include such information that the committee would deem adequate to ensure compliance with program provisions. Other safeguards, unforeseen at this time, might be needed to assure program compliance and prevent abuses. Hence, the committee should be provided the flexibility to recommend, with approval of the Secretary, other safeguards as needed. There should be authority under proposed §956.64 to establish minimum quantities of Walla Walla Sweet Onions that would not be subject to regulation under this part. Testimony indicates that this quantity should be recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary. Such quantities would not be subject to the requirements set forth in §§956.42, 956.62, and/or 956.63. Such quantities usually are too small to affect the overall marketing of Walla Walla Sweet Onions. In accordance with proposed §956.65, the Secretary should notify the committee of each regulation issued, and of each amendment, modification, suspension, or termination thereof, and the committee would give reasonable notice of such action to handlers subject to this part. Such notification would be necessary for the efficient operation of the marketing order. The committee should be able to issue appropriate rules, regulations, and safeguards in connection with shipments for specified purposes and minimum quantity shipments. Such rules and regulations should authorize the use of appropriate safeguards under proposed §956.66.
