The Senate president in the Second Republic and a member of the National Constitutional Conference Commission, Dr. Joseph Wayas, gave the warning at a news briefing in Abuja today. Dr. Wayas drew the attention of politicians to the fact that even the military, who were forced out of their posts by their colleagues, have refrained from using force to insist on returning to power. He stressed the belief that the crisis surrounding 12 June which the country was currently facing was created and promoted by those who think Nigeria could not survive unless they were in power. Dr. Wayas stressed the need for those he called campaigners of disorder to reflect on the fortitude, forebearance, and sense of responsibility displayed by media political actors who came before them. He condemned the recent statement credited to the president of the defunct Senate, Mr. Ameh Ebute, in which he declared the Provisional Ruling Council and the government as illegal. The former Senate president, who noted that the Senate of the ill-fated Third Republic had no legal standing, wondered why those who participated in illegality should speak of the illegality of any administration.
