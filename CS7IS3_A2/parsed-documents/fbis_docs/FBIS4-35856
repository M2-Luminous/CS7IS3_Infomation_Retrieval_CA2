He also spoke about the government's interest to improve employees' general performance and conditions. [Al-'Anani] [passage omitted] Regarding the prevailing Arab conditions, many of the brothers wonder, for example, about current developments in the Yemeni issue. As you know, at the request of the disputing Yemeni parties, the two parties came to Jordan about seven months ago and asked Jordan to mediate among the parties concerned. When Jordan mediated in the Yemeni issue, it did not do to impose its role, but was basically in response to the requests of our brothers in Yemen. Jordan cannot but accept the Yemeni legitimacy. This is because this legitimacy was not imposed by any Yemeni party on another party, but was the result of a purely internal Yemeni process in which the leaders of the north and south agreed to unite their country. They have also taken the necessary measures for this, including the amendment of the Yemeni Constitution and the holding of free elections in Yemen. This has given legitimacy to all Yemen through its recognized leadership which passed through all the constitutional and legal stages. Therefore, Jordan recognizes the Yemeni legitimacy which was approved by all the institutions of the Yemeni people, in accordance with which the Yemeni people adopted measures which led to the creation of the united Yemeni institutions. This process was basically continuing. Jordan will continue to be with the legitimacy in Yemen until something else is decided by an Arab consensus or anything else. But, for us, we do not fight anyone, we do not stand against anyone, and we do not have any political agenda in Yemen. However, we are with the legitimacy because this is an entrenched and basic Jordanian principle. We must not open the door for casting doubts on the legitimacy of states because this will be a precedent that could lead to bad consequences. In the presence of his majesty the king, some ministers reviewed their various visits which you might know of. Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, deputy prime minister and minister of higher education, reviewed his visit to Syria and his meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad, who stressed the need for cooperation and integration with Jordan. At the same time, he emphasized his deep relationship with His Majesty King Husayn, and the need to upgrade the level of cooperation in the economic and political fields between the two countries to the highest possible level. The higher joint committee is expected to meet soon to discuss economic issues and other areas of cooperation, culture, youth, information, and education. The interior minister also reviewed his visit to Iraq and his meeting with President Saddam Husayn, which came at the Iraqi leadership's request. In fact, the interior minister went there to discuss some issues related to the Jordanian nationals in Iraq. He found a great response from the Iraqi officials in this respect. The minister of state for foreign affairs also reviewed his participation in the nonaligned foreign ministers' conference in Cairo, and his meetings with the officials there. The major point that was discussed was the future of the Nonaligned Movement, particularly following the changes in the balance of powers in the world which left the United States at the top of the pyramid of international power. It seems that the discussion has not led to very clear results toward which we can adopt a clear stand. Of course, this was an opportunity to meet with some Arab foreign ministers. I believe that the minister of state for foreign affairs spoke about this after his return. We also listened to a report by the telecommunications minister, who attended the second phase of ARABSAT, and the meeting of the ARABSAT board of directors. The reason which led to the stumbling of this project, particularly the second phase of it, was that the launching of Ariane, the French missile, was not successful. It was supposed to carry a new Arab station. In this regard, we have instructions from his majesty the king to cooperate with the fraternal Arab states in the field of telecommunications, and to develop Jordan's abilities in the field of telecommunications, television transmission, and cooperation with the Arab states in this regard. These are almost the most important points that were discussed today. [Announcer] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani then answered correspondents' questions. Concerning the border issue and Israel's seriousness to discuss this issue in detail, he said: [Al-'Anani] In fact, the Israeli side has expressed its readiness to discuss this issue within the so-called working group on security, border, and territories. Therefore, a Jordanian team and an Israeli team will discuss this issue. If an agreement is reached, then it will be necessary to discuss it on the border site in the region in order to be settled, and so that demarcation and the appropriate measures can be taken. [Correspondent] [Passage Indistinct]. [Al-'Anani] (?There will be) a tripartite committee meeting to discuss the issues related to the Palestinian-Israeli economic agreement and its effects on us, particularly in the field of trade and banks. There will also be a meeting to demarcate borders and to set a program to develop the Jordan Valley area, with all its dimensions. This is to prepare for future studies to discuss these issues and to emphasize that these issues cannot take place unless border problems are resolved. In the past, the U.S. stand was in agreement with this idea, and the Israeli stand was hesitant. Now, it seems, I say it seems, but we are not sure until we sit, negotiate, and know their reactions--but it seems that as long as they are ready to discuss, and we are always ready to discuss our rights, there might be something which makes us say that some change has occurred in the Israeli stand in this regard. [Announcer] Concerning the employees' pay increase, Dr. al-'Anani said: [Al-'Anani] The Council of Ministers is still discussing this issue with all seriousness. A ministerial committee has discussed this and approved some principles. The Council of Ministers today began discussions on it, but it has not yet completed the discussion. We hope to be able to complete discussion on this issue during the next Council of Ministers' meeting. [Correspondent] [Passage indistinct] [Al-'Anani] No, no, the overall picture is clear, but there are attempts to improve the draft plan. As you know, the draft plan was set by a ministerial committee, and the Council of Ministers must express its opinion about the ministerial committee's proposals. There are some ideas either by some specialized sectors, or in the overall picture. [Announcer] On the date set for His Majesty King Husayn's visit to Washington, the information minister and minister of state for cabinet affairs, said: [Al-'Anani] His Majesty King Husayn's visit to Washington will take place during the first half of this month, June. His Majesty King Husayn will go to have a regular medical checkup. This is to let people know. After His Majesty King Husayn underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic, he was supposed to have a medical checkup every six months. This is the last semiannual medical checkup. This, God willing, will confirm that His Majesty King Husayn's health is as good as usual, and then the medical checkup will be done annually. This is something normal, a routine medical checkup. His Majesty King Husayn's health is very good, and we must be happy and congratulate ourselves on this. His Majesty King Husayn will, of course, visit the United States, where he will meet with President Bill Clinton, Christopher, and senior U.S. officials. They will discuss the peace process, bilateral relations, developments in the region, and other issues. As you know, these issues appear to be repetitive, but every time, due to the rapid changes and developments, they gain new dimensions. Thank you very much.
