Since the beginning of this year the rate of investment increase has declined. During the first four months of the year, investments by state-owned enterprises grew by 38.4 percent, a 30.5 percent slow-down from the same period last year. The investment structure is becoming more balanced. More money is being spent on projects involving raw materials, transportation and telecommunications. The investment fever in development zones, holiday resorts, villas and real estate has been lowered. In addition, loans to key state projects increased by more than 10 billion yuan in the first four months compared to the same period of last year, and some 20 percent of the capital has been delivered. Typically, about 15 percent of planned capitalization is fulfilled in the first quarter. As a result of the controls, the marketing of materials for production has become stable. The State Council ruled in January this year to continue the efforts to control investment in fixed assets as the government aims to maintain its gross national product (GNP) growth rate at 9 percent and the growth of prices within 10 percent this year. The investment growth rate of state-owned enterprises has been estimated at about 30 percent for the first half of this year, said Wei Liqun, a spokesman for the State Planning Commission. Qiu Xiaohua, a young economist with the state statistics bureau, said that if the 30 percent growth rate target can be achieved nationwide in the first half of the year, inflationary pressure will be greatly eased and China's economy will grow at a steady rate. China's reforms and opening to the outside world will go more smoothly, he said. If the growth rate for investment in fixed assets can be kept at 30 percent for the whole year, he added, the total investment in fixed assets for the year will marginally surpass the 13 trillion yuan target set by the central government, but it will still be a factor conducive to China's overall economic growth. He stressed that although certain achievements have been made, controls are still not powerful enough since the investment mechanism reform is yet to make a significant impact. Local investment fever is still high and many localities are eager to construct more projects without paying attention to the overall economic situation. "Investments might increase rapidly if the controls are not carried out strictly," he said, "because the investment mechanism in which the local government has the final say in investment has not changed completely." The economist said that reform of the investment mechanism should be carried out in such aspects as making certain laws and regulations to safeguard the interests of investors and to guarantee a scientific and standardized investment procedure. In addition, he said, investment decision-making rights should be transferred from the government to enterprises themselves. And more overseas investment should be exploited.
