Some scholars even pointed out that it was a serious mistake for the government to allow the Armed Forces to do business, and this might bring certain hidden dangers for mainland China. Whether the Armed Forces should be supported by state finances and whether the Armed Forces should be engaged in business operations are undisputed questions in modern countries. However, such questions are controversial in mainland China. The scholars held: The Armed Forces can only be "fed" with the state's military budget and should be supported with the state's tax revenue, and they must not be allowed to engage in business. National defense is public property that can neither be divided nor sold on the market; instead, it must be kept by the government (mainly by the central government). In a modern country, the government levies mandatory taxes and provides public property through arranging public expenses, especially national defense expenses. "Supporting the armed forces with tax revenue" is international practice. For example, in the United States, the armed forces are strictly prohibited from doing business, still less are they allowed to join hands with local governments to run all sorts of profit-making industries. This thus ensures the non- commercialization and nonlocalitization of the armed forces. At present, only in a very small number of countries, such as Indonesia and Thailand, are there business companies run by the armed forces. There, corruption in the armed forces is notorious. The armed forces have become special interest groups with their own political, economic, and military interests independent from the state's interests. International experience shows that allowing the armed forces to engage in business operations is to turn on a green light for corruption in the armed forces. Since the 1980's, the Armed Forces in mainland China have been deeply involved in business activities on a large scale. At present, the three services, the three general headquarters departments, all the field armies, and all the military regions and provincial military districts have set up their own business companies without exception. These companies are making profits to compensate for serious deficiencies in the military budget. As a result, the Armed Forces have been rapidly commercialized and localized, and corruption in the Armed Forces has become increasingly serious. Military cadres are also unhappy with such phenomena. Many investigations show that, in mainland China, the business operations of the Armed Forces have developed to the degree of their going beyond the authorities' control. Some military units use planes with special passes to transport products which should be brought under the strict control of the state, naval units have used their ships to engage in smuggling activities on the high seas, and some units have even been involved in the international underground arms trade. Such facts deeply worry mainland leaders, who found it necessary to ask the scholars to work out some urgent countermeasures. A national situation analysis report drafted by a group from the Chinese Academy of Sciences put forth five major proposals: --Strictly prohibit the Armed Forces from engaging in business operations, and suspend all sorts of business companies run by the Armed Forces or with the participation of the Armed Forces, including military-run farms. Assets may be transferred or auctioned. The Armed Forces must not be allowed to participate in various profit-making activities in civilian communities, and military units must not be allowed to accept any gifts or allowances given by local governments or civilian institutions. --Substantially increase the military budget and support the Armed Forces with tax revenue. It is necessary to greatly increase the central government's financial capacity in order to feed the Armed Forces, the Police Force, officialdom, and teaching staff. The expenses of the Armed Forces should come completely from the government's financial appropriations, which should be sufficient to maintain the normal operations of the Armed Forces in peacetime. That is, the actual income of troops should increase at a rate slightly higher than the growth rate of average income of all people throughout the country so that the troops have sufficient money to maintain their weapons and equipment, quicken the depreciation and modernization of their equipment, and to arrange military training. In wartime, special appropriations should be made to make up for deficiencies in the military budget. --Part of national defense public property should be produced through the market. Being the most important part of public property, national defense should be provided by the central government. However, some national defense materials may be produced by civilian manufacturers through the market. For example, military rations, medicines and medical equipment, clothing and other supplies, military airports, roads, and some buildings, instruments can be ordered by the military from civilian suppliers, and the orders may be placed through the invitation of tenders. The Armed Forces do not need to effect "self-sufficiency" in such materials. --Most military industrial enterprises should be separated from the regular military establishment so that the Armed Forces can streamline their non-combat parts. Only a very small number of highly confidential and key military industrial enterprises will remain inside the military establishment. Similar practices should also be adopted among scientific research institutes serving military purposes. A ministry of military industry could be set up under the State Council on the basis of the existing State Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense. It would specialize in arranging the development and production of weapons and military equipment, and the Armed Forces would become the buyer of such products. Under the conditions of a market economy, the new model should be that the central government spends money to keep the Armed Forces, the Armed Forces place orders and buy what they need, and the ministry of military industry arranges production. As for nonweapons materials and supplies, the Armed Forces should place orders with civilian manufacturers through the invitation of tenders. --Redefine the tasks of the Armed Forces, and reduce excessive nonmilitary expenditure and burdens borne by the Armed Forces. The Armed Forces should not take part in various productive and business activities in the market, still less should they be engaged in activities of reaping staggering profits or reaping illicit gains, such as through smuggling cars, selling arms, running luxurious hotels, and speculating in real estate. The Armed Forces should not be involved in local economic construction and turned into a low- cost labor force. This may also increase extra financial burdens on military units and affect the military training of troops. In the eyes of the scholars, the five proposals are completely correct, but they mean that major changes would have to be made in the sources of mainland China's military expenditures. First, it is not known whether the central government would be able to pay such a huge military bill; second, it is not known whether some people who are used to doing business by taking advantage of the Armed Forces' privileges are willing to give up such enviable benefits. All this causes people to worry about the fate of the report.
