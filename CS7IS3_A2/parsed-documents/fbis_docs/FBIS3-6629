It is even conceivable that some large banks could go bankrupt during 1994. The question is, what specific ideas should be formulated for the process of dealing with these bad loans, a process that can no longer afford a moment's delay? Is a Banking Crisis Already in Progress? [Saito] I believe that the biggest hurdle for the Japanese economy to overcome in the next two years--1994 and 1995--is the task of normalizing its financial system. What is important in this connection is to make a sharp distinction between "normalization" and "stabilization." The Ministry of Finance [MOF], judging from its known position, would inevitably try to stabilize the financial system at any cost, but my point is that the proper order dictates normalization first, followed by stabilization. Land prices will probably continue to decline even further in the days ahead, and surely there will be some bank failures. To date, the bankruptcy cases involving Kamaishi Credit Association, Toyo Credit Association, and Toho Sogo Bank have had to be dealt with already, but I suspect that there will be several bankruptcy cases involving much larger financial institutions. If that should happen, any mistake in handling would lead to dire consequences; this is why I say that the ground rules and methodology for the handling of such an eventuality must be clearly established now before it is too late. Yet both the Bank of Japan [BOJ] and MOF are doing no such thing; they are simply hoping for the best. Some financial institutions are gradually beginning to think about the question of how to ensure their survival through their own efforts, but I think they are still a small minority. [Mizuno] I, for one, believe that the present situation essentially is a banking crisis. [Saito] On a par in scale with the previous one known as the "Showa Depression"? [Mizuno] I do not intend to make such a comparison in that the previous one occurred when the financial system as well as the entire economic system were far less mature than they are today; I do believe, however, that our current crisis is at least as bad as, if not more serious than, the banking crisis the United States had in the second half of the 1980's and through 1991. I also believe that our current crisis is totally beyond remedy. [Saito] For sure the situation is deteriorating. [Mizuno] The 4 January [1994] issue of the YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported the bad-debt ratios, figured in percentage of total outstanding loans, of 11 city banks. If this report is accurate, the ratios are as follows: 15.5 percent for Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, 9.2 percent for Daiwa Bank, 8.0 percent for Sakura Bank, 6.7 percent for Fuji Bank, and 6.3 percent for Tokai Bank. The average for the 11 banks is 5.9 percent. Five of the 11 banks have ratios higher than 6 percent. [Saito] Anything over 6 percent is dangerous. [Mizuno] At the height of bad-debt ratios among 10 major banks during the banking crisis in the United States, Citibank recorded the highest ratio of 5.72 percent in 1990. At that time, the U.S. banking authorities became nervous about the possibility of Citibank going bankrupt. Meanwhile, in the case of Japan, the amount of bad debts Mitsubishi Bank reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] was 1.7 times the amount made public in Japan in accordance with domestic standards. So, if the total amount of bad debts being carried by 21 major Japanese banks was estimated by taking into account the unpublicized portions, the figure could reach 40 trillion yen. [Saito] I, too, estimate the figure to be around 40 trillion yen. If so, it will push the bad-debt ratio up to 10 percent. [Mizuno] That figure is extremely high when compared to Citibank's 5.72 percent. In terms of actual amounts, the total value of bad assets held by all of U.S. banks as of June 1993 was less than 11 trillion yen. [Saito] Which means that Japanese banks are stuck with nearly four times as much bad assets as those held by U.S. banks -- eight times as much if the difference in scale of the two countries' economies is factored in. [Mizuno] Even that fact alone is reason enough to warrant much more serious attention to the current problem of bad assets being held by Japan's banks. [Saito] But in the case of Japanese banks, they have a mind-set that counts on "the authorities" as the last resort. It is the mentality of believing that the BOJ will come to their rescue when the chips are down. This belief, which sets the BOJ apart from the FRB [Federal Reserve Bank] and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [FDIC] of the United States, gives them a sense of security. [Mizuno] In the United States, the disposition of banks' bad assets is subject to very strict conditions demanded by the banking authorities. [Saito] Looking at the current state of Japanese banks, one finds that the second regional banks (formerly known as "sogo banks" or "mutual loan and savings banks") in urban areas -- especially in the Tokyo metropolitan area, the Kinki region, and the Chukyo region -- have purchased a lot of land at high prices. It was in the final phase of the bubble economy that they invested heavily in land speculation projects. In contrast, credit associations have escaped with relatively fewer bad loans of this kind. Then there is another problem created by agricultural sector financial intitutions through their excessive lending to housing developers. But there is a slight difference in perception between you, Mr. Mizuno, and me: that is, my view is that the present condition is still in the polypoid stage. If left unattended, however, it will develop into an active cancer, which could very well spread from second regional banks and agricultural financial institutions to the three main sectors of banking -- the city bank, the long-term credit bank, and the trust bank. An incision must be performed quickly before it is too late, but neither the MOF nor the BOJ has had the experience of performing major surgical operations in the postwar era. What they have been doing is limited to minor, inconsequential procedures. Even that sort of treatment requires complicated operations. Given their meager surgical skills, however, they are now lost as to what to do about the case on hand. If nothing is done about it, I think a cancer is bound to develop. [Mizuno] I believe a cancer has already developed. The American Experience [Saito] In any event, the time for an incision is nearing. It had better be done within the next one to two years; I believe a radical treatment is absolutely necessary within the next two years at the latest. [Mizuno] But the steps now being contemplated by everyone concerned in Japan -- the MOF, the banks, and the real estate industry -- are essentially based on a PKO [ price-keeping operation] concept, it seems. They are not trying to root out the ills of asset deflation; rather, their idea is to halt the progress of asset deflation by means of a PKO measure or to generate a mini-bubble. I think this is a fundamentally wrong approach. A PKO measure was tried for fear of falling stock prices, but when it became clear that such a measure was absolutely futile in the market place, it was called off. In the handling of the problem of land, too, the Real Estate Resolution Corporation (RERC), which is already in place, and the idea of using government funds, which is currently under study, are basically "land PKO" measures. With this kind of measures, however, the problem of bad assets cannot be resolved. The situation will continue on as it is now In the United States, a similar situation was dealt with by the following measures: first, the market functions were fully utilized; second, the administrative authorities wasted no time in pressuring bank managers to dispose of their bad assets. With respect to the market functions, the banks in the United States sold off their bad assets even at a loss due to significant decline in real estate prices. In contrast, right now the banks and the authorities in Japan are afraid of the falling land prices; as long as such fear rules, they will never be able to dispose of their land holdings. [passage omitted] Real estate holdings cannot be made liquid if market functions are ignored. This is why I believe that the policy designed to restore land's liquidity currently under consideration in Japan will never work. [Saito] The problem requires more than taxation schemes such as the lowering of the so-called land transfer tax and the abolishment of the land value tax. The first requisite is to bring land prices down. But this point is not understood. Obviously everybody is afraid of losing money. [Mizuno] I think so, too. In the United States, newspapers such as THE WALL STREET JOURNAL carry public notices on items put up for sale by the RTC [Resolution Trust Corp.]. The notices give a detailed listing of the items for sale as well as contact instructions. The would-be buyers are also told that if they do not hear from the RTC within so many days there would be no deal. This shows how aggressively and undaunted by falling prices the RTC, despite being a government agency, pushed the sale of these properties under their receivership. The RTC also took over the banks that are either bankrupt or carrying excessive debt, and proceeded to liquidate such banks by selling off their bad assets. Another thing is that, in the United States, securities firms are playing a share of the role in the liquidation of bank properties. Incidentally, securities firms are involved in nearly all aspects of the bank's activity -- product development, for example. No one had expected that banks in the United States could recover so quickly. To tell you the truth, I too had failed in my writings to predict it; likewise, in the United States, neither the financial authorities, the private-sector bank managers, nor even the Wall Street analysts had thought such a quick recovery was likely. Unless those in Japan proceed by emulating the U.S. thinking and approach, nothing will be accomplished except that the ownership of bad assets will merely change from one hand to another and to yet another. Avoiding Losses Leads to No Movement [Saito] The point is, a move to dispose of bad assets and thereby to improve the contents of assets holdings necessitates a cost. Should the fear of this cost make the banks unwilling to either junk their bad assets or dispose of them at a loss, there will be no movement. As you, Mr. Mizuno, just pointed out, in the United States bad assets were thoroughly written off. As to why Japanese banks are unable to write off their bad assets, it is because they are under a variety of regulatory constraints that make even taxable write-offs, let alone tax-exempt write-offs, difficult. Of course from the MOF's standpoint, banks' settlements of accounts showing red-ink figures would pose problems such as diminishing national tax revenues; more fundamentally, however, there is the MOF's realization that allowing the less-troubled banks to take as much taxable write-offs as they like would widen the gaps, and thereby upset the horizontal balance, betweent them and those other banks that are saddled with larger amounts of bad debts and therefore unable to do the same. Should this happen, the MOF fears that the latter category of banks might face credit insecurity. This is what the MOF wants to avoid. Hence the regulatory constraints that allow all banks to take only limited amounts of write-offs. Consequently, the banks are unable to restructure their operations. My view is that the entire write-off system ought to be revised in the direction of giving the banks basically a free hand in writing off their bad assets as long as individual banks are willing to treat such write-offs as a matter of their own responsibility and to pay taxes on them. If the system is so revised, some banks that cannot afford taxable write-offs are bound to fall into a precarious situation. Such banks should be dealt with in one of two ways: either provide them with "withdrawal funds" through some sort of public agency or devise a mechanism whereby they can be closed down; in any event, the handling of these banks should be based primarily on market forces. These are the kinds of steps implemented in the United States. There, property -- bad assets -- was sold off aggressively and was written off; at the same time, personnel cuts were made and nonperforming divisions and branches were eliminated. In Japan, however, these things are not being done. It boils down to this: No pain, no results. It was painful in the United States, but the very pain was what generated so much financial funds. In the United States, 200 commercial banks went bankrupt in 1989; the number of such bankruptcies fell all the way to 42 in 1993. Behind the recovery of such magnitude were the banks' own efforts to help themselves and government's willingness to take care of the residual problems arising from the banks' efforts. [Mizuno] For example, on New Year's Day 1991 in the state of Rhode Island, the governor ordered the closure of 45 financial institutions. A few days later, the FDIC took over the Bank of New England. At that time, as might be expected, there was a run on the banks of Long Island, among others. Even so, American depositors were basically calm. They were calm because of the deposit insurance that protected their deposit up to $100,000. In Japan, however, the total amount of funds at the disposal of deposit insurance is only about 600 billion yen. [Saito] Which means that the funds will not be enough even to cover the depositors of just one insolvent second regional bank. There is another thing: In the United States, the power of state governments talks. Be that as it may, in Japan, too, I wonder whether we really need to worry about a run on deposits. Back in the days of the Showa financial crisis, the lack of accurate information gave rumors free rein. Today, however, given the abundance of information, I am inclined to think any run on deposits will be nothing more than a temporary thing. [Mizuno] As soon as people get wind of rumors about their bank possibly facing a crisis, they transfer their deposits to a better banks or to postal savings. There is a perception in the United States that the poor state of Japanese banks is the reason for the flow of deposits into postal savings. [Saito] The same perception exists in Japan as well. Office ladies and the like are frightened and saying they are going to move their money into postal savings. Of course interest rates, too, have something to do with their choice. Information Disclosure Needed First [Saito] Still, what is needed before making such an incision is the "karte" [the patient's chart] containing accurate data. Without it, the surgeon would not know where to make the incision. I am a member of an expert committee on the question of disclosure. The disclosure criteria being discussed at this committee cover only debts that are either unrecoverable or in arrears for more than six months; interest payments either reduced or forgiven are not included. To include even those items in the criteria is not welcomed especially by regional and smaller financial institutions. Also not included in the criteria are loans in arrears for less than six months. In its reports filed with the SEC, Mitsubishi Bank includes not only the arrears for longer than 90 days, but also interest payments either reduced, exempted, or suspended. Properly speaking, this ought to be the standard to follow for all disclosures. Unless the "karte" is maintained with clear, accurate data, anxiety about the patient's conditions could be fanned unnecessarily: Is it possibly a cancer? Is the cancer terminal? Whereas if the charts clearly reflected patient's conditions, separating sound banks from those beyond cure, I think everyone will calm down. Furthermore, doing so will clarify the bank's responsibility toward its shareholders and also identify potential problems vis-a-vis depositors. Information disclosure is a matter of course. The Japanese practice of ignoring it is hard to believe. [Mizuno] Citicorp, for example, divides the United States into eight districts for its annual reports, and the annual report contains a detailed disclosure of the loans it has issued in each of these districts: the exact amounts of loans and their intended purposes are classified into office building, residential building, retail business, hotel, land, international business, etc. Also included in the disclosure is the degree of risk assessed for each of these loans in terms of recovery prospects. [Saito] In the case of Japan, granted the administrative agencies and financial institutions themselves are at fault, but the blame must be shared by depositors, investors, and shareholders for being soft and less than resolute in their dealings with banks. They ought to expres their view; they should say, "Not disclosing information is strange; we will not put our money in any bank that fails to disclose." I think the consumer sovereignty is weak. Getting back to the question of disclosure, in comparison with the three main sectors of banks, the regional banks and those of lesser categories have become superficial in the handling of information disclosure. City banks are disclosing two things: the identity of their loan customers who have gone bankrupt and their loans in arrears for more than six months. But regional banks are disclosing only the identity of their bankrupt loan customers. They both belong to the same stock market, yet there is unevenness in what information they disclose. In dealing with this reality, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, for example, ought to clearly point out the absurdity of such unevenness between the two groups, both of whom are financial institutions of the same ilk. I find it also lamentable that investors are not complaining about this unevenness. [Mizuno] A problem of that kind can be corrected even tomorrow. All it takes would be for the MOF to say, "Do it!" A review of annual reports by U.S. banks shows that since about 1983, when the Basel Committee on Banking Supports of the Bank for International Settlements began studying the idea of regulating the banks' net worth ratio, U.S. banks have been using uniform standards for disclosing their primary capital and total capital. The FRB was behind the adoption of this practice. When the cumulative debts of the Third World countries became a serious problem making investors and depositors uneasy, U.S. banks were ordered to disclose their loans to those countries. More recently, when real estate became a problem, U.S. banks were ordered to disclose the details of their property-related loans. These are matters that do not even warrant discussions by any deliberative council. [Saito] But in Japan they become the subjects of rancorous debate. Although the recent revision of commercial law has made it easier for a representative of shareholders to file a group-action suit, because investors, shareholders, and depositors lack the awareness as the user of the banking service, the banks, in collusion with the authorities, tend to take the "keep them coming but do not keep them informed" attitude toward their customers. In this regard, there is room for self-reflection by the consumer as well. In the United States, it is because investors, shareholders, and depositors have sharp eyes that the FRB and the financial authorities inevitably become scrupulous in righting the wrongs of the banking industry. [Mizuno] Yet the situation has turned so critical.... [Saito] The thing is, the most difficult problem in information disclosure is for each financial institution to figure out the amount of its excessive debts. In the case of Japan, because there is hardly any movement involving land, it is quite difficult for a financial institution to figure out the latent losses posed by its land holdings. To make such calculation possible, if for nothing else, the first thing to do is to liberalize taxable write-offs. When this is done, confident and aggressive banks are likely to move rapidly to take taxable write-offs. This in turn will give land the liquidity. Choice pieces of land that are easily sellable will move first, leading gradually to the formation of land prices. Of course there will be some pieces of land which simply cannot be disposed of. In that event, sooner or later the government will have to buy them up using financial funds, with strict conditions attached, and will just have to hold onto them for a long time. [Mizuno] In the United States, even bad pieces of property are being sold. [Saito] In the United States, there is a high-risk, high-return market to deal with things like junk bonds. At any rate, once the steps I have outlined have been taken, some neutral public agency should make an orderly, accurate survey of excessive debts being carried by all the banks to be followed by a decision as to what kind of a surgical operation is needed. [Mizuno] I am all for it. In the United States, banks are clearly ranked on the basis of their net worth ratios. And those banks excessively in debt are taken over by the government. I think these steps ought to be taken in Japan, too. The market reacts on the basis of these findings and happenings. That's why the price of Citicorp's shares fell all the way to $7.00 per share when the company was having the worst times. But it has rallied since then to the more than $30 at the present. The price of Bank of New England's shares had plummeted to as low as $1.00 per share just prior to its bankruptcy. The Easygoing Management of Japan's Banks [Mizuno] I believe the managers of Japan's banks lack vigor. And it is due to nondisclosure of information regarding their bank's performance. [Saito] Not only do managers lack vigor, but bank employees also lack it.. Banks provide great in-house welfare benefits to employees, but are not eliminating surplus workers. Banks are not closing down their non-profitable branches; bonuses paid to bank employees last year were more generous than those paid by other industries. [Mizuno] Ignorance about the actual condition of their bank makes the employees themselves easygoing. This is why I believe that one of the values of information disclosure lies in the fact that it tends to make the manager more serious about managing. It makes the manager serious about the disposition of bad assets. In the case of the banks in the United States, Citicorp, for example, successfully carried out a restructuring plan called the "Five-Point Plan" in 1991-1992. Meanwhile, Chase Manhattan Bank announced at the beginning of 1993 a plan to reduce its bad assets by $2 billion and began selling off its property holdings. The market reacted very favorably to these moves. [Saito] Those were bold decisions by the managers. [Mizuno] In the United States, managers incapable of making such decisions will lose their jobs. In Japan, however, if you look at city bank operations from the standpoint of how their branch offices are doing in attracting deposits, you will find that many of their branches are not making profits. As a matter of fact, among those city banks with main offices in the provinces, there are some that maintain branches in the Tokyo metropolitan area that are unbelievably unprofitable. Think about these cases seriously, then the obvious conclusion is that perhaps it is time for these banks to give up the idea of being "city" banks. I think they should aggressively sell off their real estate holdings in the city of Tokyo. [Saito] City banks are holding many choice pieces of land; if they try to sell such land holdings there will be buyers. But the pieces of land which these banks are now trying to turn over to the CCPC [Central Committee on Privatization and Commercialization] are all so odd -- either crooked or inflated in price -- that no one would be interested in buying them. The banks are holding onto the better pieces. But I like to advise these banks to sell the better ones of their land holdings first instead of holding onto them. Good pieces of land would be sold if offered at a discount of between 20 percent and 30 percent. Banks are not doing this; instead, they are asking the government to use public funds to buy their unsellable pieces of land. Even if the government bought them using public funds, they would still be useless. My advice would be, "Don't spend public funds in a strange way." [Mizuno] Bringing in public funds to subsidize land purchases and to rescue banks, even if tried, would not solve either of the two problems. I am absolutely opposed to the idea of using public funds to finance the CCPC or to buy up bad assets. It will not resolve the problem. [Saito] First of all, a manager must make the hard decision to restructure his financial institution itself. Next, people within the institution must become aware of the critical situation. Information must be disclosed in order to generate the crisis awareness. Then the government must liberalize taxable write-offs. Unless such a restructuring plan based on self-help efforts is formulated and implemented, eventually the management team will have to step down. I think everyone who attends the board meeting ought to resign. A Land Holdings Liquidation Corporation Needed [Saito] The question is, what should be the next move after such self-help efforts? The problem is that bank's bad debts are not only enormous but also an entaglement of all kinds of mortgages. In order to untangle them and make them liquid, I am afraid some sort of "bad assets shelving agency" in the form of the National Railways' "liquidation corporation" may have to be created. As for the funds to finance such an agency, if money from postal savings, the treasury investment and loan account, or pension funds were used, it would create a perception that banks' management failures are being rescued at the people's expense; I don't think this is a good idea. Instead, the government should issue a special bond explicitly for this purpose. Instread of the interest on the principal so financed, the banks ought to pay it in proportion to the amounts of their bad assets that have been set aside. Or, if in the future the shelving agency can sell off the land it holds and make some profit, the profit may be used to redeem the government bond. So, to play this kind of role, I am inclined to think that some sort of "land holdings liquidation corporation" will have to be created. Even then, there will be some banks which, having fallen excessively into debt, cannot write off their bad assets. For them, a government agency can underwrite preferred stocks in the manner of the "reconstruction finance corporation" used in the United States during the 1930's. In other words, to generate underwriting capital, a "financial stabilization agency" or a "stabilization corporation" can be created to issue a so-called government guaranteed bond. The BOJ will buy the bond. In effect, it will be an indirect, special financing by the BOJ. The bright side of such financing is that the preferred stocks underwritten will yield dividends. Such dividends plus any profit generated will be required to be put aside in a reserve as redemption funds to be so used later. I am afraid that, unless tackled with such a two-phased scheme, these pieces of land that constitute bad assets cannot be disposed of. The first phase will require banks' self-help efforts. It is in the second phase that a "land holdings liquidation corporation" and a "financial stabilization agency" backed by a form of special financing through the BOJ are to be created. If the framework of such scheme is spelled out, I tend to think that the situation will calm down little by little. [Mizuno] What is the timing for the creation of these agencies? [Saito] Sometime during 1994-1995. And the whole scheme should be financed with a special government bond for the relief of the financial system. The United States is spending some $400 billion for the relief of its S&L industy; the revenue source for this undertaking is treasury bonds. [Mizuno] I think the scheme you outlined will not make headway in turning these pieces of land liquid. The National Railways' liquidation corporation currently holds long-term debts worth 2-6 trillion yen; included in such debts are many pieces of land that cannot be sold even at a discount. [Saito] They will have to lower prices even further. That's why I think that the land holdings liquidation corporation in my scheme will be obliged to hold onto land assets for about 10 years. [Mizuno] In that event, land assets will not become liquid. [Saito] But banks have land assets at choice locations. They ought to sell their branch offices athletic fields and company houses occupying choice pieces of land, and then have new buildings built there by contractors. Banks can either rent parts of such buildings, or they can lease back. [Mizuno] If you are talking about financing by means of government bond for a period which is to be expected to last about 10 years, ultimately the people will end up bearing the cost. [Saito] That cannot be helped. Unless such a scheme is implemented, financial institutions cannot be normalized. As a price, the beneficiaries of the scheme will be strictly held to a variety of terms. For instance, the financing may be through a 10-year government bond, the principal and interest of which may be payable at the end of the term; however, the interest will be borne by those financial institutions whose bad assets have been bought off by the liquidation agency. It may be decided to schedule the final liquidation for 10 years or five years into the future, and the loss resulting from the liquidation will have to be made up for by the financial institutions, the beneficiaries of the scheme, out of their profits. As an alternative, the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan may bear such losses collectively. [Mizuno] Under this scheme, will the financial institutions be the ones to invest in it? [Saito] Correct. [Mizuno] It won't work unless provisions are made to allow general public to invest in it. [Saito] In Japan, there is no such market in place yet. Perhaps one may come into being, say, three years hence. Until then, holding on for a long term is the only answer. We are talking about a long-term holding agency. [Mizuno] That will not lead to a solution of the problem. At present, land cannot be sold even at 50 percent of the purchase price. Some pieces of land cannot be sold at 40 percent, at 30 percent, or even at 20 percent of the prices paid. But, just possibly, they may be sold if offered at 10 percent of the purchase price. [Saito] You are painting a crash! [Mizuno] That's what everyone in Japan -- the industrial sector and fiancial circles alike -- is scared of. "Amakudari" Hampering Bank Reforms [Saito] Mr. Mizuno, your views amount to a kind of "stabilization crisis" theory. It is an argument that capitalism revives only at the point of a crash. It is one approach, but if that approach is taken now, the Japanese economy will fall apart. Right now, the economy has no stamina due to a long-term recession. The government, too, is just dawdling, and there is not a chance that the next administration will prove to be much stronger. A ship without a helmsman will sink in a bad storm. This is why I think it is dangerous to try your approach at this time. Also I see problems with the idea being floated by some economists of using public funds to make preemptive acquisition of land for later public use. My question is, what are they going to do with pieces of land that are completely useless? Rather than doing such foolish things, the best thing to do is simply and unequivocally putting them away for a long haul. [Mizuno] But among the banks' land holdings there are some that are of considerable utility value. [Saito] My advice is, sell them! [Mizuno] But even for them prices will have to be lowered. [Saito] Lower prices will attract buyers. I should think that, once write-offs are liberalized, banks will gradually attempt to sell their land holdings. It is to such banks that, I say, a helping hand should be extended, enabling them to gain sufficient funds by means of preferred stocks. I think Sumitomo Bank, for example, will move promptly to do just that. [Mizuno] The shape of things as you have outlined will eventually lead to a definitive idea, I believe. If I am to find a point of some agreement between us, it is that all the ideas surfaced in our discussion up to this point should be molded into something that can work organically.... [Saito] The first step toward that end as a matter of policy is to have some banks implement these ideas. Jonan Credit Association, for example, is doing very well in this regard even now. Take the matter of information disclosure for starters: Acting on their own and using the procedure which they call "Jonan formula," they are disclosing everything. Further, they are even marketing a high-interest deposit product that can compete against the postal savings. Given that even such a small financial institution is doing these things, I only hope bigger banks will follow suit. There is also another problem in the current situation, and that is the practice by the MOF and the BOJ of placing their officials in financial institutions. [Mizuno] In the United States, the administrative authorities make the managers put their signatures on restructuring plans for their financial institutions. It happened to Bank of America and to Bank of Boston. After that, if the restructuring plans are not brought to fruition, the authorities fire the managers responsible. Never do the authorities resort to the practice of "amakudari" ["descending from heaven"; placing former government officials in positions of responsibility at private companies] in order to keep the pipelines open between them and the financial institutions. [Saito] Even under the Japanese Banking Law, the minister of finance can order suspension of a bank's operation or revocation of its license. But, because MOF officials have shamelessly descended on some of the banks where they are holding the positions of director or president, the minister cannot very well draw his sword against these banks. The situation facing the minister is tantamount to the banks having taken former MOF officials as hostages. [Mizuno] I wish they would stop it. [Saito] Another thing: The deposit insurance system is being abused. Recently funds in that system were used to make a loan to the troubled Toyo Credit Association and to make a low interest loan to Iyo Bank. But of course the deposit insurance is intended to protect deposits. If low-interest loans must be made to some of these banks, a separate arrangement will have to be devised. This distinction is being fudged.
