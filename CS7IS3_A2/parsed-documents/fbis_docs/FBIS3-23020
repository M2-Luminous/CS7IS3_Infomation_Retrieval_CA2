Airport Police equipped with High Technology"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] [Text] Bern 15 Feb (ATS) -- After the 1969 Palestinian bombing, the police force at Zurich-Kloten airport has undergone quite some changes. Insignificant until then, it has turned into an 800-strong security force outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment. Two new projects will be carried out in the near future, namely the upgrading of the airport's enclosure and cargo installation. Immediately after the bombing of the Israeli aircraft, a decision was made to separately control planes coming from and going to the Middle East. These are under permanent surveillance, airport police chief Ulrich Neeracher told ATS [Agence Telegraphique Suisse]. Mail is now controlled using X-ray devices. From the Fall of 1969, Swiss Army troops began guarding the airport; they remained in place for a year before being relieved by the Zurich canton police. After a bomb explosion in the luggage compartment of a Swissair aircraft in February 1970, leading to its crash in Wuerenlingen, luggage control was introduced, as well as controls of Israel-bound freight. Since the hijacking of a Swissair plane to Jordan in Fall 1970, specially trained security agents accompany long-distance flights. Maximum Emergency Today, Zurich-Kloten's airport police uses state-of-the-art monitoring techniques: bomb detectors, or bicolor X-ray machines. Security measures are reinforced depending on the needs. The last maximum security alert was installed during the Gulf War, in early 1991. In 1990, policemen managed to avert an attack against an Israeli El-Al plane, when they discovered a bomb inside a suitcase.
