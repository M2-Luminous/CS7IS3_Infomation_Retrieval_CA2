FR940504-0-00048 FR940504-0-00014 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 661 [Docket No. 940422&hyph;4122; I.D. 042294B] RIN 0648&hyph;AF61 Ocean Salmon Fisheries Off the Coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Annual management measures for the Ocean Salmon Fishery and Technical Amendment. SUMMARY: NMFS establishes fishery management measures for the ocean salmon fisheries off Washington, Oregon, and California for 1994. Specific fishery management measures vary by fishery and area. The measures establish fishing areas, seasons, quotas, legal gear, recreational fishing days and catch limits, possession and landing restrictions, and minimum lengths for salmon taken in the exclusive economic zone (3&hyph;200 nautical miles) off Washington, Oregon, and California. These management measures are intended to prevent overfishing and to apportion the ocean harvest equitably among non-treaty commercial and recreational and treaty Indian fisheries. The regulations also are calculated to allow a portion of the salmon runs to escape the ocean fisheries to provide for spawning escapement and inside fisheries. This action also announces a technical amendment codifying the spawning escapement goal for Klamath Fall chinook. NMFS also announces 1995 recreational salmon seasons opening earlier than May 1, 1995. DATES: Effective from 0001 hours Pacific daylight time (P.d.t.), May 1, 1994, until modified, superseded, or rescinded. Comments must be received by May 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on the management measures may be sent to J. Gary Smith, Acting Director, Northwest Region, NMFS, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., BIN C15700, Seattle, WA 98115&hyph;0070; or Gary C. Matlock, Acting Director, Southwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 501 West Ocean Boulevard, suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802&hyph;4213. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William L.
