Now, however, he is speaking about foreign policy questions: [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] You said that your first visit will take you to Bonn. Will the second one be to Brussels? A year ago you were not the first to raise the question of Hungary's NATO membership. [Horn] Yes, but now, when referring to Brussels, I was thinking not of NATO but the European Union [EU]. It is very important -- and I supported the present government's intentions on this -- that Hungary's association treaty with the EU should really be amended. It must be improved, it must be improved in our favor. The way in which Brussels relates to Hungary and the other states in the east central Europe region is very important because I believe that the time for deeds has arrived. So there should not be just piles and piles of statements by the Twelve about the region; they should give more than they have been giving so far to help this region. [Correspondent] We would like to improve relations with neighboring countries, but in past years we have seen that on the other side there is insufficient will to receive these attempts. How will the new government resolve this? [Horn] Look, there are surely Funars [prominent Romanian nationalist mayor of Cluj-Napoca] elsewhere too, not only in Romania. [passage omitted] However, this must not be our point of departure. I believe that Hungary has no enemies either along its border or further away. On the contrary, it has partners, and if we can strengthen the partnership relationship, if we can build up their trust in our intentions -- and we have already said that we would like to bring about a historical reconciliation with our neighbors and a lot should be done to this end -- I am sure that they will receive our moves favorably.
