FR940826-1-00088 FR940826-1-00017 VI. Economic Impact Assessment Today's notice proposes a plan for the review and revision of existing effluent guidelines and for the selection of priority industries for new regulations. This notice does not establish any requirements; therefore, no economic impact assessment has been prepared. EPA will provide economic impact analyses or regulatory impact analyses, as appropriate, for all of the future effluent guideline rulemakings developed by the Agency. VII. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. It has been determined that this plan is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Dated: August 18, 1994. Carol M.
