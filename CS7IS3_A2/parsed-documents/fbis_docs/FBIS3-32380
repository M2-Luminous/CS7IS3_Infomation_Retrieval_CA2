This resolution, which EL PERIODICO DE HONDURAS will honor and support, is a result of the very bad treatment journalists have received not only from [Presidential Private Secretary] Lucio Izaguirre, but also from President Reina, who labeled us as "money changers." The following is the official communique issued by the CPH Board of Directors. Communique No. 1 The CPH Board of Directors orders all affiliates, members, and licensed students who cover the Presidency to immediately cease all news coverage related to Presidential House activities. This measure will be in effect until the corresponding authorities negotiate with the CPH to allow journalists who cover the Presidential House to return within a framework of dignity and responsibility. The problem will not be solved in an atmosphere of luncheons and dinners as has been irresponsibly suggested. [Signed] The Board of Directors
