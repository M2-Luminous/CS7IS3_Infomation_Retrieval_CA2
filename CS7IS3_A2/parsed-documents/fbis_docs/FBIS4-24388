It has been learned that from January to April, procuratorial organs at all levels across the country prosecuted at people's courts 5,634 cases of economic crimes, including cases of corruption and bribery, involving 6,738 persons of whom 115 were cadres at or above the county or department level. Procuratorial organs in various localities also promptly arrested and prosecuted a number of gangster-robbers, rapists, and other gang criminals according to the law. At the same time, procuratorial organs at various levels promptly arrested and prosecuted a number of highwaymen and train robbers who had done great harm to society, thus initially changing the situation for the better in some key areas and key sections of highways and railways. Cases of smuggling by units were investigated and handled. From January to April, 35 major cases of smuggling involving legal persons were directly investigated and handled by procuratorial organs. Liang Guoqing pointed out: Political and social stability now prevail in our country. However, public order has yet to be strengthened in some localities. He said: Social evils are often accompanied by grave crimes, serious acts of fraud -- especially financial and commercial fraud -- and crimes committed by legal figures that seriously jeopardize public order. Criminals often collude with members of some units, and the latter go along with the former in their evil deeds. He called on procuratorial organs at all levels to link the effort to crack down on serious crimes with the struggle against corruption. He also called on them to vigorously prosecute cases of economic crimes, including cases of corruption and bribery, and crack down on such criminal activities. Liang Guoqing stressed: In the near future, procuratorial organs should select a number of major, influential cases for prosecution at people's courts in order to create a strong momentum in cracking down on criminal offenses and crimes of corruption and bribery. At the conference, leaders of provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal people's procuratorates also discussed questions such as arrests, prosecutions in court, and protests by procuratorial organs.
