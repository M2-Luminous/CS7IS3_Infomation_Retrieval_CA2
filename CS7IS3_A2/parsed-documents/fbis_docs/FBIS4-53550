The U.N. Nuclear Monitoring Agency said it has sent a letter to North Korea warning that the continued removal of the rods would be a violation of the nuclear safeguards agreement. On Thursday, U.S. Government and diplomatic sources in Washington reported the three-member IAEA inspection team had determined that a small number of the estimated 8,000 fuel rods had already been removed from the reactor. The IAEA and the United States fear that plutonium extracted from the rods may be diverted to a suspected nuclear arms development program. The IAEA has said the future removal of the fuel rods without the agency's supervision and without marking and separating them would be in violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This would force the watchdog agency to refer the problem to the U.N. Security Council for possible sanctions. Meanwhile, U.S. State Department sources said the IAEA team's checks of the monitoring cameras and seals at the radiochemical laboratory at the complex in Yongbyon are progressing smoothly and should be completed soon. Another IAEA inspection team in March was denied access to the laboratory by the North Koreans, raising suspicions that Pyongyang is trying to build a nuclear bomb.
