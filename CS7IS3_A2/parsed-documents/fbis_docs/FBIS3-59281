Thus, the bureau receives double results from changing the enterprise's image and expanding the transport capacity. The Shenyang railway bureau bears one-fourth of the nation's railroad travellers departures and arrivals, and one-seventh of the cargo's departures and arrivals. Owing to this year's continuous increases in arrivals and departures of customers and cargo, the conflicts between transportation capacity and transportation quantity have become more and more serious, and corrupt practices more and more striking. This railway bureau holds that inadequate transport capacity and corrupt practices are mainly reflected in "hot" lines, directions, trains and tickets. The high demand of these "four hots" not only causes the noted intensity in transport, but also provides a convenient opportunity for people to engage in corrupt practices. The corrupt practices of increasing prices and charging additional money at will, and making profits with trains and tickets ruins the reputation of the bureau, and at the same time blocks and fragments transport capacity. Based on this consideration, Shenyang bureau has closely integrated rectifying corrupt practices with realizing transport potential. The bureau and its sub-stations constantly send more than 230 transport and corrupt practices working groups to important transport sections and local bureaus of the entire system to guide and help in better managing transport production and rectifying corrupt practices. First, this bureau recognizes model organizational behavior as an important aspect for rectifying corrupt practices and accordingly builds cadre teams. The bureaus' director, Lui Zhijun [0491 1807 6511], party committee secretary Ma Zengqing [7456 1073 3237], and the party committee directors of the nine sub-bureaus together signed a reward and punishment agreement titled "Deeply Rectifying Corrupt Practices and Taking Full Responsibility" which clearly states the two-stage goals of the bureaus to rectify corrupt practices initially by 1 October and finally by the end of the year. This agreement enables combining the rectification of corrupt practices with different levels of cadres' personal benefits. Increasing the profile of passenger and cargo transport, improving society's supervision, and publicly and reasonably arranging the transport capacity are Shenyang bureau's other methods for rectifying corrupt practices and improving transport capacity. At the beginning of September, Shenyang bureau published an announcement in newspapers in Liaoning and Jilin provinces stating that it will provide information concerning transport capacity and the number of trains to the public; on 15 September all windows of the whole bureau's customer and cargo service sections adopted the habit of wearing badges while working, clearly marking prices, and publishing telephone reporting hot-line numbers in order to accept the supervision of the entire society. Lui Zhijun, the bureau director, said that "We should want to `accept the people's authority,' and receive the entire society's recognition." At the same time this bureau's main directors also came to Liaoning and Jilin provinces, the Shenyang Military District, and the party leadership organizations in eleven cities (alliances and prefectures) to introduce this situation, ask for opinions, and ensure support of production and transport methods for the 47 state-owned "double assurance" enterprises. Taking Liaoning province as an example, it can be seen that the Shenyang railway bureau's modified transport capacity for the "national team" resulted in a reduction of funds on the order of 250 million yuan. Shenyang bureau has received clear successes in combining rectifying corrupt practices and realizing potential transport capacity. In the first four months of this year, the quantity of Shenyang bureau's transported goods not only was lower than that planned by the department, but also was more than 1.9 million tons less than that in the same period of last year. However, starting in May, the bureaus' daily loading and unloading records continuously improved, and entered a new stage of increased transport capacity and income. At present, Shenyang bureau has completely paid off its debts according to the annual plan. The quantity of cargo transported and the number of customers served, are all above the established annual progress plan. A positive change from corrupt practices has made the limited transport capacity truly realize its efficient contribution to society, and fully attain its railway transport potential.
