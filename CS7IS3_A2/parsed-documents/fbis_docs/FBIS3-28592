In some quarters of the government, officials initially laughed it off, saying: "It is absolutely ridiculous." However, references to this issue have been made by U.S. Government authorities. To prevent this issue from arousing any unnecessary feelings of apprehension among neighboring Asian countries, growing concerns have been voiced suggesting that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, himself, for that matter, take the opportunity to clearly defend Japan's position on this issue during such occasions as the Japan- U.S. summit meeting scheduled for 11 February. Analyzing the issue, one Japanese-U.S. diplomatic source notes the following points: 1) there is an ulterior motive behind this; 2) spreading rumors that Japan has nuclear capabilities could be used as an advantage in breaking the stalled DPRK nuclear issue; and 3) this signifies the collapse of the Japanese-U.S. security structure, proving that the U.S. military has weakened. However, a top Foreign Ministry official argues: "To use this as a whip against North Korea is a completely mistaken notion. We are very annoyed." But what makes the issue so complicated is that "there exists the idea in Europe and the United States that nuclear weapons should be countered by nuclear weapons, and it is impossible no matter how hard Japan, which has experienced a nuclear attack, tries to make them understand its almost allergic reaction to nuclear weapons; it is almost like playing a game of "whack-a-mole" [a game in which the object is to keep hitting mechanical moles which randomly pop out from their holes]" (as stated by a senior Foreign Ministry official). In some quarters of the government, officials hope for an early settlement of the DPRK nuclear issue which is at the core of Japan's new problem. However, to wipe out this argument on Japanese nuclear armament, they plan to work harder to try to persuade U.S. Congressmen to understand Japan's position before Hosokawa's U.S. visit.
