FR940919-1-00030 FR940919-1-00012 Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 180␣/␣Monday, September 19, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AB75 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Withdrawal of the Proposal To Determine a Crustacean, the California Linderiella, an Endangered Species AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule; notice of withdrawal. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) withdraws the proposal to list the California linderiella ( Linderiella occidentalis ), as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Additional information that has become available to the Service since the publication of the proposed rule reveals that the species is more abundant than previously known. The Service has considered the additional information and determined that this species is not likely to become either endangered or threatened throughout all or a significant portion of its range in the foreseeable future, and it does not qualify for listing under the Act. EFFECTIVE DATES: The proposed action of May 8, 1992, to list Linderiella occidentalis as endangered is withdrawn on September 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the Sacramento Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2800 Cottage Way Room E&hyph;1823, Sacramento, California 95825&hyph;1846. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Chris Nagano at the above address or by telephone (916/978&hyph;4866). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On May 8, 1992, the Service published in the Federal Register (57 FR 19856) a proposal to list five species of crustaceans from vernal pools in California as endangered or threatened species. The California linderiella was included in this proposal. During the comment period on the proposal, additional information was received regarding the California linderiella indicating that populations exist north and west of the previously known range, and more vernal pools containing subpopulations of this species also were located. The Service has considered the new information and determined that the species does not warrant listing under the Act. The Service places this animal in category 3C of the animal notice of review. Category 3C species are species for which information now in the possession of the Service indicates that the species is more abundant or widespread than previously believed. If further research or changes in the habitat indicate a significant decline in the species, it may be reevaluated for possible inclusion in categories 1 or 2. A final rule listing the other four crustacean taxa included in the proposal is published in the Federal Register concurrently with this notice of withdrawal of California linderiella. Author The primary author of this notice is Chris Nagano (see ADDRESSES section). Authority The authority for this action is section 4(b)(6)(B)(ii) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ). Dated: August 31, 1994. Mollie H. Beattie, Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23157 Filed 9&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;P
