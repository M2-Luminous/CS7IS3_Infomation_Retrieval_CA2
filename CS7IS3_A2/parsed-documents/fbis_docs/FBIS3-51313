He accused Lula of not having a consistent program for Brazil. The minister believes Lula will not achieve the presidency and warned that a PT government "would ruin many good things," as happened in the [former President Fernando] Collor government. "I cannot see Lula's proposal. What kind of model does the PT want for Brazil? Everything is very confusing, very ambiguous. Is it going to be a big Nicaragua? A Cuba? There is nothing," the minister said. Cardoso made his attack against Lula on the night of 15 January when, after distributing food to those suffering from the drought in the interior of Pernambuco State, he continued with his agenda as a candidate with the recording of a radio program. The minister tried to indicate that he does not fear a confrontation with Lula, and he even minimized the PT candidate's popularity, stressing that poll results do not have very much significance. Regarding the support given to Lula during the 1989 campaign, Cardoso indicated that that was another time, and that the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] considers the PT's program incompatible. He stated that he had decided to support Lula only in the second round because he did not want to vote for the right and also in view of the electorate's demands. "It is not that Lula is an evil person. The trouble is that he does not have a program." Cardoso again admitted the hypothesis of running for president and that he considers it absurd that some groups already have given up on him as a candidate because they believe he should remain at the head of the Finance Ministry in order to supervise the economic stabilization program. He admitted that at this time there is no sense in discussing candidacies; he stressed that he is concentrating on the task of stabilizing the economy and that he is certain he is acting responsibly. "None of my actions have been motivated by the idea of becoming a candidate. What I refuse to say is that I have to reject the idea if the plan is successful. My political rights were taken away from me by the military. Are my political rights going to be taken away from me because I can achieve success? I do not play with that type of demagogy," he warned. Before participating in the radio program, the minister had a closed meeting with Deputies Roberto Freire (PPS [People's Socialist Party]), Maurilio Ferreira Lima (PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]), and Jarbas Vasconcelos (PMDB), the mayor of Recife. The meeting served to smooth over the disagreements, which had worsened with the attrition that led Freire to leave the government leadership in the Chamber of Deputies, between the minister and Freire. An alliance between the PSDB, PMDB, and the PPS also was discussed. The minister also took the opportunity to inform himself about the election climate in Pernambuco, and he expressed his support for Jarbas Vasconcelos in his bid for the state's governorship. The minister also met with PSDB militants and once again explained how the fight against inflation is being carried out. At PSDB headquarters, Cardoso met a group of government officials fired during the Collor government, and he was booed when he reaffirmed the position of Planalto Palace regarding the vetoing of the draft bill that guarantees the re-hiring of fired government officials.
