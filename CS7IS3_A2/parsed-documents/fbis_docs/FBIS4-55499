Although the Turks present a constitutive and constructive element of Macedonia's statehood, this act is a repeated attempt to leave this minority at the margins of the political life in the country, the party announcement says. Such behavior results in distrust for the government bodies and institutions. The announcement concludes this kind of democracy leads nowhere.
