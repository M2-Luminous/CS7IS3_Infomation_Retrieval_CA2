ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: NMFS issues a proposed rule to implement Amendment 7 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Pelagic Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region (FMP). This rule would replace a moratorium on the issuance of new permits for the Hawaii-based longline fishery for Pacific pelagic management unit species. Under this rule, limited entry permits for the Hawaii longline fishery would be issued to people meeting certain eligibility criteria. The rule also proposes broad framework procedures for subsequent adjustment of the conservation and management measures for the pelagics fisheries intended to provide for more efficient administration of the longline fishery. This rule also makes several technical changes to the regulations. The proposed action is necessary to manage the longline fishery based in Hawaii to achieve optimum yield from the fishery and prevent overfishing in accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Comments are solicited on this action; especially regarding the sufficiency of the upgrade limit to control the longline fleet's growth and the adequacy of this measure to protect pelagic stocks and to prevent adverse impacts on non-longline fishermen fishing for tuna and billfish, and to protect sea turtles. DATES: Comments on the proposed rule will be accepted until April 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on the proposed rule and the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) may be sent to Anneka E. Bane, Acting Director, Southwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 501 West Ocean Boulevard, suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802&hyph;4213. Copies of the amendment, final environmental impact statement (FEIS), and IRFA are available from Kitty M. Simonds, Executive Director, Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (WPFMC), 1164 Bishop Street, Suite 1405, Honolulu, HI 96813, (808) 541&hyph;1974. Send comments on the proposed collection-of-information to the Director, Southwest Region, NMFS, 501 W. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach, CA 90802&hyph;4213, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, ATTN: Paperwork Reduction Project 0648&hyph;0204 and 0648&hyph;0214, Washington, DC 20503.
