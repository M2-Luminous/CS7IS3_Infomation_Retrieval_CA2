At the same time, it also warned enterprises to strictly guard against being fooled while dealing with the business of exports of textile products. It was learned that some enterprises have failed to pay sufficient attention to the importance of cracking down on the illegal trafficking of textile products and the relevant policies. A small number of enterprises still have the idea of relying on luck and believe that illegal trafficking of textile products will not occur in their enterprises. Some enterprises, particularly the "three types of foreign-funded" enterprises, township enterprises, business companies which have newly been granted the rights to free management, and production enterprises know little about the relevant policies and situations. The illegal trafficking of textile products has not only violated our country's relevant laws and regulations but also the international agreements and the relevant bilateral agreements, seriously sabotaging China's export order, creating a bad influence externally, and seriously damaging the interests of the state. The meeting proposed: If our province's relevant enterprises are found to be involved in illegal trafficking of textile products, they will be criticized in a circular and their illicit gains and goods will be confiscated. They will also be punished with fines, have their textile product quota cut, and have their customs declaration right and their textile products export operational right temporarily suspended or abolished. At the same time, persons responsible will be questioned. If their cases are exceptionally serious, and they are found to have created great loses to the state and violated criminal law, they will be transferred to judicial organs to have their criminal liabilities investigated.
