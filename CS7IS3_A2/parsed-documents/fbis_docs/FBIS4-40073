"Russia will not resort to unilateral steps in its policy in the region which are not connected with the peaceful settlement and may destroy the basics of international peace and security. Such measures would be contrary to the Russian national interests, contrary to the basic interests of the people of Yugoslavia", he told Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on Tuesday. Kozyrev urged other countries to refrain from unilateral actions and expressed hope that the US Administration will not support the intention of the Congress to unilaterally lift the arms embagro on Bosnian Muslims. "Otherwise a violation of the (UN) Security Council resolutions, the UN Charter will be evident which would create a new political situation. If any of the powers begins to unilaterally support those `under its wardship', the world will return to the worst times of the `Cold War'", he said.
