These documents will immediately follow the appropriate administrative procedures through the Attorney General's Office, according to each case. The public sector's suspension of activities, and their negative repercussions for the population with less economic resources, was one of the leading issues reviewed during the meeting, according to statements made by government officials and presidency spokesman Felix Loarca Guzman. Loarca Guzman said the Executive Branch is still particularly inclined toward a dialogue, which was the intention since the beginning, and the documents which certify workers have abandoned their jobs are simply part of the usual legal proceedings. Meanwhile, labor leaders like Luis Lara, of the Health Workers' National Assembly [Asamblea Nacional de Trabajadores de Salud], maintain their position concerning the legality of their measures and the fairness of their requests; adding that the Executive Branch has yet to fulfill their demands although they participated in a dialogue. Hector Luna Troccoli, secretary general of the presidency, reported that in the case of labor stoppages decreed without meeting the legal requirements, the Civil Service Law and Labor Code are applicable -- the latter in a supplementary manner -- aside from a specific decree which regulates the workers' right to go on strike.
