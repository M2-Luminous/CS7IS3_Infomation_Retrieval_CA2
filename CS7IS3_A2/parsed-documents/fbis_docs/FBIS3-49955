[passage omitted] [Tudjman] This is the first step in the establishment of normal diplomatic relations. One should recall that, for instance, relations between the United States and China, after they had been interrupted for many years, were established precisely in such a way after Kissinger had visited Beijing, by opening up such liaison offices. This is a great step, I would say, of historical importance, since this means the recognition of Croatia within its internationally recognized borders. [passage omitted on Curic speaking about the importance of the declaration] [Tudjman] This means that public foundations have been laid down for bringing to an end talks that we have been conducting with the Serb population in Croatia, not only on a permanent agreement on the cessation of hostilities, but also on the reintegration of Croatia's territories that are currently under UN protection in a normal way into Croatia's constitutional and legal order. Obviously, this will take place gradually by opening up roads and their reintegration into the economic, legal, and social system of the Croatian state. [passage omitted on Curic on other aspects of the agreement] [Jovanovic] Turning our back on military methods represents an important step forward in relation to the practice that has hitherto prevailed. This is what is probably the most positive thing in all this. By this declaration, this decision to establish direct communication in the form of these bureaux, offices, the two governments put their full weight behind peace and the resolution of outstanding problems in a peaceful way. An important problem remains to be solved: That is the problem of Krajina, the UN Protected Areas, which is to be resolved as envisaged by the Vance plan, through direct negotiations between legitimate representatives of Serb Krajina and representatives of the Croatian Government. Of course, we can provide help in this, but we cannot, neither are we authorized, to conduct these negotiations, or to prejudge a final political solution in any way. [passage omitted: Curic presents further details on the signing of the declaration] [Curic] The Geneva conference, when it comes to peace in Bosnia, has not produced any significant steps forward: [Tudjman] Perhaps the conference has never before been as dramatic as today. [passage omitted on Curic round-up of the meetings today] [Tudjman] It was obvious that some participants were in a hurry to reach an agreement, while some others are likewise in a hurry to continue the war. Even though all the sides have stressed that they are in favor of ending the war, practically there have been no results. [passage omitted] [Tudjman] The important headway that we achieved in this regard is that we agreed with the Muslims that talks on contentious issues should be continued, while the most contentious issue has remained their continued demands regarding Neum and central Bosnia. We offered them a draft of our bilateral agreement, they offered us theirs, but differences are so big in this regard that this will probably be discussed when the talks resume in Zagreb. They surprised us with their rejection of 17.5 percent of the territory to be given to the Croats for the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. They accept 33.3 percent in total with regard to concessions that they received from the Serbs, but they are putting forward fresh demands to the Serbs, which refers to some towns; [Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister] Silajdzic even said that he had heard about the 17.5 percent for the first time today, although this conclusion was presented within the conference and within the European Union.
