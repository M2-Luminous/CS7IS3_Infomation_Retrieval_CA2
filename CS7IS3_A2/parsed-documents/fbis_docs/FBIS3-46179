He said the new government will not reverse the reform process, as feared by some enthusiastic reform advocates, especially after the departure of former Deputy Prime Ministers Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fyodorov. Shumeyko indicated that their departure only represents a change in economic policies, and that the new government is shifting its efforts to stimulate production. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin announced a shift from the purely monetary methods of managing the economy as pursued by Gaydar and Fyodorov. Fyodorov, also former minister of finance, today formally quit that post following his earlier refusal to remain in the new cabinet. Sergey Dobinin, his former first deputy, has since been appointed acting minister under a decree by President Boris Yeltsin. Fyodorov disclosed that he recommended Dobinin for the post as he thought Dobinin was "the best choice". Shumeyko ruled out an altered government attitude toward the West following the departure of Gaydar and Fyodorov, saying "Russia will maintain its relations with Western partners as ever." But at the same time he pointed out that Russia, as a "sovereign nation, will not allow anyone speaking to it in a chiding manner." Shumeyko also told the press that presidential power has been consolidated as a result of the December legislative elections and the government reshuffle. The speaker of the Federation Council denied speculation of a dispute between the president and the prime minister over economic policies.
