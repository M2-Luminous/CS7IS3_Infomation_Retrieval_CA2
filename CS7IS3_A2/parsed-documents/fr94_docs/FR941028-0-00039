FR941028-0-00039 FR941028-0-00009 Consistent with the State's role as primary decisionmaker, the AVS is a tool, developed by the Federal government in concert with the States, which provides information in a convenient mode, readily accessible to State regulatory authorities. It is a source of relevant ``information available'' of the type which the State regulatory authority is required by the Act to consider when the State regulatory authority decides whether to issue a permit to conduct surface coal mining operations. Absent AVS, a State regulatory authority would have to laboriously contact other State regulatory authorities for violation and ownership and control information or would have to simply reply upon the voluntary disclosure of information supplied by applicants or by public-spirited citizens. That OSM has taken the lead in developing the AVS and in proposing to require to use of AVS through rulemaking is consistent with the Federal government's role to assist and to oversee the State regulatory authorities. Even then, the content of AVS is the product of the efforts of both State regulatory authorities and OSM working together to incorporate into AVS ownership and control and violation information developed through their regulatory programs. Accordingly, a State's authority to make a decision with respect to a permit application is primary and is unimpaired by anything in the proposed rules and by the State's use of AVS. To the extent that the rules support OSM's oversight of the State's decisions, such oversight is mandated by and consistent with the provisions of the Act and the regulations cited above. To the extent that the proposed rules provide that challenges of information already on AVS be made to OSM, such provisions do not impair primacy. Instead, the rules recognize that the Federal government is uniquely situated to maintain the accuracy and integrity of a nationwide database that will be used by many States. To be sure, each of the State regulatory authorities has a valuable contribution to make to the quality of AVS information. Yet, the individual States may have differing perspectives on ownership and control issues. The potential for inconsistency is significant_particularly with respect to ownership and control decisions relating to multistate companies with complex organizational structures. Also, potential challengers of such information need, if possible, a single point at which they can challenge ownership or control information which will be used in many States and which, absent such a locus, could subject them to inconsistent outcomes. Such a role for OSM is consistent with the role for the agency envisioned by SMCRA. See sections 201(c)(9) and 201(c)(12) of SMCRA. Further, it must be recognized that the decision to deny a permit because an operator is linked to a violation through ownership or control can be an unpopular one, subjecting a local economy to stress. An operator may claim that he ``has been put out of business'' by the State regulatory authority. This is one area where the Federal government can assist the States by accepting the responsibility of maintaining ownership and control information which may ultimately lead to permit denials in the various States. Federal acceptance of such a role helps to assure the integrity, consistency, and accuracy of ownership and control information on the AVS. It is also consistent with one of the purposes of the Act which is ``to insure that competition in interstate commerce among sellers of coal produced in different States will not be used to undermine the ability of the several States to improve and maintain adequate standards of coal mining operations within their borders.'' See section 101(g) of the Act.
