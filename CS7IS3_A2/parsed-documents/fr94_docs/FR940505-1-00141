EPA requests comment on the appropriate schedule of reduction (i.e, faster or slower phase-in) for the seasonal emission limit even though the final (2005) emission limit would not change. EPA will establish enforceable environmental performance targets that will serve as the primary mechanism to achieve the annual emission limits for commercial aircraft operations in each FIP area. These area-wide performance targets will be calculated for each ozone season from 2001 through 2005 using the following formula: Performance target (lbs/PEU)=seasonal emission limit (lbs)/seasonal projected activity (PEUs) Passenger equivalent units (PEUs) will reflect the projected number of passengers and the amount of cargo carried, as described below. The example environmental performance targets presented for illustrative purposes in the tables above use EPA's current PEU activity forecast, which assumes an annual linear growth rate of approximately 1.5 percent per year from 1990 through 2005 based on information from the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG).
