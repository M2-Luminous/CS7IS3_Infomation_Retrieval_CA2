Under Hungarian electoral law, the minister of the Interior proposes candidates for the positions, and Parliament then votes on whether to approve the nominees. Every party with candidates on the national list will then appoint one member each to membership in the NEC, which must have at least nine members. Sometime in March, the parties will be able to collect their candidate nomination slips. (The exact date is to be determined later.) Recommendations from at least 750 people must be collected to enter a candidate in the elections. Candidates in the individual constituencies and those on the national and territorial lists of the parties should be registered at least 30 days ahead of the election date, which today was set for Sunday, May 8, by the president of the republic. Under the terms of the electoral law, the country's 11,000 constituencies should be created within ten days after February 4. Each constituency must have at least 600, but no more than 1,200 voters. The law stipulates that there must be at least one voting station in every town and village. The election campaign will last until midnight, May 6. A campaign ban will be in force from then until the end of the voting. The last day when public opinion poll results related to the elections are permitted to be published is 8 days prior to the elections.
