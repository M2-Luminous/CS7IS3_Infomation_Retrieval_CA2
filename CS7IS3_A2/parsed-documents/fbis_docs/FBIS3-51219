A decision on replacing Cot, in command of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) since July 1, is up to the United Nations, the officials said. Cot is at present on leave in France for family reasons. He was reprimanded last week by UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for stepping out of line by urging NATO airstrikes against Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Known for his plain-speaking, Cot made repeated calls for special powers to carry out air strikes, whereas under a May 1993 Security Council resolution only Butrus-Ghali has authority to call on North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air power. Last week the secretary-general criticised Cot for his public remarks and for pressuring governments so as to be able to call in air strikes. Butrus-Ghali has opposed air strikes for fear of reprisals against UN peacekeepers and of disagreements in the Security Council where Russia is opposed to any escalation of the Yugoslav conflict.
