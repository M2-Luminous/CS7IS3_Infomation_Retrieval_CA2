Could the mainland civil service system really be implemented on schedule? Does the mainland have the fiscal ability to support the system? What are the special characteristics of the mainland civil service system? There are countless questions and discussions. This writer called on the relevant agencies responsible for implementing the civil service system in China to answer these questions. I will first lay out the views of the relevant authorities, in hopes of allowing our friends overseas to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the mainland's civil service system. Deng Xiaopeng's speechmaking on his inspection tour of the South in 1992 opened a new page in the history of reform in the mainland. At the end of that year, the leadership of the Chinese Government discussed and passed in principle a draft proposal submitted by the Ministry of Personnel on the implementation of a civil service system. In 1993, the relevant agencies launched even more enthusiastic publicity to hasten the legislative process on a civil service system and finally pushed through the "Temporary Regulations on a National Civil Service System." When this regulation appeared in the headlines of the mass media, it indicated that the time was ripe for the implementation of a new personnel management system in national administrative organs and demonstrated that the mainland had increased the strength of the political system reform. What is the significance of China implementing a civil service system? Perhaps its like the often heard saying "an outsider can see more clearly." The comments of some foreign analysts are quite insightful. One Western scholar says China is in the middle of a reform of basic systems. They understand that if the government does not reform the personnel system, it will not be possible to solidify the achievements of economic reform. How true this is. Chinese communist policy makers soberly recognize that to intensify the reform of the economic system, they must also proceed with corresponding reforms of the political system and must establish a scientific personnel management system. The implementation of a civil service system is an important "move." Some friends worry that with fiscal difficulties in the mainland, the government will not be able to muster enough capital to raise salaries for civil servants. It is reassuring that the highest policy making regime in the mainland has made appropriate arrangements. According to disclosures, this salary increase for functionaries will be on a greater scale than any previous increase, to gradually correct the problem of relatively low wages for government workers. It was also decided that every agency and every area would begin calculating wages based on the new salary rates on 1 October 1993, regardless of when they complete the reform. Eight Years of Exceptionally Difficult Work The cadre personnel system currently in use in the mainland began during the war years and developed gradually after 1949. Workers in party and government organs, enterprise management personnel, scientific and technical personnel, teachers, doctors, performers, and athletes were all called "national cadres" and were managed in the same way. This type of management method is well-suited to a highly centralized and unified planned economy and served a positive function in the past. With reform, however, in the economic system and in the fields of science and technology, education, and culture, the traditional personnel system is less and less suited to the new circumstances and its drawbacks are more and more serious. Mainly, the concept of "national cadre" is too broad and lacks scientific categorization. The delineation of management authority is too centralized, the management methods are antiquated and unvaried, and the personnel assignment system is not sound. As a result, talented individuals are not able to shine, and corrupt practices are difficult to avoid. As early as 1980, Deng Xiaopeng, the chief architect of opening and reform, raised the issue of reforming the personnel system. He called for the "courageous breakdown of old conventions and of organization and personnel systems not suited to reform"; and the establishment of new systems for the election, admission by examination, appointment and removal, assessment, impeachment, rotation, tenure of office, administrative retirement, and retirement of cadres. In keeping with the arrangements made by the State Council, in 1984 the relevant agencies began drafting regulations on a national civil service system. In 1987, the 13th National Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party formally decided to implement a civil service system. In 1989, the "Temporary Regulations on a National Civil Service System" were circulated nationwide for comment. In early 1990, all 29 provinces, autonomous regions, and directly ruled municipalities (with the exception of Taiwan) of the entire nation, 14 cities with individual plans, and 66 central government agencies submitted feedback to the Ministry of Personnel. At the 14th National Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in October 1992, Jiang Zemin called for the "earliest implementation of a national civil service system." After eight years, the "Temporary Regulations on a National Civil Service System" have finally emerged, fusing together the painstaking efforts of numerous people. To test the feasibility of the "Temporary Regulations on a National Civil Service System" and to seek experience with the implementation of the civil service system, in early 1989, six organizations including the State Auditing Administration, the General Administration of Customs, the State Statistical Bureau, the National Environmental Protection Agency, the State Tax Bureau, and the State Administration of Building Materials were designated as pilot agencies for the new system. In 1990, Harbin, a city in the North and Shenzhen, one in the South, were also selected as pilot locations. During the past five years, the pilot locations have produced laudable results. The main indicators are: Government organs have once again become a priority choice for people seeking employment. The civil service system hires personnel via public examinations for those seeking to enter government organs. Just this provision alone touches the hearts of young people in their prime. They are clearly aware that life in a government organ is spartan but they still list employment in a government organ as a priority choice. From 1989 to 1991, six government agencies under the State Council held three examinations to recruit staff to fill gaps in non-leadership positions. A total of 4,585 registered for the examinations to fill 401 positions. After a written examination, oral examination, physical examination, and assessment, 327 people were hired. The ratio of examination registrants to hirees was as high as 14.7 to 1. The layers of government are the nerve system of the nation. A nerve system must be of top quality in order for the nation it leads to have top quality administrative efficiency, top quality economic benefits and top quality labor productivity. The system also promotes the development of honest government in government organs. Certain policy errors committed in the past by government organs were, no doubt, related to the thinking and work style of officials, but the organization system and work system were also important factors. The hiring system for civil servants can overcome unhealthy practices in personnel assignments. The systems of assessment, discipline, and rewards and penalties can inspire cadres to actively seek self-improvement. The anti-nepotism system can avoid the detrimental effects of family relationships and interpersonal relationships. The top leadership at the State Statistical Bureau led the way on eliminating nepotism in work assignments and transferred relatives of two of the Bureau's Assistant Directors out of the Bureau. The customs system implemented anti-nepotism in official duties. When workers are carrying out official duties which involve a relative, they must voluntarily explain and practice avoidance. The National Environmental Protection Agency had planned to add 30 personnel before entering the pilot program. As soon as the word was out, the officials in charge received over 200 letters seeking favors on behalf of others, thus creating much difficulty for this effort. In 1989 and 1990 this agency held two public examinations to recruit personnel and not a single person asked for favors. The system enhanced the vigor of the cadre ranks. In carrying out the civil service system, the pilot units and pilot cities broke through the long-standing practice of cadres winning promotion but never demotion and entering but never exiting the system. Within their authorized hiring limitations, the six pilot agencies chose a total of over 300 superior individuals. Among these, most were from enterprise and commercial units. Due to the intense competition, the newly hired personnel usually have superior political and substantive qualifications and the distribution of ages and fields of expertise are also more reasonable. After being hired, they quickly fill positions and quite a few have become key workers. In keeping with the regulations in the civil service system on promotion and demotion, the pilot units promoted superior civil servants and demoted, relieved of duties, dismissed or transferred out the small minority of civil servants who did not perform well. Because there is a law, references, and procedures, promotion and demotion is all done smoothly. Everyone feels that there is a future and value in working in a government organization but they also feel the pressure where "public meals are not that easy to eat." The mainland's civil service system, is not only developed out of China's national characteristics as a bold new creation, but also borrows from advantageous methods used by foreign nation's personnel management systems, which reflect modern personnel management patterns. It really is a system which is suited for the socialist market economy system and will gradually develop into a scientific, legalized system of government organization personnel management. Its main characteristics are: One is that it reflects the principle of differentiated management. The national civil service system is primarily used in government organizations and is different from the personnel management system used in enterprise and commercial units. This is a change from the previous method of using a single model for management. Two is that it includes scientific mechanisms for encouraging competition. The hiring method for functionaries uses public examinations, with strict testing and hiring of only the best candidates. The system uses procedures prescribed by the law to assess civil servants and to use the assessment results as the primary basis for awards and penalties, promotions and demotions. Three is that it includes mechanisms for normal turnover of employees. These include normal retirement, exchanges, appointments, maximum age limits on tenure of office, resignations, and relief of duties. Civil servants can enter and leave the system and the civil service ranks will remain full of vitality. Four is that it has mechanisms for guaranteeing diligent and honest government. Diligent and honest government is a fundamental requirement for civil servants and is a constant thread in a civil service's obligations and rights, discipline, hiring, promotions, assessments awards and penalties and other systems and stages. At the same time there are nepotism and other specific regulations which also promote honesty and self-discipline in civil servants. Five is that it is a complete system of laws and regulations. The "Temporary Regulations on a National Civil Service System" is the general law on the civil service system. The Ministry of Personnel and other agencies under the State Council have already, or are in the process of, formulating individual laws and regulations and implementation rules to form a more complete system of laws and regulations and provide a legal basis for civil service management. Some overseas friends mistakenly believe that the civil service system which China is now implementing is similar to the civil service system in western countries. Actually this is a great misunderstanding. The mainland's civil service system adheres firmly to that which suits China's national characteristics and China's special style. It continues and carries forward well the Chinese government's experience and tradition of effective cadre management, and it has basic differences with the West's civil service system. A contrast of the similarities between the Chinese and foreign civil service systems can best explain the issue. The laws and regulations in England and the United States on the promotion of civil servants are closely linked to work quality, quantity and ability. The regulations in the mainland's "Temporary Regulations on a National Civil Service System" not only include the above elements but also adhere to specific requirements for individuals to have both ability and integrity and that people be appointed on their merits. Now, China has the "Temporary Regulations on a National Civil Service System" which suits China's national situation, five years of pilot project experience, and many individual systems which are practical, clearly focused, and very operable (such as hiring by examination, anti-nepotism, and others which are already in use throughout the nation). There is a group of backbone elements from the top to the bottom. It is especially true that with the support of the highest leadership of the Chinese Government and of the masses of the mainland, the implementation of the civil service system in the mainland had several advantageous conditions. Thus, one can believe that from 1 October 1993, with organization reform as a foundation, in three years or a little more time, the civil service system will be basically established in the entire country, and later it will gradually be perfected. This clearly can be accomplished. In his speech during his inspection tour of the South in the Spring of 1992, Deng Xiaopeng said "Whether China's affairs will be handled well, whether socialist reform and opening up can be maintained, whether the economy can be developed quickly, and whether the nation can live for a long time in peace, in a certain sense the key is people." The implementation of a civil service system in China has grasped this key concept at a fundamental level. The strengthening of this reform action has important practical and historical significance in the establishment of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
