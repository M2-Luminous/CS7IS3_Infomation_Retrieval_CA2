FR940223-2-00056 FR940223-2-00035 Further, under the order, TAALS must amend its professional code to conform to the requirements of paragraphs II and IV of the attached order, which are summarized above. TAALS must also amend its bylaws to require each member, chapter, and organizational subdivision to observe the requirements of the order. In addition, the order requires TAALS to provide to the Federal Trade Commission the text of each amendment to the TAALS Bylaws, Professional Code or Working Conditions, and the text of any new rules, regulations or guidelines. We note, however, that the order does not prevent TAALS from adopting and enforcing reasonable ethical guidelines prohibiting advertising that would be false or deceptive within the meaning of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. In addition, TAALS will be permitted to compile and distribute accurate aggregate historical market information concerning past fees that were actually charged no earlier than three years after this order becomes final, if presented in an unbiased and nondeceptive manner that maintains the anonymity of the parties to the transactions underlying such reports. Similarly, the order does not profit TAALS from collecting and publishing accurate publicly available information on fees paid by governmental and intergovernmental agencies if such publication states the qualifications and requirements for such fees. With any publication of fees permitted by the order, TAALS must include a statement that it is prohibited from recommending fees applicable in the United States and that interpreters must independently determine their own fees. In addition, the order states that it does not prohibit TAALS from providing information or its nonbinding and noncoercive views concerning interpretation equipment, the hours of work or preparation, or the number of language specialists used for a type of job. For some specific information, members should refer to the order itself, which is enclosed. Counsel, American Association of Language Specialists.
