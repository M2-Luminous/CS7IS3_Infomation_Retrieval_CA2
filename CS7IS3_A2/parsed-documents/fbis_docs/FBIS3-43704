Roelf Meyer, Cyril Ramaphosa and Rowan Cronje will meet informally to explore whether the political impasse with the Freedom Alliance can be broken. Two rounds of trilateral talks at the end of last year ended with alliance negotiators agreeing to take a proposal to their leaders that would pave the way for further talks. It also addressed the commitment required by the government and the ANC before they are prepared to discuss the changes to the constitution demanded by the Freedom Alliance. The three sides gave themselves until January 24 to broker an inclusive political deal. An apparent lack of movement by the alliance and signs of "reluctance" on the part of the ANC to resume negotiations since the last round had made it more difficult to arrange further talks, a government spokesman said on Thursday. "It is a tense and difficult situation to overcome," he conceded. The alliance was still committed to further trilateral talks, Mr Cronje said on Thursday. However, he warned the government and the ANC to stop "playing with words". He said the alliance welcomed the latest statements from the government and ANC committing themselves to an inclusive settlement, but there were fears the two sides were "stringing the FA along". It appeared some elements within the government and the ANC were not keen to re-open the interim constitutional package. "Let's stop putting obstacles in the way. Let us know where we stand," the alliance chairman pleaded. He dismissed the tough stance taken recently by some alliance members who believe the government and the ANC to be dragging their feet. He also dismissed as "nonsense" speculation that cracks had appeared within the alliance, following Ciskei's decision to participate in the Transitional Executive Council.
