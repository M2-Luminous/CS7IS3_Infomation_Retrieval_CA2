Two of them were given an additional 20 years in prison for attempted murder. The Jerusalem District Court handed down the sentence after convicting them upon their own admission. Our correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that in an unprecedented move, the president of the court did not allow one of the defendants to complete his statement before the sentence was issued in view of the political nature of his remarks, as the judge put it. After the sentencing, Qaramani's brother tried to attack one of the murderers, but was stopped.
