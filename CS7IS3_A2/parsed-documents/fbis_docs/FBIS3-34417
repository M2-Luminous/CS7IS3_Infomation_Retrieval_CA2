Is Iran still the same power trying to export its revolution or has the regime there now shifted to the phase of defending its own existence, and is that now its sole preoccupation? It is clear that the Iran we knew at the time of the war with Iraq in the eighties is not the same as the Iran of today, whose revolution is now entering its 16th year trying to find a new and more pragmatic path. The daily facts of life, especially oil prices, dictate above all that there should be a search for new policies that would negate past policies without announcing it. For how is one to interpret the fact that in Lebanon, through its tools there, Iran appears to be most extremist about Israel but in the Gulf it establishes the best relations with Qatar, the country which has gone further than other Arab states in the region in responding to the peace process and whose prime minister met with the Israeli foreign minister twice, and the country which had expressed willingness to host one session of the multilateral negotiations, which would mean the arrival of an official Israeli delegation in Doha? Qatar, of course, is free to follow any policy it likes, particularly as it is a sovereign state that knows its own interests. It is worth noting that Iran's upstaging stops at certain limits. Where the upstaging game benefits Tehran in defending the regime's past slogans and where such slogans are still alive, Tehran pursues that same policy as in Lebanon, but where appeasement appears to be desirable, such slogans disappear, as in the case of Qatar for instance. It is true that the internal political polarizations sometimes make it necessary for Iranian politicians to continue to play that game even though it has proved to be very harmful to a country such as Lebanon, but it is also true that the changes taking place in Iran are now apparent to everyone. The evidence can be seen in the fact that Syria is engaging in the peace process without any consideration for the Iranian position. Even some of the Lebanese forces which had more than good links with Tehran are beginning to try to emphasize that there is some distance between them and Iranian policies and that their policies are Lebanese before being Iranian. What is taking place in Iran is seen as part of the changes occurring in the region, radical changes that made the sight of Shim'on Peres and Yasir 'Arafat holding hands look quite ordinary as if they have been friends for decades. It remains to say that knowledge of what is going on calls for a minimum degree of thinking about the new picture emerging in the region and the willingness to acclimatize with reality and stop condemning every new element that appears in the picture. Even Iran is changing.
