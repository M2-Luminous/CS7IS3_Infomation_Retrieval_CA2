The city used $1.04 billion in foreign funds from January to November, more than twice the figure in the same period of 1992, Shen Jing, an official with the city's Economic Development Bureau said last week. Industrial output from foreign-funded firms was more than 29 billion yuan ($3.33 billion), or 73 percent of the city's total. And the figure was 32 percent up on the same period in 1992, Shen said. The firms exported goods worth more than $5 billion, an increase of 22.7 percent. That figure accounted for 69 percent of the city's total. In 1993, foreign investment still focused on industrial programmes. However, more and more foreign businessmen invested increasing amounts of cash in tertiary industry. In addition, Shen said, well-known entrepreneurs and international consortia began to turn their attention to the special economic zone. "These investors, instead of investing on one specific item, moved into a variety of trade and professions in a bid to develop overall," he said. Li Ka-shing, the richest entrepreneur in Hong Kong, helped Shenzhen establish the Shenzhen Chang Ho Industrial Company and he invested in many fields. Last year, Li signed an investment agreement to help build Yantian Habour which involved huge amounts of cash from the Hong Kong side. Kumagai Gumi, a well-known a Japanese firm, invested in electronic appliances and in putting up large commercial buildings. To encourage foreign investment in the city, Shen said, a series of favourable policies and economic regulations were set up, which greatly invigorated economic activity. According to a recent study, more than 80 percent of the foreign-funded enterprises in the city made profits. All American-funded firms had annual profits of more than 15 percent and over 50 percent of the companies recovered their investment. The output of Huaqiang Sanyo Electronics, a Sino-Japanese joint venture, has increased by more than 1000 percent since it was set up 12 years ago. Its sales volume hit more than 1.4 billion yuan ($160.92 million) last year. In addition, Shen said, more than 120 foreign-funded enterprises were awarded Nationally Advanced Foreign-funded Firm titles. In a related development, Shenzhen became China's highest exporting city for the first time last year. It exported $7.2 billion-worth of products from January to November, up by 15.7 percent on the same period in 1992, said figures from the Trade Development Bureau. The total figure for 1993 was expected to be $7.8 billion, up 14.7 percent on the previous year. The achievement was made possible by the work of more than 400 foreign trade enterprises and foreign-funded firms as well as processors of imported materials, said a bureau spokesman. Exports by foreign-funded enterprises totalled $5.1 billion, an increase of 22.6 percent. The figure for processing factories was $550 million, up by 14.9 percent, and exports to distant countries were $490 million, up 27.3 percent. In addition, the spokesman said, 21 firms were allowed to set up overseas offices in new markets including Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam. The city also organized or participated in many fairs both at home and abroad last year.
