Immediately following his appointment, Tinca had accompanied, about two weeks ago, the head of the executive [Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu] on his tour in the counties of Brasov, Covasna, Harghita, and Mures. Following this, on 26 March he attended the oath-taking ceremony that took place in the Someseni garrison, together with General Paul Cheler, commander of the 4th Army, the Cluj County prefect, Grigore Zanc, and the mayor of the city of Cluj-Napoca, Gheorghe Funar. After the solemn moment of the soldiers' taking their oath of allegiance to the country, the defense minister talked with the parents and relatives of the soldiers, after which he visited some of the barracks of the "General Avramescu" motorized battalion, the shooting and training grounds, as well as the military equipment maintenance and repair bases. At the end of his visit, at the headquarters of the 4th Army, the minister met with the Transylvanian army corps, with generals, and high-ranking officers. The press was admitted to that meeting. Despite the fact that it is the first time ever that this has happened -- which proves that the Army is trying to be open in its relations with the press and, through the press, with public opinion -- we have to admit that we did not learn too many "secrets." We were already aware, as everyone else in today's Romania, that the budget allotted to the army has decreased each year, that the country's defense industry is almost not functioning at all, and that the pay given to the soldiers is hardly sufficient for them to buy food and pay for the rent and their families' other expenses. We had known that over a number of years the army has ceased to have that spirit of competitiveness it should have, being much rather characterized by a state typical of those struggling for survival. Thus we went there to learn, straight from the source, how much truth there is in such information, so that we can sound the alarm bell while there is still time to correct things. What we heard from generals and high-ranking officers of the 4th Transylvanian Army confirmed that things are much graver even than we had believed. In Transylvania alone, and just in the near future, the cadres of that army would need a total of 4,587 apartments. The Ramnicu Sarat clothing factory is seriously behind with its deliveries of uniforms, and therefore the recruits have been given worn-out clothing. The boots, and generally, all the footwear produced in Bacau come apart the first time they are used in the sleet. Food prices increased so much that officers detached to other units can hardly afford to maintain themselves, let alone support their families left behind hundreds of kilometers away. Many people do not know that officers are expected to teach their soldiers a total of 22 various disciplines, and if they want to sound convincing when they order: "Soldiers, follow me! Forward!" they have to be considered genuine models by their men. "What is even more serious, General Paul Cheler said, -- and this holds true for the entire Romanian Army, not just the Transylvanian one -- is the fact that the officers and other military cadres in all military units will not complain about their low pay or other personal problems, but rather about the fact that their units lack ammunition and fuel needed for drills, their Russian-made radio equipment, for instance, is 40 years old, and that their night ammunition is almost identical to that used at the beginning of the century, because its phosphorus needs to be activated with a flashlight." In order to keep its tanks and armored carrier vehicles operational, the 4th Army needs several dozens of thousands of batteries, 11,000 tires, 2,700 trucks, and several hundred buses and vans, as the ones they are currently using are 20 years old. Besides the shortage in equipment, now they are taking away the army's firing ranges too. A firing range near the town of Turda, spreading over 12,000 hectares, which was in the army's possession before the last world war, is now reduced to merely 2,700 hectares, and that land is also claimed by the inhabitants of an Alba County village. Another firing range in Harghita County, previously used to practice artillery fire in mountain regions, was declared a "natural monument" by local authorities, which also denied the soldiers access to that area. A more serious matter is that they are unable to ensure training for the reserve cadres. According to the law, the army has to pay the called up persons the same amount they earn in their civilian life. However, the army's budget does not provide for such payments, and, if the called up person works for RENEL [Romanian National Electricity Network Corporation], his payment would exceed the salaries of three officers. At the same time the fines to be paid by persons who do not carry out certain military duties amount to merely 24-40 lei. The crisis currently facing the army is not a new one. It has been going on for 10 years. However, one would expect that the modernization process that began over the past few years in Romania would also include the army structures, its endowment with the necessary means to increase its defense ability. Because being a modern country, which we claim we began to be after our admittance to the Council of Europe and after the signing of the Partnership for Peace with NATO, also presupposes our having a modern army.
