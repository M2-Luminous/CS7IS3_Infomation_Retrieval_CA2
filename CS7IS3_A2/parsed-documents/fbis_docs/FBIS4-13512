Sha'th told reporters: We can reach an agreement today after introducing some necessary amendments concerning the transfer of all civilian powers. This agreement will then be adopted by myself, as head of the Palestinian delegation, and by General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation. On the broad lines of the agreement on the transfer of water authority, Dr. Sha'th said the agreement stipulates that water and its full management in Gaza and Jericho come under Palestinian control. This includes the drilling of new wells and the management of old ones, he said. He said Israel will continue to supply Gaza and the settlements with water. The Palestinians will pay Israel the cost of the water they receive, he said, adding: The water that will go to the settlements will pass through our territory and will be under our jurisdiction but the Israeli company of Meqorot will continue to supply the settlers with water. He said the settlements will receive the same amount of water they are receiving now. These, Sha'th explained, are the main points of the agreement but the details of the transfer of water authority will be announced when the agreement is signed. Sha'th said the Israelis will have control inside the settlements as stated by the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on 13 September. Noting that water supplies cannot be divided, he said information will be exchanged on the use of water, meters, and so on. The aim, Sha'th said, is to reach an agreement that preserves our water resources, endangered during the years of occupation. He said the current level of salinity is dangerously high. Sha'th said: I expect that the new Palestinian leadership will focus attention on preserving and promoting water resources. Sha'th said the Legal Affairs Committee is making extremely slow progress, with the problem of legal jurisdiction still not solved. Concerning the Security Affairs Committee, he said, some progress has been made and work on some papers that have been pending since last week may be completed this afternoon. On the progress made in the Security Affairs Committee, Sha'th explained that the negotiators worked out some details concerning the Palestinian police, the detailed Israeli withdrawal plan, some measures concerning the demarcation of the border and the Palestinian self-rule regions, and some measures concerning roads, joint patrols, and crossing points between Israel and Gaza. He said these issues could be completed this evening. Sha'th said there are several civilian and security papers as well as the 24-point general agreement that serves as an introduction to the various issues contained in the appendices. He said four out of the 24 points in this agreement remain to be dealt with. They include the legal jurisdiction. He stressed that the general agreement cannot be completed without finishing with the legal jurisdiction issue. Sha'th said he could not speculate on when the negotiations would be complete. This, he said, depends on the other side. Muhammad Dahlan, a member of the Palestinian delegation and head of the Detainees and Confidence-Building Committee, said an initial agreement to release 5,000 detainees in the next stage has been reached. He said negotiations will continue to reach a final agreement through two subcommittees to release the rest of the detainees. But a responsible Palestinian source said Israel fears releasing the rest of the detainees in the absence of the Palestinian authority and it fears that the release may have a negative security impact on the Israelis. Dahlan said that all the Palestinians deported during the intifadah will be returned. He said that 54 deportees have already returned, six of them yesterday. Eleven more will return to Gaza through Cairo tomorrow, Thursday, he said.
