FR940930-2-00062 FR940930-2-00035 [Announcement Number 503] Public Health Conference Support Cooperative Agreement Program for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Prevention Introduction The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the anticipated availability of fiscal year (FY) 1995 funds for the Public Health Conference Support Cooperative Agreement Program for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Prevention. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of HIV Infection. (To order a copy of Healthy People 2000 or CDC's Strategic Plan for Preventing Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection (July 8, 1992), see the Section Where to Obtain Additional Information.) Authority This program is authorized under Sections 301 [42 U.S.C. 241] and 310 [42 U.S.C. 242n] of the Public Health Service Act, as amended. Smoke-Free Workplace The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. Eligible Applicants Eligible applicants are non-governmental, nonprofit and for-profit organizations. Thus, universities, colleges, research institutions, hospitals, other public and private (e.g., national, regional) organizations, federally recognized Indian tribal governments, Indian tribes or Indian tribal organizations, and small, minority- or women-owned businesses are eligible for these cooperative agreements. Current recipients of CDC HIV funding must provide the award number and title of the funded program (see the Section Program Requirements, C. Letter of Intent). Availability of Funds Approximately $250,000 is expected to be available in FY 1995 to fund approximately 10 to 15 awards. The awards will average $20,000 and will be funded for a 12-month budget and project period. The funding estimate may vary and is subject to change, based on availability of funds. Awards will initially be made on a contingency basis as described in the Purpose section. The following are examples of the most frequently encountered costs that may or may not be charged to the cooperative agreement: 1. As approved, CDC funds may be used for direct cost expenditures: salaries, speaker fees, rental of conference related equipment, registration fees, and transportation cost (not to exceed economy class fares) for non-Federal employees. 2. CDC funds may not be used for the purchase of equipment, payments of honoraria, organizational dues, entertainment or personal expenses, cost of travel and payment of a full-time Federal employee, or per diem or expenses, other than mileage, for local participants. 3. CDC funds may not be used for reimbursement of indirect costs. 4. Although the practice of handing out novelty items at meetings is often employed in the private sector to provide participants with souvenirs, Federal funds cannot be used for this purpose. 5. CDC funds may be used for only those parts of the conference specifically supported by CDC as documented in the Notice of Cooperative Agreement (award document). Recipient Financial Participation CDC will not fund 100% of any conference proposed under this announcement.
