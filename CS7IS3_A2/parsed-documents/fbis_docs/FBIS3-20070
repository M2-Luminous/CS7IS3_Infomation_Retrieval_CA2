Correspondent Dhimitrios Petikhakis has more details on this issue. [Petikhakis] We have just learned that Spain appears to have backed down, and it is not ruled out that the British will do the same. Let us see what the Spanish have backed down from. They have not backed down from the issue of the EU's enlargement exactly, but from the issue of how many countries are needed to change the direction of the European Union. Currently, two large countries and one small one are needed to do that. After enlargement, it is only logical that this number will increase since the number of member countries will also increase. The British and Spanish were saying no. As a result, the institutional future of the European Union, in a way, will be determined here in Ioannina, and this is very, very serious. That is because one and one-half years ago, an institutional accord had been agreed on, and now a new one will be formed. This accord will enlarge the 12-member European Union to 16 members, and will amend the Maastricht goals in 1996. Therefore, we see that something very serious is at stake here in Ioannina. It can not be ruled out that this meeting here in Ioannina will take its place in history next to the meeting that took place in 1991 at a very small town in southern Holland [Maastricht].
