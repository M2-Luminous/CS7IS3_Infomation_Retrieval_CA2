The radio claimed that the demonstration supported Sanaa's legitimacy. Brother Ba-huqaybah told the Yemeni news agency, SABA', in Aden, that there was absolutely no truth to those claims. The truth was that the masses in the province organized a demonstration on the morning of 26 May in which they declared their support for the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. He pointed out that the participants in the demonstration sent a cable of support, in the name of the masses and all the civil and military institutions in the province, to the brother chairman and members of the Presidential Council, in which they expressed their full and absolute support for the young Republic. In the cable they strongly condemned the bloody war sparked off by the bloody al-Ahmar gang, under the leadership of that ignorant shedder of blood, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, against the sons of our Yemeni people.
