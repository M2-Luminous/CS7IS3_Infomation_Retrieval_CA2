FR941103-0-00012 FR941103-0-00003 * * * * * (a) Except for Italian-type hams, Serrano hams, Iberian hams, Iberian pork shoulders, and Iberian pork loins that have been processed in accordance with paragraph (i) of this subpart, the dry-cured ham, pork shoulder, or pork loin came from a swine that was never out of the country in which the dry-cured ham, pork shoulder, or pork loin was processed; * * * * * (h) Workers who handle fresh pork in the processing establishment where the dry-cured ham, pork shoulder, or pork loin was processed are required to shower and put on a full set of clean clothes, or to wait 24 hours after handling fresh pork, before handling hams, pork shoulders, or pork loins that have progressed in the aging/curing process as follows: (1) In the case of Italian-type hams processed in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section, those that have progressed beyond the final wash stage; (2) In the case of Serrano hams or Iberian hams or pork shoulders processed in accordance with paragraphs (i)(2), (i)(3), or (i)(4) of this section, those that have progressed beyond salting; and (3) In the case of Iberian pork loins processed in accordance with paragraph (i)(5) of this section, those that have progressed beyond being placed in a casing. (i) The dry-cured ham, pork shoulder, or pork loin was processed in accordance with this paragraph. Except for pork fat treated to at least 76 ○C (168.8 ○F), which may have been placed over the meat during curing, the dry-cured pork product must have had no contact with any other meat or animal product during processing. (1) *␣*␣* (2) Serrano hams. Serrano hams were processed as follows (190-day minimum curing process): (i) If the ham is received frozen, it was thawed in a chamber with relative humidity between 70 and 80 percent, with room temperature maintained at 12 ○C to 13 ○C (53.6 ○F to 55.4 ○F) for the first 24 hours, then at 13 ○C to 14 ○C (55.4 ○F to 57.2 ○F) until the internal temperature of the ham reached 3 ○C to 4 ○C (37.4 ○F to 39.2 ○F), at which point the blood vessels at the end of the femur were massaged to remove any remaining blood. (ii) The ham was covered in salt and placed in a chamber maintained at a temperature from 0 ○C to 4 ○C (32 ○F to 39.2 ○F), with relative humidity between 75 and 95 percent, for a period no less than 0.65 days per kg and no more than 2 days per kg of the weight of the ham. (iii) The ham was rinsed with water and/or brushed to remove any remaining surface salt. (iv) The ham was placed in a chamber maintained at a temperature of 0 ○C to 6 ○C (32 ○F to 42.8 ○F), with a relative humidity of 70 to 95 percent, for no less than 40 and no more than 60 days; (v) The ham was placed for curing in a chamber with a relative humidity of 60 to 80 percent and a temperature gradually raised in 3 phases, as follows: (A) A temperature of 6 ○C to 16 ○C (42.8 ○F to 60.8 ○F), maintained for a minimum of 45 days; (B) A temperature of 16 ○C to 24 ○C (60.8 ○F to 75.2 ○F), maintained for a minimum of 35 days; (C) A temperature of 24 ○C to 34 ○C (75.2 ○F to 93.2 ○F), maintained for a minimum of 30 days; (vi) Finally, with the relative humidity unchanged at 60 to 80 percent, the temperature was lowered to 12 ○C to 20 ○C (53.6 ○F to 68 ○F) and maintained at that level for a minimum of 35 days, until at least 190 days after the start of the curing process; Except that: In a country where swine vesicular disease exists, the ham must be maintained at that level an additional 370 days, until at least 560 days after the start of the curing process. (3) Iberian hams. Iberian hams were processed as follows (365-day minimum curing process): (i) If the ham is received frozen, it was thawed in a chamber with relative humidity between 70 and 80 percent, with room temperature maintained at 5.5 ○C to 6.5 ○C (41.9 ○F to 43.7 ○F) for the first 24 hours, then at 9.5 ○C to 10.5 ○C (49.1 ○F to 50.9 ○F) until the internal temperature of the ham reached 3 ○C to 4 ○C (37.4 ○F to 39.2 ○F), at which point the blood vessels at the end of the femur were massaged to remove any remaining blood. (ii) The ham was covered in salt and placed in a chamber maintained at a temperature from 0 ○C to 4 ○C (32 ○F to 39.2 ○F), with relative humidity between 75 and 95 percent, and kept in the chamber for a period no less than 0.65 days per kg and no more than 2 days per kg of the weight of the ham; (iii) The ham was rinsed with water and/or brushed to remove any remaining surface salt. (iv) The ham was placed in a chamber maintained at a temperature of 0 ○C to 6 ○C (32 ○F to 42.8 ○F), with relative humidity of 70 to 95 percent, for no less than 40 and no more than 60 days. (v) The ham was placed for curing in a chamber with a temperature of 6 ○C to 16 ○C (42.8 ○F to 60.8 ○F) and relative humidity of 60 to 80 percent for a minimum of 90 days.
