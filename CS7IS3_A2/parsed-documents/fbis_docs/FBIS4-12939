[Abu-Zayidah] The Israelis attribute terror attacks, car bombs, and stabbings to Hamas and think that all its members are the same. However, the truth is that not everybody in Hamas thinks the same way or has the same logic and views about the near future. There are many moderate people among them, who believe in a modus vivendi with the Palestinian rule, similar to that of the Islamic movements in the Arab countries, such as Jordan. These people have got nothing to do with terror attacks, but they represent Hamas. [Klein] Nevertheless, how will you prevent Hamas from setting out on attacks from the Gaza Strip and Jericho? [Abu-Zayidah] The Palestinian side will not allow car bombs or any other attacks to set out from the Gaza Strip. Both sides, the Palestinian and the Israeli, will try to prevent it. [Klein] Has Hamas given you any indication that it wants to take part in the process? Palestinian sources claim that Fatah and Hamas men met on Monday in an apartment in Gaza and that they secretly decided to integrate Hamas in the Palestinian police force, which will also include 2,000 inhabitants of the territories. [Abu-Zayidah] They want to take part in it. They do not reject it. However, their integration in the Palestinian police force has both its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that the police force would be representing everybody and not just Fatah. The disadvantage is that they might use their jobs to smuggle weapons and pass on information against the Palestinian rule in the Gaza Strip. [Klein] How much support do you think Fatah could muster in the territories? [Abu-Zayidah] It is all a matter of economic success; of getting a democratic Palestinian rule established and of successfully solving economic problems. Fatah may very well enjoy the support of 90 percent of the population if it succeeds, and of 30 percent if it fails. Everything depends on how we go about translating the transfer of rule to us into action. [passage omitted]
