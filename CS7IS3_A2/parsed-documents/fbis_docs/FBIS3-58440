Venizelos highlighted that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou had the opportunity, at the highest level, to detail the positions of the European Union and those of the Greek Government on the big national issues of Skopje and Cyprus. The spokesman regretted the grumbling and fabricated, as he put it, criticism by the opposition, which is implementing a strange policy that is out of place following the NATO summit. In a statement on the results of the prime minister's contacts in Brussels, New Democracy discussed a lost opportunity. Political Spring also issued a statement claiming that the lack of a specific result on the Skopje issue indicates the prime minister's failure in his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton. Replying to the New Democracy and Political Spring statements, the government spokesman said among other things that the opposition stance unfortunately doesn't match the circumstances and shows ignorance regarding developments in Brussels and the relevant diplomatic procedures.
