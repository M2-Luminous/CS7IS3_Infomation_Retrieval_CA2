The broad masses of people, including the vast numbers of intellectuals and workers, have a vast reservoir of enthusiasm and creativity for socialist modernization; some of these people are very talented. We should provide them with better mechanism and environment to show off their talent, and enable them to make greater contributions to socialist modernization. Premier Li Peng began by extending his warm congratulations at the meeting to recipients of the national award for excellent entrepreneurs with inventive achievements on behalf of the party Central Committee and State Council. He said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping said science and technology are the primary productive forces. Scientific and technological progress, inventions, and creations decide whether or not an enterprise flourishes and develops. To flourish and develop, to consolidate its national strength, to improve its people's living standards, and to achieve the four modernizations, a country has to rely on scientific and technological progress also. Awarding excellent entrepreneurs who have made inventive achievements is a very meaningful thing to do. You are inventors as well as entrepreneurs. You have turned scientific and technological fruits into productive forces, introduced good products which meet market needs, and brought economic efficiency to enterprises -- all these greatly deserve recommendation. Li Peng said: We have different types of inventions -- great, medium, and small ones. Great inventions can usher in a new scientific era. To a certain degree, the foundation for basic and applied sciences, which have great potentials and bright prospects, has been established in our country. Small inventions can promote social progress, make things convenient for the people, and make society efficient. Our country needs major inventions to scale new heights in science. In addition major inventions, we should also put a premium on small and practical inventions. In his speech, Li Peng expressed the hope to see more inventions and creations being produced on all fronts, so that our motherland will thrive and prosper. Leading Comrades Ni Zhifu, Li Peiyao, Song Jian, and Luo Gan attended the meeting and the first national award ceremony for excellent entrepreneurs with inventive achievements. [passage omitted]
