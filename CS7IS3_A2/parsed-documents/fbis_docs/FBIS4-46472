Parkhomenko, Dr. of Technical Sciences, Professor: "Test Range Leaves Estonian Republic"] [Text] Renewal of the Russian Navy within the framework of the new military doctrine is possible only on the basis of extensive scientific research, both theoretical and experimental, to include testing of weapons, equipment and the ships themselves in the field. Today, one of the most important qualitative characteristics of a ship is its detectability by the enemy's reconnaissance, observation and target indication equipment, and the degree of protection afforded against weapons having guidance systems reacting to ship physical fields. As we know, the parameters of ship physical fields are measured by both maneuvering (ship) and stationary (test range) resources. Both are used in the Russian Navy (in distinction from the U.S. Navy, which uses test ranges only). Maneuvering resources are mobile, and they make it possible to take measurements in different regions of the sea; however, owing to their metrological features they are used primarily for directly checking the correspondence of the levels of ship physical fields to established norms. Stationary systems do not require special deployment for measurements, which significantly reduces testing time and provides for acquisition of broader information, and they can be used effectively in the course of scientific research. Under today's conditions, both our test ranges and those of foreign countries carry out a large number of specific tasks, including in particular: accumulation and analysis of data on the physical fields of ships of different classes, participation in creating new monitoring, measuring and analyzing equipment, development of the procedures of measuring, checking and standardizing ship physical fields, testing and improvement of these procedures in the field, and research on ship physical fields, particularly with the goal of revealing sources of fields exceeding prescribed levels and developing recommendations on how to reduce them. Our test ranges carry out these and other jobs in this area both independently and jointly with other naval organizations, industrial enterprises and institutions of the academy of sciences. In this case, the effectiveness of the research is related to the territorial location of the test range. Proximity of scientific research institutions of the corresponding profile, together with their specialists and modern apparatus, the possibility of utilizing the production base of industrial enterprises to manufacture models of instruments and equipment, and use of ships given over to the navy for testing under comprehensive programs are factors helping to increase this effectiveness. Nor should we forget another function of test ranges--training personnel with the needed qualifications for institutes and directorates of the navy, the Naval Academy and naval institutions of higher education. These specific tasks were assigned in particular to a test range near Tallinn and to a research base in the Crimea. However, in September 1992 the base located in Balaklava was incorporated into the Ukrainian Navy, to a significant degree through the efforts of base commander Captain 1st Rank O. Prodan and his deputy Captain 1st Rank S. Chubarov. The base is currently undergoing reorganization, placing its further existence in doubt. The fate of the test range, which celebrated its 40th birthday on 12 September 1993, was different. Established in 1953 in Khara-Lakht Bay, 75 km from Tallinn, the Naval Test Range No 1 was essentially the only large scientific research center studying ship physical fields in the Baltic. It may be said without exaggeration that the entire country built it. This was a unique facility. The test range possessed sonar and hydrodynamic test beds, a test bed for magnetic treatment of ships and adjustment of steering controls, a magnetic modeling laboratory, an electric field laboratory and a large number of hydraulic engineering structures. Close to 1,000 surface ships and submarines of dozens of designs passed through these facilities; 50 scientific research projects were completed, and the results were introduced into naval requirements, into manuals and regulations on ship protection, and into specifications of new equipment and apparatus. Under the leadership of Rear Admiral Ya. Krivoruchko and captains 1st rank L. Dubinin, R. Krupnov and V. Chizhevskiy, in the 1970's the test range became a huge scientific research and testing organization having extensive ties with the USSR Academy of Sciences, the State Standards Committee and enterprises of ship building industry. During this time it significantly widened and strengthened its ties with enterprises and organizations of the Estonian SSR. Officers of the test range took a direct and active part in testing of the latest ships and submarines of the Northern and Pacific Fleets, and organized special research. The results served as the basis for developing measures to produce physical fields of ships currently afloat, ships under construction and those still on the planning boards. The test range's associates have heard uncontested praise for developing the methods and resources of measuring ship physical fields and processing the data. In the navy they were the pioneers of automating their measurement and analysis. Nor should we forget the test range's contribution to training highly qualified specialists. More than 20 of its associates have become scientists with higher degrees. The 9 July 1980 government decree "On Further Reduction of the Noise of Nuclear-Powered Submarines" called for modernization of the test range with the goal of developing its laboratory base further. There were plans for building new underwater test beds, replacing the measuring complexes and carrying out capital construction. However, cancellation of appropriations as a result of perestroyka processes made it impossible to carry out modernization by the intended deadline, and subsequent changes in the sociopolitical situation, and chiefly Estonia's departure from the USSR and then the Union's disintegration, made it both unsuitable and impossible to carry out the planned volume of work. Its location within a foreign state and the uncertainty of the test range's status in light of the growing strength of nationalistically oriented circles in the Estonian Republic had a negative effect on its scientific activity and production. This is why the question of radically resolving the test range's fate with regard for planned withdrawal of the Northwestern Group of Forces and the Tallinn Naval Base to Russian Federation territory was raised in 1991. A special commission was appointed in order to resolve the issues of its reorganization and to conduct negotiations with the Estonian side. The commission was placed under my charge. Fundamental agreement regarding the suitability of preserving this institution in Khara-Lakht Bay and using it in the interests of the RF Navy and the Estonian Navy was reached in 1992 in the course of repeated working contacts with Minister of State Rayvo Vare and other officials of the Estonian Republic. Providing scientific and technical services to Baltic states in questions of measuring and studying ship physical fields was proposed as one of the directions of its activity. Proposals for using the test range's scientific potential in the interests of space were also developed with the purpose of making it a highly competitive organization in the very near future. Essentially, only one question raised disagreement in the prepared package of documents on implementing the reached agreement: While the Estonian side insisted on staffing the test range with civilians or manning it with servicemen of the Estonian Republic, we suggested that executive positions in the manning table (up to division chiefs inclusively) should be filled by officers of the RF Navy, with all other positions being filled by blue and white collar workers. Changing all of its associates to civilian status while filling executive positions with our specialists who would remain as personnel of the RF Navy was seen as a compromise. Looking back, I can say with confidence that implementing the agreement reached with R. Vare would have best served the interests of the navies of the Russian Federation, Estonia and other Baltic countries possessing naval forces, and of course the interests of RF citizens who had lived in the settlement of Suurpea since the day the test range was established. Mention should also be made of the fact that neither the command nor the associates of the test range had ever experienced cases of negative contacts with the indigenous population of Kharyuskiy Rayon in the "pre-perestroyka" period. But events were destined to develop differently. For practical purposes, a government crisis that resulted in replacement of the Estonian cabinet of ministers scuttled the agreements, which had not been given any legal force. The new individuals who continued the negotiations on the Estonian side wished to interpret the scientific organization as nothing more than a Russian naval base threatening the sovereignty and transgressing upon the economic well-being of what they called their "tiny, impoverished Estonia." Administrative advisor Priiks was distinguished by special zealousness in destroying all that had been accomplished. And although the Estonians offered to lease us land for the test range and award it the status of a naval base, they asked for such an unrealistic rent that there was no doubt that they counted on us rejecting it. The situation regarding the test range was also aggravated by publication of Order No 126 of the Main Command of the CIS Joint Armed Forces dated 4 April 1992, which essentially prohibited all commercial activity by it. In this way, "everything is possible" transformed into "nothing is permitted." Consequently, further attempts at preserving the test range in Estonia and making a profitable enterprise out of it lost all meaning. Dozens of documents coordinated with financial, economic and legal departments and approved by the naval command, the RF Ministry of Defense and the State Committee for the Management of State Property, and contracts signed with Russian and Estonian enterprises, firms and organizations transformed into a useless pile of papers. The months I spent with Captain 2d Rank S. Sazonov, the acting chief of the test range, in Moscow and Tallinn "corridors of power" were wasted. The fate of the test range had to be resolved quickly, and on a new legal basis. The most radical solution, one not requiring special effort, and apparently desired by a number of bureaucratic departments, was to disband it. On the backdrop of the devastation in the country and the enormous difficulties experienced by the navy, this decision might not even have appeared blasphemous. In this way, the test range found itself omitted from the list of troop units to be relocated from the Baltic, which for practical purposes predetermined its automatic disbanding. Under these conditions Vice Admiral V. Polyanskiy, the chief of the Ship Building Directorate, Rear Admiral I. Zakharov, chief of the Ministry of Defense Central Scientific Research Institute No 1, Captain 1st Rank O. Maslov and other officers had to exert a great deal of effort to substitute the word "disband" in the corresponding plans by the words "relocate the test range." The relocation site (variants were proposed from the Far North and the Far East to St. Petersburg) immediately became an object of heated disagreements, ending with adoption of a decision in our favor. We argued the suitability of locating the test range in the vicinity of Leningrad Oblast, which was made evident by the results of special research that scientifically proved the advantages of its establishment precisely within this region. In addition, the positive working experience of a branch of the test range, established there in May 1992, also played a role. A directive published by the General Staff in February 1993, which decided the final fate of the test range, set the deadline for its relocation in late 1993. Thus the work of moving the test range acquired a firm basis, although the real difficulties were only just beginning. A sizable part of the territory of the Estonian National Park near Tallinn had been dedicated to us. I should say in passing that we took very good care of this land. Two military posts were located there, together with their infrastructure including special children's institutions, a sick bay, administrative and laboratory buildings, storage depots and so on. Upon studying and reconnoitering the terrain in the new area (a zone of so-called "magnetic calm"), we found that we could realistically hope to use an amount of territory that barely equaled a tenth of the former territory. Foreseeing difficulties in solving problems associated with reserving the land, and still continuing with our attempts to preserve the test range in Estonia, we began an effort to reconcile this issue. However, despite a decree of the RF Council of Ministers and a directive of the General Staff of the RF Armed Forces that determined the location of the test range, and the basic consent given to this by the leadership of the Leningrad Oblast Council and the local administrative heads, this issue has still not been resolved, and its resolution is the most important task of the immediate future. Of course, the total mutual understanding attained in relation to the test range's fate between us and between V. Pashin and V. Kopchenov, the leaders of the Central Scientific Research Institute imeni A. N. Krylov, and L. Khromykh, chief of the institute's testing station, permits temporary placement of the delivered apparatus and equipment in this area, and creates the necessary conditions for the military unit to start functioning. We were able to retain possession of sizable amounts of material valuables as a result of the relocation. The property and apparatus were shipped by sea and by motor transport. The following ships and vessels were put into service for the sea shipments: the BDK-122, the dry-cargo transporter "Bira," the BTR-77, and the cable ship "Nepryadva." Motor transportation (20-tonne trucks) made around 40 trips. A total of over 1,500 tonnes of freight were transferred, including unique Russian and imported apparatus, an electric power plant, boilers, hangars, transformers and so on. Special and transport launches and vessels registered to the test range were moved to the new basing area (on their own power and under tow by the icebreaker "Buran"), and all of the motor and tractor equipment needed to maintain normal life at the test range was delivered. Because the RF Ministry of Defense did not appropriate resources for the relocation as a separate item, being a cost-accounting organization we made maximum use of our own internal reserves for this. Despite the fact that the recent times have been distinguished by instability of the positions of the military leadership regarding rights granted to scientific and testing organizations of the Ministry of Defense operating under self-financing conditions, we took all possible steps to ensure the test range's survival through the cold winter and spring of 1993, and to fulfill the relocation plan approved by the naval Main Command and avert the social explosions that nearly occurred on several occasions. Nor should we forget the efficient, highly professional work done by finance specialists headed by Lieutenant Colonel S. Kushnarev, who ensured timely payment for work done by the test range on the basis of contracts. We are also indebted to them to a significant degree for attaining complete mutual understanding with the higher financial body headed by Colonel Ye. Abrashkin, which provided timely assistance in converting monetary resources. The work experience acquired by associates of the test range in 1992-1993 in servicing its ZPD [not further identified] by the watch method has allowed us to set up, jointly with specialists of the Central Scientific Research Institute imeni A. N. Krylov and on the basis of delivered equipment, temporary test beds with which to measure and check the physical fields of ships. Creating a high quality scientific and technical product in 1994 is the main objective of the test range. In the first stage, it is fully understandable that such relocation is unavoidably associated with fulfillment of functions by scientific associates atypical of them (functions that are significantly destructive in nature), with loss of a stable way of life, and with periodic experience of extreme situations. Moreover, successes in scientific and productive activity depend directly on living conditions and the personal well-being of people. This is why the chairman and members of the relocation commission tried to do everything within their power to make the move and the initial period of reestablishment as painless as possible. On 17 and 18 November 1993, which were unusually frosty days, a column of 20 vehicles carrying test range personnel and their families arrived at the new place. The last to leave the test range was Captain 1st Rank V. Bokov, as is expected of a commander. The promises of representatives of the naval command to accommodate all of the new arrivals in a sanatorium didn't materialize (we of course didn't really think they would), but to make matters worse, even tents were not to be had. Owing to the assistance of local administrative head M. Sergeyev, deputy director of the local affiliate of the Energiya Scientific-Production Association Yu. Ogurtsovskiy, chief of the testing station of the Central Scientific Research Institute imeni A. N. Krylov L. Khromykh, and director of the tourist base of the Manula Joint-Stock Company N. Okhrimchuk, all of the new arrivals were temporarily accommodated in living quarters allowing them to get through the winter normally. In the future, fully specific measures will be implemented by Colonel S. Trubitsyn, deputy commander of the Leningrad Naval Base, at the direction of the naval commander-in-chief to provide some housing support to the test range's associates. And we are seeking possibilities for radically solving the housing problem, doing everything necessary for this. The relocation has been completed. A period of creative activity aimed at restoring the test range on its new territory, and a scientific and technical base that will be used jointly for the moment with the Central Scientific Research Institute imeni A. N. Krylov, is beginning. Study of the problems of planning an experimental model of the test range will reach its conclusion in 1994. The initial appropriations for 1994-1996 have been planned by a decree of the Council of Ministers. The naval commander-in-chief approved a plan of measures for 1994 and subsequent years to set up and develop its infrastructure. There are full grounds for believing that this plan will be carried out. And so, the test range has left the Estonian Republic, basically preserving its equipment, personnel, and the 40 years' traditions and number of the military unit intact. The losses suffered by the RF Navy in this case are tangible. Given today's requirements on improving the qualitative characteristics of ships and raising their combat effectiveness, the importance of research on ship physical fields is growing. Consequently, there is no doubt that the test range will be restored in full volume in the next few years, and in a new place and on a new scientific and technical basis at that. Russia has sufficient forces and resources for this. The Estonian Republic lost incomparably more: A scientific research center doing work in which all Baltic countries are interested will apparently no longer exist in the foreseeable future on the shore of Khara-Lakht Bay.
