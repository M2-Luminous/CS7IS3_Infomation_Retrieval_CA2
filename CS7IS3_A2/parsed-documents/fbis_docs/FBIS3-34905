In fact it preempted the negotiations by casting doubt on their results, describing them as futile. Syria yesterday expressed a kind of pessimism about the possibility of achieving any progress. A Syrian official has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Israel continues to confuse the issues as a result of its position rejecting peace and the separation policy it is pursuing, which has resulted in the Oslo and Cairo agreements with the PLO. Through this policy it is seeking to infiltrate Arab ranks. The official pointed out that Israel's request to raise the level of representation in the negotiations on the Syrian track centers on its reliance on the concessions offered to it by the Palestinian side, since this request came immediately after the Cairo agreement. He said: No matter how many agreements of that kind are concluded, they cannot lead to a solution in the Middle East, especially as the U.S. Administration and the world are committed to the foundations of the peace process and a comprehensive and just peace is an international demand just as it is an Arab and regional demand. The Syrian official described the new Washington round of negotiations as sensitive and delicate. He said they are bound to reveal the new Israeli orientation, even though nothing has yet been issued by Israel to indicate that it is offering something new through its delegation to Washington. The official said that Syria continues to receive from Washington assurances about the U.S. commitment to the foundations of the peace process. [passage omitted]
