Mr Mwila denied being the grandmaster of corruption in Zambia, and attacked the press as the cause of the breakdown of law and order. Friday's edition of the independent weekly POST quoted him as saying forces working to destabilise the country could, if not checked, precipitate a military coup. He criticised the press for encouraging the trend in lawlessness, recalcitrance, indiscipline and total disobedience to authority, saying: "You make dictators. Read the signs." The press had, he claimed, wrongfully published confidential presidential documents. "Zambian soldiers are not different from Zaireans, Ghanaians or Nigerian soldiers -- they too could blow up soon and take this country by force. Don't push us too far." He rejected charges of corruption, saying he had nothing to gain from it. Mr Mwila warned Zambians to listen to him because the press was abusing its freedom and democracy was being turned into anarchy.
