Francois Mitterrand, who twice thwarted his ambitions only to appropriate the position himself, will do everything he can to prevent [Socialist Party First Secretary] Rocard from succeeding him -- and Mr. Mitterrand retains his full capacity for making a nuisance of himself. In Tuesday [10 May] night's televised interview, the president of the Republic did not attack his former prime minister. He did worse: He ignored him. People had been wondering about Francois Mitterrand's stance with regard to the European elections. Members of his entourage had dropped hints about his preference for Bernard Tapie, which had caused an outcry at "rue de Solferino" [Socialist Party headquarters]. This suspicion of betrayal had grown so much that the president felt the need to pretend to be scolding his staff upon his return from Central Asia. So everybody had to hear that the Socialist president supported no other list than the Socialist Party's. Unfortunately for Michel Rocard, during Francois Mitterrand's interview with Paul Amar and Patrick Poivre d'Arvor, the president proved unable to put an end to the rumors. On the contrary, he gave them a new lease on life. To be sure, he indicated he would vote for the only list that is both "European and Socialist" and that, as far as he knew, there is only one such list. But at no cost would he let himself simply say that he supported Rocard's list. As if even saying Michel Rocard's name would hurt his mouth. While the president had praise for Philippe Seguin [National Assembly speaker], he mustered only minimal support for Michel Rocard. To say the least, he did not appear entirely convinced of the legitimacy of his successor's position at the helm of the Socialist Party. Thus he spoke of the Socialist Party's "current managers." One could hardly have been more reserved with respect to Michel Rocard himself. The president of the Republic was not only coldly malevolent with respect to Mr. Rocard; he also lavished his praise on Bernard Tapie, the Socialist's greatest foe in the 12 June European election. Mitterrand, who seems to have a special taste for canine metaphors, refuses to "howl with the pack." He portrays Mr. Tapie as a left-wing man and commends his merits as a sports club manager and [former] minister. He even had rather encouraging words for him: "He is a man of exceptional energy; but above all, I note that he has chosen the side that we may term progressive." Rocard would probably have been satisfied with lesser compliments. The president went even further on the subject of the impending presidential election. He clearly indicated that he would not take a stand before the second round of voting. And above all he noted that Michel Rocard's candidacy remained to be "confirmed" by the Socialists. And to add insult to injury, he said he expected the winner to be a right-winger. He could hardly have been more malicious toward the Socialist Party's "natural" presidential candidate. This behavior does not seem to affect Michel Rocard, however, who said yesterday on France-Inter radio that he was quite happy with this rather ambiguous support. Socialist Party Treasurer Pierre Moscovici, in a commentary made on RMC radio on the very night of the telecast, was more explicit. He explained that the less support Mitterrand gave to Rocard, the more likely the PS list would be to succeed. Nevertheless, Socialist officials cannot hide from the fact that a failure in the European election (less than 20 percent of the votes) would inevitably ring the knell of Michel Rocard's presidential ambitions. Francois Mitterrand, who remains one of France's best experts in electoral matters, knows this. If he decided to obliterate this man who has been his foe for the last 30 years, it is because he is not one to forgive offences, and also because he would like to be able to hand over his position to a left-wing man. And he is so certain that this man cannot be Rocard that he does everything he can to eliminate him.
