FR940725-0-00129 FR940725-0-00019 Regarding changes to 1915.7 Competent person: Throughout the existing and proposed regulation, the competent person is given tremendous responsibility to ensure worker safety through inspection and testing.␣*␣*␣* *␣*␣* a requirement should be added at 1915.7(b)(8): Knowledge of the physical hazards and the air contaminants which may be produced in the course of the work to be done, the means of preventing employee exposure to them.'' The regulation could even go so far as to require the competent person to attend a 2-day training class certified by the National Fire Protection Association. NFPA maintains a list of certified classes. OSHA agrees that it may appear from the proposal that competent persons are expected to perform some duties equivalent to those of the Marine Chemist, Certified Industrial Hygienist, or Coast Guard authorized person. This was not the intent. OSHA does not believe, based upon the duties that are expected from a competent person, that it is necessary to specify the competent persons be trained by the NFPA as suggested by Washington State. Rather, OSHA believes the knowledge and training requirements in paragraph (c) are appropriate for the testing that a competent person is allowed to do. However, the competent person needs to be trained to recognize the need for more sophisticated assistance and must know how to call for that assistance. This new requirement makes it clear that competent persons, rather than perform all tests and evaluations alone, must have the ability to determine when the expert assistance of the Marine Chemist, Certified Industrial Hygienist, or Coast Guard authorized person is needed. In paragraph (c)(7) OSHA is continuing the requirement found in the second part of paragraph (b)(5) in the previous rule. Paragraph (c)(7) requires that a competent person must have the capability to maintain the records required by the standard. As noted earlier, OSHA has divided the previous requirements of paragraph (b)(5) into two separate paragraphs, (c)(5) and (c)(7). There were no objections to this change as it was proposed in paragraph (b)(6) and (b)(7). Therefore, OSHA considers paragraph (c)(7) to be an editorial change to previous paragraph (b)(5). Recordkeeping. OSHA has redesignated the logging of inspections and test requirements as paragraph (d) Recordkeeping. The changes proposed to the requirements of previous paragraph (c) addressing logging of inspections and tests were contained in paragraph (c) of the proposal. In paragraph (d)(1) OSHA has made substantive changes to the language of previous paragraph (c)(1). OSHA is requiring that the employer ensure that the competent person, Marine Chemist or Certified Industrial Hygienist performing any tests required by Subparts B, C, D, or H of this part, records the test locations, time, date, location of inspected spaces, and the operations performed, as well as the test results and any instructions. OSHA has combined paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of the proposal and eliminated the need for the OSHA 74 form. The new language continues the previous requirement that persons conducting tests and inspections record the results of those tests and inspections. However, it eliminates the mandated use of the OSHA 74 form. OSHA believes that the format or instrument of the test report is not important, so long as the information required by OSHA is contained in the record. OSHA received a number of comments urging the Agency to allow other forms of reporting the atmospheric testing results in addition to the OSHA 74 form. The Navy's Sea Systems Command (Ex. 6&hyph;12) commented that, [Section] 1915.7(c) requires that all tests be logged on the OSHA Form 74. Recommend insertion of the words ``or equivalent'' to allow for use of locally developed (e.g. computer-generated) forms which include at least all of the information required by the OSHA Form 74. Marine Hydraulics International (Ex. 6&hyph;21), Colonna's Shipyard (Ex. 6&hyph;22), S.T.A.S. (Ex. 6&hyph;37) and Moon Engineering (Ex. 6&hyph;38) agreed and submitted identical comments that stated: We suggest that the following words be added to the end of this paragraph: ``or equivalent.'' The OSHA 74 does not possess room for additional instructions to workers, and by allowing the use of an equivalent form, workers could be informed of other requirements that the Shipyard Competent Person may invoke. In previous paragraph (c)(1), competent persons were required to make a record of the locations, operations performed and the date, time, and results of any test they performed on a ``Log of Inspections and Tests by Competent Person'' (OSHA 74 form). Competent persons were also required under previous paragraph (c)(1) to use a separate form for each vessel on which tests and inspections were made. By allowing the use of alternative forms to record atmospheric test results, the employer will have more flexibility in complying. However, employees will be protected and OSHA will be aided in its enforcement by the fact that employers will still be required to maintain records of tests and inspections. In paragraph (d)(2) of the final rule, OSHA continues the maintenance of records requirement of previous paragraph (c)(2). OSHA is requiring the employer to ensure that records created to comply with the recordkeeping requirements of this section are posted in the immediate vicinity of the affected operations while work is progress and for a period of at least three months from the completion date of the specific job for which they were generated. OSHA considers the new language to be a non-substantive change. In paragraph (d)(3) of the final rule, OSHA continues the availability of records requirement of previous paragraph (c)(2). Paragraph (d)(2) requires the employer to ensure that the records required in this section are available for inspection by the Assistant Secretary, Director, employees, or their representatives while work in the affected spaces is in progress. The new language contains editorial corrections for clarity and consistency with other OSHA record inspection requirements. OSHA considers the changes to this paragraph to be non-substantive. C. Subpart B, Sections 1915.11 through 1915.16 1. §1915.11 Scope and Application The scope contained in previous §1915.11 applies the requirements in Subpart B to vessels and vessel sections found in shipyards during ship repair and ship breaking; §1915.16 applies to ship repair only. On November 29, 1988, OSHA proposed to amend its shipyard standards addressing safe entry into and work within spaces containing explosive and other dangerous atmospheres on board vessels and vessel sections in shipyards (53 FR 48092). Under this proposal, OSHA would have applied Subpart B to all types of shipyard work on vessels and vessel sections, including ship building, ship repair, and shipbreaking. The Agency proposed extending the scope of Subpart B in this manner to protect employees entering and working in explosive and other dangerous atmospheres, regardless of the type of work they were performing. Subsequently, after the closing date for comments on this proposed shipyard rule, OSHA also proposed new rules for confined spaces in general industry (54 FR 24080, June 5, 1989). The general industry proposal would have had the effect of covering land-side (that is, other than shipboard) confined spaces in shipyards, such as piping systems in shops or confined spaces in staging areas. As noted earlier, SESAC reviewed the general industry proposal and made recommendations regarding its possible application to shipyard work. In June 1992, OSHA reopened the record for Subpart B (57 FR 28172, June 24, 1992), to place the SESAC recommendations in the rulemaking record and to gather additional information on whether or not the proposed general industry confined spaces standard was appropriate for land-side confined spaces entered during shipyard work.
