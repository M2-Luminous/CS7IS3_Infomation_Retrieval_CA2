He Told Them So Without Witnesses"] [Text] At yesterday's session of the Council of Ministers Presidium the Russian Government deemed "unsatisfactory" the general state of discipline in ministries and departments. INTERFAX, citing government sources, reported in particular that out of 296 presidential directives to ministries and departments only 156 were executed in full. As SEGODNYA's correspondents have learned, Premier Chernomyrdin's statement was couched in extremely sharp tones. This must be why journalists were not allowed into this session while the "chosen" press learned about the results of the presidium session from Mr. Grishin, deputy chief of the government press service. Although one of the reasons for the premier's sharp tone was apparently his "grudge" against the vice premiers who had earlier twice disrupted the meeting, the course of the session shows that Viktor Chernomyrdin is in full control of the situation and can allow himself such a style in dealing with his cabinet. According to Mr. Grishin, the performance of the Economy Ministry, the Finance Ministry and the State Property Committee [Goskomimushchestvo] was criticized most toughly. According to some reports, emergency conferences were held in the latter two departments immediately following the end of the session. Mr. Grishin also said that the government decided to reprimand and reprimand severely "a number of high-ranking officials." Furthermore, according to SEGODNYA's sources, Anatoliy Chubays was advised to remove Valentin Sychkin as deputy head of Goskomimushchestvo, which is effectively equal to his dismissal. In early 1993, however, Mr. Chubays managed to stand up for two of his deputies: Dmitriy Vasilyev and Petr Mostovoy, whose resignation Viktor Chernomyrdin demanded immediately after his confirmation as premier. Mr. Sychkin is in charge of Goskomimushchestvo divisions dealing in real estate, including Moscow real estate. According to Mr. Grishin, the decision about the dismissal of other highly placed executives (the reference is apparently to First Deputy Economy Minister Andrey Shapovalyants) was postponed until their return from business trips abroad.
