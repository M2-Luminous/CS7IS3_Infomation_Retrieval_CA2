Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton met with visiting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, trying to strike a Western consensus on how to deal with the two-year-old ethnic war in the former Yugoslav republic. UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said in a letter Friday [28 January] that he had instructed top UN officials to actively plan to open the Tuzla airport for relief supplies and to replace Canadian troops at Srebrenica with Dutch peacekeepers. "We've endorsed that report," said Warren Christopher, the secretary of state. "That could lead to the use of air power if there's not an agreement." One administration official was quoted by the ASSOCIATED PRESS as saying that Washington could seek tough UN sanctions against Croatia similar to those Serbia is now suffering. Top on the agenda during Kohl's meetings with Clinton included Bosnia, but the German chancellor disclosed little specifics. "We talked about a number of possibilities that I wouldn't want to make public just yet," Kohl said at a news conference. A White House statement said the two leaders discussed "a range of international and bilateral issues, including developments in Russia, Ukraine, Central Europe, Bosnia and the Middle East." "They agreed on the need for vigorous follow-up on NATO summit decisions," the statement said. The Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims will resume talks in Geneva, Switzerland, on February 10. While France urges the United States to exert pressure on the Bosnia Muslims to reach a peace agreement with the Serbs and Croats, Washington has stressed all along that no peace settlement should be imposed on the warring sides. The U.S. is unwilling to dispatch ground troops to Bosnia unless all three sides reach a peace accord in good faith. Clinton won support today from Kohl on that front. Kohl said he was against imposing a settlement on the warring parties and intervening with NATO ground troops. That would lead to "blood bath" and "more traumatic and more tragic" results, Kohl said.
