The group submitted a petition to the Food Agency to allow it to buy Thai rice from wholesalers according to their needs, agency sources said. The Food Agency will decide on its attitude to the rice retailer's petition after examining the rice sales situation in June, an agency official said. Thai rice is unpopular on the domestic market chiefly because its grain type is not suitable for traditional Japanese meals. The sources quoted the head of the nationwide rice retailers' group as saying retailers have been piling up stocks of unsold Thai rice and do not have any solution on how to reduce them. Japan broke a longstanding rice import ban this year to make up for supply shortages caused by a poor domestic harvest last year due to a cool, rainy summer. On Tuesday, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Mutsuki Kato said rice import contracts have been signed for a total of 2,545,000 tons so far and no more contracts will be concluded. China was the biggest exporter with 1.07 million tons, followed by Thailand with 753,000 tons, the United States with 537,000 tons and Australia with 183,000 tons. The Food Agency, which regulates rice production and directly supervises imports and distribution, has instructed wholesalers to sell domestic rice and foreign rice in a set at a certain proportion. In the case of Thai rice, the ratio was 20 percent a set when imported rice was put on market in March. The ratio was then reduced to 10 percent in May. However, according to retailers, consumers often leave Thai rice at the shops even though they have paid for a whole set. There have been resales of Thai rice on an unauthorized market at lower prices -- often below 50 yen per kilogram, which is cheaper than one quarter of the government-set price, the retailers said. There are even supermarkets offering Thai rice for free to consumers, or groups of people planning to donate it to countries with food shortages, they said.
