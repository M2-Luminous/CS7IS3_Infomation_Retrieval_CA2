The 1994 National Trade Estimate on Foreign Trade Barriers announced by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) at the end of March found Japan guilty of unfair trade practices in many industrial sectors. The latest USTR report on foreign trade barriers is "significantly different" from those prepared in past years in that it is aimed to pave the way for invocation of a retaliatory trade provision known as Super 301, MITI said. Unilateral trade measures like Super 301 constitute violations of the recently signed global trade accords under the Uruguay Round sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), MITI said. "Such steps are global targets of criticism as they erode free trading systems," MITI said in a statement. The statement dismissed U.S. claims that Japan's markets are closed while its trade surplus, traced to the closed nature of the markets, helped deprive Japan's trade partners of opportunities for employment and production. Japan's global trade surplus has been derived not from its market conditions as if it were closed but from macroeconomic structural problems, the statement explained. MITI also argued there is no ground to support the claim that Japanese markets are more closed than other countries. An average tariff on industrial and mining products is only 2.2 percent in Japan against 5.4 percent in the United States and 5.7 percent in the European Union (EU), MITI explained. Under the recently reinstated Super 301, Washington will seek to identify foreign trade barriers using the USTR findings. The U.S. would then have until Sept. 30 to pinpoint priority countries that are engaged in unfair trading.
