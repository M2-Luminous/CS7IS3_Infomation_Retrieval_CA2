Japanese Government officials in charge of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks predict that Japan's stimulus measures, tax cuts, and the microeconomic area will be at the top of the agenda for the summit talks, but they do not hide their embarrassment at the present situation wherein political turmoil makes it impossible to set a specific schedule for the compilation of a budget for fiscal 1994. The question is whether the government will be able to compile the budget before the summit talks. U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen, who arrived in Japan on 23 January, asked the Japanese Government to "take vigorous and continued fiscal measures" and other senior U.S. Government officials echo his view. If the House of Representatives were resolved and general elections held, the compilation of the budget for fiscal year 1994 would undoubtedly be deferred until after the summit talks. Many government officials are in favor of putting off the summit talks, saying, "The summit talks, even if held, would be meaningless," (says a senior official in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry). An analysis by the same senior official in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] says that if the Finance Ministry manages to work out an internal draft budget bill after averting the worst situation where the House of Representatives is dissolved and generation elections called, it is highly possible that the summit talks will be held as planned. The same senior MITI official predicts that even if the Hosokawa government remains incapacitated, the U.S. Government has a "mythological view" of Prime Minister Hosokawa and the U.S. Government is not expected to refuse to hold the summit talks." Treasury Secretary Bentsen, however, pressed Japan for agreements at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, asserting, "If the agreements are inadequate, it is better not to hold the summit talks, and the United States will seek to review the basis for the bilateral economic framework talks." It is hard for the Hosokawa government to reach bold agreements with the U.S. Government that could weaken its power base. Hence, the Hosokawa government will have limited options, (says a senior official in the Foreign Ministry). The government officials in charge of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are increasingly feeling a sense of crisis concerning the Hosokawa government.
