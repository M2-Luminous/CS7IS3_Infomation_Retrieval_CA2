Our army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David reports that the five men claim that their appeal was neither a media gimmick or a joke. They assert that their deportation to south Lebanon would satisfy the prime minister's craving to be rid of them and also get them out of jail. The five said that in south Lebanon they could contribute to the conquest of Eretz Yisra'el and the war against terrorism while realizing their Jewish and Zionist aspirations.
