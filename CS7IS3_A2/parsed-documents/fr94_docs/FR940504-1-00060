FR940504-1-00060 FR940504-1-00018 F. Additional Requests for Comment 1. Prior Knowledge The objective of conducting a CV study in a natural resource damage assessment is to determine the damages suffered by the public as a result of a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance into the environment. For consideration of lost nonuse values, the relevant public may include the entire U.S. population, or may include a regional subset of the population. Damages may be sustained by each individual in the relevant public, but only a small fraction of the public will actually participate in the survey. The damages an individual suffers from a discharge or release depend on many factors. These include the effects of the discharge or release on natural resources, how much the individual uses the services provided by the injured resources, individual preferences, and the individual's information about the release or discharge and the world in general. In conducting the survey, it is necessary to educate the respondent about the natural resource itself, the facts surrounding a discharge or release, and the impacts of the discharge or release on the resource. This education process greatly changes the respondent's information set. Upon gaining this new information, respondents are then asked to place a value on the losses suffered. There is general agreement that the losses an individual experiences from a discharge or release after learning the new information are likely to be systematically different than the losses they would experience prior to learning the new information. Some commenters have argued that the fact that the CV method itself actively changes the information set of an individual prior to valuing the good or service makes it fundamentally different from other economic valuation methodologies. These commenters have questioned whether it is appropriate to extrapolate value estimates based on post-survey information to the general population. Given the assessment's objective of estimating damages owed to the public at large, and the small fraction of the public that actually participates in the survey, some have argued that the relevant information set for the purposes of extrapolating to the general population is the pre-survey information set. One way to move towards value estimates that reflect the information set of the general public is to obtain information in the survey itself regarding the respondents' pre-existing knowledge about the resource and injury to it. Regardless of the value a respondent states after learning information from the survey, those respondents who were not aware of the resource or an injury to it or both would be assigned a value of zero. The rationale for assigning a zero value is that if X percent of the survey respondents did not know about the resource or injury, then X percent of the relevant public is likely to be similarly uninformed. (Implicit is the assumption that individuals who are unaware of the injury at the time of the survey would continue unaware, but for the survey, for the foreseeable future.) Other commenters have articulated the point of view that the level of respondents' prior information about the injury is irrelevant to the determination of natural resource damages. According to these commenters, an education process increases the reliability of CV by exposing respondents to a uniform set of information regarding the characteristics of the commodity, availability of substitutes, and prices. Consumers undertake a similar education process in private markets to form their demands for other commodities. In this sense, the education process is necessary so that CV is not fundamentally different from other valuation methodologies. Further, these commenters have stated that the fact that an individual is not informed of a specific injury does not mean that he or she suffers no loss as a result of the injury. Natural resources are held in trust for the public. Therefore, WTA rather than WTP would be the most appropriate measure of lost values of injured resources, were it not for the technical difficulties involved in eliciting WTA. Each member of the public has an interest in the injured natural resources being valued regardless of whether he or she is aware of the particular resources and injuries. Therefore, these commenters believe it would be inappropriate to require that CV respondents' values only be counted if they were aware of the injured resources before the survey. The Department seeks comments on whether it is appropriate to use information regarding pre-existing knowledge of respondents to reassign to zero any positive values expressed by individuals who were unaware of the injuries prior to the survey in the calculation of damages. Commenters who believe it is appropriate to assign zero damages to individuals with limited prior knowledge should articulate the rationale for doing so. Commenters who believe that it is inappropriate to assign zero damages to individuals with limited prior knowledge should articulate their rationale for using the post-survey information set to extrapolate damages to a public that only has pre-survey information.
