An unidentified presenter announces that today's program will present the election platforms of the Christian Democratic Party and the Labor Congress of Ukraine. The Labor Congress of Ukraine is represented by Yuriy Yekhanurov, deputy minister of economy, and (Anatoliy Tovstoukhov), the secretary of the political executive committee of the Labor Congress of Ukraine. The Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine is represented by Vitaliy Zhuravskyy, party chairman. The first representative of the Labor Congress speaks in Russian. He says the current leadership is to blame for Ukraine's crisis and the current year's budget, adopted by the government, is an example of yet another deception of the people. Therefore, he says, it is clear why political parties and movements are striving to take power. As background information, the representative says the Labor Congress was formed in April 1993 on the basis of the Union of Small Enterprises, the Union of Leaseholders, several independent trade unions, youth organizations, and the all-Ukrainian Association of Entrepreneurs. Today it has a membership of over 2,000 and affiliations in 18 oblasts and in Kiev. The party is an independent party of centrist orientation and its objective is active participation in the election through the 2nd congress, which is to take place on 29th, the setting up of the socio-political bloc "Solidarity for the Sake of Well-Being and Progress," and the party intends to form a faction in parliament. Among the party's nominees is former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, who was nominated by the Dnepropetrovsk organization of the Labor Congress of Ukraine. The representative then states the party's election program envisages three priorities: man, market economy, and state. In his opinion, neither the West, as a whole, nor Clinton will help Ukraine unless it helps itself. In conclusion, the first speaker says the party favors expansion of cooperation with Russia and other CIS countries in the economic sphere. The party believes that Ukraine should be a presidential-parliamentary republic with the growing decentralization of the administrative economic system which should lead to federalism. Enterprises and regions should be granted more rights; the social policy should be geared to ensuring people's right to work; salaries and wages should correspond to the cost of living, and support should be rendered to young families, pensioners and invalids. The second representative of the Labor Congress of Ukraine speaks in Ukrainian. He says the economy should be re-oriented toward satisfying social needs. One of the goals is to increase the number of private owners. Private property will be a basis for improving the economic situation. The state should retain its functions as a regulator during the transitional period of market transformations. More jobs should be created as soon as possible. Credits should be given to working private owners and to those who wish to build their own homes. Next, the program's presenter invites the audience to watch and listen to a video recording of the election speech made by chairman of the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine Vitaliy Zhuravskyy. Vitaliy Zhuravskyy says that it is time to do away with miserable existences, scanty wages, sky-rocketing prices, the mafia, and corruption. The Christian Democrats call on the people of Ukraine to elect honest and decent people to the new parliament. Ukrainians have always had worse living conditions than the peoples of democratic countries and those who initiated perestroyka were the first to flee Ukraine to find refuge abroad. For example, the former minister of power engineering of Ukraine, Sklyarov. Zhuravskyy says the Christian Democrats build their ideology on the philosophy of faith, hope, and charity. His party will insist that Ukraine's share of the former USSR property be returned and that the gold and diamond funds, as well as the property abroad, be divided fairly. Reforms, he says, should be launched in practical terms with agriculture being a priority. The Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine supports different forms of ownership in the countryside. Continuing with the economy, Zhuravskyy says the energy sources must be diversified and energy-saving production methods must be developed. A rigid credit and financial policy is imperative to curb inflation. However, most important are demonopolization and privatization on a nation-wide scale, as a result of which every citizen should receive his share of the state property. All forms of ownership: state, joint-stock, and private must be on an equal footing. The taxation system should be revised so as to give a boost to the production sphere. Zhuravskyy adds that today, during the period of a transition to civilized economic relations the teams led by Parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch and President Leonid Kravchuk show total inability and feebleness in forming an efficient government of reformers. The Christian Democrats favor a strong and efficient army which will ensure Ukraine's territorial integrity. Ukraine should become a state with a powerful space industry, Zhuravskyy says. On religion, Zhuravskyy says the Christian Democrats support the equality of all church denominations and the separation of church and state. As a human rights organization, the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine believes that human rights and the rights of the nation must not exclude each other. Finally, Vitaliy Zhuravskyy says his party will use its vast international relations to cope with the Chernobyl aftermath and help its victims. Help will also be provided to labor and war veterans.
