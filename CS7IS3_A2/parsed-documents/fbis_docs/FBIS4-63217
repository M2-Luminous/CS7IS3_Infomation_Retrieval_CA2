Zafar Khakimov of the Uzbek national broadcast company would neither confirm or deny this information to Interfax saying that he did not have the relevant information. In the meantime local television and radio workers have already been told that in the near future Uzbek broadcasting will be increased by a total of 20 hours per day to make up for the loss of Ostankino and Mayak. To this end another 200 people will be employed. For Uzbek residents television and radio programs from Moscow are the main source of information about life in Russia, the CIS and the world. Of the former Soviet and now Russian newspapers, only RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, TRUD and MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA are published in the republic.
