[Friedman] But a date and a place is being sought, because the two of you want to meet. [Peres] It is not a question of our wanting to meet. I think the negotiations must be resumed in the appropriate manner and with momentum. The Hebron tragedy undoubtedly created a new situation which has to be addressed and overcome, and conclusions should be drawn from it. [Friedman] Is it true that there is talk of some kind of sequential deal under which Israel would be prepared to.... [Peres, interrupting] I do not like the word deal; we do not need deals. We would like to address every issue on its value. There is a mutual interest in preventing the killing of both Arabs and Jews. The present situation is truly intolerable. [Friedman] Is it possible that Shim'on Peres' view that the Jewish settlement in the heart of Hebron is detrimental and injurious to the peace process may be adopted -- at least in part -- and that as a result, all the Jews residing in the heart of Arab Hebron will soon be moved to one site? [Peres] What is certain is that we would not discuss such an issue with any foreign, non-Israeli element. Israel would have to make such a decision alone, independently, taking its own factors into consideration. This is not an issue for negotiation. At the same time, the way the Jews are sprawled out in Hebron is unquestionably awful: We are spread out over five sites, one of which is inhabited by eight families, each living in a camper. This causes us much concern. Hebron is still under curfew, but that is no long-term solution and they have been under curfew for a long time already. I regret to say that the dream of coexistence between settlers and Palestinians received a terrible blow in the Tomb of the Patriarchs. [Friedman] To make your Sunday meeting with 'Arafat possible, the government will have to make the decision on Hebron sooner than planned. [Peres] I do not know; I do not think one depends on the other. [Friedman] Mr. Peres, we disclosed this morning that two IDF [Israel Defense Forces] bases have been moved from densely populated Arab areas in Gaza. I would like to ask you whether that is part of our gestures to 'Arafat and part of the evacuation and redeployment process, which has started despite the absence of a relevant political decision. [Peres] No, that has absolutely nothing to do with the negotiations. It has to do with the IDF deployment in the Strip. There are places where the IDF is being reinforced and others where it is reducing its presence in anticipation of future deployment, but these are unilateral Israeli steps. [Friedman] Thank you very much, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. [Peres] You are welcome. [end recording]
