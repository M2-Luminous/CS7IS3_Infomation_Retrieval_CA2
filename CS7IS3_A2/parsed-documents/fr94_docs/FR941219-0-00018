ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is revoking a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for the chemical substance described generically as an alkenyl ether of alkanetriol polymer, which was the subject of premanufacture notice (PMN) P&hyph;93&hyph;458.

Therefore, the Agency is revoking this rule, as required under the Expedited SNUR rulemaking process (40 CFR part 721 subpart D). In a separate notice of proposed rulemaking published elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register , EPA is proposing a SNUR for this substance with a 30&hyph;day comment period.

The docket control number for the revocation is OPPTS&hyph;50612C. For details, refer to the proposal published elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register . The relevant portions of the original docket for the direct final SNUR are being incorporated under OPPTS&hyph;50612D, which is established for the proposed rule.
