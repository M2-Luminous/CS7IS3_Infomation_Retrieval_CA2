FBIS4-7251 "dreas082_d_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 South Korea Samsung Signs Automaking Contract With Nissan Samsung Signs Automaking Contract With Nissan SK2804133694 Seoul YONHAP in English 0740 GMT 28 Apr 94 SK2804133694 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- Regardless of the pros and cons over the country's biggest business group entering the automaking industry, Samsung Heavy Industries is moving fast toward that goal by striking a deal with Japan's Nissan Motor Co. Samsung, announcing a contract to adopt Nissan automaking technology Thursday, said its cars -- intended strictly for export -- will be patterned after three new 2-liter models made by Nissan. It plans to notify the Trade, Industry, and Energy Ministry of its agreement with the Japanese automaker as soon as possible. Immediately after the announcement, Assistant Minister Pak Sam- kyu said his ministry will scrutinize the contract to determine whether it complies with related laws when Samsung submits a technology-import application. Although it looks fine at first glance, the announcement was made by the concerned company and may be different when studied from a legal viewpoint, he told reporters. Under the contract, Nissan will transfer technology on its latest cars and jointly develop Korean models, as well as provide engineering assistance to localize the cars and know-how on running production lines. The two agreed to set no limits on export lines for Samsung and to give the Korean company full rights to change auto parts and design. The absence of limits on export lines and design changes is unprecedented in Korea's history of technology importation, a Samsung official said. The key points to their agreement are that Samsung will have its own car brand and independently choose overseas markets, acquire the latest Nissan technologies including its unique VQ engine and QT suspension, and exchange information on sales, marketing and after- sales service. In return, Samsung is to pay Nissan 1.9 billion yen (14.3 billion won, or 17.7 million U.S. dollars) in royalties plus 1.6 percent to 1.9 percent of the price of every warehouse release in technology fees. Moreover, it will pay 6.76 billion yen (50.7 billion won) in delivery and technology fees for the three new models in order to acquire full authority over their sales in overseas markets. Samsung had also been looking at Toyota of Japan and Volkswagen of Germany, but chose Nissan after it accepted most of Samsung's proposals. Nissan, with annual production capacity of 2.81 million cars and turnover of 27.4 trillion won last year, is the world's fifth biggest automaker after General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and Toyota. Samsung was drawn by Nissan's world-class technology and its willingness to fully transfer advanced technologies. Samsung, which jumped into truck-making just last year, expects to start with 50,000 units in its first production year, the official said. It pledges to more than fulfill the 70-percent guideline set for localization to become a representative Korean exporter.
