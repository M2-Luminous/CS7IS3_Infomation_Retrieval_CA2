The shaykh expressed surprise and astonishment at the statement, which coincides with efforts to resume negotiations on the occupied territories, including Jerusalem. Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq said: If the American President really made the statement attributed to him, then this shows that the American position is not steady. Such statements harm current efforts to resume talks between the Palestinians and the Israelis and talks between Israel and the other Arab cordon states, namely, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. The al-Azhar shaykh called on officials to take a position if the U.S. President is proved to have made such a statement.
