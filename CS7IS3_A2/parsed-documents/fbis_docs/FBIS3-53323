[Bahman] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. Declaring a day of solidarity with Bosnia-Herzegovina is a commendable move but a verbal expression of sympathy alone should not suffice. You should persuade them [not further identified] to adopt clear and definite decisions. Those who believe it is enough to pay mere lipservice should remember that they can become involved in similar predicaments. [ETTELA'AT] How do you appraise the reaction of Islamic countries on Bosnia-Herzegovina? Have they met Bosnian expectations? [Bahman] Islamic countries have not done all they should in the face of such atrocities. Unfortunately, when assistance was needed, it did not come. Now it is too late. [ETTELA'AT] There have been numerous rounds of peace talks by the EC and the United Nations to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What has been the outcome for Bosnia? [Bahman] As I said, the Islamic countries have not met Bosnian expectations and some still deal with the aggressors. Some have thought only of keeping their governments in power and, since they demand assistance from abroad, these foreigners motivate them to act against Islamic countries. Tomorrow, they will meet the same fate. [ETTELA'AT] How do you view the recent peace talks in Geneva and Brussels? Can the sides reach a compromise in these talks? [Bahman] The sole objective of these conferences is to have Europe free itself of the problems of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The objective is to terminate the war but without bearing in mind the rights of the Bosnian Muslims. This conference will resolve nothing and misfortune and hardship will still prevail. [ETTELA'AT] How do you see the current position of the secessionists of the Bihac uprising? [Bahman] The Bihac scenario was staged by a group who were safeguarding the former regime's interests. They are the supporters of the former (Bolshevik) regime. They wish to rule regardless and clearly, this country's enemies are assisting them. [passage omitted] [ETTELA'AT] How do you view relations between Iran and the Bosnian Muslim government and their future? [Bahman] The Islamic Republic of Iran continues to extend assistance to the extent it can. This is why conditions for greater cooperation have been created. Iran is one of the greater countries for trade and construction and if peace is restored in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the two sides can forge bilateral cooperation. [ETTELA'AT] What message do you have for our readers? [Bahman] There are many things that should be said but my message to the Iranian people is that first, solidarity among Muslims is important, as there can be no progress without it. Second, wisdom and intelligence are necessary everywhere. Specialists and youth should seek to acquire new technology and grapple with problems. The Islamic Republic of Iran has a competent specialized cadre. No one should content himself with dependence on foreign specialists or seek solutions from them.
