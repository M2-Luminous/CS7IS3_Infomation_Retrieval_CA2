Bulatovic, in an interview to Radio Kragujevac, Serbia, pointed out that the Army of Yugoslavia had a highly developed system of the country's defences. "It is common knowledge," said he, "that Yugoslavia does not have any territorial claims on any of its neighbours, but it is ready to respond to aggression of any kind." He confirmed that some of the neighbour states were launching provocations along the Yugoslav borders, counting on external support. This, as he said, was nothing new, because they used to do the same whenever they thought Yugoslavia was weakened by internal troubles and by pressures exerted by the big powers. Asked about the danger of Yugoslavia's being involved in war, with reference to NATO violations of Yugoslavia's airspace, Bulatovic said that ``no one in his right mind has any interest in involving Yugoslavia into a war, as this would widespread the war conflagration in the Balkans, and it is the big question whether (the war) would be limited to this area alone. "Every impartial observer may realize that Serbia and Montenegro, that is, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, had not started the war on the soil of the former Yugoslavia, and that they have no intention of including themselves in it. On the contrary, they are doing their utmost for paths to be found for the establishment of just and lasting peace in these areas," said Bulatovic.
