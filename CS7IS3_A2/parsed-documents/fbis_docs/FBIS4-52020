FBIS4-52020 "dreas088__a94002" FBIS-EAS-94-088-A Daily Report 6 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Analysts Assess Uruguay Round Agreement Analysts Assess Uruguay Round Agreement OW0505144494 Tokyo GAIKO FORUM in Japanese Apr 94 pp 18-31--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0505144494 Tokyo GAIKO FORUM Japanese BFN [Discussion by Hirohiko Okumura, research director at Nomura General Institute; Kazuo Ogura, former director general of the Economic Affairs Bureau, Foreign Ministry; and Yasuhiko Nakamura, NHK commentator, on 7 March 1994; place not given] [Text] It Is Like Both Sides of the Moon [GAIKO FORUM] I would like you to look back over how the Uruguay Round of negotiations' conclusion came about and discuss the significance of the negotiations' conclusion. [Ogura] I think there are three pillars to the Uruguay Round. The first is the necessity for some improvement in the world trade system, or systems and rules that have been practiced for 30 or years following the end of World War II. Dumping is a typical example. The second is an inquiry made into a field where there have been no rules, or into a field where the making of rules has been too difficult to accomplish despite the desirability of having rules. One is, of course, the problem of agriculture and the other is the problem of voluntary restraints on exports centering on textiles. It is not that there have been no rules governing agricultural trade, but the rules themselves have been ambiguous and agricultural subsidies have been approved by GATT. There have been no great restrictions and rules governing voluntary restraints on exports have not been very explicit. Calling that a loophole is a little too strong, but those problems have been difficult to handle. The third, intellectual property rights, is a great achievement of the Uruguay Round. It is a new field that has barely been covered by the GATT system or other world trade rules. Of course, there have been various rules governing intellectual property rights or patent rights themselves, but these rules have not necessarily been explicit in their connection with trade. The question is how to make rules to govern such a new field. Some said there was discussion about the idea of the GATT system developing a fourth great pillar in addition to those mentioned above; I think there is no mistake about it. For example, a new world trade agency, the World Trade Organization [WTO], is going to be established. Despite all that, what generally has not been understood has been international rulemaking. Rulemaking means an improvement of existing rules in a particular field; or making rules in a field where there have not been many rules; or making rules in a field where people have wanted to make rules, but have been unable to do so; or making new rules in an entirely new field. Of course, since the Uruguay Round dealt with negotiations, there are other problems in addition to rulemaking. Therefore, the Uruguay Round is like the front and back of the moon; seen from the front, it was rulemaking; seen from the back, it was an adjustment of economic interests because there were economic and political interests and motives among three groups--the United States and the European Community, Japan, and the least developed countries. Speaking from a political standpoint, originally there may have been a motive for the unity of the West, or a motive for opposition to regionalism. And there may have been a motive for drawing the least developed countries into the world trade system. It is inevitable for the persons who participated in the negotiations to think that their primary concern was rulemaking. If the negotiations are viewed from a distance as political scientists and economists do, it will be interesting to know what the interests and motives were, to what kind of negotiations these interests and motives led and under what circumstances; and it will be necessary to analyze these matters. [Okumura] These problems of trade and other international transactions have something to do with the necessity of implementing a change in the industrial structure, the method of conducting business, and business strategy on the basis of the principle of relative superiority in principle. Since this is a kind of change of systems, there will be a fight between a small number of people who have gained great profits under the past system and a large number of people who will gain a little profit under a new system. Any change in systems involves tremendous effort, and it is only natural that it took a long time to implement the current change. A system which can be changed in an instant is not a great system. As you have pointed out, this time we have had a great change in systems and rules in three fields. What made this possible is the fact that the process of the world economy's unification has been behind the international trade transactions, which bred political dynamics for a change in systems within each country. That, in turn, made it easier to persuade a small number of people who profited under the past system. Various negotiations were conducted under the Uruguay Round from 1986 to 1993. Looking back over what happened to the world economy, we find that direct investment made rapid progress on a historical scale. The second is the movement of capital, the amount of which increased to an unprecedented degree. The third is the fact that the exchange rate was forced to undergo a very great adjustment in connection with the movement of capital. The fourth is international policy cooperation, whose evaluation may differ, depending upon one's position. However, despite various problems, the effort to continue policy cooperation has been carried on to this day, which shows the true worth of policy cooperation. I would like to think that the Uruguay Round has come to a successful conclusion under such circumstances. An adjustment has been made so established domestic rules can be changed into international rules. Japan has adopted rules that are thought to be the best for its country, but these were not found to be necessarily good rules for foreigners in the midst of the process of internationalization. That has resulted in an absolutely necessary adjustment. [Nakamura] What Mr. Ogura has said about rulemaking is right. What did Japan gain most from the conclusion of the rulemaking? The protection of the free trade system. Japan said that to protect the free trade system, it must make a decision on rice which belongs to the agricultural field. There is no mistake about the fact that the protection of the free trade system is the most important thing in a long-range view. However, the protection of the free trade system is an abstract idea, and, even though other regions or other countries have clearly profited from that protection, it is not so easy for Japan to understand it. If one says that it is not so easy to understand it because it involves rule making, that would be the end of it. The conclusion of the negotiations may bring about some results. For example, the United States may profit in the field of intellectual property rights. IBM, for one, may gain a certain amount of profit in software trade. As for France, it was originally supposed that France would be asked to reduce the export subsidy for agricultural products by as much as 24 percent. However, it turned out that they got off with a 21-percent reduction. And it was decided that the United States should impose tariffs on certain waiver items. For those concerned countries that are capable of exporting these items, it may become possible for them to export these items to a certain degree by overcoming the barrier of tariffication. However, Japan knows that it could contribute to the protection of the free trade system, but it does not know the rest very well. That may be due to the lack of explanation by the government. It is difficult for ordinary people to understand: "In truth, the result will be the same in each individual case. This is a better solution." In making a speech, I can say: "The current situation is much better than what it would have been if the negotiations had gone wrong and had broken down." However, I cannot say very much beyond that. Reference has been made to the Uruguay Round and its impact on Japan's economy. I do not think there was much joy in the industrial community, at business job sites, or in the financial market because of the conclusion of the negotiations. The Japanese economy is undergoing hard times after the collapse of the bubble, so its mid-range project can cover only three years. However, the Uruguay Round will not bear fruit quickly, but will do so only gradually, taking five to 10 years. In that sense, the Uruguay Round is not something eye-opening to Japan. Although we do not currently applaud the Uruguay Round with hand clapping, when we enter the latter half of 1990's after the adjustment of the bubble's collapse, the Uruguay Round will contribute to the enlargement of the world economy and world trade, and the Japanese economy will be making satisfactory development under the Uruguay Round. Such an understanding will probably be accepted later, but currently it is not much in vogue here in Japan. [Nakamura] Concerning the agricultural field, which faced rough going at the last stage of the negotiations, Japan is conscious of the fact that it made a considerable concession in opening its market to foreign rice--even if the opening of the market is only partial. Foreign countries, on the other hand, may feel that they have bestowed a considerable favor on Japan on the grounds that they have provided such a special measure only for Japan and South Korea. There is a great imbalance of perception between Japan and other countries in that respect. [Ogura] There may have been such an aspect to some extent. However, there are several reasons, one of which is that Japan has a current accounts surplus. Practically speaking, it is politically very difficult for Japan to say that unless it gains such and such a thing, it will not participate in the negotiations. Meanwhile, the United States and Europe want to take such and such a thing, and they have to say with great emphasis that they must take such and such a thing to persuade their own countries. Actually the EC as a whole is running a deficit with Japan, and it has recently had a trade deficit with the United States. There is also a problem with newly industrialized countries. Japan had wanted to say, "What will Japan gain from the success of the Uruguay Round?," but if Japan had brought that matter up for negotiation, it would have been improper. However, I think that Japan should have made its share in the agricultural field clear, instead of saying: "The partial opening of the rice market was all right because profits can be made in the field of industrial products." "The free trade system has been preserved." We should have had more discussion in our country. However, if we had pursued this line of thinking, we would have been obliged to adopt "a struggle on certain conditions." However, in the case of the rice problem, Japan could not politically engage in such a struggle from the beginning. The general public was of the opinion that Japan would be absolutely opposed to the partial opening to the end; or that was a political reality. But as Mr. Nakamura has said, if we take such and such a thing because it brings us such and such a profit--in short, taking something corresponds to giving something--that constitutes a struggle on certain conditions. I wonder if Japan could engaged in such a struggle in the field of agriculture. I have a feeling that Japan should have begun the negotiations a little earlier. Since Japan imports a large quantity of agricultural products such as food, it had bargaining power. We should have made good use of it. However, great restrictions would probably have been imposed if Japan had tried to exercised such bargaining power in the Uruguay Round negotiations. [Nakamura] For one thing, Japan was superficially optimistic about agriculture when the Uruguay Round began in 1986. Despite the fact that for some reason or other, Japan did not at first clearly declare its intentions that "Japan's stance on the agricultural field is like this," it suddenly began to say "this is the maximum permissible limit for Japan as far as agriculture is concerned." Since Japan did not mention this when the negotiations began, I do not think that it could explain its position internationally. Moreover, a Diet resolution took place during the negotiations. It is impossible to have a resolution without a dissenting voice on this kind of problem, and such a resolution does not restrain the decision of the government. Despite that, too much emphasis was placed on the resolution even at the end of the negotiations. It was very unfortunate that behind-the-scenes negotiations had to be conducted on the basis of that resolution. Therefore, Japan should have engaged in a struggle upon certain conditions on the way however complicated the matter became within Japan. In return for that, Japan should have accurately explained its position that "this is the maximum permissible limit for Japan," and then it should have conducted discussions with the process of diplomatic negotiations open to some extent. The tariffication of rice is to be postponed for six years, but I wonder what the result will be. The amount of minimum access six years after the postponement is 800,000 tons, which is a considerable amount. Such a consideration makes one think that tariffication from the beginning would have been better. Then the minimum access of 5 percent will suffice six years after the postponement. The tariff rate six years after the postponement will become quite high. Even if we had set the tariff rate high at the time of the negotiations' final conclusion, that would have been internationally acceptable. The negotiations' conclusion that makes one think that tariffication from the beginning would have better is unfortunate. Japan's Negotiations Began With Food Security [Ogura] As a line of thinking, Mr. Nakamura has said that we could have engaged in a struggle upon certain conditions. After all, GATT is ultimately negotiations in the interest of exporting countries. Of course, importing countries have various interests, and they have the right to speak in rulemaking concerning the problem of dumping, for example. However, the negotiations card is held overwhelmingly by exporting countries. Under the GATT system, primary negotiating power is traditionally given to the main supplying countries. Negotiations are realized when there are exports between countries, so negotiations are out of the question when agricultural products are not exported. It is worthwhile to listen to the opinion that we should have engaged in a struggle upon certain conditions earlier. One of the problems with that opinion is whether it was really advantageous for Japan to engage in a struggle upon certain conditions, leaving Japan's agriculture situation of importing agricultural products as it was. As an extreme case, Japan should think of further enhancing the added value of agricultural products economically and rationally to export them, although I do not mean to say that the government should provide export subsidies; otherwise, under the existing circumstances, Japan will not be able to enter into international negotiations concerning agriculture. Another thing is what Japan said when it first raised the problem of rice: it was not the environment, but food security, which is not only an economic theory, but social psychology and a kind of political theory. In short, a certain degree of supply and demand and the maintenance of the food control system are already included in food security as a tacit premise. Since Japan entered into the negotiations on the basis of a food security theory, it could not assume a quite different negotiating attitude later. It is possible to discuss what was most advantageous to Japan from a purely economic viewpoint when calculations were made--minimum access of 5 percent or minimum access of 8 percent, for example. However, it is a little doubtful whether such a discussion was meaningful in actual negotiations. Therefore, opinions may differ as to what kind of negotiation was possible for Japan. However, since Japan entered into the negotiations on the basis of a food security theory, it had to bid at that point, so to speak. If Japan had entered into the negotiations on a basis other than a food security theory, it could have argued for comprehensive tariffication instead of the choice it had made. However, since Japan started from the position--"Food security is everything. Japan will preserve the food control system," it set a limit on its solution of the matter, although that limit was not clear. [Nakamura] Preservation of the food control system is only a temporary measure; tariffication of rice will be inevitable in six years. Japan should discontinue what it has undertaken. If the present situation continues for six years, there will be tariffication. Since there will be no minimum access then, there is no knowing if the current food control system can be preserved. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries will say that the food control system can be maintained since national trade is recognized. However, I do not think that rice producers will gain vigor under the present circumstances. Such a situation is not very conducive to Japan's agriculture as a whole. Japan is already a country established on the basis of trade and is also an advanced industrialized nation. The question is what to do with agriculture in such a situation. Furthermore, Japan still holds inefficient sectors and cannot neglect them since its political power is still very strong on the surface. Nevertheless, Japan must grow on the basis of behavior befitting an advanced industrialized nation, while it is obliged to say "agriculture is very important." I am very sorry that the negotiations were conducted under such a situation. [Okumura] Japan's agriculture is now very weak in international competitiveness. There are various reasons for its weakness. For example, the exchange rate has undergone a successive change -- 360 yen, 240 yen, and 120 yen; Japan's agricultural production costs suddenly become high in terms of labor costs and the current exchange rate. This does not necessarily mean that Japanese farmers are lazy. We must spend time and use a careful strategy to improve agriculture. I know that it would have been better if we had entered into the negotiations with an agricultural policy on our part, but now it is useless to say so. We must improve the competitiveness of Japan's agriculture by means of a careful strategy for some years to come. It is very difficult to decide whether we should improve competitiveness while rice is being partially liberalized or while a high tariff with a high rate of transparency is being imposed on rice. [Ogura] One method is to improve competitiveness while the measure of minimum access is being taken as it is now. Therefore, I do not necessarily think it a good choice to continue a price competition for some years to come. An important prior condition, however, is to implement a policy to improve competitiveness during that period. [Nakamura] The most important thing to do is to thoroughly discuss again what the Uruguay Round's conclusion was all about as far as agricultural policy is concerned. The past agricultural policy as a whole is now being questioned. [Okumura] If some agricultural sectors are liberalized through deregulation, the prices of raw materials will be reduced by one-fourth for consumers and producers, and high value-added products with international competitiveness will be made. The presence of regulations, however, makes the prices of raw materials unusually high, which makes it impossible to make high value-added products. Such agricultural sectors exist, therefore, the government should turn to deregulation so that those sectors can have an international competitive edge, instead of maintaining regulations for protection. [Nakamura] The food industry is dissatisfied with the recent conclusion. The tariffication of butter and powdered skim milk, for example, has not made them very cheap. The price of sugar is the same as it has been. Candy makers say: "Raw materials are very expensive and we cannot compete with European products at such prices." We should at least say to such people, "Please be patient for six or 10 years, because the competitiveness of agriculture has been weak." "We will do our best after that." Unless we do that, consumer prices will be influenced. In truth, the recent conclusion ignored consumers in the agricultural field. It is necessary for the agricultural people to acknowledged "that fact" and act accordingly. However, instead of procrastinating, we should have made more requests to Europe and the United States, saying: "We will accept tariffication, in return for which, you too...," by playing our strongest card, tariffication. For the past few years, the opinion has been held that food security could be accomplished so long as the opening of rice markets was prevented. For the future, however, we should ask ourselves what food security really means and think of food security as a whole without confining our concern to rice only. [Ogura] Both the United States and Europe had their own agricultural policies. The framework of the Common Agricultural Policy, a famous European agriculture reform policy, had already been made. The task of Europe was how to tide over the Uruguay Round negotiations within the framework of that policy. The United States had a new agricultural policy based on the Agricultural Law of 1985, which led to the security of incomes. The United States wanted world trade rules to go along with its agricultural policy. However, did Japan really have an agricultural policy prior to the negotiations? Is it not true that, because of the Uruguay Round, Japan delayed working out an agricultural policy or an agricultural policy vision? If there had been a new agricultural policy vision 10 years before and the Uruguay Round negotiations had been conducted accordingly, the situation would have been different. [Nakamura] That is right. Japan could have said like Europe, "That is our framework." This time Japan could not say, "This is our limit." Momentum Was Given by the Tokyo Summit [Nakamura] What led the Uruguay Round negotiations, which had had difficult sailing, to a successful conclusion at the end of last year? I have a feeling that the conclusion came suddenly. [Ogura] Well, in a word, what moved international politics ultimately is time, that is, a time limit. In short, the successful conclusion was due to the schedule that stipulated that a conclusion must be reached by 15 December. Of course, there were schedules prior to that, but then it was possible to change the schedules politically. The reason was the demand of the U.S. Congress for a fast-track decision on the measure. Europe was still in the process of its 1992 integration. Of course, all had a deadline in a way, but it was a goal, not a deadline in the true sense of the word which meant a catastrophe if it was not observed. This time the negotiators of the Uruguay Round drove themselves into a corner--to the brink of success or failure. Another reason is that times were bad. Clearly, grave concern was aroused during the Tokyo summit in September: "It is not right if we cannot even bring the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion in the face of such a recession." I have a feeling that such a mood had been growing steadily since last spring. [Nakamura] The change in GATT directors general, from Dunkel to Sutherland, produced a certain amount of flexibility. An atmosphere was born in the secretariat which allowed it to decide to drop tasks that could not be accomplished despite a series of efforts--audiovisuals and U.S. marine transportation business, for example. [Ogura] That is right. In looking back, we find that the Tokyo summit played an important role. At that time, I was a little doubtful about the effects on the Uruguay Round caused by the summit. Of course, the summit had an effect on the Uruguay Round, but, when the summit was over, I did not know whether such an effect could bring the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion. In truth, the commitment of the world's prime ministers and presidents to the Uruguay Round was a very decisive element. [GAIKO FORUM] I have the impression that the problems between Japan and the United States became complicated as soon as the Uruguay Round negotiations were concluded and establishment of the WTO was decided. [Ogura] A very serious problem in the future will be cross-retaliation: When one country feels dissatisfied with the other in the trade of goods, it takes countermeasures against that country in the services sector; when one country has a complaint about the other in financial matters, it imposes restraints on the trade of goods. If a dispute arises about licenses such as intellectual property rights, the problem is how the dispute is settled when the WTO will be entwined with the unified procedures for settling disputes, procedures which have just been stipulated. The GATT has concerned itself primarily with goods. Now, however, intellectual property rights or services such as finance and maritime transportation have become important. For this reason, the method of settling disputes itself will become a very important problem internationally. At the same time, the problem of exchange rates will become important. The average U.S. and Japanese tariff rate on industrial goods now stands at 3 to 5 percent. Thus, even if the 3-percent tariff rate is decreased by 30 percent, the average tariff rate--of 3 percent--will then fall to no more than about 2 percent. What is the movement of exchange rates compared to that? The movement of tariff rates does not bear comparison to that of exchange rates. Ours is a world in which a fluctuation of 1 yen or 2 yen is a daily occurrence. At the time of the Tokyo summit, everyone asked me, "What is the value of a reduction of only 1 percent despite years of serious negotiations?" Since the time of the Tokyo summit, it has been decided that it is better to make business easier through harmonization, such as the elimination of nontariff barriers and business uncertainty, than to engage in talks to reduce tariff rates by such and such a percentage. Thus, a sector where the results cannot be expressed in terms of figures has been broadened and this time has come to include services and intellectual property rights. In this way, the problems of the substance of trade negotiations have undergone a great change with the change of the world economy. To me, the big question is what type of form the next negotiations will take. [Okumura] Negotiations on services have not been conducted under GATT. That has become possible starting with the recent negotiations. This means that a country which is strong in the service sector in terms of comparative advantage has gained an advantage over others. It will become possible for a country which is not strong in the production of goods, in terms of comparative advantage, to tide over difficulties, even if it encounters difficulties in the goods sector, as long as the liberalization of the services sector is further promoted. Because each country has its own strong and weak sectors according to its industrial structure, it has become impossible to conduct multilateral negotiations only in the goods sector without including collateral services. In that sense, the recent conclusion of the negotiations was inevitable. Now, the next question is what kind of benefit will the recent conclusion confer on the world economy. According to the calculations of the GATT Secretariat and the OECD, the volume of trade will be increased by 10 percent 10 years from now. However, when the development of the economy for the next 10 years is considered, policy adjustments and the stability of exchange rates will have a much greater impact. In short, it is impossible to say that the recent conclusion of the negotiations has paved the way for stable development of the world economy. With the growth of services progressing at a such rate among industrialized nations, exchange rates and policy adjustments will become more important than ever. [Nakamura] The OECD's forecast is based on the premise of the smooth liberalization of the existing 15 sectors. Therefore, the liberalization of audiovisual products, maritime transportation, and banking were not touched on. The liberalization of agricultural products will progress much further than it has, but we cannot expect too much; its effect will not be so great. [Ogura] Although there are many things that cannot be quantified, the recent conclusion will contribute very little to the development of the world economy in terms of quantity. Why, then, is such a thing necessary? It is because the present international trade order is being barely maintained through negotiations after doing something--at least something accomplished through forward movement. If such negotiations fail, or if we do nothing, protectionism, regionalism, or selfish unilateralism will prevail. Such a phenomenon will occur everywhere and will create confusion. In a sense, the Uruguay Round is like a safety valve. [Okumura] What would have happened if the recent negotiations had failed or if they had not been on the Uruguay Round negotiations themselves? We can find the answer by looking at the reactions of the markets after the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. negotiations. Because of uncertainty about the future, the exchange rate rose to 102 yen to the dollar, and the stock market index decreased by about 1,000 yen to 18,900 yen immediately after the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework talks. After a few days, however, the yen returned to nearly 106 yen as of today, and the Nikkei-Dow Jones average returned to the 20,000 level. As is evident from the above figures, the markets became calm because of the calculation that even if the United States threatens Japan with its trade act, either it will not be able to carry out the threat or after a time it will adopt a policy to urge Japan to make a drastic policy change, no matter how serious such a threat may be now, because the United States sooner or later has to adopt a policy which conforms to the results of the Uruguay Round talks. If the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework talks had occurred in the absence of the GATT system or the Uruguay Round negotiations, there would have been great turmoil in the foreign exchange markets and stock markets. Because the GATT system and the Uruguay Round negotiations had a tremendous effect in calming the situation, their potential supportive power is great. [Nakamura] In this way, it has become possible to bring a case such as the Super 301 to the WTO. A system that is understandable internationally to some extent has come into being. Nobody will think it unpardonable for Japan to appeal to the WTO. At least, a system has been established under which the general thinking is "The U.S. behavior is rather funny." [Okumura] Will the WTO be strengthened in terms of its staff and authority compared to the present establishment? [Ogura] Radically speaking, GATT has not been recognized as an international agency so far. In differing from the IMF, GATT has a secretariat but has never been a big international agency. That may have prompted GATT to recognize the fact that it has not been recognized formally, to improve its organization as an international agency, to establish a supervisory organization, to increase its staff, and to establish more committees. [Nakamura] However, the United States really does not like the idea. [Ogura] That is a difficult question. As you have said, the WTO has a negative aspect. At the same time, what the United States wants the most now is in the fields of services and intellectual property rights. Therefore, the United States will prefer the WTO with new improvements to a GATT which remains unchanged. [Nakamura] Ultimately, the chances are: "The WTO will do. We will ratify it through a fast-track process." [Ogura] That has a lot to do with the fact that the WTO covers new sectors. It is developing countries that offered the strongest resistance to the WTO covering new fields. That is because things which are left largely unattended to, such as intellectual property rights and medical supplies, will be placed under the control of the WTO. It is very likely that these countries will venture into the services sector in areas such as banking. Another great problem remaining to be solved is the movement of unskilled laborers. The Need for Adjustment of Macroproblems and Microproblems [Nakamura] What about the problem of developing countries? [Ogura] Opinions differ on this matter. One important problem which the recent Uruguay Round did not discuss was "the theory of graduation," which was a kind of taboo. However, this problem cannot be a taboo after five years. This problem will have to be handled in the same manner as other problems. After five or seven years, some of the developing countries will surpass the so-called industrialized nations in terms of income, will they not? [Nakamura] Aside from countries which have graduated or are graduating, what did the recent negotiations mean to countries which have not yet graduated? Tariffs on fibers, for example, were not lowered very much, although tariffs on tropical products were lowered a little. On the other hand, however, developing countries had to accept the conditions laid down by industrialized nations concerning intellectual property rights and services. If the labor markets had been opened a little more, developing nations would have gained an advantage. I do not think that developing countries gained very much. [Ogura] In short, developing countries have been divided into about three groups. Even aid is not provided for cumulative debt-plagued countries; the debts to be paid are growing larger. It is such a vicious circle. To the second group of countries, aid is more important than trade. Vietnam, for example, is receiving aid from various countries, but it is still not yet mature in terms of trade. It is about time for South Korea and Taiwan to live on trade. These countries, which belong to the third group, will gain much from the Uruguay Round. The second group of countries, which gets along on aid, will have a very hard time, although the Uruguay Round is trying to gradually reduce the barriers to their export of fibers, for example, which has already become a sensitive issue. To countries with a heap of debts, the question is surely how much demand there is for their tropical products. Japan is in a position to import a considerable amount of primary products, and it gives special consideration to buying the products of the least developed countries, although the amount of its orders is not necessarily great. The reason is that Japan could afford this and that it has an appropriate stand on placing orders. In the negotiations held on 15 December in Geneva, the developing countries said, "Japan has done very well." However, when we looked at the contents of the trade products involved, we felt ashamed because we had not paid careful attention to the so-called tropical products as well. [Nakamura] Is Japan in favor of Taiwan, China, Russia, and others joining GATT? [Ogura] The situation will become very unstable if China, which has a population of 1 billion, and a giant like Russia remain outside of the GATT system. When viewed in perspective, it will be better if they follow the international rules. However, there is an opinion that conditions for competition should be equalized through the unification of different conditions now existing in each country because of the intensification of mutual dependence in the world economy. For example, an opinion prevails that environmental regulation, product liability laws, and labor standards law are different; it is unfair to compete under such a situation; therefore, these laws and regulations should be unified to some extent. It is all right if the situation stays at this level. However, if one says, "The method of the application of the antimonopoly law is different, so make it identical," the other retorts, "What about the social conditions?" In short, it is like unification in Europe. An opinion prevails that conditions must be the same to effect a smooth unification. In addition, discussions are under way about the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA]. Some hold a view which is close to social dumping [business seeking to sell goods in foreign markets at low prices by unfairly lowering their production costs through low wages and poor labor conditions]. What we think of social dumping is very important. In a certain sense, the Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative talks were held on the basis of this idea. However, if we talk to developing countries, such as the least developed countries, about social dumping, they react very strongly. Speaking of the post-Uruguay Round era, people concerned with trade mention the following: environmental, labor, and competition policy; in other words, the problem of the environment and trade, the labor standards law, and competition policy. They say that if competition policies differ greatly, the behavior of enterprises will become different. In my opinion, such an idea is somewhat problematic. I believe that Japan should think about the problem of regionalism, which is an issue of longstanding, and the theory of graduation. [Nakamura] I understand that the problems of the environment and labor will come up in the post-Uruguay Round era. The point is that if the Uruguay Round in its present form has a role to play internationally, what is its relationship with the regionalism of today? In short, there is NAFTA for the United States and the European Union for Europe, and their member nations will increase. There is nothing but GATT for Japan. That makes the recent conclusion all the more meaningful. Therefore, Japan should rectify the closed nature of international trade, although that may be difficult in reality. Of course, because Japan itself has a lot to reflect on, it should do what it ought to do. Also, it will be splendid if Japan becomes a leader in creating a new order or rules for international trade. [Okumura] If the WTO is really recognized as a third international agency, it will exist alongside the IMF and the World Bank. And things will not function well unless these three agencies coordinate their work. Following the recent Japan-U.S. negotiations, a high-ranking U.S. official seems to have led the negotiations to the advantage of the United States through the instrument of the exchange rate. How do you assess this? I think what the United States did was absolutely wrong. If such a thing is permitted, it may lead to a situation similar to that of the Great Depression in the 1930's. [Ogura] The trouble is that the group that discusses macroeconomics internationally through policy coordination is different from the group that discusses trade. [Okumura] Of the international agencies, if the trade sector of the WTO and the policy coordination sector of the IMF do not cooperate closely, the situation will become all the more difficult. [Ogura] It is important for those two international agencies, or for the people working in them, to discuss things together. For example, the two agencies can make use of the process of discussions within summit meetings. With the establishment of the WTO, if the two agencies act without close cooperation, a serious problem will arise. [Okumura] Now, let us suppose that the exchange rate overshoots itself. Let us, for example, suppose that the yen rises to 100 yen to the dollar through speculative transactions of the yen in Japan because of the utterances of a U.S. Government bureaucrat or official. It is essentially impossible to maintain the rate of 100 yen to the dollar unless there is a change in macropolicy. However, when capital transactions are conducted on a colossal scale all over the world as they are today, and when there are many uncertain elements concerning the future, those who engage in foreign exchange speculation by utilizing the comments of statesmen will win the game for a certain period. Then the psychology of enterprises will be shaken. Now, when, for example, Japan changes its strategy and decides to manufacture goods in China instead of in Japan, this poses the large question of whether that choice is good for the Japanese. There is a great difference between plants that are trying hard to streamline themselves and cut production costs, and international transactions that could wipe out the profits of companies overnight in the wake of severe exchange rate fluctuations. Therefore, I can fully understand plant officials' cries to the effect that they cannot conduct regular economic activity unless exchange rates are stable. Unless global trade arrangements like the Uruguay Round, world trade, and the WTO are connected with exchange-rate stability, they are really meaningless to the welfare of the Japanese people. I believe that moves toward direct investment are also meaningless to the welfare of the Japanese if the exchange rate remains unstable. Another problem is a relationship between macroproblems and microproblems. Let us suppose that the United States is in a hysterical situation because of it being a colossal debtor nation, when it has failed to take the most proper policy in the matter of macropolicy. Then the United States tends to engage in a sector-by-sector approach, which is quite understandable emotionally. On the other hand, the creditor nation which pushes the United States around is thinking in a coolheaded manner and tends to say nothing but that "the other party is in a hysterical mood." The country which is being pushed around has no alternative but to take a sector-by-sector approach. This is exactly what has happened now between Japan and the United States. It is the logic of a coolheaded person to say, "It is impertinent for the other party to talk about numerical targets" and "It is against GATT's rules." People who are in an abnormal state in the matter of macroproblems will not listen to such a claim. Then, because macroproblems and microproblems begin to influence each other, discussion that coordinates the two will be necessary. You have engaged in international negotiations. What do you think of this? [Ogura] That is the most difficult thing to do, because we have no place to hold such discussions except in the preparatory stage of a summit meeting. The IMF has recently begun to discuss the problem of trade. However, unless the IMF, the OECD, and GATT have a joint meeting in a multilateral place, they will reach the limits of their resources under the current practice. There is another problem between the two countries. For example, macroproblems and microproblems are clearly separated in the case of Japan and the United States, a case which is very problematic. It is a little unusual now for the two countries to treat macroproblems bilaterally. We should include Europe to make negotiations really multilateral. How to coordinate bilateral and multilateral negotiations may be the greatest problem of the post-Uruguay Round period. [GAIKO FORUM] Thank you very much.
