For 18 months the zone has been under the control of the Joint Peacemaking Forces: On the one side those of Moldova and Russia, on the opposite side those of Russia and the Dniester region. The left-bank security zone, once the scene of combat operations, is a zone of alienation. A "quiet" war for influence over the villages along the river is being waged there between Chisinau and Tiraspol. Some villages have -- by decision of their local assemblies -- placed themselves under the Dniester region's protectorate, while some have raised the state flag of Moldova. The quietness in the neutral zone could be shattered: Unresolved political problems are building up unhealthy tension. According to local inhabitants, today's situation is reminiscent of March 1992 -- the start of the armed conflict in the eastern regions of Moldova. Between Dubossary and Kochiery, whose streets run into each other, there is a traffic control barrier. In front of the barrier, where Russian soldiers warm themselves by a simple fire, is the Dniester region; beyond lies the territory of Moldova. Here plutoniers (the rank in the Moldovan police corresponding to sergeant) stamp their feet on the frost -- an unusual occurrence in the south. While not established by any laws or envisaged by the United Nations, the border is nevertheless marked out. Vehicles are searched "for weapons" at the barrier. For the inhabitants, particularly the children who hurry from Dubossary to the Moldavian school in Kochiery and, the other way around, from Kochiery to Dubossary, the barrier is opened. The ban applies only to police, who are not allowed to show themselves in the city in uniform. But, according to the guard post sergeants, it is dangerous to travel to Dubossary even without their uniforms -- if they are recognized, they are beaten up. The Moldovan guard post appeared alongside the peacemaking post recently, after the declaration of the special situation in the Dniester region and in response to the militia guard post. Both sides fear acts of provocation during the Moldovan parliamentary elections, which will be held in Kochiery but forbidden in Dubossary. However, conflict could break out for reasons that have nothing do with politics. By decision of the Dniester region authorities 800 hectares of land in the use of Kochiery's Viktoriya sovkhoz is being expropriated. Ths land struggle in Dubossarskiy Rayon, which is described by the Chisinau press as nothing less than provocation, is not the only ground for settling accounts between the right and left banks. Not far from Dubossary stands the only bridge across the Dniester left intact after the fighting. On the right bank is a Moldovan guard post, on the left bank a Dniester region guard post. On the bridge itself is a joint guard post with Russian peacemaking troops. Recently Russian soldiers have refused to do duty detail on the bridge: The bridge is in a defective state. Because of a widening lateral crack the joint monitoring commision has banned heavy trucks from crossing the bridge. Only cars and scheduled buses are permitted, and only then on condition that the passengers get out. Traffic nevertheless remains heavy. While the Moldovan and Dniester region sides are working out who is to repair the bridge and thus control the traffic, trucks carrying food use it, Moldovan peacemaking troops drive tracked vehicles across it, and Turkish wagons slip across on the quiet -- for the now customary bribe in dollars, rubles, or leis. Only "suvorovki," the Dniester region rubles overstamped with a picture of Suvorov, are not in use here. "Who wants them?" They make a charge for the crossing on both the left and the right bank. They also tell you amicably that the bridge could collapse. The village of Dorotskoye, like the famous Malinovka from the well-known operetta, found itself caught between crossfire from "left" and "right" during the armed conflict. It has remained under dual control. There are two administrations in the village -- the rural soviet and the Moldovan primarie [city hall] -- and two detachments -- the police and the militia. A battalion of Russian peacemaking forces is quartered here. The emergency situation prevailing in the security zone is indicated not so much by the largest number of armed men per square kilometer in the CIS as by the frightened and anxious looks on the local peasants' faces. They have been afraid to talk to journalists. Just imagine having "Whites to the left of you and Reds to the right." Albeit that the Dniester region guards are perhaps the less welcome in the Moldovan village. The Russian peacemakers are also "foreigners" here. A week ago a drunken picket at the guard post on the bridge demanded that Russian soldiers remove reinforced concrete blocks obstructing traffic and remove themselves at the same time. According to reports from the ordinary soldiers, they often receive threats of reprisals. The Moldovan peasants' attitude to the Russian soldiers is clear-cut -- they are occupiers. Reminders that you are on foreign soil are also heard from the Dniester region side. You will hear all manner of things from the Cossacks and border troops whose guard posts are to be found, according to the battalion commander, on virtually every corner. According to official figures the Joint Peacekmaking Forces lost around 20 men last year. This was for a variety of reasons, including mishandling of weapons and "drink-related" accidents. Just before the new year the battalion in Dorotskoye lost one of its men. The leadership of the local Moldovan kolkhoz could not find boards to make a coffin for the "occupier."
