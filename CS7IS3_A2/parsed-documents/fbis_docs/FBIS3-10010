"The government's answers are still a bunch of papers, and whether it will abide by them remains to be seen. Peace is far away; there are only promises. We still have to see what the communities have to say," said Marcos. According to Marcos, the EZLN is not ready to sign peace. He stated that until now the EZLN talks with Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, have been limited to a dialogue in which "he has responded to our 34 demands, but none of them have been negotiated." He said the 19 EZLN delegates, who participated in the talks, "have not said if we agree with the commissioner's 34 proposals; our leaders and grassroots communities must say it." Subcommander Marcos said the Zapatists do not understand the government's answers "because they clash with our languages and culture. It is impossible to go past the negotiation phase because we still do not understand; we have to translate their answers into our perception of the world." He stated the San Cristobal de las Casas talks are close to an agreement, which will later be discussed at the grassroots level, and that the first round "will conclude with a document of consultation," and after that peace will come. He recognized Camacho Solis' sincerity in the talks but wondered to what extent his stance represents the government's. "Camacho Solis is telling us what is possible and what is not; in some ways he is another mediator." He said there is no agreement on democracy, one of the chief demands of the Zapatists, at the talks because the government has refused to discuss national topics. "The government has refused to discuss democracy, refused to discuss amending Article 27, democracy, or of recognizing the EZLN as a belligerent force, electoral reform, justice, changes in the economic policy, and reforming the Free Trade Agreement," he indicated. The top leader of the EZLN reiterated that if President Carlos Salinas de Gortari does not resign, then there ought to be "an electoral change so it is the civilian sector of society that controls" the 21 August elections. The EZLN has not thought of surrendering its weapons because "a lot of history remains to be covered. Surrendering of our weapons is far away, perhaps 500 years away," Marcos stated. For him, remaining armed constitutes a guarantee the government promises will be kept. He said the Catholic Church has always opposed Indians taking up arms, even in its role in Chiapas, it has favored" a "collective sentiment of community in the Christian sense."
