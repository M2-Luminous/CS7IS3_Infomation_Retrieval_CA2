[Segal] Good afternoon. [Landau] What was the reaction in Jerusalem? [Segal] Officials in Jerusalem say that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] attack in Lebanon did not constitute a violation of the understandings reached after Operation Accountability since no civilian were hurt and the only casualties were among Hizballah fighters. [Landau] Although the attack was north of the security zone. [Segal] Yes, but officials in Jerusalem said this constituted no violation. Nevertheless, we have learned that although not all the cabinet ministers supported this morning's raid, Hizballah's counterfire with Katyusha rockets at Israeli territory is unanimously regarded as a violation of the agreement. This is not new. Hizballah has already violated the agreement two or three times. Several political sources nevertheless said that the situation was still better than the one existing prior to Operation Accountability, which led to last year's military operation along Israel's northern border. [Landau] Do you know if the IDF is considering a counterattack? [Segal] Defense sources have said that the shelling proves that we are actively engaged in a war against terrorism. This results from political, strategic, military, and operational considerations and any reaction by Hizballah is carefully studied at the military and political levels before being approved. [Barqay] Mordekhay Gur earlier said that Hizballah's attack constituted a flagrant violation of the agreements. Second, the IDF's operation this morning is not viewed as a violation. Let us now move on to political developments which continue regardless of the exacerbation along Israel's northern border. You have just learned that Shim'on Peres will make a stopover in Rabat on his way back from South America. [Segal] Yes, we just pulled in that report a short while ago. Shim'on Peres is due to arrive in Rabat, the capital of Morocco, this evening. This has been confirmed by political sources in Jerusalem. Peres is scheduled to meet with King Hassan in a bid to promote the opening of a joint interest and liaison office in the Moroccan capital. This office will serve as a kind of low-level diplomatic representation. Negotiations between officials in Rabat and Jerusalem have been conducted over the past few months. As we reported on IDF Radio, a proposal that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin himself fly to Morocco was considered approximately one month ago. Foreign Minister Peres was slated to fly to Morocco afterwards but canceled his visit after the Moroccans expressed opposition. The Moroccan Government has still not given Israel a green light for the visit. Over the past week, negotiations were conducted on several levels by David Adon, the director of the Israel-Arab department at the Foreign Ministry, who has spent the past few days in Morocco. Labor Knesset Member Rafi Edri is also in the Moroccan capital in an attempt to establish initial steps toward normalization. There is no guarantee that Peres' visit will induce the Moroccan king to support such a move but Foreign Ministry officials are hopeful that some progress will be made. A Foreign Ministry delegation, led by 'Oded 'Eran, the assistant director general in charge of economics, will arrive in Rabat on Sunday [5 June] in order to prepare the multilateral talks due to begin in approximately two weeks. This delegation will also hold political talks. [Barqay] Thank you, Udi Segal.
