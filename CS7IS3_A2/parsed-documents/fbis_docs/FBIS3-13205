They said that the jury's decision to convict the four defendants on all the charges leveled at them "was based on a weak argument and conflicting testimonies that do not rise to the level of legal evidence." A source who followed the proceedings of the trial in New York told AL-HAYAH that the prosecution in the case, representing the U.S. Government, "based its argument on circumstantial evidence and a group of unlinked events" in an endeavor to convict Muhammad Salamah and Nidal 'Ayyad (Jordanians of Palestinian origin) and Mahmud Abu-Halimah and Ahmad 'Ajjaj. The source added that the prosecution "reached its conclusion about the defendants' implication by producing evidence and testimonies that do not rise to the level of irrefutable evidence."
