The decision is a setback to China's attempt to revamp its currency exchange system. The move came after Beijing decided the plan to abolish the swap markets at one stroke by April 1 was unrealistic, said sources. Under the proposal, what the central bank had dubbed a "national interbank system" was to have replaced the old-style swap centre system and begun operating on April 1. However, sources said that the lack of regulations governing the new system, banking staff's inexperience in handling foreign exchange transactions and other technical problems were the major deterrents. "Banking officials gathered in Beijing in the middle of the month to be briefed by the central bank on the operation of the new system. But the officials used the meetings to voice grievances at the haste in which the system would be introduced," said one source close to the central bank. "Nobody seems to quite know how the system will operate, not even Beijing officials who made the proposal," the source said. The delay will affect Beijing's attempts to centralise foreign exchange supply and strengthen its control over foreign exchange flow. The abolition of the swap centres, announced by Beijing on December 29 last year, as part of the official and swap centre rates unification plan, is the most important reform of China's foreign exchange system since the establishment of the swap centres in 1985. The measure to establish the banks as the basis for the country's foreign exchange system indicates China's intention to model its system on those of other market economies, in which banks deal through interbank markets and intermediating brokers. Some critics of the plan branded April 1 "the fools' day", considering that China's interbank system, which barely resembles those of other market economies, is insufficient to accommodate the changes. In theory, under the new system, companies will ask the authorised banks to buy or sell yuan. The banks in turn will instruct their dealers to execute orders in the markets. But in practice, the plan is simply to change their names from foreign exchange adjustment centres to foreign exchange markets and linking up through a computer network to form a unified system. Seats in the foreign exchange markets would only be available to banks, both foreign and Chinese. It is understood that the central bank's vice-governor Chen Yuan, will brief foreign banks' personnel in Beijing on the new foreign bank regulations as well as interbank operations in handling foreign exchange transactions. One report by Business China noted that China's 110 swap centres scattered over the country would not be closing, even if the swap markets were to be abolished as scheduled on April 1. In the trial period, only the biggest 18 swap centres would be linked and the rest would continue to function as old-fashioned swap centres. As a result, only those within the unified system will quote one exchange rate while those outside will quote different ones. Warburg Securities analyst Allan Ng said that such a practice in the transitional period was not very different from the old system and it might still lead to a black market due to the lack of a real unified rate throughout the country. Tsang Shu-ki, senior lecturer at Hong Kong Baptist College, said mainland banks were understood to be barely prepared for the new foreign exchange system, despite training courses for staff over the last two months.
