Babkin, G.K. Ivakhnyuk, and N.F. Fedorov, Saint Petersburg Technology Institute; UDC 661.183] [Abstract] A study examined ways of varying the number of functional groups on the surface of mesoporous and macroporous carbon sorbents. A method of directed hydroxylation of the surface of a uniformly mesoporous carbon sorbent that had been subjected to heat treatment in a vacuum at 2,200�C for 4 hours was tested. The carbon specimens were subjected to chlorination at temperatures between 200 and 600�C. Additional treatment of the chlorinated specimens resulted in the attachment of hydroxyl groups to the carbon surface. The said treatment was conducted at 200�C until the release of HCl ceased. The adsorbents thus produced were subjected to adsorption studies; microcalorimetry; and mass, infrared, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Both qualitative and quantitative differences between the starting specimens and the hydroxylated specimens were evident. The infrared and x-ray photoelectron spectra of the hydroxylated specimens contained bands with peaks at 1050 and 1120 cm[.sup]-1[/] that were identified as stretching vibrations of the C-OH bond. Directed hydroxylation changed the chemical properties of the surface of the carbon specimens; specifically, it changed the number of primary centers of adsorption of water vapors. The greatest number of primary centers of water vapor adsorption formed when a chlorination temperature of 450�C was used. The proportionality between the number of primary centers of water vapor adsorption and ceiling water vapor sorption that is expected during the process of water-vapor saturation as identical water clusters form on the surface of carbon sorbents did not occur during the experiments. This lack of proportionality was attributed to an uneven distribution of primary centers of water vapor adsorption along the adsorbent's surface that in turn led to partial coalescence of the water clusters and to the formation of ``islands'' of water. The decrease in the number of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the sorbents that occurred at 200 and 600�C caused the surface of the carrier to fill to a lesser extent. As a result, a proportionality between the number of primary centers of water vapor adsorption, ceiling water vapor sorption, and heat of submersion in water for the hydroxylated specimens began to be evident. This principle was recommended for use in producing produce model sorbents that may be effectively used to produce active and stable immobilized enzyme preparations. The technique of grafting amino groups to a hydroxylated carbon surface was said to be superior to that of grafting amino groups to hydrated silica because the undesirable hydrogen bonds that form in the case of the silica gel do not form when hydroxylated carbon is used as a substrate. The surface of the most hydroxylated specimen produced was determined to contain 1 hydroxyl on every 80 square angstroms, which is sufficient to accommodate at most about 20 amino groups in the case of an enzyme such as trypsin. For this reason, multiple-point binding was recommended as highly desirable for increasing the stability of immobilized preparations. Figures 4, table 1; references 7: 6 Russian, 1 Western.
