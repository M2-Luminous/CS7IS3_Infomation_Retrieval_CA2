For the defense establishment, the return to Taba means an understanding with the Palestinians that any agreements achieved there would be final, and that it will not be necessary to rush every agreement to Tunis for Yasir 'Arafat's approval or rejection. The Taba talks will address the Qatif Bloc's area and defense mechanism; road traffic and how it is to be made secure; and that ancient issue of the control in border crossings, including that of Rafah. In all the talks, the Cairo understandings and agreements will be the starting line, nothing else. If the Taba encounter proves successful both in terms of negotiating modalities and the Palestinian delegation's mandate, the civilian track will be launched in full scope in the coming days.
