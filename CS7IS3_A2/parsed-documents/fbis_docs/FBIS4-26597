It will make proper adjustments in its programming effective 20 June. The adjusted programming will retain its distinctive features while giving more prominence to news broadcasting. From morning till night, news will be broadcasted at the most important times. The former "International News" program carried at 2200 [1500 GMT] will be moved to 0610 [2210 GMT], and there will be a 10-minute program called "Night News" to increase efficiency. The previous "Daily Morning News" will be replaced by "Yesterday's Guide." In addition, the "738 News Hotline" and "738 Live Studio" will be merged and broadcasted from 1810 to 1855 [1010 to 1055 GMT]. This will enable the program presenters to host their program more easily and will encourage the audience to participate in the hotline. As part of the change, a small number of specialized programs will also be adjusted. The "Rural World" program carried at 1830 [1030 GMT] will be replaced by the "Urban and Rural Panorama" program broadcasted at 0730 [2330 GMT] and 2030 [1230 GMT]. Both "Hunan Night Talk" and "Audience Voice" will be dropped in favor of more literature and art programs.
