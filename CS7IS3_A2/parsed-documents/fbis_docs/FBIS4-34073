Buschmann, who has been a fugitive since 1987, returned voluntarily from Nicaragua. More than 200 peple were waiting at the airport for Buschmann, who arrived from Costa Rica after a three-hour delay. Among those waiting for him were leftist opposition leaders who went to the airport to express their solidarity with him. Buschmann, a 51-year-old theater actor and one of the founders of the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR), was arrested during the past military regime. He was accused of leading an operation to conceal weapons the FPMR had smuggled into Chile in 1986. The following year he escaped from prison and left the country clandestinely. Today he is returning to exercise, as he said, his legitimate right to defend himself and to resume his life legally.
