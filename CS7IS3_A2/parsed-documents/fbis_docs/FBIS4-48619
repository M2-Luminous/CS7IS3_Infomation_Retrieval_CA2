Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle has accused the opposition Basotho National Party, the BNP, of being involved in the strike, which has spread to include junior prison wardens. Similar claims surfaced during the army pay dispute earlier this year. It all seems to stem from the elections last March, in which the BNP were comprehensively defeated. Today, a planned meeting between Mokhehle and the BNP leader Everistus Sekonyana failed to get off the ground and the acting finance minister, whose predecessor was killed last month, was kidnapped at gun point by angry policemen. On the line to Maseru Jeremy Skeet asked Mr. Sekonyane what relations were like between himself and the prime minister. [Begin recording] [Sekonyane] They are certainly not the best relations one would wish they were. If the leadership was on both sides [words indistinct] which exist into good relations, I always believe that if the leadership is well disposed [words indistinct]. [Skeet] Now, you are the leader of the BNP, are you disposed to good relations? [Sekonyane] Well, I have to be, you know, by now I ought to know that you cannot run a modern state without being well disposed to accommodating other views, even if those views are different from yours. [Skeet] So, you blame the prime minister, Mokhehle, for the bad relations between you and him? [Sekonyane] I have learned that in life you don't start by blaming, you start by encouraging your opponent, you know, to get into a situation where you can be able to minimize your differences, or bury them. If you can't bury them, at least minimize and concentrate on the profits. [Skeet] But, what are the major issues that separate your two parties? [Sekonyane] Well, the major issues really are ... [changers thought] it is not a question of the major issues, it is a question of action, you know. There is no love lost, you know, between the two parties for more than 20 years and, you know, we have to build on that, and it is not easy. There is no way in life, you have got to find each other, you have got to talk to each other. [Skeet] Now, your approach sounds very conciliatory, but there are those people who accuse you of, one stirring up trouble, and now stirring up trouble in the police force, and they are on strike. [Sekonyane] You know, I once said to somebody, I said if I were that influential, I better be the prime minister. It is a very, very funny thing that, you know, I have got a a magic wand and people do what I want them to do, and yet I am not in that position. [Skeet] But the police force used to be somewhat say, a branch of your party, the BNP, and now they are on strike. How much influence have you in the police force? [Sekonyane] Well, you know, this is not so. It is very, very easy when people want to [word indistinct] through propaganda. They forget that we were ousted by the army in 1986. [Skeet] But we are talking about the police here Mr. Sekonyana. I will just ask you, how close are you to the police force? [Sekonyane] No, no, we are not close to the police force. It is a professional police force and as far as anybody really who knows Lesotho, the police were never really that much politicized, I really do not believe so. Anybody who is here knows that fact.
