How do you evaluate the visit by a foreign minister of a superpower to the Palestinian autonomous area? [Al-Husayni] In fact this visit has been allocated to the Palestinians within the agenda of the Syrian-Israeli track. Perhaps it is symbolic more than anything else. One meeting has already been held in Jericho and the other will be held tomorrow morning in East Jerusalem. Concerning Jericho, it is obvious that the Americans want to be the first from outside the region to start official visits to Jericho. During the meeting, several questions were raised on the reality in which we are living after the Israeli withdrawal, in terms of needs and preparedness of the Palestinian forces. They informed us that certain assistance will be extended, either to the self-government in the future or to certain areas, such as Gaza in particular. [Tarabayh] On the political level, what were the topics you discussed with Christopher? [Al-Husayni] In fact the talks centered mainly on the issue of Jerusalem, the settlement activities, the Israeli practices. We also stressed the importance of starting negotiations on the final status [of the occupied territories] as soon as possible. [Tarabayh] It was observed that when the self-rule agreement was signed in Cairo, you openly expressed your apprehensions--and this is not the first time--on the fate of Jerusalem. Do these apprehensions still exist? [Al-Husayni] Yes, we voiced apprehensions but we did not do anything and we did not take the appropriate measures. Perhaps we will lose Jerusalem. We must wage the battle for Jerusalem in order to present a new Palestinian fait accompli in the face of the Israeli fait accompli. The Israelis are trying to decide the issue of Jerusalem in their favor. [Tarabayh] Does this mean that you consider that the self-rule agreement signed in Cairo ignored the issue of Jerusalem or failed to provide a solution for Jerusalem? [Al-Husayni] We wished that the agreement had been preceded by an Israeli commitment to lifting the isolation of the city of Jerusalem. [Tarabayh] In your opinion, why did the Palestinian side not insist on this issue? [Al-Husayni] Let me say that at certain times the Israelis warned that there were certain demands which, if openly demanded, they could not meet, but if they were left to them, they might meet them in a calm manner. Perhaps there was a sort of understanding. I hope that it will happen in this way and Israel will lift the isolation of Jerusalem gradually and without great clamor in the media. However, up until now, we have not seen anything in this direction. [Tarabayh] It was circulated that the name of Faysal al-Husayni was included in the list of members who would form the Palestinian National Authority [PNA] in Gaza and the Strip [as heard]. Will you participate in this authority? [Al-Husayni] Yes. Despite all reservations, this agreement was signed, and became an accomplished fact. We should deal with this fact, not only in the sense of precisely working to implement its articles literally, but also in the sense of dealing with it in order to promote it and fill the gaps in the text. We believe that through continued and collective work we can circumvent these obstacles. [Tarabayh] It was said that you insisted on having the portfolio of Jerusalem affairs. Is this true? [Al-Husayni] Yes. My condition was that I would accept any post given to me provided it would not keep me away from Jerusalem in terms of time or geography. [Tarabayh] When will the membership of the PNA be completed? [Al-Husayni] I believe that a few days after the 'Id holiday [approximately 21-24 May], the picture would be clear. [Tarabayh] Will this authority be regarded as a government? [Al-Husayni] Yes, it is a government. [Tarabayh] In other words, can we address you by: Mr. Minister? [Al-Husayni, laughing] This is premature. [Tarabayh] How do you assess the current situation in the occupied Arab territories, particularly in light of the renewed clashes in Nabulus, Hebron, and other areas? [Al-Husayni] The fact is that the Israelis began a partial withdrawal from specific areas in Gaza and Jericho. The Israeli Army, however, has not withdrawn from other areas, and the settlements have not been removed. Consequently, occupation has not ended. Thus, in the presence of occupation, such clashes and events will continue until the Israelis behave otherwise and until they actually show, as part of a very clear plan, that they really wish to withdraw completely from the occupied Palestinian territories and remove their settlements. [Tarabayh] Are you reassured about the deployment of the Palestinian police in the self-rule area and about the citizens' welcome of this police force? [Al-Husayni] The citizens' welcome has exceeded imagination, and, perhaps, went beyond the conceivable limit. The backing, love, support, and rallying around the Palestinian national security forces may even impede the work of these forces. However, this rejoicing may last for a few days, but, ultimately, matters should be organized, and this love should facilitate not only the policemen's needs, as is the case now, but also their field work on the street. [Tarabayh] How do you view the future coexistence between the Palestinian factions opposed to the self-rule agreement and the Palestinian factions represented in the national authority? [Al-Husayni] I believe that if we follow a democratic approach as well as the freedom of opinion and the rational dealing with matters, and if we also refrain from using physical or verbal violence, we can achieve much. We need this opposition. An opposition is important in any country. There is opposition in Israel, and it affects the government in certain domains. Thus, why should we not have similar opposition? [Tarabayh] Are there contacts designed to coordinate positions among these factions on the ground in the territories? [Al-Husayni] Yes, there are contacts. However, these contacts vary from one group to another. [Tarabayh] Thank you, Faysal al-Husayni. [Al-Husayni] You are welcome. Thank you.
