He downplayed Russian objections to the attack, saying he had "a good talk" with Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday and that foreign ministers of both countries would continue communications today. In Moscow, Yeltsin told reporters that the U.S. has no right to bomb Bosnian Serb positions without consulting Russia first. Clinton said U.S. warplanes acted with U.N. civilian authorization and that U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali backed such a move in an earlier statement. The U.S. president made these remarks before a meeting of his national security advisers at the White House.
