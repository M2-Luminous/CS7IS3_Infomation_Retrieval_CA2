He said the Agrarians retained enough sense to reject the document. The Agrarian Union brings together all the major farms and farming facilities of Russia. In April the Union's Council sent an open letter to President Yeltsin. According to Starodubtsev, it demanded the right to join the conciliatory commission's efforts to polish the document and devise a mechanism for its realization. The Union was still waiting for an answer from the president. Although the Russian farmers welcomed every wise, well-intended and long-term proposal, Starodubtsev said they would never welcome moves to do them in and destroy Russia. Starodubtsev saw the Civic Accord agreement as suicidal. Even if Yeltsin invited the Union to sign the Civic Accord agreement, Starodubtsev would not sign. He was confident that the conclusion of agreements with those who worked to destroy the countryside was immoral.
