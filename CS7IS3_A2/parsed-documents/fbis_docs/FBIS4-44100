Following setbacks on the stock exchanges at the beginning of the week, the dollar experienced a sudden plunge until the situation was reestablished on most markets yesterday. Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery draws here the lessons from these successive jolts. He replies in passing to businessmen who are requesting further measures to bolster economic activity. [Maudit] Were you in a cold sweat this past week? [Alphandery] No, not really. Now that things have started going better, now that the real economy is picking up, and the international environment is improving, we must keep cool and not give too much importance to financial movements that were clearly amplified by exaggerated psychological reactions. [Maudit] You speak as if no serious jolts had been experienced this week on the market. [Alphandery] Of course there have been. There was some turbulence. But it will be overcome because the basic economic trends are positive. Recovery is being confirmed in Europe. Japanese plans to boost the economy are beginning to have effect, beyond expectations. Finally, the American economy is still growing, though more slowly than before. The good news is that the three great locomotives of the world economy are now pulling again in the same direction. What is more -- and this had not happened for a long time -- they are doing so synchronously. This is why I feel calm. [Maudit] However, the drop of the dollar is rather worrying. [Alphandery] This is an exaggeration. It is true, however, that the dollar has dropped considerably, which has given rise to certain questions being posed in the United States, Japan, and Europe. No doubt, this weakness partly explains the recent tensions over long- term interest rates. But I am not worried about the future, because I believe that economic reality will prevail. [Maudit] So you remain an optimist, despite and against everything? [Alphandery] Not an optimist, but rather, cool-headed. There are as many explanations for the dollar's drop as there are economists. Nevertheless, two major factors are often pinpointed to explain this trend. To begin with, the U.S. trade deficit, which this year may amount to as much as $150 billion (more than 820 billion French francs). Second, there are fears that inflation may reappear in the United States. In both cases, we should not overestimate the dangers involved. With recovery under way in Europe and Japan, America's deficit should gradually decrease. Besides, I agree with Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, with whom I had long conversations this week, in believing that there is no risk of inflation getting out of control. I am therefore convinced that the markets over-reacted in the short term -- as they often do -- and that the situation will develop favorably. [Maudit] Are you also minimizing the importance of the stock exchange crisis? [Alphandery] I am not minimizing anything. I am simply saying that when long-term interest rates tend to increase, they necessarily have an impact on the stock markets. However, I see no reason why long-term interest rates should continue to remain high in European countries overall. In fact, we began to observe an easing up by midweek. It is only natural: There is no risk of inflation; the economy is healthy and there is a strong savings base to finance investment. [Maudit] So why did the stock exchange plunge? Are the markets blind? [Alphandery] They sometimes amplify the movements, but they are not blind. This is why I would not be surprised if the stock exchange bounces back up again. Let me tell you, on the other hand, that according to a study conducted by the "Associes en Finance" [Financial Partners] research institute on the main companies quoted on the Paris stock exchange, CAC 40 [Paris Stock Exchange index] companies may well see their profits increase by 31.2 percent this year. In 1995, they may even surpass the record levels achieved in 1989. [Maudit] Do you not feel that the markets are particularly concerned about the situation in France? Is this because of the problems with public finances, or because of political uncertainties? [Alphandery] I do not share this feeling in the least. For a very simple reason: In the field of the government deficit, 15 months ago we opted for a very clear line -- namely, restructuring. In particular, although nobody was forcing us to do so, we drafted a five-year law setting our objectives with regard to reducing the public deficit. Everybody knows this: France has now taken the management of its deficit in hand [Maudit] Nothing, then, is likely to hamper economic recovery? [Alphandery] I do not think so. If you look at the latest indicator available to us -- namely, the consumption of manufactured products -- the May results are of course not quite as good as the exceptionally high April results, but they are better than the results obtained in March. The underlying trend is therefore positive. Overall, I believe the growth rate of economic activity in the second quarter will be higher than in the first quarter, which leads me to confirm my expectation that our 1.4-percent growth forecast will be surpassed this year. [Maudit] This outlook is not shared at all by employers, who believe recovery is rather too slow and are requesting further measures to boost economic activity. [Alphandery] It would be best to ask employers individually what they think about the situation. I meet many of them in the field who tell me that things are definitely getting better. I believe that when the figures for the second quarter are published, everybody will be able to realize that this is in fact the case. What satisfies me most is the fact that we are getting quicker results than expected with regard to the employment situation. We are getting there: The French economy is again creating jobs. Unfortunately, we have not yet reached the stage where we can absorb the number of new arrivals on the labor market, but let us be patient, we will eventually get there! I do not believe I have misled anybody through my forecasts so far. [Maudit] Is there no need, then, for the further support measures demanded by employers? [Alphandery] You know, I am sure, that I pay a lot of attention to this issue. For example, early in the year I felt it was necessary to bolster the automobile industry. The economy was recovering, but not in this particular sector. We therefore advocated support measures for the car industry, and these measures achieved the expected aim. [Maudit] So, are you basically telling employers that there will be no new measures? [Alphandery] Future measures to consolidate growth? Such measures have already been planned and will take effect in the second half of 1994. They will include, in particular, increased financial allowances for students returning to school after the summer vacation. In addition, thanks to a more buoyant European environment, demand for French products will continue to increase. The CNPF [National Council of French Employers] can therefore say what it likes, there are no dark clouds on the horizon.
