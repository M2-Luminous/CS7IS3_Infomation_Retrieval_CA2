Security Council at the proper time, China's foreign minister told his Egyptian counterpart in talks here today. Qian Qichen, who is also a vice-premier, added that the regional distribution principle, especially how to reach balance between the developing and developed countries, should be taken into account in the reform of the U.N. Security Council. 'Amr Musa, Egypt's foreign minister, agreed with Qian's views on this issue. The two foreign ministers also reached extensive consensus on the international situation and bilateral ties in their talks. Qian said that yesterday's talks between Egyptian President Husni Mubarak and Chinese President Jiang Zemin were very good, and he was convinced that the current visit of Mubarak would enhance Sino- Egyptian relations. Musa said that in recent years, the bilateral ties had developed smoothly and steadily. The two countries should explore new ways of economic and trade cooperation in order to promote the equal and mutually-beneficial cooperative relations, he said. Touching on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Qian said that China was deeply worried about the conflict in the region, which has lasted for a long time, and heartily sympathized with people there. The Chinese Government sincerely hoped that all the parties involved would take the people's interests into consideration and at once stop the conflict and all hostile activities, Qian said. China was also concerned with the deteriorating situation in Gorazde, he said, adding that the Chinese Government held that the problem should be solved by peaceful means rather than by actions which would make the situation more complicated. China's foreign minister said that China, along with the international community, would continue to promote the peace process in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and spare no effort to help national reconciliation to be reached and people there to shake off the sufferings brought by the war. Musa told Qian that Egypt was concerned about the problem, especially the suffering and unfair treatment of the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He pointed out that the United Nations and international communities should take effective actions to end the war in the region. The two foreign ministers also discussed such problems as the situation in the Persian Gulf, the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula, and the non-aligned countries movement.
