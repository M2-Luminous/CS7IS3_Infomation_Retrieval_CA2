FR940419-0-00059 FR940419-0-00019 Still another conflict case in which cost recovery litigation was adversely impacted involved a subcontractor who was performing PRP searches, negotiation support, and oversight of PRP work on a site for the EPA. The subcontractor not only had a significant financial relationship with the PRPs of that site, but was also representing and performing related work for the PRPs on the same site. The repercussions of this conflict involved not only a significant delay in the Agency's ability to cleanup the site, but also tens of thousands of dollars in transition costs to remove and replace the subcontractor. EPA's concerns regarding conflicts of interest are very real. As EPA continues to clean up the environment and to try to recover the costs of the cleanup from PRPs, EPA seeks, through this rule, to protect the public from delays and increased costs. For example, EPA contractors may perform remedial design work for EPA by developing plans and specifications for a selected cleanup remedy at a site. If that contractor also works for a PRP to assess the contamination at the same site, EPA, PRPs, and the public may question the integrity and objectivity of the work the contractor has performed for EPA. Moreover, EPA could face difficulty in utilizing the contractor's expertise and experience in supporting the merits of EPA's enforcement case. Judges and juries may doubt the credibility of a factual or expert witness who has performed conflicting work and may have inconsistent opinions. Another example of how EPA's enforcement could be jeopardized in the future would be if a contractor who performs technical enforcement support for EPA, including searches for and case histories of PRPs, subsequently or concurrently worked for the PRP on the same case. Again, contractors performing this and other types of Superfund work are often privy to sensitive EPA litigation information and case management plans and could divulge such information to the PRP. If such information was leaked or otherwise divulged intentionally or unintentionally, the Government's case may be damaged by disclosure to the PRP of litigation strategy. In addition, if documents deemed confidential and privileged were released, such documents could then be admitted into evidence in opposition to the Government's case. We disagree with commenters that the Agency has not considered the balance between the cost of the rule and the benefits to EPA of avoiding conflicts. We believe there must be uniform regulatory requirements to raise contractors' awareness and understanding of conflict of interest problems and the procedures needed to prevent them. Over the past few years, the development of this rule with its strong conflict of interest provisions has created a heightened sensitivity to conflict of interest matters throughout EPA's programs and the contractor community. As a result, we are already seeing an increase in contractors reporting of potential conflicts to the Agency. Certainly, with the tremendous cost of cleaning up the environment, we need to ensure the integrity of our procurement program and cannot afford to jeopardize our enforcement actions and impede PRP cleanup of hazardous waste sites. EPA has seriously considered the cost of the rule and has worked to minimize the rule's burden to the contractor community, yet ensure adequate protection of its programs. 4. Pending FAR Regulations and Consistency With OFPP Policy Letter 89&hyph;1 Some commenters expressed concern with the publication of EPA's rule prior to the publication of the pending FAR regulations, and some expressed concern that the proposed rule is inconsistent with and goes beyond the existing regulations and OFPP Policy Letter 89&hyph;1. On October 22, 1990, the interim regulations were published as FAC 90&hyph;1, amending the FAR subpart 9.5 on conflicts of interest. On October 25, 1991, the interim rule was converted to a final rule. We have carefully reviewed our rule to ensure its harmony with FAR subpart 9.5. The rule specifically addresses the unique requirements of the Superfund program which are not covered by other regulations. To safeguard our enforcement actions and ensure the integrity of our cleanup program, it is essential that we monitor not only conflicts of interest prior to award, but also conflicts during and after performance. These special provisions are not inconsistent with FAR subpart 9.5.
