Achieving this requires a reversal of the previous trend implemented during the past 25 years, which encouraged major technological projects of large dimensions that were highly sophisticated and centralized. There must be a move toward promoting initiatives that will bring a high rate of technological return to the productive system, and an international projection of Brazil's scientific and technical capacity. This is one of the main conclusions from a study prepared by the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV) at the request of the Ministry of Science and Technology and the World Bank (IDB), based on the agreement that established the Second Program in Support of Scientific and Technological Development (II-PADCT). The work to assess Brazilian scientific policy, divided into three phases, was done by an independent group of Brazilian scientists and economists from Campinas State University (UNICAMP), which was responsible for covering relations with the economic sector; from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, concentrating on the current status of Brazil's scientific policy and the preparation of new guidelines; and from the Ministry of Science and Technology, studying the institutional aspects of the issue. The results of the studies will be presented next week, at the "International Seminar for Evaluation of and Proposals for Brazil's Scientific and Technological Development," to be held at the FGV. Also to be discussed are the results of the applications of the funds released by the Inter-American Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), totaling $72 million between 1985 and 1990, and by the IDB, amounting to $150 million during the past four years. According to the coordinator of the work carried out by the FGV, Simon Schwartzman, a clear identification of the technological demands of Brazil's industrial plant is required, as is the aiming of research toward potentially applied fields. He explains: "Nevertheless, this does not imply a neglect of basic research, but rather its adapation to the country's model of economic and industrial development. In his assessment, Schwartzman remarks: "The 1980's were typified by a major lack of definition of the objectives and goals of Brazilian scientific production." This was due to the failure of the military plan during the Geisel government's term, with accelerated growth of the economy. At that time, an S&T system was set up in the country aimed at large-scale programs intended to respond to the demands of the military sector, in the telecommunications, nuclear, aeronautical, and computer science fields. Potential The abundance of funds and incentives was, however, not reflected in a concern for quality and efficiency in scientific production, which ultimately failed to gain an international projection. During the 1970's, Brazil was responsible for 0.2 percent of worldwide scientific production. Ten years later, that production amounted to only 0.4 percent. "There was little growth," in Schwartzman's view. According to data from the Ministry of Science and Technology, the scientific community consists of 50,000 persons, 12,000 of whom have post-graduate degrees. "This number isn't small, and is comparable to that of a small European country. To take advantage of this potential, there must be a recovery of installed capacity and a redirection of Brazil's scientific and technological model."
