Crossovers The Council determined that a qualifying vessel would be allowed to participate in all moratorium fisheries during the moratorium, even if the vessel had a reported landing from only one moratorium fishery. The Council reasoned that restrictions on the ability to crossover into other moratorium fisheries would constrain a fisherman's flexibility during the moratorium and would be allocative among different sectors of the industry. The Council determined that crossover restrictions would be addressed under the comprehensive management plan. Crossovers during the moratorium could result in the entry of groundfish and halibut vessels into the crab fisheries, halibut vessels into the groundfish fisheries, and crab pot vessels into the groundfish fisheries. NMFS particularly requests public comment on crossovers, because crossover ability could have the potential to increase the harvesting capacity in the groundfish and crab fisheries, thwarting the goals of the moratorium. 7. Transfer of Moratorium Qualification ``Moratorium qualification'' is proposed for all qualifying vessels. Moratorium qualification could be transferred if two requirements were satisfied. First, the vessel transferring moratorium qualification would no longer be eligible to participate in any of the moratorium fisheries for the remainder of the moratorium unless that vessel subsequently received transferred moratorium qualification from another vessel. Second, if moratorium qualification were transferred to another vessel, a vessel length restriction would apply to the receiving vessel. The latter restriction, known as the ``20 percent rule'', would restrict vessels that are equal to, or less than, 125 ft (38.1 m) length overall (LOA) from increasing LOA by more than 20 percent, or 125 ft (38.1 m), whichever is less. Vessels over 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA would not be allowed to increase LOA during the moratorium. The LOA of a vessel, as defined at §§672.2 and 675.2, means the horizontal distance, rounded to the nearest foot (.33 m) between the foremost part of the stem and the aftermost part of the stern, excluding bowsprits, rudders, outboard motor brackets, and similar fittings or attachments. For example, the owner of a vessel that is 100 ft (30.5 m) LOA could transfer that vessel's moratorium qualification to a vessel that is 120 ft (36.6 m) LOA or less. The 100-ft (30.5 m) LOA vessel would not be able to participate in any of the moratorium fisheries for the duration of the moratorium because it does not have moratorium qualification. The 100-ft (30.5 m) vessel would be able to participate if it received transferred moratorium qualification from a vessel that was 83 ft (25.3 m) LOA or longer. The Council did not select a date before which the transfer of moratorium qualification would not be allowed. Recognizing that a market in moratorium qualification had developed, the Council determined that moratorium qualification would rest with the qualifying vessel unless otherwise specified by legal agreement. The Council also determined that the transfer of moratorium qualification would not result in a transfer of the vessel's catch history. 8. Replacement of Vessel Until the moratorium expires, the owner of a vessel with moratorium qualification would be able to replace that vessel with a vessel that does not have moratorium qualification as long as two requirements were satisfied. First, the replaced vessel would no longer be eligible to participate in any of the moratorium fisheries for the remainder of the moratorium, unless that vessel subsequently received transferred moratorium qualification from another vessel. Second, any increase in LOA through vessel replacement, sequential vessel replacements, or combined replacement and reconstruction would be limited by the 20 percent rule. The Council deemed the vessel replacement provision as necessary to facilitate the normal and on-going vessel replacement activities undertaken by vessel owners in response to financial, economic, and efficiency incentives. 9. Reconstruction of Vessel A qualifying vessel that is reconstructed would have to comply with certain restrictions in LOA to remain eligible to participate in any of the moratorium fisheries. The proposed restrictions are: a. If vessel reconstruction were completed before June 24, 1992, any increase in LOA resulting from that reconstruction would be unrestricted; additional reconstruction would be allowed after June 24, 1992, subject to the 20 percent rule. b. If reconstruction were started before June 24, 1992, but not completed by that date, any increase in LOA resulting from that reconstruction would be unrestricted, but no more increases in LOA would be allowed during the moratorium. c. If reconstruction were started on or after June 24, 1992, any increase in LOA resulting from that reconstruction would be subject to the 20 percent rule. The Council determined that it was important to allow increases in vessel LOA through reconstruction to provide for enhanced safety and stability, or to allow for the installation of processing equipment. However, the Council determined that reconstruction should not allow unlimited increases in LOA or the objectives of the moratorium would be compromised. The Council chose to limit LOA as a measure of fishing capacity, because it believed LOA was unambiguous, easily determined, and difficult to circumvent. To account equitably for actions already taken by vessel owners, restrictions on increases in LOA would be applicable only to changes that occurred after June 24, 1992, which was the day the Council adopted the 20 percent rule and the public became aware of this Council action through the June 24th Council meeting. 10. Replacement of Lost or Destroyed Vessel Any qualifying vessel that is lost or destroyed during the moratorium could be replaced by a non-qualifying vessel. Any qualifying vessel that was lost or destroyed on or after January 1, 1989, until the date of moratorium implementation could be replaced with a non-qualifying vessel. However, the replacement vessel would be required to make a landing from a moratorium fishery within 2 years of the moratorium implementation date. A qualifying vessel lost or destroyed before January 1, 1989, could not be replaced. A vessel that replaced a lost or destroyed vessel would be subject to the 20 percent rule, and the replaced vessel would become a non-qualifying vessel unless that vessel subsequently received transferred moratorium qualification.
