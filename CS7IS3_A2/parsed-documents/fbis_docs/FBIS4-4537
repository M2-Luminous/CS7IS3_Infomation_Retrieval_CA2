U Khine Saw Tun, the son of U San Tun Aung of the Lamadaw area, Kyauktaw, Rakhine State; a member of the Central Committee of the ALP [Arakan Liberation Party], an Arakan armed organization in the jungle; and joint secretary of the Information Committee of the DAB [Democratic Alliance of Burma] in the jungle, returned to the legal fold in Yangon [Rangoon] on 29 March. U Myint Maung joined the National League for Democracy in December 1989. He took part in the election held in May 1990 and was elected as a representative of constituency-2 in Einme Township, Irrawaddy Division. He went underground in Manerplaw in December 1990 and was made the officer in charge of agriculture, forests, and environmental protection in Dr. Sein Win's exile group. He returned to the legal fold because he was unhappy with the unfairness of the jungle groups and the one-sided decisions made by their leaders. U Khine Saw Tun went underground in 1988 and served as a reserve Central Committee member of the ALP, an Arakan armed organization, and a central committee member of the National United Front of Arakan, NUFA. He also served as joint secretary of the Information Committee of the Democratic Alliance of Burma, DAB, and was in charge of the central office. He traveled to Germany in 1991; Bangladesh and Germany in 1992; and Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, England, Switzerland, and France in 1993. On these trips he attended constitutional meetings and other political meetings. It has been learned from responsible personnel that he returned to the legal fold because he became discouraged during his visits to many foreign countries by the attitudes and unrealistic dreams of the groups that are opposed to Myanmar and refuse to review and understand the truth and ongoing changes taking place in Myanmar.
