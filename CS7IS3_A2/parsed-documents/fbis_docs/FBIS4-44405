There will be no "direct" transition, and no legislative member should expect to ride the "through train" [meaning that members of Hong Kong's last Legislative Council may become, upon confirmation by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Preparatory Committee, members of the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]. This is because the British Hong Kong authorities have submitted the so-called "three violations" political reform package [Chris Patten's plan in violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Hong Kong Basic Law, and the understandings reached between China and Britain] to the Legislative Council, and the Sino-British talks have broken down. Now, whatever political reform plan is adopted by the Legislative Council, a new kitchen will have to be set up in 1997, says the big boss. The 1994/95 elections for the three-tier legislature are drawing near. Though this "last train," with a life of only two or three years, cannot carry the passengers to their destination, all political parties and organizations and all politicians, big and small, are scrambling to get on board. They include not only democrats and conservatives but also pro-China political organizations. This is not because they turn a deaf ear to the northern big boss' "stern" statement. Rather, the reason is that if you do not get on the train, the arena will be occupied by others in the next two to three years. With the curtain to be raised soon for the election war, a must now in political circles is to deal with friends and foes with diplomacy. If some results can be produced eventually through negotiations, the outcome would be the confrontation of two big forces. The democrats would team up to encounter the "Unsacred Alliance" formed by the conservative and pro-China forces. The hardliners among the democrats are most likely to be pushed down from the train in 1997. Their participation in political affairs is more or less out of a going-without-retreating mentality. This is especially true for their attitude toward the "last train" before 1997. You must first get on the train before you are pushed down from the train. In the 1994/95 three-tier legislature election, all are ready to do their utmost no matter what plan the Legislative Council will adopt. Election of the local legislature--district boards--will be held in this September. Next year the Hong Kong-Kowloon and New Territories urban councils will be elected. This will be followed by the most influential event--the election of the Legislative Council. Election of the district boards and urban councils are skirmishes for the Legislative Council election. In this year's district board election, there will be 360 seats to be filled. The "Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong," a pro-China political organization, has revealed that it will support 80 candidates to run for these seats. The "Liberal Party," which is regarded as a conservative party, has announced that it will have some 100 members to join the election war. As to the three democratic political organizations, it is estimated that the "United Democrats of Hong Kong" will have 100 candidates, the "Meeting Point" some 30 candidates, and the "Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood" about 40 to 50 candidates. Whether the democrats can team up in the election depends on whether agreement can be reached through negotiations among the United Democrats of Hong Kong, the Meeting Point, and the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood. In principle, the agreement will be that, in the same election district, the three organizations will make all-out efforts to support only one democratic candidate who is most likely to win the election. This will avert their contention in the same election district. Even if contention occurs in the same district, they hope to minimize it and behave as true gentlemen, if at all possible, so as to avoid hurting their amity. As a matter of fact, the district boards have 360 seats, while the three democratic organizations have less than 200 candidates in total. Perhaps the democrats should pay more attention to studying the cause that has limited their development and resulted in their insufficient manpower. Meanwhile, because of the three organizations' overlapping areas of development, their candidates may conflict with one another in the same election district. In the past, these three organizations have all along tried to negotiate with one another. In the 1991 district board election, however, they did have some conflicts despite their negotiation efforts. In 1991, the United Democrats of Hong Kong supported 71 candidates to run for the district board seats, the Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood had 17 candidates, and the Meeting Point had 13. In that election, conflicts did occur between the Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood and the Meeting Point. Nonetheless, whether the three democratic organizations can reach some agreement through negotiations cannot be judged merely by the existence or nonexistence of conflicts among them in the district board election. We must look into other factors. A flagship among the democrats, the United Democrats of Hong Kong is the largest of the three democratic political organizations, presently taking up 13 seats in the Legislative Council (including as many as 11 of the 18 directly elected seats). It, therefore, has the posture of a "big party." In the eyes of the northern big boss, however, the United Democrats of Hong Kong is a thorn in his side and must be taken out. The United Democrats of Hong Kong has expressed willingness to hold dialogues with the Chinese side, but the latter has viewed it as a "group not to maintain contacts with" and has consistently hurled accusations against it. As for the Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood and the Meeting Point, the former was previously more enthusiastic about participation in political affairs than the latter. This is because at the inception the Meeting Point was mainly a political-critic group. Now, however, in the Legislative Council the Meeting Point holds four seats, while the Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood is merely a "one-person party." Toward these two political organizations, the Chinese side's attitude is different from that toward the United Democrats of Hong Kong. The Chinese side has said that dialogues can be held with them and, what is more, it will appoint their members as Hong Kong affairs advisors and district affairs advisors. Toward the Chinese side's gesture, the Meeting Point takes a relatively clear attitude. It agrees to have dialogues with the Chinese side, but upholds its own stand. With regard to the issue of Hong Kong's political reform, it supports democracy and takes Governor Chris Patten's package as the bottom line. On the other hand, the political stand of the Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood is comparatively "ambiguous." The United Democrats of Hong Kong and the Meeting Point have shown a stronger desire to seek coordination among the democrats. The Meeting Point has said openly that it is willing to consult with the United Democrats of Hong Kong and the Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood so that they can coordinate with and support one another in this year's district board election. In contrast, as people within the political circles may recall, in the 1991 election, when the Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood and the Meeting Point both planned to nominate their candidates for the same election district, the former proposed two solutions: One, the opponent should make way. Two, the two organizations should merge into one. In fact, teaming up among democrats should not be limited to coordination in the district board election. A higher goal should be the development of a broader united front consisting of the three organizations plus other democratic personages. This is particularly necessary in view of the Legislative Council election to be held next year. The Legislative Council has 60 seats, of which 20 will be directly elected (of the other seats, 30 will be elected by functional constituencies, and 10 by the Election Committee). This makes it all the more necessary for the democrats to coordinate their actions with respect to candidates for the various election districts. They should pool their efforts and support one another. However, teaming up may be just wishful thinking. Turning it into a reality will probably involve grave difficulties. One of the difficulties is the hard-to-resolve conflicts of interests among the democratic political organizations. Every political organization wants to expand their strength and influence. The most effective way to do this is to gain more seats in the legislature, especially the Legislative Council. Since this concerns their interests, it would be hard to be "modest." In the past elections, though the three democratic organizations sought to coordinate their actions, none would make way for the others. Election is a seat-seizing game. As there are only a limited number of seats on the "last train," a scramble for seats will easily occur. Further, attention should be paid to the splittism caused by the "China factor." The northern big boss has always wanted to suppress the United Democrats of Hong Kong by smearing that organization so hard as if it had contracted "political AIDS" and everyone should keep apart from it. Long ago Beijing began to behave as the ruler of Hong Kong. It seems that the United Democrats of Hong Kong can only have a gloomy political future. Under China's big-stick policy, the United Democrats of Hong Kong, though it may become a passenger on the "last train," is most likely to be pushed down. And, in all probability, other political organizations and politicians, big and small, will keep a "safe distance" from it and will have reservations about coordinating with it or allying with it to form a democratic united front, if they think of their "own prosperous future" or if they are frightened by the stick of the northern big boss. Now, the northern big boss is keeping a fierce watch on the democrats' efforts toward coordination. China's mouthpiece has already launched an offensive, asserting that the United Democrats of Hong Kong is "overbearing" and cannot coordinate with the other democrats. At the same time, the Chinese side has spread words to the effect that the newly appointed Hong Kong affairs advisors and district affairs advisors will include members of the Meeting Point and the Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood, but no consideration will be given to members of the United Democrats of Hong Kong. This is to display its traditional talisman--the carrot in addition to the stick.
