Information released by mainland China's Ministry of Internal Trade and Material Supply Information Center shows that the aggregate average price increase of all categories of capital goods in the first quarter of this year was 8.2 percent, a decrease of 30 percentage points in the rate of inflation compared with the 38.2 percent recorded in the same period last year. Prices continued to drop in April, and the inflation rate has decreased from 15.8 percent in January this year to 0.4 percent now. In January, prices of steel products used as building materials soared by a wide margin, since all sectors of the community were optimistic about the economic development trend, and the state on its part moderately increased the money supply and implemented some reformatory measures. Price hikes were later stopped and are tending toward stability, showing a slight drop as a result of the policy of macroeconomic regulation and control practiced by the state. From information released by the Material Supply Information Center, the average price of steel products stood at 3,580 yuan per metric ton across the country in March, a further decrease of 0.6 percent in addition to the 0.5 percent decrease recorded in February. As compared with the price level in the same period last year, the general price level of steel products decreased by 4.5 percent, with small section steel prices decreasing, in particular, by as much as 11.8 percent. The average price for a car is 173,000 yuan, a decrease of nearly 10,000 yuan compared with the highest price recorded earlier this year. Meanwhile, building materials prices keep decreasing, with the nationwide average price for cement standing at 369 yuan per metric ton in March, a decrease of 5.4 percent compared with the price earlier this year. The price of coal remains relative stable. Experts predict that since the general price level of major capital goods, such as steel products, timber, and cement, remains basically stable, prices of all categories of capital goods will remain stable as well, probably showing a slight drop in the second quarter.
