The Energy Agency is now moving ahead with "technical confirmation tests of equipment for shutting down reactors," to expand the development of dismantling technology, and "surveys of reactor shutdown technology," to investigate waste disposal measures and the legal system. In the steps that will be taken next time, reactor shutdown measures will be carried out in three steps. The basic policy in shutting down nuclear power plant facilities is to seal off the facilities for a fixed period of time, then to dismantle and remove them. The concrete scheduling of such steps will be after the year 2000 because nuclear power plants are normally in use for 30 to 40 years. From now on the important thing is to work toward harmony with local societies based on a premise of guaranteed safety. Then, while promoting further technological sophistication, there must be systems of safety regulations and measures for the disposal of the resulting waste, as well as studies from a social perspective that take into consideration the local people. The Energy Agency is now concerned about the Tokai nuclear power plant (166,000 kW; in operation since 1966), which is expected to be shut down in the near future. At the same time, the agency is heading toward providing governmental guidance so that the government and private sector will cooperate in studies for the purpose of formulating concrete procedures for shutting down reactors. While the agency will continue to implement conventional confirmation tests and technical surveys on reactor shutdown measures, it will also begin the development of technology for recycling the waste resulting from dismantling a reactor.
