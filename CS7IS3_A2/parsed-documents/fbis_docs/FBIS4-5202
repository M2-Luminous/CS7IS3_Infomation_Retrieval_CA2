Aphisit Wetchachiwa, spokesman of the Prime Minister's Office, disclosed that in addition to trade and investment policies, the Australian side expressed its desire to use Thailand as an aviation center for Qantas Airlines. The Thai side asked the Australian delegation to protect Thai products which have difficulties when imported to Australia and those products which were once accused of market dumping by asking Australia to use various cautious measures. Aphisit said: [Begin recording] Besides bilateral issues, the two sides exchanged views extensively on how to use the multilateral cooperation framework to serve the two countries' trade, investment, and economic interests. In particular, the two sides have recognized the important role of the economic cooperation forums such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, and discussed possible ways to further expand cooperation in different areas. They discussed the possibility of linking economic cooperation between the ASEAN Free Trade Area and the economic cooperation zone, the so-called CER, of which Australia and New Zealand are members. This issue has never been brought up for official discussion previously. However, both the Thai and Australian sides agreed that further actions must be taken in this regard. Thailand itself can bring up this matter during ASEAN meetings, while Australia seeks consultations with New Zealand as well as members of ASEAN, AFTA [ASEAN Free Trade Area], and other groupings. Multilateral economic cooperation itself is very significant. The two sides agreed that it is a framework that can effectively prevent and discourage any country from resorting to unilateral trade measures which threaten and cause damage to the economies of others. Moreover, the stability is also a byproduct of multilateral cooperation. Despite the end of the Cold War, the two sides deemed it necessary to continue consultations on the security issue. [end recording] Speaking to reporters during an interview after the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak disclosed that the two sides agreed to turn APEC into a multilateral economic cooperation grouping. Suphachai said: [Begin Suphachai recording] We discussed multilateral cooperation with APEC. The Australian side reiterated its concern over this issue. It noted that the United States is moving toward multilateral cooperation and that this is the right move. A multilateral basis means many countries are involved in any agreement. Australia does not want the United States to resort to bilateral actions similar to what it is doing with Japan. Therefore, Australia asks Thailand to help to build up the strength of APEC because APEC was established with support from U.S. politicians and economists who support the principle of multilateral trade. They do not want to see APEC lay idle for fear that certain elements in the United States might turn to practicing trade harassment on a unilateral basis. Prime Minister Chuan reaffirmed that Thailand has always supported and wants to see a strong APEC. However, he suggested that APEC apply GATT agreements as soon as possible and try to comply with GATT rules. He also noted that APEC members are not equally developed like countries in the European Union. This issue must also be considered. [end recording]
