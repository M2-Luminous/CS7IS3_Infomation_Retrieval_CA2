The method was developed in the framework of the state scientific-technical programme ``security.'' Member of the Academy of Natural Sciences, A. Panushi, pointed out in his report that the new method is based on rendering safe super-toxic substances, including chemical weapons. This thermal-chemical technology has considerable advantages over domestic and foreign technologies based on a conventional low-temperature and plasma combustion. The newly designed method relies on the principle and instruments used in rocket engines. Apart from technologies, the process of the destruction of main components of chemical weapons was demonstrated using an experimental installation designed by the Central Machine-Building Research Institute of the Russian Space Agency. A mobile model of this installation makes it possible to destroy chemical weapons and other super-toxic substances directly in their storage places. Russian minister for the environment, Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, and vice-president of the Russian Academy of Sciences Konstantin Frolov, who took part in the discussion of the new method, pointed out the importance of conducted experiments and their prospects both for Russia, the CIS and other countries.
