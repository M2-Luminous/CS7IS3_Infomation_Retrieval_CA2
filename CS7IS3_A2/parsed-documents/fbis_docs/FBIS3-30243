The first wave of privatization ended last October. The privatization objectives of the first wave were fulfilled, with the exception of 30 enterprises. Ivan Lexa contested views to the effect that privatization has slowed down and those expressing doubts about its transparency. He said that, since 15 July 1993, when the ministry started working in its new composition, the process of privatization has accelerated six times. A total of 100 privatization projects have been approved since then, 35 of which were direct sales. Another 70 privatization projects are waiting for the National Property Fund [FNM] to invite or evaluate a public tender. The state secretary pointed out that neither the government nor the MSPNM can accelerate the process, which is in the hands of the FNM. The MSPNM was dissatisfied with cooperation with the FNM Executive Committee, and changes in the FNM bodies have established prerequisites for the situation to improve. Some new methods should make privatization more transparent. Prices will be set according to a new expert's standard and will be monitored by the Supreme Inspection Office. Financial Police will check potential buyers of property, how they meet their tax obligations, the purity of their previous operations, etc. The ministry also calls on the trade unions to send to it signals regarding the professional qualities and irreproachability of current managers who want to privatize their company. According to Ivan Lexa, the personnel ties between the MSPNM and the FNM as contained in the government bill on privatization are warranted. The MSPNM is preparing another important bill--on holdings. The bill's key issue is the legal codification of taxation, as the double taxation of proceeds from shares must be prevented. Speaking about employee-held shares, Ivan Lexa said that, in its policy statement, the government pledged to support employees' wider participation in privatization. He cited Sigma Zavadka, Topvar Topolcany, and JAS Bardejov as successful examples of companies privatized by their employees. In the Tlaciarne Bratislava [Bratislava Printing Works], the initiative was seized by middle-level managers, who already own 51 percent of shares. He also said that the method of allocating a part of the shares for the management and another part for employees had good prospects. Asked by PRAVDA about the form and the date of the second privatization wave, Ivan Lexa said that registration [of coupon books] is planned for the last quarter of 1994. It is necessary to beware of the all-or-nothing approach [mantinelizmus], to which led the endeavor to comply at any price with the federal deadlines for the first privatization wave. The method of privatizing individual enterprises will be assessed more thoroughly [than in the first wave]. A specific owner will be sought first, and only then [when a specific buyer is not found] will the coupon method be used. Property worth 50-70 billion korunas [Sk] will be privatized in the second wave of coupon privatization. The MSPNM is to submit its material on the second wave to the government by the end of February 1994. A concept is being prepared on how to privatize the Sk47.7 billion worth of securities still held by the FNM. The state's permanent participation [in companies, in which the FNM holds a stake] will be reassessed and limited as much as possible. FNM-held shares will be sold either directly or by means of public tender, and smaller remainders will be offered for sale on the stock exchange or on the RM-System market. However, the state secretary pointed to the risk of disturbance in the market if too many securities were to be sold at once.
