The U.S. Administration received formal confirmation from the DPRK yesterday that it will freeze the major elements of its nuclear program while a new round of talks between the U.S. and the DPRK proceeds. Christopher had discussions on the new situation in the DPRK with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, department spokesman Mike McCurry said at a news briefing. They used that discussions to "really begin to build a framework of consultations for the upcoming third round of talks," McCurry said. The spokesman explained that in every step along the way in dealing with this crisis the United States had used "very careful and precise diplomacy" to first build international support for sanction efforts at the United Nations. "We will use exactly that some type of approach now in building a common understanding and foundation for the type of dialogue that we now seek to have with the DPRK," he said. In answering a question, McCurry said the response from the DPRK "specifically addressed the types of concerns that we raised." "We are quite satisfied that the response was detailed enough," he added. McCurry said U.S. Administration officials have had a good exchange with DPRK officials on dates of a new round of talks between the two countries. But he refused to disclose them. President Bill Clinton said yesterday the United States was ready to hold the third round of talks with the DPRK in Geneva early next month.
