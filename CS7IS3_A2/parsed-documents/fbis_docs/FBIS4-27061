The region comprises eight large industrial cities, namely, Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Liaoyang, Benxi, Dandong, Yingkou and Tieling. As early as 1985, the eight cities decided to set up a cooperation region to give full play to their own advantages. As a heavy industrial base of China, this region has sound scientific and technological foundation and the most concentrated railway network in the country. The Shenyang-Dalian expressway links the region with the leading port in northeast China. By now, the industrial production value of this region has amounted to 62 percent of the total of the province and the heavy industrial production value to seven percent of the country's total. In the past ten years, the region has established 22 enterprise groups involving machinery, metallurgy and environmental protection, and it set up a united market in 1992 in Shenyang, capital of the province. The cooperation region not only helps the eight cities supplement each other but also helps these cities to jointly open the world market. These cities have jointly held several trade talks and strengthened trading with Japan and the Republic of Korea.
