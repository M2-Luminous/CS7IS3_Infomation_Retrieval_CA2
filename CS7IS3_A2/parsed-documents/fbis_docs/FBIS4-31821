Jasenka Dudic reports: [Dudic] The opposition's new proposal is: Until further notice, not to put forward candidates for the position of vice president of either chamber of the assembly. We are not insisting on the appointment of the people we have put forward, Budisa said, and added that the opposition insisted on the fact that the 14th session of the Chamber of Counties should be resumed from the moment the vote on the vice president of that chamber was taken which, the opposition believes, was not done in line with the rules of procedure. [Begin Budisa recording] In return for our concession not to put forward any candidates for the position of vice president of either chamber, the opposition demands that principles and the rules of procedure be honored, which means that the 18th session of the Chamber of Deputies should be held in line with the rules of procedure. [end recording] [[Dudic] If the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] accepts this proposal, Budisa said that the opposition will return to the parliament. Failing this, Budisa said that the opposition will resign from its posts in committees and commissions. He also said that the opposition is united, and that not even the Croatian Party of Right will return to the parliament unless all of the opposition does. Budisa also announced a meeting with Jure Radic for today and a meeting between opposition and HDZ negotiators for Thursday [16 June].
