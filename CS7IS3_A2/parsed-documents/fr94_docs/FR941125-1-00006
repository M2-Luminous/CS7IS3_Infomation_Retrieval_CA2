FR941125-1-00006 FR941125-1-00003 7 CFR Part 1032 [DA&hyph;95&hyph;04] Milk in the Southern Illinois-Eastern Missouri Marketing Area; Proposed Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Order AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed suspension of rule. SUMMARY: This document invites written comments on a proposal to suspend a portion of the supply plant shipping requirement of the Southern Illinois-Eastern Missouri Federal milk marketing order (Order 32) for the months of December 1994 and January 1995. The proposal was submitted by Prairie Farms Dairy, Inc., which contends the suspension is necessary to ensure that producers historically associated with Order 32 will continue to have their milk pooled under the order without having to move milk uneconomically. DATES: Comments are due no later than December 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments (two copies) should be filed with the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Nicholas Memoli, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 690&hyph;1932. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule would lessen the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and would tend to ensure that dairy farmers would continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, the suspension of the following provision of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Southern Illinois-Eastern Missouri marketing area is being considered for the period of December 1, 1994, through January 31, 1995: In ยง1032.7(b), the words ``and at least 75 percent of the total producer milk marketed in that 12-month period by such cooperative association was delivered'' and the words ``and physically received at''. All persons who want to submit written data, views or arguments about the proposed suspension should send two copies of their views to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, by the 7th day after publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The period for filing comments is limited to 7 days because a longer period would not provide the time needed to complete the required procedures before the requested suspension is to be effective. All written submissions made pursuant to this notice will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)). Statement of Consideration The proposed action would suspend a portion of the supply plant shipping requirement for a cooperative association that operates a supply plant under Order 32. It would permit a supply plant operated by a cooperative association to qualify as a pool plant if the cooperative shipped 25 percent of the plant's total producer receipts to pool distributing plants during the month and milk from the plant was delivered to a pool distributing plant during each of the immediately preceding months of September through August. It would remove a requirement that the cooperative must have shipped 75 percent of its milk to pool distributing plants during the September through August period. According to Prairie Farms, a dairy farmer cooperative based in Carlinville, Illinois, it owns and operates six fluid milk processing plants and five manufacturing plants. Prairie Farms states that four of the six fluid milk processing plants, as well as a cultured product/supply plant, are regulated under the Southern Illinois-Eastern Missouri Federal milk order. It states that these plants are supplied by its own member dairy farmers and balanced by four cooperative associations, two of which operate supply plants. Prairie Farms indicates that its producer milk for recent months at its plants is about 12 to 14 percent higher than the same period in 1993 from approximately the same number of producers. It states that the increased production from its members_primarily due to improved growing conditions that resulted in an abundant supply of high quality feed_has caused it to reduce purchases from other cooperative associations. As a result, it states that two pool supply plants operated by the cooperative associations barely met the shipping requirements for the month of October. Prairie Farms anticipates that a similar situation will occur in November and expects the problem to worsen in the months of December 1994 and January 1995. Prairie Farms states that the proposed suspension would allow Order 32 supply plants to serve the market, but at a level that should reduce or eliminate the need to make expensive and inefficient movements of milk to meet the supply plant shipping requirement. Accordingly, it may be appropriate to suspend the aforesaid provisions from December 1, 1994, through January 31, 1995. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1032 Milk marketing orders.
