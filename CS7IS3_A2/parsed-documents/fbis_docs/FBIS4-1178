Mr Kriel said in a telephone statement: "Those who believe that they will prevent or disrupt the election by such terrorism have completely missed the bus. "Such mindless acts of terrorism will not stop the birth of democracy in South Africa. "Those responsible for this outrage will achieve nothing except strengthening the determination of the people of South Africa to vote for democracy." The NP urged police to do their utmost to apprehend the perpetrators of "this cowardly deed". "South Africa can not afford this kind of terrorist deed. It is time to ensure stability." The ANC Youth League [ANCYL] also expressed its disgust at the bombing, saying it was a frightening demonstration of the "disrespect for human life in those who are opposed to the changes that must be brought about by the coming election. "ANCYL calls on all the youth and people of South Africa to hold their hands together and move forward to a peaceful, non-racial and democratic country. "This blast is an indication of what will happen to the country if we don't go beyond apartheid," the ANCYL statement said. The ACDP condemned the incident "with the contempt it deserves". "Too many lives have been lost already and we cannot afford to lose more lives," it said. All those commenting extended their condolences to the families of the victims and wished those injured a speedy recovery.
