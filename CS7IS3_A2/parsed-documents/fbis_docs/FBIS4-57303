Why did the number of votes won by MAS in the 1993 elections drop from 86,000 to 38,000 in Caracas and from 59,000 to 22,000 in Miranda? Why did the party lose nearly 200,000 votes between 1988 and 1993? Why did voters who cast their ballots for MAS in 1988 fail to do so this time? Party leader Hector Perez Marcano is asking himself these very questions. The debate will focus on alleged internal corruption, bureaucracy, and the organization's pragmatism, according to Moises Moleiro. The Socialist leader claims that the ambiguity of the Movement Toward Socialism's positions makes it impossible to distinguish between MAS, Democratic Action (AD), and Copei [Social Christian Party]. Moleiro says MAS's lack of political clarity was demonstrated on 4 February 1992, when the orange party yielded to the position taken by Social Democratic and Social Christian leaders defending the discredited government of Carlos Andres Perez. In contrast, Rafael Caldera detected the causes of the military uprising and stated that one could not ask the people to come out in defense of a democracy that is starving the people. Moleiro recalled that following the riot on 4 February, a committee was set up to review the position taken by MAS on such a crucial chapter of history. The Socialist leader expressed his discomfort because that committee pigeonholed the conclusions of the work and thus rejected the debate that the majority of MAS members were anxiously awaiting. Moleiro, who ran for the presidency of MAS in past elections and who now seems inclined to back Victor Hugo D'Paola's candidacy for the office of secretary general of the party, thus touches upon a sore point. He says it is a matter of pure politicking or alliances of convenience between MAS leaders and the representatives of certain economic groups. Without sparing criticisms, he has aimed his fire at Aragua Governor Carlos Tablante, whom he accuses of accepting financial backing from an economic group tainted by scandal. He condemned the fact that in Aragua, the MAS ticket of deputies was headed by Manuel Capriles, brother of Manases Capriles, accused of the murder of Lorena Marquez. He also criticized the fact that Capriles headed the list of deputies from Aragua even though the Office of Comptroller General had issued a report condemning his administration as government secretary. The observations defended by Moleiro, Rafael Thielem, Jorge Valero, and Hector Perez Marcano include one concerning the alleged rigging of the last internal election. Moleiro says, in connection with "the selection of candidates for deputy from the state of Miranda in May of 1990, in Barlovento alone, the winners gathered more votes than those obtained by MAS in the 1993 national elections." To the charge of election rigging, Perez Marcano adds that of improper leadership of the political organization. Moleiro cites this factor as the reason why the party increased its membership by a scant .5 percent in five years. "If things continue in this fashion, it will take MAS 10 more years to grow by one point," the Socialist leader figures. "If everything remains the same, MAS will have to wait a century to increase its votes by 10 percent," he warns. The election stagnation experienced by MAS probably stems from the fact that the party's national leadership has not understood the changes that have occurred in Venezuela in recent years, Perez Marcano points out. "This explains why a party such as Cause R, which was tiny in January 1992, has leapfrogged over MAS, relegating us to fifth place," Moleiro reflects. "The reason why MAS lost its way seems to be its pragmatism and the lack of clarity of the leadership headed by Freddy Munoz, Moleiro claims. In Perez Marcano's opinion, the ambiguity of MAS policies has prevented the organization from capturing voters abandoning AD and Copei. Reformers within MAS say that what is needed is a return to the times when the party was essentially a critic and questioner. This position has gained strength considering that MAS has come to be a government party and that, if it is not careful, it will become paralyzed, no longer a factor in social struggles. This possible danger is a risk that MAS can ill afford because it is a party that proclaims itself to be an alternative force for change, some members of MAS believe. "Without an in-depth debate that faces problems squarely and includes all members, the effects may be irreparable," Moleiro warns. Manuel Isidro Molina, candidate for the office of secretary general of MAS in Caracas, says the party should not shrink from debate and that it would be impardonable if such issues were to be discussed in secret meetings. "Venezuelan society does not deserve to have political parties debate the issues behind closed doors, particularly when the other side is proclaiming that the aberrations and distortions of Venezuelan democracy must be debated democratically." Teodoro Petkoff refuses to debate the crisis in MAS, arguing that these are internal matters that should be discussed privately. Argelia Laya, president of the party, has also condemned the position of those promoting a public discussion of MAS's internal affairs. Speaking from the critical faction, Rafael Thielem blames MAS Secretary General Freddy Munoz for the election stagnation suffered by that political organization. Munoz, who cannot be elected secretary general for more than two terms because the statutes do not permit it, hopes to ascend to the presidency in order to conceal his errors and back a man he trusts for the office, his adversaries say.
