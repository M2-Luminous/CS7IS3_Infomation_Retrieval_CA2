"Judging from Japan's scientific techniques and economic power, it is obvious," the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The source, however, said, "intention and capability are different. Absence of intention (to produce nuclear arms) should be definite." "There is no need for the government to deny nor emphasize (such capability)," the source added. Hata told reporters on Friday that "it's certainly the case that Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons but has not made them." The premier said Japan has abstained from holding such arms in line with its obligations as a nonnuclear power under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai has called Hata's remarks an insufficient explanation of the government's true position. He told reporters that Japan "limits its use of nuclear energy to peaceful purposes, abstains from military utilization and does not endeavor to possess nuclear weapons technology or know-how."
