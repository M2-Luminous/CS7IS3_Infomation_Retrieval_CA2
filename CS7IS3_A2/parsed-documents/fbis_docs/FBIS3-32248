According to eyewitnesses, a television cameraman, while filming Caldera's departure, approached a horse of the Honor Guard escorting the presidential car, spooking the animal and prompting it to rear. According to sources close to the president, the president's chauffeur was forced to brake abruptly to avoid hitting the horse. In the mishap, Caldera received a blow so sharp that it broke his pen into three pieces. The president, who complained about pain in his ribs, will be examined by doctors at the Miraflores Palace, seat of the Venezuelan Government.
