The EMC chief described military relations with Chile as "superb" and emphasized: "They have been enhanced during the past few years thanks to bilateral contacts between politicians from the two countries." In remarks to NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS news agency, Diaz emphasized the visit that Vice Admiral Patricio Arancibia Reyes, the Chilean national defense chief of staff, will pay to Argentina on 18 April. The goal of Arancibia Reyes' visit is to enhance the mutual cooperation system existing between the two countries to face possible natural disasters in border areas. Therefore, Arancibia Reyes will hold various meetings with local military leaders. Hinting at the tension over border disputes that had been marking bilateral relations for many years, Diaz said: "Fortunately, the distrust with which we have been living for a long time has disappeared." Concerning the military side of bilateral relations, Diaz pointed out: "There is a total closeness [acercamiento] that has been enhanced with constant cooperation between the forces." He added that this mutual assistance "has allowed officers from the two nations to take refresher courses." Diaz admitted that Chile "has a slight supremacy over Argentina at the military level." Diaz said this point "does not represent any problem" because "a small imbalance is compensated for by good understanding and good relations." The EMC chief emphasized that for the cooperation tasks that will be discussed during the meetings with the Chilean military officer, "Argentina will contribute with all the experience it has gained during the peace missions carried out throughout the world within the UN framework." In this regard, Diaz added that the Argentine Armed Forces "have gained worldwide prestige thanks to these missions in which their high level of professional training was demonstr?ed." Diaz later emphashat in the entire South American region there is a "total balance of forces," for which reason "peace in the area is guaranteed and a possible crisis is not being hinted at." In this regard, Diaz stressed that relations with all the [South American] countries "are very good," especially with Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela, with all of them the exchange of know-how has been increased. Diaz said Mercosur [Common Market of the South]'s formation "has revitalized joint actions by the armies" of the countries forming it. The general also explained that military relations with the United States "will be enhanced this year within the assistance program" and announced that Argentina "will receive 14 helicopters that will be assigned to the Army." Diaz added: "We also have scheduled a visit this year by General McCaffrey, the commander of the U.S. Southern Command headquartered in Panama; and a meeting with General John Shalikashvili, the U.S. Armed Forces joint chief of staff." Diaz later ruled out the possibility of joining NATO because this organization does not accept the participation of countries far from the Northern Hemisphere. Nevertheless, he guaranteed that Argentina would receive communications and military doctrine technology. In conclusion, the EMC chief discussed the exercises that will be carried out this year to face the situations arising from natural disasters like floods, fires, and earthquakes. In this regard, Diaz, who is responsible for these exercises, pointed out that in this field, "a large-scale specific exercise will be carried out with the participation of the three branches, an exercise that will be prepared by the 5th Army Corps, headquartered in the city of Bahia Blanca."
