The reshuffle affects in particular diplomats who come from southern Yemen and those who have close links with the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], one of the two parties to the Yemeni political crisis. The other party to the crisis is the General People's Congress [GPC]. The most notable feature of this reshuffle is the return of diplomats "who do not enjoy Sanaa's trust" to Yemen. A source close to the YSP rejected this reshuffle, pointing out that a number of embassies have not received their expenses for many months, in order to force YSP diplomats to return. The source warned that, if these embassies do not receive their allowances, Aden will allocate to them allowances that guarantee the continuation of their work, lest Yemeni diplomacy become a partisan tool in the hands of the GPC. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Yemeni embassies run by a southerner occupying the ambassador post usually has at least one northerner on whom Sanaa relies in running most affairs and contacts, while the head of the diplomatic mission remains just a symbol. A well-informed source has said that the recent diplomatic reshuffle is a reaction to the crisis caused by Muhammad Sharaf, Yemeni charge d'affaires in Warsaw, who provoked a big clamor when he revealed a secret arms deal which the Economic Military Establishment had concluded with Poland for the northern military command. He refused to issue entry visas for Polish arms companies' officials to enable them to visit Sanaa and complete the negotiations concerning the deal. It is worth mentioning that the Yemeni Foreign Ministry granted some Polish officials visas upon their arrival at Sanaa airport. Upon his arrival in Warsaw last Sunday, Fu'ad Sawwaf Sivjik [as transliterated], sales director of the Polish company Cenzin, said that he had signed a contract worth tens of millions of dollars to supply the Yemeni Defense Ministry with arms, ammunition, and equipment.
