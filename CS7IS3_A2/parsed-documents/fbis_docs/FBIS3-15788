Podmarkov said that this amount is incompatible with the total amount of debt exceeding a trillion roubles by now, but shows that Ukrainian consumers make efforts to repay their debts. Options for the full repayment of Ukraine's debt will be discussed on Thursday with Ukrainian representatives, Podmarkov said. The Ukrainian delegation which will negotiate the issue is expected to arrive late on Wednesday.
