"This is neither a landslide nor a political shift," CSU Chairman Theo Waigel said on Monday before a meeting of his party's Executive Committee in Munich. Minister President Edmund Stoiber spoke of a "pretty middling result." Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen, on the other hand, claimed that the CSU had suffered a serious defeat: "The voters have given the CSU strong slaps in the face." Waigel assessed the average turnout of 60 to 70 percent as "good to very good." This shows that one cannot speak at all of the citizens' abstinence at the polls if such efforts are made, he said. The result of the mayoral elections in Bamberg was considered to be the biggest surprise of the election, in which about 400,000 of the approximately 8.6 million people eligible to vote in the Free State were involved. In Bamberg there will be a run-off ballot without Rudolf Grafberger, the current mayor and CSU candidate. The SPD mayors, on the other hand, held their positions in the towns of Bayreuth, Hof/Saale, Rothenburg/Tauber, as well as Aschaffenburg in Franken. In addition to Bamberg, a run-off election for mayor is necessary in Eichstaett, Freising, and Landsberg/Lech in Upper Bavaria, as well as in Lindau in Swabia. The local council elections in the Lower Franken district of Rhoen-Grabfeld as well as in the Upper Bavarian district of Ebersberg were won by the CSU. In Bamberg, the CSU had expected a better result, Waigel said. The decision will now be made on 20 March between Herbert Lauer of the Supraparty Association of Voters and Andreas Starke of the SPD. Waigel called for support for Lauer as the CSU's originally desired candidate at the run-off ballot. Stoiber warned against seeing local elections as a barometer of the mood for Landtag or Bundestag elections. The decisions are too much related to specific individuals, and party affiliation plays only a small role. Verheugen spoke of a "political earthquake." For his party the "brilliant results" achieved in the towns and communities, which are worried about jobs, are a confirmation of its policy. In the view of Bavaria's Greens' leader Gerald Haefner, the CSU is clearly losing its grass roots. The election result of Sunday is a "gratifying sign that the CSU's power is no longer God-given." The good results achieved by his party in several communities show that many people no longer see ecology and the economy as contradictions, Haefner stated.
