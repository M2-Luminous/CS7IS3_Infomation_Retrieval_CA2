The Assembly, as designed by its founders, will bring together ethnic organizations, ethnic-cultural associations, parties, movements, and individuals, after which it will coordinate their actions "in the area of ethnic relations, political and socioeconomic transformations" and will establish "interethnic communication in civilized forms" upon defining "the common interests of the peoples of the Russian Federation." The all-Russian assembly was convened at the initiative of the Assembly of the North Caucasus Democratic Forces under general secretary Shmidt Dzoblayev, which has already been operating as part of the Russian Democratic Reform Movement [RDRM]. According to the organizing committee, the initiative was supported by 64 regions. Only 43 credentials, however, were handed at the constituent congress: not all regional representatives could put aside their business to make a trip to Moscow. [passage omitted] The congress was attended by Mr. Popov [not further identified], who in his salutary address on behalf of the RDRM at the very beginning wished the Assembly successful work, and then left the hall. There were no more well-known politicians at the congress, nor was there any particular need for their presence because the Assembly, Shmidt Dzoblayev said, was created "from the bottom up" and "does not rush to show its sympathies for one party or another." Recognizing the protection of individual rights as the new movement's priority, the founding delegates chartered the vectors of its political and economic strategy as they envisioned a possible way "toward interethnic accord through the revival of national honor and dignity." Pointing out that the current interethnic conflicts are in reality "conflicts between regional and federal authorities over the distribution of property," the delegates set their sights on a "constitutional federation," in which "national-territorial entities will not divide citizens into `indigenous' and `non-indigenous,' and the federal authorities will be entitled to "remove from office a regional chief if he fails to take measures to stop ethnic discrimination." If this does not help, "oxygen should be cut off to the regions by imposing economic sanctions." The Assembly's economic program has so far been limited to the recognition of "the need for the state regulation of the economy" and will be definitively outlined sometime toward next winter at the movement's first congress. The hours-long discussion of the plans resulted in the adoption of a program statement describing regional problems "as a matter of particular concern for the authorities and the public," and also amendments and additions to the charter. In conclusion, the Assembly founders elected a political council -- the ruling body between congresses, which will subsequently elect from its members a bureau that will govern the organization between meetings of the political council. The constituent congress also elected an executive committee and an auditing commission. Shmidt Dzoblayev was unanimously elected general secretary of yet another assembly.
