The industrialists believe the former governor of the Bank of Italy should remain in office. They do not see the economy recovering before 1995 and fear there will be massive layoffs. The industrialists have finally decided that the best option is to stick with Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. The head of government may not be the authentic magician of economic recovery that some had expected, but he has succeeded in achieving more than one concrete result. And after all, there is no alternative. The year 1994, in fact, will also be a gloomy year. The production system will function at a minimum level, and in the meantime, unemployment will continue to flourish. In this context, the helm of Italy, Inc., should be entrusted to safe hands. It is therefore not advisable to run risks, as for example by backing a Silvio Berlusconi who vacillates between the neofascists of Gianfranco Fini and the Lega troops of Umberto Bossi. The results of the L'ESPRESSO poll that interviewed half of the Confindustria assembly (77 out of 157 members of the council) demonstrate that the Italian entrepreneurs have a specific objective and are marching in close formation to attain it. Here, point by point, are the names of the men on whom the industrialists have decided to put their money, what the industrialists' predictions are for 1994, and what solution they are proposing for emerging from the tunnel of the recession. Ciampi for President [preceding words in English] After passing through a minor crisis of credibility, the former governor of the Bank of Italy is beginning to regain support in the business community. When he was sworn in at Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister], he was greeted with enthusiasm: a poll L'ESPRESSO conducted in May 1993 gave him--on faith--a 7.0 approval rating. A slow decline then began, and in the space of two months his rating dropped to 6.6, leveling off at 6.4 in September. This trend has now been reversed. The passage of the budget bill on schedule, and the success obtained by the sale of the Italian Credit Bank (after the sale, 52 percent of the industrialists said they were convinced that the privatizations will actually be carried out) caused Ciampi's rating to begin slowly to rise again, to 6.6. And a majority (more than 52 percent) are asking him--in a loud voice--to remain at Palazzo Chigi. "The government has perhaps lacked decision-making initiative to some extent," Giancarlo Lombardi, a textile manufacturer and respected member of the Confindustria council, maintains, "but you have to give the prime minister credit for keeping the promises he made and for performing with a certain style." Walter Mandelli, the former vice president of the entrepreneurs, agrees. "The head of government and his cabinet," he says, "have given proof of their good faith by holding fast to an economic policy line that is widely shared." Even Ernesto Gismondi, vice president of CNEL [National Council for Economy and Labor], is in favor of giving him a passing grade. "In the temporary phase that began with the earthquake caused by the kickback scandal," he says, "Ciampi is successfully performing the function of administrator of a company that is in receivership." A better job can be done: This is the slogan of his unconditional critics who continue to be represented in the Confindustria assembly. "The former governor of the Bank of Italy has not measured up to expectations," explains Confindustria council member Paolo Passanti, who is associated with the organization's research center. "He has not been sufficiently courageous in making decisions on the more important questions, as for example the problem of how to contain the cost of money and combat unemployment." In any case, the financial statement for the past three months also shows a favorable balance for Ciampi. Specifically, in the sample polled by L'ESPRESSO, those who say they are disappointed by the performance of the former governor of the Bank of Italy dropped to 32 percent from the 38 percent recorded in September, while those who judge him to be more capable than they could have anticipated rose during the same period to 14.5 percent from 9 percent. Professor: You Flunked Four passing grades and two failing grades: Two-thirds of the team of economic ministers got a passing grade from the industrialists who gave the exam. Judged to be the most capable was Treasury Minister Piero Barucci, who was largely credited with getting the privatizations under way (he scored a 6.3). He shared the awards platform, however, with Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa and Industry Minister Paolo Savona, each with a 6.2. Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta also passed, albeit by the skin of his teeth (with a 6.0). Thumbs down, however, on the two Socialist ministers, Franco Gallo (Finance) and Gino Giugni (Labor). As far as the industrialists are concerned, these two can stay at home permanently. Go Back, Sir If Ciampi is the best player on the field, the industrialists' backup is named Mario Segni. But because the referendum leader could not decide which side to take or with whom to ally himself, he began to lose support: in June 1992, 49 percent of the entrepreneurs wanted him in Palazzo Chigi, whereas his support has now been reduced to a more modest 25.7 percent. After Ciampi and Segni, there is a void. The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], to be sure, is no longer a problem. Almost three out of four entrepreneurs insist that they would not be frightened if it were installed in the control room. For example, Lombardi maintains that "despite some contradictions, a significant part of the PDS has opted for a pro-market policy, and if it were to be invested with the responsibilities of government, it would be constrained to do everything possible to keep its promises." But even if the former Communist Party no longer causes fear, there is little confidence in the ability of its leadership [preceding word in English] to lead: in the poll, for example, PDS Secretary Achille Occhetto received not a single vote for prime minister, and only three out of 100 industrialists indicated that they were fans of Chamber of Deputies President Giorgio Napolitano. The doors are also barred against Silvio Berlusconi. When in recent weeks he announced that he was prepared to sacrifice himself and take the field personally to halt the advance of the left, His TV Eminence [pun on Italian word emittenza] was, as usual, outspoken: "I want the leaders of industry, he said." But they--the entrepreneurs--do not appear to be as eager. Indeed, the poll results speak quite frankly; they say that 93 percent of the Confindustria assembly has no intention whatsoever of backing the boss of Fininvest. Not only do they not intend to support the gentleman from Arcore, but they do not even want him as the head of government, inasmuch as among his own colleagues, "Burlesquoni"--as the authoritative ECONOMIST renamed him in a headline--garnered only a handful of votes. "Let us rise up and join hands," says Forza Italia, the party song of his new party. If it were to be played in the hall where Confindustria's council meets, 93 entrepreneurs out of 100 would remain seated comfortably in their armchairs. In short, there would be too few to play ring-around-the-rosey. Things Look Bad From Here Whether it be Ciampi or Segni, what is wanted is an authoritative leader. The fact is that in 1994 we will need binoculars to see the economic recovery ahead. The forecasts developed by Confindustria's top leadership and presented on Tuesday, 14 December, speak of a 1.6 percent growth of the GNP, sufficient to make it possible basically to maintain employment levels and, according to associates of Confindustria President Luigi Abete, the year should end with a loss of only 20,000 jobs, equal to less than 0.1 percent. The rank and file of the entrepreneurs, however, do not put much stock in these estimates. "Abete and his people have to appear to be optimistic," Enzo Giustino, president of the Campania industrialists, explains, "because if they told how things really are, they would wind up scaring the bankers to death and cause the stock market to crash." The picture painted by the 77 industrialists polled by L'ESPRESSO was, therefore, a darker one, although they acknowledged that the worst may have passed. In September, almost 90 percent of the companies said they had an assured supply of work for only the six ensuing months, whereas today that figure has dropped to 75 percent. They are unwilling to bet so much as half a lira that a substantial recovery will take place in 1994. In fact, six out of ten entrepreneurs say that Italy, Inc., will have a growth rate next year of no more than 1 percent. On the other hand, if the recovery is delayed, the hemorrhage of jobs will continue. On this front, the optimism of the Confindustria leadership is truly at odds with the forecasts of its rank and file: two out of three of those polled said they are sure that the personnel of their companies will suffer a new and heavy blow. How To Stay Afloat The Italian industrialists' prescription for getting through 1994 intact--and for duly keeping their appointment with economic recovery--consists of only a few points. On the fiscal front, the entrepreneurs are calling for a decisive crackdown on those categories that have always been suspected of being involved most heavily in the practice of tax evasion: a list headed by professionals, followed closely by merchants and artisans. However, the proposal that all unearned income be included on "Form 740"--so that all such income would be taxed on a progressive basis--is also gaining support: 48 percent of the sample said they now favored this option, probably out of a conviction that the stock exchange would have everything to gain from a reform of this type. More taxes, but also less spending. According to the industrialists, the government's axe should come down hard on the public sector and not spare either public health, pensions, education, or--why not?--the Armed Forces. It is a veritable declaration of war.
