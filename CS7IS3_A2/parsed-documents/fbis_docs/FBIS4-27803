FBIS4-27803 "dreas107_a_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan White Paper on Cooperation With Asian Nations White Paper on Cooperation With Asian Nations OW0306094494 Tokyo KYODO in English 0815 GMT 3 Jun 94 OW0306094494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan should step up its economic cooperation to other Asian countries as a way to help revitalize the global economy, the fiscal 1994 white paper on economic cooperation released Friday [3 June] said. Japan has a responsibility to activate the world economy by supporting ongoing self-help efforts among Asian economies to maintain and expand their "growth dynamism," said the annual report. To that aim, an international division of roles needs to be promoted on the investment and trade fronts, the white paper said, calling for Japan to expand direct investment in and imports from Asia. The white paper, prepared by the International Trade and Industry Ministry, described the newly industrializing economies (NIES) in Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as "the growth center for world economic development." "Such a dynamism in the areas has resulted from an effective use of market mechanism and an increased linkage with the rest of the world in trade and investment," said the white paper. This year's white paper paid particular attention to China, Vietnam and India, devoting much space to analyzing various problems involved in economic reform efforts in these countries. China, touted as having the biggest growth potential in the world, scored a significant real economic growth of a 13.4 percent in 1993 thanks to the increased use of market mechanism. But the paper cited the need for infrastructure improvement in the country, especially in the inland area, in order to correct its economic gap with the rapidly growing coastal area. The white paper said Vietnam should effectively use aid funds extended by Japan and other countries for improvement in economic infrastructure, and lagging legal and administrative systems. The Vietnamese Government also needs to make further efforts in placing economically inefficient state-owned corporations into private management, it said. As for India, the white paper said its legal system has been upgraded under the ongoing reform program. But further efforts, particularly deregulation, need to be done in financial and farm sectors, it said. The paper also sees the need for India to improve its infrastructure in utilities, traffic systems and telecommunications networks. These efforts would help rectify an inadequate allocation of wealth among the Indian people, eventually contributing to higher productivity, the white paper said. Japan should formulate economic cooperation programs for other Asian countries while clarifying problems these countries are facing domestically, it said. Assistance to them also should be made in a manner that ensures harmonization with global trade accords recently concluded under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, the paper said. The paper noted that Japan's economic assistance in 1992 decreased 36.3 percent to 15,944 million dollars, with a smooth growth in official development assistance (ODA) more than offset by a substantial drop in private-sector aid. Japan's ODA for the year increased 2.7 percent to 11,332 million dollars. The sum was the largest in the world, accounting for 18.5 percent of the global ODA.
