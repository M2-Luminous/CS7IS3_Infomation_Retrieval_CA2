Just before the official suspension of constitutional rights, the president had said "the situation in several cities was no longer bearable." Peasant and Indian demonstrations began on 13 June, right after President Duran Ballen signed the new land law into effect. The demonstrators erected roadblocks on many of the countries roads and highways, looted businesses in several cities, and clashed with authorities resulting in at least three Indians dead and a dozen wounded. During a meeting between Duran Ballen and Conaie leaders on Monday, the president said he would not repeal the law. Instead he proposed the formation of a joint commission to reform the law and to draw up the regulations that will govern its enforcement. The Indians, who make up about 30 to 50 percent of the country's total population of 10 million, finally rejected the proposals.
