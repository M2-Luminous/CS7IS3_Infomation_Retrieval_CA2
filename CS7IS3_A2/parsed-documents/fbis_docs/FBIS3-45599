At the meeting, Public Security Minister Tao Siju conveyed central leading cadres' important instructions on enhancing work on public security and politics and law. Vice Public Security Minister Tian Qiyu delivered a report on the situation confronting the current public security work and on future tasks. Last year, thanks to the efforts of all, various levels of public security organs accomplished well their duty of maintaining stability, of cracking down on enemies, of punishing criminals, and of protecting the people. In January-November period last year, the nation's public security organs cracked over 1.04 million of various criminal cases; recovered 4.8 billion yuan worth of money and goods; scored remarkable results from extensively launching the drive to crack down on criminal gangs, on hunting down fugitives, and on solving major cases; successfully investigated into and handled a large number of major economic fraudulent cases; and helped the state prevent economic losses worth $130 million, or 400 million yuan. In analyzing the current situation of social order, participants at the meeting were of the view that the social order at present is normal and that the normal social order has produced a reassuring effect on reform, opening, and on developing the economy. However, the number of criminal cases still shows a rising trend, particularly the number of major and serious cases. Social order in some regions is not good; criminals run rampant; and the masses lack a sense of security. Participants at the meeting called for continuously upholding the policy of "severe crackdown on crimes" and for continuously exerting utmost efforts to stem the rising momentum of criminal cases. They called for concentrating efforts on "cracking major cases, cracking down on criminal gangs, hunting down fugitives, working out measures suited to local conditions, launching special campaigns, and carrying out special management over social order. As in regions where the security problem is serious, it is necessary to organize forces and to carry out unified action with the main efforts concentrated on cracking down on homicides, robberies, thefts, and organized crimes. In addition, special attention should be paid to cracking down on evil forces in cities and rural areas and to resolutely crack down on fraudulent economic activities of a criminal nature. Participants at the meeting pointed out the current need to stress raising crime-investigation and crime-cracking levels; to crack more criminal cases; to crack major cases; to strictly enforce the law; to severely and quickly punish criminal elements by fully employing existing legal weapons; to resolutely rectify acts of imposing fines instead of meting out prison terms, of bending the law for the benefit of relatives or friends, and of downplaying the seriousness of cases. Participants at the meeting were also of the view that since this year will witness the introduction of the most reform measures over the past decade, there will be some issues that will impact social stability. Properly handling various matters arising out of the contradictions among the people is a major and pressing theme for public security organs under the new situation to correctly handle the problems of contradictions among the people. It is necessary for public security organs to do a good job of explaining state policy among the people in active coordination with relevant departments, help timely solve problems brought out by the masses that should and can be solved, and help them reduce contradictions. At the same time it is necessary to resolutely crack down on hostile elements bent on beating, smashing, and robbing, as well as those instigating contradictions among the people. Tian Qiyu said it is necessary to get actively involved in comprehensive management of social order; to enhance various preventive measures; to strengthen building of public security stations, in particular those in rural areas; to establish healthy grassroots organizations involved in protecting social order and to make sure that these organizations fulfill their role of protecting social order. Tian Qiyu called for an active studying and exploration of methods to control transient population. He proposed reorganizing, consolidating, and strengthening crime-prevention and social order management teams and to bring into play their important roles of maintaining social order. It is necessary to vigorously launch the "small security zone" activities, to do a good job in assisting and educating persons who have been released from prison after serving their terms and persons who have been released from reform-through-labor institutions; and to actively explore new ways to enhance security in enterprises under the new situation. More and effective efforts should be made in the work of eliminating evil phenomena in society. Tian Qiyu stressed the need to further carry out the anticorruption struggle. He said that at present, particular attention should be paid to enhancing education among all the public security cadres and personnel on the purpose of the anticorruption struggle, on moral standards, on the mass line, on enhancing the mass concept, on firmly establishing the idea of doing all for the people and of relying on the people while forging closer ties between the police and the people. Finally, he called for continuing on-the-job training activities in a down-to-earth manner and for striving to raise the professional and law enforcement levels of the broad mass of public security cadres and personnel.
