The two leaders held talks centerd on bilateral relations between Uganda and Austria. Speaking to the press after the talks, President Klestil said that, although Austrian foreign policy is centered on Europe, President Museveni's official visit to his country is a proof that Uganda took a central place in Austrian relations with Africa. President Museveni on his part said he is pleased that Austria is assisting Uganda in the rehabilitation of the water system in Kampala and hospitals around the country. He emphasized that trade and investment, rather than aid for Uganda, are more durable and sustainable forms of cooperation between the two countries, and in this regard looks forward to increased Austrian collaboration, which he said will be centerd on business as well as other investment, to top up the abundant potential the country has.
