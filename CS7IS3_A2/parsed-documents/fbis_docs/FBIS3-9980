This is a very sensitive issue, particularly in the international context. [words indistinct] In my opinion, the Palmerola base resulted from an military agreement [words indistinct] It is not a formal treaty; it was not submitted to the National Congress. Based on this agreement, [words indistinct] it was theoretically established that it was a [words indistinct] base. The Cold War has ended. What happens to this installation? Can it be utilized -- with international cooperation -- for the benefit of the Honduran people and the United States? Can it be used to combat such a threatening and damaging scourge as drug trafficking? Can it be used for [words indistinct] ecology, or to help control disease, or to improve the transfer of technology in the agriculture sector, or to help in the health sector? All of this will have to be discussed in due time at the National Congress. The National Congress will decide this. I will even go further. We could ask the people of Comayagua, who are directly affected, what they think about the presence of the installation there. I strenuously opposed war activities there, as they only bring us destruction. [passage omitted] We are talking about privatization in general, not about one particular company. The simplest example would be [words indistinct]. This was taboo some time ago, one could not talk about this. I am very happy that currently we can talk about the privatization of a hotel or of any other institution. The privatization issue is neither good or bad in itself. It all depends on what is being privatized and how it is being privatized as this can lead to widespread corruption or it can serve to help Honduras' economic independence. In this way, we would not have to face situations arising from the payment of the foreign debt. A total of 43 percent of the Honduran budget is used to pay the foreign debt. If we add what goes to pay bureaucracy to this, we are facing a truly dramatic situation. Some institutions have told me that almost 90 percent of their budget is used to pay for administration. After that, what is left for the institution's goals? What I want to tell you is that we have not discussed [word indistinct] appears in the press; we have not started to discuss this. Nevertheless, we have initiated discussions on Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise]. This has an even more profound effect on Honduran economy. [Unidentified reporter] On the Palmerola issue, can you give us more details. Will your government send the foreign troops, the American troops, deployed there away, or are they going to stay? [Reina] [words indistinct] is still pending, but I can give you some hints. I believe we should see if it is good for Honduras -- taking into account international cooperation -- to maintain the installations. We must take into account 1) this is a Honduran base; 2) the arguments for and against this installation will be discussed at the National Congress, and 3) the people must be directly asked what is their opinion on this matter. The international context changed from a Cold War to an agenda of international cooperation. As far as Hondutel is concerned, there are two firm proposals. One is from [name indistinct], which was published in the press. I believe it is very attractive and very [word indistinct] proposal. Why this? Well, because there is a way to take advantage of these [words indistinct] and to become more efficient as an institution. [Reporter] Have the Armed Forces begun the debate on privatization? [Reina] This all depends on whether we are convinced it is good for Honduras. In any case, I have firmly committed that if it is done it will be because it is good for Honduras, its economy, and the future of its people. It will be done with the utmost honesty, [words indistinct], controlled, reviewed, supervised, so there is not the slightest doubt of a dirty deal behind the privatization. [passage omitted] What we have to do is present a proposal and discuss it with the Armed forces and the other institutions. This proposal has three options: 1) there will be no more forced recruitment; 2) the Armed Forces has a proposal on the selection of members of this armed institution; and 3) our proposal that recruitment be on a volunteer- educational basis. This can be included and should be included in our proposal to the legislative assembly. As far as Palmerola is concerned, within the context of the Cold War, it is a human tragedy that has lasted for almost half a century, from 1945 post war, to 1989, 1990, 1991, depending on the region where world tensions were being eliminated. There are people who still have the Cold War mind-set; they would like those tensions and ideological confrontations to return. This must be discussed in depth and light must be shed on the Palmerola issue. This is the result of extending an agreement not a treaty. The difference between an agreement and a treaty, for those who are not lawyers, is that an agreement does not have to be submitted to Congress while a treaty needs to be submitted to Congress. Everything relating to military matters should be submitted to Congress. During that time, however, we were involved in a national security situation. Those were very difficult times for Honduras, the hemisphere, and humanity. There was an arms race going on that was going to become the War of the Galaxy. That is why we firmly opposed this because Honduras was going to be the scene of a world war. Having overcome this, the discussion must center on whether international cooperation and collaboration can help us accomplish the points of the new agenda. What are these points? Human rights, ecology, drug trafficking, fighting poverty, and the improvement of justice. This is what we must discuss. We must no longer talk about who is or is not a communist, which was a common topic within the context of the Cold War. If this can be done and be discussed in-depth at Congress, the decision regarding such installations will come from here. [passage omitted] [Reporter Diaz] [words indistinct] to improve the country's economic situation by reducing the fiscal deficit. Aside from the talks on the privatization of some enterprises and taking into account that 90 percent of the budget of different institutions is used to pay personnel, could your administration -- as other governments have promised to do many times -- reduce state bureaucracy? [Reina] Miss Edith Diaz, Mr. Jaime Rosenthal said in his letter issued the day before yesterday that the problem is not the fiscal deficit per se, which is very appropriate. He said the problem is the deficit with the balance of payments, namely the commercial balance. He indicated that we do not export enough; we import more than we export, thereby incurring deficits. Consequently, we must produce more to be able to export more. I think he is saying the right thing. But your question centers more on how and when the fiscal deficit will be cut. When we talk about Hondutel, it is precisely for that purpose. Petrodollars came and these countries got irresponsibly into debt. Now 43 percent of the budget goes to pay this debt, while another large percentage is used to pay state employees. There is no money left for the development of the country. How can we advance like this? Where did the borrowed money go to? How was it spent? How was it invested? To reduce state bureaucracy, one must know how we received the country in January 1994 and take measures to cleanse the economy. This begins by fighting corruption. To reduce the government, the problem is sometimes how to compensate people employed by the government. For example, these people's salaries were increased so they would have larger benefits. I have asked if we must eliminate excess personnel? I was told yes, but we must pay so many millions in severance pay. This is a straitjacket for the government. What do we do? Do we break the law and not compensate them? Do we go further into debt to pay the compensations? Do we leave officials in office who do not have any duties? Do not go into politics because this is very difficult. It is not easy to resolve these problems, but we are going to face them. We must overcome... [pauses] because these situations can be overcome. A government team with good intentions, courage, determination, a team of the best men can do so. [passage omitted]
