We stressed that he not only stands for change but that he also represents a bill on the future. "History will show whether it will be honored, and whether it is covered." Earlier than expected it has become clear that the bill was drawn on an uncovered account. "The Europeans may remain skeptical for the time being," the editorial concluded at the time. According to the U.S. media, Bill Clinton simply does not understand what is going on in the Balkans, particularly in Bosnia. For him foreign policy is at best an aspect of domestic policy, which has turned out to be difficult enough for him. Thus, foreign policy is a nuisance for the U.S. President. The political course of the current Administration reflects this fact. If Chancellor Franz Vranitzky meets with Bill Clinton today, he can claim to represent a small country but one that is familiar with the geographic, geopolitical, and historic background to the situation in Bosnia and Serbia. Thus, Vranitzky can be something like a teacher. He need not act as a supplicant but can walk with his head up. Quite the contrary, it would be advisable for the President to modify an American motto: "When the Austrians talk, we listen." This is not megalomania but realism. Just like Clinton, Vranitzky knows that the United Nations is currently going through its worst crisis since its founding, as Foreign Minister Alois Mock put it pertinently. It has completely lost credibility, and the world body does just as the Serbs please. At the same time, NATO and the United States have also lost everything that was still left of its superpower status. The hesitation of the United States to use its military strength to defend the alleged ideals of freedom, human dignity, human rights, and self-determination is to blame for that. Vranitzky will have to explain to the President today and to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali tomorrow that only comprehensive and determined air strikes can prevent the Serbs from creating a new empire at the costs of the neighboring peoples. He will also have to make it clear to the White House that the West should by no means again make the mistake it committed between 1933 and 1939. If there had been military intervention after the occupation of the Rhineland by the Germans, World War II would probably never have happened. Bill Clinton still believes that a negotiated solution in the Balkans is still possible. At least until yesterday he was not willing to accept more than half-hearted selective air strikes that are doomed to failure from the very beginning. Vranitzky will have to convince officials in Washington that a hesitant attitude is not useful. Moreover, he will also have to warn them against an all too gullible attitude vis-a-vis the Russians. Even though Moscow's special envoy Churkin is apparently desperate because of the uncompromising position of the Serbs, the Russians know that, because of Washington's weakness, they have again become a second major partner in the world political game from which they seemed excluded until recently. In other words: Moscow believes that it can play a major role again -- supported by a Washington that proudly broadcast a short time ago that it is the only remaining superpower. Only when all these lessons are understood will Vranitzky be able to present his justified proposal to make Vienna the center of Bosnia's reconstruction. First he should try to find out whether Washington is really ready to accept as partners the men whom it placed on the list of war criminals among great approval a short time ago. Yet this may be the U.S. interpretation of realpolitik.
