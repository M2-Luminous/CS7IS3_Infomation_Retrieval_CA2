FBIS4-54716 "dreeu086__a94009" FBIS-EEU-94-086-A Daily Report 3 May 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Klaus Comments on Government Changes Klaus Comments on Government Changes AU0405072394 Prague CTK in English 1833 GMT 3 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0405072394 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, May 3 (CTK) -- Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Czech Radio today that changes in the Czech Government were only natural and their number was not excessive as compared with stabilized West European states. He was commenting on Petr Pitha's resignation as education minister last Wednesday and his replacement by Ivan Pilip yesterday. Both are members of the Christian Democratic Party (KDS). Klaus said that health reasons were really behind Pitha's resignation. Pitha is the third minister to leave the present government which emerged from the June 1992 elections. The other leavers were Health Minister Petr Lom (Civic Democratic Party, ODS) and Culture Minister Jindrich Kabat (Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, KDU-CSL). Both were criticized for their performance as ministers. Asked whether the government was considering the dismissal of Tomas Jezek, chairman of the National Property Fund (FNM), and whether this step would harm coupon privatization as indicated by some dailies, Klaus said: "The idea that coupon privatization could be threatened by the dismissal of one person belongs in the category of jokes." "Tomas Jezek's future in this or another post is by no means connected with coupon privatization," Klaus stressed. Speculations about the dismissal or resignation of Jezek (Civic Democratic Alliance, ODA) appeared especially in connection with the last scandals accompanying the sales of the shares of some enterprises held by the FNM. Klaus also dismissed speculations that he or the government coalition would have discussed Jezek's firing as "simply erroneous." He added that he himself learnt only from the press that a majority of the members of the FNM governing body were starting to consider Jezek's dismissal. On Saturday the left-orientated daily RUDE PRAVO, referring to an unnamed "coalition source", wrote that Klaus, together with Deputy Premier Jan Kalvoda (ODA) and Privatization Minister Jiri Skalicky (ODA) had decided on Thursday not to dismiss Jezek for the time being. According to the paper, the dismissal was demanded by six out of the nine members of the FNM governing body, chaired by Skalicky.
