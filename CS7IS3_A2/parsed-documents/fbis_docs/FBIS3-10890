It is known that the human rights issue has always been taboo for our governments, and it is also known that the State Department is forced by law to send to the U.S. Congress a report on the human rights situation in the entire world. Any reference to Brazil in that report is received in Brasilia with outrage even, and the executive branch does not seem to understand that the human rights issue is a universal concern. Although no one expected it, a top U.S. Government official touched on this issue in rude language during a meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission. But this is what happened in Vienna last week. We were described as a country where "street children go around in the garbage looking for food and are hunted for sport." Vivian Derryck went even further, saying "that negligence is too close to savagery to be called anything else." During the Collor administration, the Foreign Ministry feared the problem of children and human rights would allow a broad international campaign against Brazil like the campaign carried out against the Medici administration in relation to the massacre of Indians. Unfortunately, by the inertia of the government and the indifference of broad sectors of society, there are still cases that, taken out of context, allow speeches like Mrs. Derryck's to be delivered to audiences that receive them well despite the prompt and harsh answers from the Brazilian representatives. Even now in Londrina there was an ad published in a newspaper inciting the killing of minors involved in holdups. The psychopathy of the ones who ran the ad is not taken into account by the people in the nongovernmental organizations and the U.S. diplomatic corps, which writes the human rights report. In fact, this is similar to the "hunted for sport" referred to in the Candelaria massacre. When in international meetings the real efforts made by nongovernmental civilian organizations, different churches, and officials of some states to improve the situation of children are ignored, it is natural for the federal government to feel justly hurt by the abuse typical of student body elections, which can only be replied to by denying the moral authority of the U.S. Government to make this type of abuse. Unfortunately, however, this is the situation we will have to live with for many years. Mainly because the increase of juvenile crime in association with the economic crisis, unemployment, and the indifference to moral values are making people insensible and inclined to deal with this problem in the simplistic manner, and many times with the complicity of officials who are blind to everything.
