According to materials submitted to the National Assembly by the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy, the government plans to widen the scope of the move into China after forming the foundation through technological trainings on and advisory support in building and operating nuclear power plants, aiming at the ultimate goal of plant exports to China. To achieve this goal, the government has decided to hasten the conclusion of an ROK-PRC nuclear energy treaty, which is now being negotiated, and as well as make efforts to conclude the "ROK-PRC Industrial Cooperation Treaty," which will practically back domestic companies' move into building nuclear power plants in China, before the end of this year. The government also plans to unify channels for this and make a single one to prevent excessive competition among domestic companies in building nuclear power plants in China and to build a complementary cooperation system. It also decided to seek methods of forming a consortium with foreign professional companies, if necessary. If negotiations with China are being held smoothly, with President Kim Yong-sam's China visit as a momentum, it will become possible to promote this by field, such as plant and system design (The Technology and Atomic Energy Institute of the Korea Electric Power Corporation [KEPOC]), manufacturing of machines and materials (Korea Heavy Industries and private enterprises), operation and maintenance (KEPOC), and construction (private enterprises).
