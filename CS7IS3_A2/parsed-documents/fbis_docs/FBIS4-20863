FBIS4-20863 "jptac003__l94059" JPRS-TAC-94-003-L JPRS Arms Control 22 March 1994 CENTRAL EURASIA UKRAINE Secretary of Defense Perry in Ukraine Secretary of Defense Perry in Ukraine Common Positions Found LD2203174594 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1629 GMT 22 Mar 94 LD2203174594 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky] [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk is satisfied that the defense ministers of Ukraine and USA during recent talks "reached common positions on most issues which today can be resolved," Kravchuk said at a meeting with Pentagon Chief Willian Perry on Monday. Kravchuk also said: "There are issues which cannot be resolved today, but gradually they can be resolved if there is willingness to do so." On the same day the defense ministers of the two countries Vitaly Radetsky and William Perry signed an agreement on additional U.S. aid to Ukraine for the liquidation of nuclear weapons. As Perry told journalists after the signing ceremony, Ukraine will be given an additional $50 million for the dismantling of nuclear arms. In December last year the USA granted $135 million to Ukraine for that purpose. Noting that cooperation between the two countries is very important in the strategical aspect, Perry stressed the particular significance of interaction between the military ministries of Ukraine and the USA. Perry said that an agreement was also reached on "frequent and close" ties between the general headquarters and leaders of the military ministries of the two countries. Radetsky called the fact that with the U.S. and Russian help Ukraine managed to get out of a nuclear stalemate and sign a trilateral Moscow statement on the liquidation of nuclear weapons on its territory "a historic step." He said all obstacles to Ukraine's joining the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons had been eliminated. Radetsky pointed out that developing cooperation between Ukraine and the USA promotes both global and regional security. At a meeting on the same day Perry and Ukrainian Vice-Premier Valery Shamrov decided to charge experts with preparing an agreement or a communique which would reflect a common position of Ukraine and the USA on nuclear disarmament and cooperation in the space and rocket field. Chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary commission on defense and state security issues Valentin Lemish told journalists that probably a bilateral commission will be formed to control the disarmament process in Ukraine.
