It is a decision consistent with the lines of opening to the enormous markets of the Pacific and Indian Ocean countries laid down by the Free Trade Treaty. The fall of the Berlin Wall, the coming together of the two Europes, the end of apartheid in South Africa, the understanding between Jews and Christians in the Vatican and Jerusalem, and the agreements between the Israelis and the PLO -- to cite the most celebrated rapprochements -- have created a world atmosphere of peace and the elimination of barriers which separated people from each other for decades and even centuries. Clinton has decided to end 30 years of confrontations between Hanoi and Washington. This will entail a high political cost for him in view of the wounds which that war inflicted on U.S. society, but he has paid more heed to the unanimous opinion of his advisers, including the military, who had been advising him to lift the embargo, and this shows his repeated concern to serve the cause of peace.
