However, it was still not clear last night whether the opposition as a whole would support the agreement. Speaking after a meeting called by Parliament President Marut Bunnak, Chumphon said agreement had been reached in principle on all 25 proposals put forward by his committee. They agreed that priority should be given to eight amendments: -- To reduce the voting age from 20 to 18. -- To vary the number of MPs in line with the increase in population. -- To reduce the minimum number of candidates a political party must field in general elections to one-fourth of the total number of House of Representatives seats. -- To give House committees more power. -- The leader of the largest opposition party be automatically named opposition leader. -- To allow immediate consideration by the House of motions put forward as a matter of urgency. -- To establish an administration court. -- To reduce the number of senators to one-third of MPs. "I am pleased that changes to the Constitution will be made," Chumphon said. Chat Phatthana Party Secretary-General Prachuap Chaiyasan said it was possible to amend the eight points, but he could not give a guarantee. Yesterday's meeting had made progress, but whether the changes would be passed depended on a compromise. Prachuap also asked the government to call a special House session to deliberate the amendments. Solidarity Party deputy leader Khanin Bunsuwan said changes to the charter were likely as a result of the meeting. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said earlier yesterday he was confident of changes to the Constitution, but not all the 25 points. "I think that the points which are agreed to (by the government and the opposition) could be changed. But it is difficult to amend all 25 points because of different opinions," he said. The opposition parties on Tuesday resolved that all 25 proposals should be included in a single bill. The government would prefer to initially amend six points. Each side has accused the other of insincerity in pushing for a more democratic constitution. Chuan claimed that the suggestion to consider all amendments as a single bill had not been agreed to by all opposition members. He said all parties should cooperate on the amendments. Chuan said separate bills would make the changes easier. If a bill failed to pass through the parliament, legislators could propose another bill, he said. It would not hurt the government or the opposition if a particular amendment did not materialize. Both camps want changes for a better constitution. Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasathian said it would be impossible to get agreement on making all 25 changes in one bill. His Phalang Tham Party had resolved to amend about five points of the charter, he said. He said failure to amend the Constitution would affect Parliament's image, just the government's. Opposition Prachakon Thai leader Samak Suntharawet said the 25 points should be considered as separate bills.
