Garcia Laguardia called on the masterminds of the terrorist attacks to refrain from such practices and to seek other means of solving problems. He also indicated that actions such as these endanger the lives of innocent people who are not responsible for the problems. The attorney general was referring specifically to the explosion in front of Channel 7 this past Tuesday, the one between 18th Street and 6th Avenue the day before yesterday, and the one in front of the National Congress building early yesterday morning. Garcia also stated that other explosive devices had been deactivated throughout the city. Garcia Laguardia said that those who intend to destabilize the democratic system through terrorism and anarchy should reconsider because their attitude is not good for Guatemalans; on the contrary, it only endangers the lives of others.
