This follows an eyewitness report from the ANC that at least one busload of Zulus had been seen arriving at the farm of the AWB leader. Earlier Mr. Terreblanche told a newspaper that he was providing training for what he termed nonwhites who were opposed to communism. Mr. Fred Rundell of the AWB confirmed the reports but would not say if the Zulus were members of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] or if the training enjoyed the support of the Zulu king.
