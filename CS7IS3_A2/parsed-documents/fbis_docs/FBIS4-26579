Huang Zhendong, minister of communications, said in a press conference today that China has used foreign capital to construct a host of docks in the ports of Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Qinhuangdao, Rizhao, Lianyungang and Qingdao, increasing the handling capacity by 43 million tons. Twenty-three provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have used or are going to use loans from international financial institutions or foreign governments to construct 7,000 km of highways. Besides, direct investment in highway or port infrastructures by foreign business people has also advanced considerably, he said. As for opening to the outside world, Huang said, by the end of 1993 China's water transport ports open to foreign vessels had grown to 107 in number, and 35 highway transport ports are now open to foreign vehicles from neighboring countries. In addition, China has signed maritime agreements with 43 countries and signed governmental road transport agreements with eight countries; 577 joint ventures in highway transportation and water transport businesses and vehicle services have been approved, of which 415 are in the road transport sector, 66 in automobile services, and 96 in water transportation. Huang said that his ministry will take advantage of all favorable opportunities and provide a list of infrastructure projects with high economic returns to attract foreign capital, adhering to state industrial development policies to solve the problem of inadequate investment. He said that there are good prospects for the communications sector's use of foreign funds. Guangdong province alone has signed letters of intent on the use of 3.5 billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds.
