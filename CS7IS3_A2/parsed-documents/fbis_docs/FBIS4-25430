In an interview with XINHUA prior to his visit to China, Fujimori said that his forthcoming China tour will promote bilateral economic cooperation and exchanges and that relations between the two countries will be further strengthened. Fujimori and his accompanying delegation left here early today for visits to Japan and China. Fujimori's forthcoming China tour will be his third since he became Peruvian president in 1990. The previous two visits to China took place in April and November 1991. Both visits have greatly promoted the development of relations between the two countries, particularly bilateral cooperation and trade, the president said. China has provided a lot of assistance to Peru which also purchased from China farm machinery and teaching equipment, thus meeting the needs of its agricultural and educational sectors, he said. He noted that there exist vast potentials yet to be tapped in cooperation in these two fields. With his third visit to China, the two countries will have wider cooperation and more exchanges on a much larger scale, the president said. As the economies of the two countries continue to develop and become mutually supplementary, bilateral trade will be further increased, he added. The president appreciated China's policy of non-interference in other nation's internal affairs and its stands for international cooperation.
