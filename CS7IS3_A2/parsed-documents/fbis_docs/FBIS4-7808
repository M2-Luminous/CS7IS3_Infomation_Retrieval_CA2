Thus, commanders of various units are to be replaced with "political commissaries of the Ceausescu era," under the pretext that during their lengthy careers and especially after 1989 the latter "distinguished" themselves by not making any mistakes. The same sources revealed that this genuine restoration is to take place with the consent of the new defense minister, Mr. Gheorghe Tinca, whom the military consider "the slave of the power," and that the move is part of Romania's "new" military orientation distinguishable over the past month, intended to establish a full-scale alliance with Russia. Considering that Mr. Adrian Nastase [speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and executive chairman of the Social Democracy Party of Romania] is also pleading for the replacement of the army commanders appointed by the former defense minister [Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu], there are no more doubts left as to the efforts made by the state power to place the armed forces under its authority.
