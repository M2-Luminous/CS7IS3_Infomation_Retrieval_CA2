FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Riley, ANM&hyph;537, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;42, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056; telephone number: (206) 227&hyph;2537. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On August 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by amending the Sheridan, Wyoming, Class E airspace designation (59 FR 43311). Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal. No comments were received. During an airspace review an error was discovered in the airspace description for Class E airspace at Sheridan, Wyoming. This action corrects that error. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace is published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class E airspace at Sheridan, Wyoming. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anicipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entites under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
