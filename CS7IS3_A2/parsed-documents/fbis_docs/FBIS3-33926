The movement took over this duty some time after Yasir 'Arafat stopped paying the salaries, aid, and financial donations he used to give to the wounded Palestinians and families of the Palestinian resistance martyrs in Lebanon. According to informed sources, the Jihad movement receives funding from Iran and gives it to these Palestinian families and wounded resistance fighters every month. The movement hands over this funding to some Palestinian officers inside the camps who have misgivings about 'Arafat's policies, despite their still being within the Fatah framework. The same sources say that the necessary monthly funding to cover the expenses of the wounded and the families of the Palestinian martyrs in Lebanon amounts to $3 million a month. It is not known whether the Jihad movement covers this whole amount. Some sources point out that the movement pays, through some Fatah officers who have differences with 'Arafat, the monthly salaries of these families and the wounded men who fell, after 'Arafat cut salaries and aid to them. The sources conclude by pointing to extensive Iranian activity in the camps in Lebanon, especially in the camps in south Lebanon. This activity centers on providing medical aid in particular.
