In a statement issued in Sydney, the leader of the BRA, Francis Ona, attacked the rebel government's United Nations representative, Mike Foster, for comments he made in an interview on Papua New Guinea Radio. Sean Dorney reports: [Begin recording] [Dorney] In what appeared at the time to be a conciliatory statement, Mr. Foster told the NBC (National Broadcasting Corporation] of PNG, the war would drag on indefinitely unless there was some give and take. [Foster] We don't believe that the request for unconditional surrender is realistic and we don't believe either that the complete and immediate secession is realistic but somewhere in the middle there is a shared ground and I think for the sake of the whole of the Pacific region we should cease the arm conflict and begin the discussions that can lead to peace and restoration of understanding and human rights values. [Dorney] However, Mr. Foster has now been attacked by the secessionists, who accused him of creating confusion and misunderstanding. Francis Ona is quoted as saying he'll maintain struggle for independent Bougainville. [end recording]
