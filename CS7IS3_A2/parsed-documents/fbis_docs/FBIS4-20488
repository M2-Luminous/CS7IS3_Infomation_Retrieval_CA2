FD3009 was transformed by Thermus sp. FDB8 chromosome DNA. Three transformants were obtained using the selecting medium of mitomycin C. These transformants show intermediate characteristics between the FD3009 and FDB8 with respect to their cell shape, clone colour, mitomycin C resistance and thermostable DNA polymerase activity. These indicate that the transformants are resulted from transforming FD3009 by FDB8 chromosome DNA.
