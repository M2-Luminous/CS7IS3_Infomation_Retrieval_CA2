Scott Monroe Nelson, 55, telephoned a local newspaper from the nearby town of Tagum to announce that he had just been freed unharmed by unidentified men who snatched him in Davao on December 28 and freed him early Wednesday. He later arrived with Tagum police at the regional police headquarters in Davao, located about 950 kilometers (600 miles) south of Manila, to pay a call on officials who had been stumped by his disappearance. The Houston, Texas native told police that two gunmen forced him into a car in Davao on December 28 and transported him blindfolded outside the city. He said they stripped him of 2,200 dollars in travellers cheques, 200 dollars in cash and two gold rings and kept him in a windowless room until his release. Police had expressed skepticism over the case when a woman claiming to be Nelson's girlfriend reported he had been kidnapped, but could not pinpoint the place where it happened. She also claimed Nelson had been snatched on orders of his estranged Filipina wife, who lived in another city. "We are still investigating," police superintendent Filipino Amogis said.
