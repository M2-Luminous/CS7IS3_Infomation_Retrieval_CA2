President Tired of Standstill"] [Text] The peaceful or, at any rate, tacitly indifferent coexistence of Boris Yeltsin's administration and the newly elected chambers of Russia's Federal Assembly must have appeared to the republic's president unconscionably drawn-out as early as five weeks after the day of the December elections. Having signed on 24 January his Appeal to Members of the Federation Council and Deputies of the State Duma, he seems to be demonstrating a firm intention to end the situation of mutual neutrality and noninterference that he finds unusual and clearly unpleasant. The document that is being circulated on an ever wider scale on Bolshaya Dmitrovka and Krasnopresnenskaya Naberezhnaya [respectively, seats of the Federation Council and the Duma] these days speaks in form only about a purely procedural problem: the president reminds the deputies that in setting the 50-percent quorum necessary for the chambers to approve their temporary rules of procedure, they proceeded from the number of seats that were actually distributed in the 12 December elections -- six seats in the Duma and seven in the Federation Council, while they did not consider at all the seats remaining vacant. Such a violation gives Boris Yeltsin occasion to express "extreme anxiety" over the fact that, already in the first days of their work, parliamentarians "violated the most important provisions of the Constitution," and that "real prerequisites have been created for the making, in the future by either of the chambers, decisions not only on rules of procedure but also on federal laws and other decisions" contrary to the requirements of the Fundamental Law. "The Russian Federation Constitution does not provide for the presence of chambers of the Federal Assembly consisting of 171 and 444 deputies, hence the decisions of such chambers cannot be recognized as constitutional," the president remarks in an easily distinguishable metallic voice. In the meantime, the method for determining the quorum causes extremely tense debates already in the first hours that the Duma and the Federation Council were in session. Going back to what seems to be a closed-door session threatens them with a tremendous scandal. Accepting the president's claims would amount in the case of the State Duma, in particular, no more and no less than cancellation of the results of the voting for its chairman: Ivan Rybkin won the race for the position of speaker by one single vote, gathering a false quorum, as Yeltsin sees it. One should hardly see in the president's demarche the desire to dismiss the agro-communist, who so far is acting quite modestly and circumspectly. Mr. Yeltsin must have set a much bigger task: to remind the deputies that they all still walk under the president, as well as to demonstrate that this president sits up high and sees far afield. As a matter of fact, the standoff indicated by the Kremlin's resolute action will inevitably call for an arbiter. In the given case, it may only happen to be the Russian Federation Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court now proves to have regained its ambitious hopes and wishes just in time. A worthy cause is all that was lacking to go back to the line of fire. Well, here it is.
