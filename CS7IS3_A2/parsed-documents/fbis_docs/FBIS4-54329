FBIS4-54329 "dreas103_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-103 Daily Report 27 May 1994 South Korea Dailies Assess Unification Minister's Remarks Dailies Assess Unification Minister's Remarks SK2705030094 SK2705030094 BFN [Editorial Report] On 25 May, ROK vernacular newspapers carry articles reacting to remarks made by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of the National Unification Board, at the National Assembly on 23 May to the effect that the ROK will reconsider the joint declaration on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula if North Korea continues maintaining its radiochemical laboratory. On page 2, the conservative CHOSON ILBO carries a 700-word article by reporter An Hui-chang which says that the unification minister's remarks reflect the government's strong will to see that "the nuclear transparency of North Korea is secured by any means." The article quotes Minister Yi's remarks made on 12 May in a confab with the members of the Korean Newspaper Editor's Association of Korea, where he said that "the declaration on denuclearization will be nullified if it is internationally confirmed that North Korea possesses even half a nuclear weapon...." The article says that his remarks have presented our somewhat disoriented nuclear policy with a clear-cut direction policy. The article quotes Minister Yi as saying that the joint declaration has virtually been nullified in any sense, adding that the ROK Government has been coping with North Korea's nuclear issue from the standpoint of sticking to the joint declaration--although North Korea has violated it--with a view to preventing a nuclear domino phenomenon while, at the same time, taking the U.S. position into consideration. The article stresses that our government cannot concede on the point of securing nuclear transparency and that our government is sending a message to the international community, including the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], that they should pay attention to this point. The article says that this is a message indicating that "the ROK Government will not just sit idle" if North Korea continues to ignore the joint declaration and the United States tolerates this in the process of their negotiations. The article concludes by saying that his remarks seem to indicate that the ROK Government is seriously considering the nullification of the joint declaration and that this may have a ripple effect on the third round U.S.-North talks. On page 3, the CHOSON ILBO carries an 800-word editorial which says that Minister Yi's remarks are "a diversionary message" and showed concern over the United States trying to seek a settlement with North Korea while allowing it to possess one or two nuclear bomb. Adding that the remarks are bringing North Korea's attention to the possible ripple effect that the nullification of the joint declaration will create, the editorial says that if North Korea guarantees nuclear transparency, it will be possible for both South and North Korea to have nuclear technological sovereignty in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, adding that Minister Yi's remarks are a sign of change in the ROK Government's policy toward North Korea's nuclear issue. The editorial stressed that the cooperative system between the ROK and the United States should be further consolidated. On page 5, the moderate TONG-A ILBO carries an 800-word article by reporter Pak Che-kyun which says, in essence, that the ROK Government has been trying to put out the fire which was ignited by Minister Yi's remarks. The article cites Article Three of the joint declaration which says "the South and North shall not possess nuclear reprocessing facilities and uranium enriching facilities," quoting experts' worry about the possible difficulties the ROK might face in case it should give up reprocessing facilities, while adding that "the United States, which has potential fears for the nuclear weapons development of North and South Korea, had applied strong pressure on stipulating the clause of 'giving up reprocessing.'" The article continues to say that "the ROK Government is now in a position to flatly negate the minister's remarks on reconsidering the joint declaration" because both the ROK and the United States are basing their opposition against North Korea's nuclear development upon that declaration. The article concludes by saying that "if the United States takes issue with his remarks, there will be a great stir." On page 5, the moderate HANGUK ILBO carries a 1,100-word article by reporter Yu Sung-u which says that the ROK Government's foreign affairs-national security team led by Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong- ku has been boldly taking issue with the efficacy of the joint declaration. The article says that his remarks are based on a matter-of-course principle in view of Article Three of the joint declaration, saying that the ROK Government's attitude of making an issue of the efficacy of the joint declaration has been necessitated by the present circumstances under which the ROK is entrusting the United States with the negotiations with North Korea on the nuclear issue. The article says that his remarks are "a conditional or a passive declaration of nuclear sovereignty to the United States and Japan as well as to North Korea," adding that an imbalance between the South and North exists in that the ROK side has given up even the development of nuclear reprocessing technology while North Korea's extraction of plutonium is an issue. The article concludes that it is high time that a serious examination of the merits and demerits achieved since the signing of the South-North Basic Agreement and the joint declaration by South and North Korea. On page 4, the pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries a 1,300-word article by reporter Ku Pon-yong which is essentially the same as other vernacular dailies of 25 May. The article says that the unification minister's remarks make a point of ensuring that bargaining is not disadvantageous to the ROK and sends a warning to Japan whose nuclear potential is growing. The article concludes that his remarks have been made to express the government's long- term position in response to some people's views for advocating possessing reprocessing facilities for peaceful purposes under the circumstances in which the power generation with atomic energy constitutes 43.2 percent of total power generated. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "The Condition for the Reconsideration of the Denuclerization on the Korean Peninsula." Referring to the significance of remarks made by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of the National Unification Board, at the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee some time ago regarding the nullification of the South-North Joint Denuclerization Declaration on the Korean peninsula, the editorial says, "it must be true that Deputy Minister Yi's view of North Korean policy has been based on the denuclerization on the Korean peninsula, but he has maintained that the suspicion of North Korea's nuclear development must be dispelled. In this respect, we have no objection to his remarks. It is the basic framework of the government's consistent policy toward North Korea. The reconsideration of the joint denuclerization declaration on the Korean peninsula means, however, that we can revise the North-South agreement that prohibits them from possessing a nuclear reprocessing facility, as well as a uranium enriching facility. When this happens, great changes may occur in our government's nuclear policy. Therefore, we cannot but pay attention to it." Describing Deputy Prime Minister Yi's such remarks as a proposal indicating that North Korea should suspend the nuclear development program and, surely, guarantee the transparency of its nuclear development in order to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula, the editorial says, "he once said in a meeting with editors that if North Korea possesses even half of a nuclear bomb, the denuclerization declaration on the Korean peninsula will become virtually null and void. This is a clear and firm expression of the government's policy regarding the North Korean nuclear issue." The editorial says, "it is certain that the competitive nuclear development between the North and South will bring about a great disaster to our nation by making this land become a place for nuclear confrontation. Therefore, we must concentrate diplomatic efforts on making North Korea abandon its nuclear ambition, thus further strengthening the ROK-U.S. cooperative system. KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 5 a 1,000-word article by reporter Kim Pong-son entitled "A Subtle Stir in the Country by Deputy Prime Minister Yi's Remarks on the Reconsideration of the Denuclerization Declaration on the Korean Peninsula." Referring to the contents of the denuclerization declaration, the article reports, "some domestic scholars say that the joint denuclerization declaration must be revised because it abandons its rights to even possess nuclear reprocessing facility or enriching facilities for peaceful purposes." Noting the remarks by Kim Si-chung, minister of the Ministry of Science and Technology, regarding the need to revise the joint denuclerization declaration, the article says, "the government has clearly expressed the position that it will not revise it." Also, referring to the remarks by a spokesman of National Unification Board indicating that North Korea's operating a radiochemical laboratory is a violation of the joint denuclerization declaration, the article reports, "North Korea provides justification for South Korea to reconsider it. Also, its future operation of the radiochemical laboratory is a nullification of the declaration. Therefore, it must close the laboratory to avoid the dispute between the North and South." The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 a 1,000-word editorial entitled "The Principle of the Denuclerization Declaration Must Be Observed." Referring to Deputy Prime Minister Yi's remarks that we cannot but discuss the North-South Joint Denuclerization Declaration in a different way if North Korea continues operating the radiochemical facility, the editorial says, "if his remarks mean that the government will carry out its future nuclear policy based on the fact that the declaration is already null and void, we cannot but counter his remarks, because the joint denuclerization declaration, in addition to the North-South agreement, is an important agreement between the North and South to secure peace on the Korean peninsula and to achieve national reunification." Noting the background of the formulation of the declaration between the North and South and the contents of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the editorial says, "North Korea's operation of the radiochemical laboratory is not a violation of the treaty, even if it is a nuclear reprocessing facility, because the treaty does not prohibit the country concerned from possessing or operating it." The editorial also says, it is not easy to determine whether Deputy Prime Minister Yi's remarks "are intended to prevent North Korea's nuclear development or to find justification for South Korea's nuclear development." HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 2 a 700-word article by reporter Kang Tae-ho entitled "The Expression of the Government's Dissatisfaction at the U.S. Position Toward North Korea." Referring to the background of Deputy Prime Minister Yi's remarks and other government officials' remarks on need to revise the joint denuclerization declaration, the article then added, "some people believe that his remarks are a kind of an expression of the government's dissatisfaction at the U.S. Government's negotiation attitude toward North Korea with the approach of a third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks."
