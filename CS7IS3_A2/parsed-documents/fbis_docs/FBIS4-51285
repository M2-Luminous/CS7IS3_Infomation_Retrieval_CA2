Meanwhile, he decided to ban imports of guns and ammunition from China. He also announced that the United States would maintain the existing sanctions imposed on China since 1989, including the denial of participation in the U.S. trade and development assistance program, U.S. opposition to non-basic human needs loans to China by the World Bank and suspension of weapons deliveries. Speaking at a White House press conference, Clinton said that extending MFN "will avoid isolating China and instead will permit us to engage the Chinese with not only economic contacts but with cultural, educational and other contacts." "We have to see our relations with China within the broader context of our policies within the Pacific-Asian region," he noted.
