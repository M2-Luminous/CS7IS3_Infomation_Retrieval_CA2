In 1994, Vietnam enters a crucial year of renovation and development. Following is an interview by TUAN BAO QUOC TE with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet on a series of issues, namely, the outstanding features of the new diplomacy, the key aspects of foreign policy in 1994, and what is new in the investment policy. [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] May we ask you to evaluate our country's international activities in the past year? [Vo Van Kiet] Our country's international activities in 1993 took place in a very rich manner and in many fields -- political, economic, cultural, and physical education and sports -- and realistically served our goals of peace, independence, and development for the sake of prosperous people, strong country, and civilized society. The results of these activities have contributed to enhancing Vietnam's international posture and have favorably allowed us to pursue the economic and political goals of our foreign policy in the coming years. The leaders of other countries and international friends whom I had a chance to meet all advocated Vietnam's foreign policy and highly evaluated our renovation. The fact that the country was being developed in a stable manner and important socioeconomic achievements were being made in the renovation effort in recent years served as a basis for our country's big advantage in its international activities. Reality has affirmed that the domestic and foreign line and policies we are developing are correct and suitable for the present trend and allow our country to move forward along with other nations in the region and in the modern world. [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] What are the outstanding facts in these activities? [Vo Van Kiet] We were walking steadily with both feet: building the multifaceted cooperation relations with our neighboring countries and countries in the region, and diversifying the international relations, including relations with the big countries and political and economic centers in the world. The good relations we had with the region created favorable conditions for us when our country extended relations to other parts of the world. At the same time, the fact that we had diversified and multilateral relations and had retained the traditional relations with the countries that had been cooperating with and supporting us created even more favorable conditions for us within the region. The efforts to consolidate our relations with neighbors and countries in the region were linked with the policy of diversifying international relations. An important aspect of our diplomatic activities was economic. Thus our international activities were both profound and broad, were aimed at central and important points, and best served our national construction and defense. These could be considered the peculiar and new aspects of Vietnamese diplomacy. I would like to add that while we were developing the above-mentioned moves, we also did our very best to strengthen the friendship and cooperation relations with our traditional friends and wholeheartedly supported the struggles of the people of other countries for national independence and social progress. This fact reflected the principled character of Vietnam's indivisible foreign policy and also conformed to the Vietnamese people's profound international sentiment. [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] Can we call what you have just mentioned the foreign policy of the period of renovation? [Vo Van Kiet] The years and months of the struggle for national liberation had given birth to the revolutionary diplomacy combining national strength with the strength of the era and making great contributions to glorious feats of arms, such as the liberation of the South and the reunification of the fatherland. The diplomacy of the revolutionary period of national liberation had inherited and absorbed the quintessence of the millennial diplomacy of national defense and construction, and at the same time had been raised by the brilliant diplomat, Ho Chi Minh, to the height of the diplomacy of the era. This inheritance and development was the law of social movement. On the other hand, any foreign policy is determined by an actual historical ciscumstance. The world diplomacy is moving from one stage to another. The international situation is undergoing quick changes, with the grouping of new political and economic forces. Vietnam is an underdeveloped country having not so vast a land area and average economic potential but it is situated in a region that enjoys the most dynamic economic development in the world and includes many countries with strong economies and important political positions. From now until 1995 the economies of Asia may reach an average growth of 7 percent while the world as a whole cannot surpass the rate of growth of 2 percent. In and outside of the region, both politicians and businessmen are urgently making adjustments to accommodate the Pacific Era in the 21st century. The foreign policy of our country is entering a new stage switching from serving the national liberation struggle to serving the renovation, and, in facing the task of contributing to the renovation of the country, setting foreign policy guidelines and goals for the immediate and long terms by winning more friends and having fewer foes, in accordance with Ho Chi Minh thought, and by adopting lively and flexible conduct and counteracting formulas. Even in this process, the party and state everyday must handle many complex international issues, which require that we apply principles and tactics in a correct and timely manner in order to gain advantages for the country and people and to conform to the common trend. I would need more time to review the rich reality, but I think that the new foreign policy is capable of combining the national character, the traditional diplomacy, and the characteristics of the era. [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] What is the focus of foreign policy activities in 1994? [Vo Van Kiet] In 1993, the process of our country normalizing and expanding its international relations was basically completed. In the years to follow, we need to consolidate and raise the quality of these relations and pay attention to the key locations. Our political and diplomatic activities must be strongly aimed at economic aspects and serve the economic goals that have been set. This is not only the work of the foreign-affairs organs of the party and state but also the responsibility of all sectors and echelons, and has to do with the development of cooperation programs in many fields in our country. [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] What about the economic focus of foreign policy? [Vo Van Kiet] In the last few years, thanks to our policy of openness, we were able to attract a large volume of foreign investment, to step up exporting, and to some extent to resolve the budgetary difficulties regarding sources of revenue and mobilizing capital investment for the national economy. In 1994, we need to continue to increase export by 20 percent, by 25 percent in 1995, along with gradually improving the allocation of export goods, to return to the traditional markets in Russia and Eastern Europe, and to have access to new markets. [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] Please let us know the new aspects of the 1994 investment policy. [Vo Van Kiet] The country is entering a new period of development. We must attain a rate of growth no less than 8 percent per year and work hard to double the 1990 GDP level by the year 2000. To do so we must have a lot of capital. We have been paying attention to mobilizing the sources of domestic capital. In the last 3 years, the total investment in development came close to 70,000 billion dong; the projected total in the next two years will amount to 90,000 billion dong. This way we will be able to achieve the goal set for domestic capital investment for the years of 1991-1995. However, a lot of idle capital exists in the population. In 1993, we were able to mobilize only less than one-half of the people's capital-contributing capacity. The government is urgently drafting a law on domestic investment. About foreign capital, there has been a major gain due to a breakthrough in the establishment of our relations with international financial and monetary organizations, with the ability to acquire capital and then expand new industries. The countries and international organizations that participated in the International Financial Assistance Conference held in Paris have agreed to grant us loans under favored conditions totaling 1.86 billion dollars in the 1993-1994 fiscal year. The official aid for development from a number of industrialized countries also has greatly increased. Direct private foreign investment continues to increase quickly. The total of such capital being put to actual use in 1993 amounted to $800 million, nearly twice the total in 1992. However, in the present stage, the ability to get foreign capital greatly depends on our ability to accept and use it effectively in our country. Therefore, we will give priority to investment projects aimed at improving our infrastructure, processed goods for export, and manufacturing sectors, which will help to resolve the unemployment problem. On this occasion, I congratulate TUAN BAO QUOC TE for being published for the first time. As the country is being renovated, the press needs to be renovated and modernized. [Nguyen Ngoc Truong] Thank you, Mister Prime Minister.
