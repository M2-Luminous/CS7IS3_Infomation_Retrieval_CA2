In an interview with KUNA, al-Mid'ij pointed out that Kuwait would ask for the quota allocated to her before the tyrannical Iraqi invasion -- 2.2 million barrels a day. Minister al-Mid'ij attributed this Kuwaiti demand to two reasons: first, that "this is the minimum of our rights since they should be equal to those of other states"; second, that Kuwait's production capacity is estimated at 2.4 million barrels a day. Al-Mid'ij also said he hoped Kuwait's request would be granted. [passage omitted] Concerning the foreign participation in the oil sector, the Kuwaiti minister said "it is still under review and we expect to reach a final idea about it by the end of this year." Al-Mid'ij commented on a KUNA question about the resentment of South Korean oil-consuming companies from a Kuwaiti demand to increase the prices by $2 per tonne for the contracts of the second part of 1994. He said the issue of prices was among the issues open for discussion in connection with any commodity and at any time "as long as we have not violated the condition if there was an agreement between us and any other side. It is our right to offer our commodity at the price we think suitable, and it is the right of any side to buy or refrain from buying this commodity." He pointed out that "for us, the issue of prices should not be interpreted on the basis of making it impossible and difficult for them, because this is a commodity on offer, and when we are convinced that this is [indistinct word] and this is its cost [indistinct words]." In the course of his statement, he pointed out that the level of (?oil) stockpile in the industrial countries has started to decrease in an usual manner, a matter that would lead to increases in oil prices. Al-Mid'ij stressed that if the technical and political situation of oil continued until next December, there would be an increase [indistinct word] in oil prices estimated by two dollars. [passage omitted] He dealt with the penalties which any of the OPEC member countries could face if they did not adhere to their quotas. He pointed out that this would take the form of sending messages to the countries violating this agreement, in addition to subjecting their oil quotas to deductions in the near future.
