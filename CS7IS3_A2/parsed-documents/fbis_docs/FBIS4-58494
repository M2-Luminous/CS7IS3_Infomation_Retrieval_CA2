The announcement of the formation of the Transitional National Assembly (an unelected parliament) has been postponed because of the major parties' refusal to participate in it. [passage omitted] It seems that Annaba was selected for Labor Day celebrations to indicate that security forces are in control of the situation. Southeastern areas of the capital witnessed large-scale combing operations yesterday. Information from various sources indicates that security forces have killed prominent military leaders in the "armed Islamic groups" or the "armed Islamic movement." There are reports of the death of Major General Abdelkader Shabouti in Chelif (west of Algeria). He was the leader of the "armed Islamic movement" belonging to the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. AL-HAYAH has learned that Shabouti was in the Orous area suffering from an undisclosed illness. He was moved to west Algeria for treatment. Circles close to the FIS have not confirmed Shabouti's death. Nor have there been any reports that he has been "murdered." However, there are reports in some Algerian circles about his death. Other information indicates that Said Makhloufi was killed "by mistake" during the recent siege imposed by security forces on Boumerdas. He was holding a coordination meeting between the armed Islamic groups and the armed Islamic movement. The certain thing is that this information is still in the hands of security men and FIS leaders. It might be announced in the coming weeks. Some sources say the reason for neither confirming nor denying the two FIS leaders' death is to avoid obstructing current preparations for FIS supporters' participation in the 8 May march in support of the dialogue approach.
