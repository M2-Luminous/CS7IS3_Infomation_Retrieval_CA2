The source was not able to say whether the agreement, signed by two now defunct states, had been rescinded in order to make way for a replacement document or whether the move represented the introduction of visa requirement for certain republics of ex-Yugoslavia, as the Czech Republic has already done. The usually well-informed source believes the latter possibility more likely. It is not clear which republics are concerned or when the new visa requirements will come into effect. The Czech Republic introduced visa requirement for citizens of the new Yugoslav Republic (Serbia and Montenegro), and Bosnia-Herzegovina on June 23 last year.
