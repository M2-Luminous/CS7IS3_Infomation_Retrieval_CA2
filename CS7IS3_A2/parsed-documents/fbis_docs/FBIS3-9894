He added that all countries throughout the world have relations with their residents abroad, and Cuba should be no exception. Robaina explained that we must reestablish normal relations with our community abroad, and that this relationship must include all residents abroad, not just those in the United States. He said it is impossible to speak of an opening to the world without including the existence of our fellow citizens globally. He added that it is not Cuba that excludes the hostile, aggressive ones. They exclude themselves. Robaina concluded by saying that our foreign policy is integral to a people and a revolution accustomed to surprises and to gaining power where it appears not to exist. If foreign policy can do this, it is a reflection of the desires of the people and the Revolution.
