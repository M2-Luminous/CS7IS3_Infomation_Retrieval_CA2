Under the plan, which has yet to be ratified by the State Council, overseas firms would be permitted to operate foreign-related insurance business in China. But they can only settle their accounts in foreign currencies. The move represents China's bid to meet the challenge of restoring the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), as well as an endeavor to broaden international cooperation in the areas of insurance, a relatively weak sector in the country. However, China will be cautious about the step. It would be a gradual process, the sources said, adding that conditions are not yet ripe for a large-scale opening up. Some restrictions are expected with regard to branches to be established in China, the sources said, without giving further details. Experts here said that opening up China's insurance sector will not only boost the country's insurance business, but help garner more foreign funds. With a population of about 1.2 billion, China is a huge insurance market in the eyes of many foreign investors. In fact, more than 30 foreign insurance companies have set up representative offices and agencies in China so far, the majority of which are offering consulting services or acting as agents. Over the years, the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), China's flag-carrier in this field, has established good business ties with insurance firms in almost all countries and regions, according to Shi Guoqing, deputy general manager of PICC's International Department. In line with the basic principle of "equality and mutual benefit" embodied in GATT, China will be given the opportunity of entering the international insurance market, while opening up its own. PICC, which monopolises more than 90 percent of the country's total insurance business, is currently accelerating the pace for developing overseas insurance business. China-funded insurance agencies are now scattered in Hong Kong, Macao, Singapore, Britain, the U.S., Germany and Luxembourg. They can conduct businesses such as property insurance, life insurance, re-insurance and in the fields of investment and securities. The number of such agencies has risen to 71. A total of 1,000 employees are working in the agencies, which witnessed a general insurance premium income of about 230 million U.S. dollars last year. The Hong Kong Chinese Insurance Group Company (CIG), which was opened last year, has captured about 20 percent of the total business in Hong Kong insurance market. The Hong Kong Minan Insurance Company, a subsidiary of CIG, ranked first in the same trade in Hong Kong for its large premium income. China-funded insurance companies in Macao also hold as much as 40 percent of the market. As mentioned by Shi Guoqing, beside successfully organizing the CIG and European China Holdings Company last year, China will take a bolder step to set up regional management companies in Southeast Asia and in North America in the near future. Then the country will try to knit a world-wide insurance network, so as to make China's insurance business more competitive on the world market. Shi Guoqing said that there was a broad prospect for China to develop overseas insurance business, as the world market is a sizable one. Statistics show that the world's yearly premium income is about 1,400 billion U.S. dollars. In the meantime, the PICC has also done well in developing foreign-related insurance business, which has contributed a lot to foreign trade, and improving the investment environment. Last year, premium income for foreign-related insurance business achieved more than 700 million U.S. dollars, up 30 percent over the previous year. PICC has now opened 80-plus insurance items for foreign-related business, which include off-shore petroleum drilling, satellite-launching and construction of nuclear power plants.
