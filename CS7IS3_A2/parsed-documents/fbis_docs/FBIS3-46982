The contract would provide provincial telephone systems at 20 sites throughout Cambodia. The networks would be linked to the $30-million satellite system installed in late 1991 by the U.N. Transitional Authority (UNTAC) that policed a peace pact in the country, the English-language Cambodian daily said. Before the Australian Company Telstra-OTC installed the state-of- the-art UNTAC satellite system, the only working phone network in Cambodia was an antiquated domestic one in Phnom Penh. The newspaper quoted Cambodian Minister for Post and Telecommunications So Khun as saying: "There is real interest in the UNTAC satellite system. We have received 15 applications, and I have already had five companies knocking on my door to find out what (we) will be offering." According to So Khun, licenses to operate on the UNTAC facility would be awarded in April. Cambodia currently has four mobile phone systems in operation, mostly set up by Thai companies but with one from Malaysia. The 22,000-strong UNTAC force was deployed in Cambodia after the signing of an international peace agreement in Paris in 1991.
