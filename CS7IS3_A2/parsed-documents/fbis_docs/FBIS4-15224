Ahead of this event Estonian Delegation Head Vaino Reinart answered RIA-NOVOSTI correspondents' questions. [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] According to the Estonian press, the republic leadership is extremely pessimistic about the chances for the 18th round of Russian-Estonian talks. Is that right? [Reinart] Not at all. The Estonian delegation is going to Moscow with a calm heart. The somewhat unexpected turn of events at the 17th round of talks caused a stormy reaction in Europe, which clearly confirmed the correctness of our stance at the talks. The demand for the Russian troops to be withdrawn by 31 August this year won the unequivocal support of NATO, the CSCE, the EC, and the United States. At the same time it was stressed that the withdrawal must be effected without any additional terms being put forward. I hope that Russia too has drawn the necessary conclusions from the international reaction and chosen a more constructive approach than the one it voiced during the last round. [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] It is known that the preparation of a general treaty regarding the troop withdrawal, including the settlement of matters pertaining to military pensioners, has been a stumbling block in the negotiating process. There are reports that Estonia is drafting new wordings of some agreements that will now be acceptable to the Russian side. Can you confirm that? [Reinart] The Estonian delegation has naturally spent all this time working on various drafts and we hope that Russia too has not abandoned the quest for constructive solutions. The main troop withdrawal treaty was ready during the last round and I do not really understand why we were not able to initial it. I cannot see Russia's proposed changes regarding the text that has already been coordinated as anything but Russia's reluctance to complete the work on this draft treaty. Estonia's priority in this round of talks is to complete the preparation of the troop withdrawal treaty as required by the resolutions adopted by international organizations. We are of course willing to discuss the draft agreement on social guarantees for military pensioners and we hope that Russia will give up its demands for Estonian legislation to be amended in order to secure decisions beneficial to it. [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] The Estonian Government has approved and submitted to parliament the draft law on the border whereby Estonia's land border is fixed in accordance with the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty. Does this mean that your delegation will raise the question of territories during the 18th round of talks? [Reinart] Estonia has not taken any unilateral steps regarding the border issue. We believe that such actions will not bring us closer to really resolving the problem. In its proposals Estonia acts on the principle of international law whereby interstate borders are fixed by international treaties. The only treaty fixing the border between Estonia and Russia is the Tartu Peace Treaty, which is still valid today. Despite the Estonian side's repeated requests, Russia is refusing to provide legally valid explanations that accord with the principles of international law as to why the border should run through an area not prescribed by the Tartu Peace Treaty. Russia has also responded in the negative to Estonia's suggestion that this question be submitted to the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague for consideration, which, as you know, only examines contentious issues with the consent of both parties. If Russia is so convinced of its arguments, I cannot understand why it is not willing to resolve this issue on the basis of international law. [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Latvian Delegation Head M. Virsis described the results of the Russian-Latvian talks as a "difficult compromise for both sides." Is Estonia ready for such "difficult compromises," will it take its neighbor's experience into consideration? [Reinart] Russia has repeatedly said that the example of another Baltic country -- Lithuania, from which Russian troops were withdrawn without the corresponding treaty's being concluded -- does not set a precedent for Estonia and Latvia. The corresponding Russian-Estonian and Russian-Latvian draft treaties were different from the very outset just as certain aspects were also different. Estonia has already made "difficult compromises" with Russia by agreeing to the final date for the troop withdrawal by 31 August this year. The possibility of a certain number of military pensioners obtaining residence permits in accordance with Estonian legislation is also a compromise. Estonia is not about to agree to any compromises -- difficult or easy -- that are designed to perpetuate the occupation. We hope that Russia is also prepared to act on the basis of the principles of international law when resolving the remaining problems.
