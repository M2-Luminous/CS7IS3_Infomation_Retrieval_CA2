The loan, given to China's National Afforestation Project, will assist the country through 1997. About 25 percent of it goes toward expanding national forests and the rest to developing collective woodlands. In the past three years, China has used $180 million of the loan to afforest 900,000 hectares, said Qu Shuye, head of the World Bank Loan Projects Management Centre under the Ministry of Forestry. When the project is completed, Qu said, it will boost the country's timber output by 300 million cubic metres, helping to ease the country's lumber shortage. Loan money has gone to 16 provinces and autonomous regions, most in South and East China, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang and Shandong. As part of the project, a computer network has been set up to link forestry centres nationwide, allowing officials to co-ordinate efforts across the country and solve problems immediately with regular feedback. Qu said an ecological monitoring system has also been set up to make sure that excessive planting does not lead to soil erosion. He added that the World Bank's loan has not only helped afforestation efforts, but has helped bring new concepts and technology to the forestry sector. Forestry officials have hammered out a scientific afforestation research plan. More than 80 specialists worked on the plan, which Qu called "unprecedented." To supervise the loan, the country has set up a system that links the use of money with planting results, the senior official said. The World Bank is to grant another $200 million loan this year to the Forestry Resources Development and Protection Project, which will cover the intensive farming of artificial forests, the building of multipurpose shelter-belts and the improvement of management of nature reserves, Qu said.
