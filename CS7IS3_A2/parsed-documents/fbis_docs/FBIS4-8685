FBIS4-8685 "dreeu074_a_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-074 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 ALBANIA Ministry Protests More Greek `Provocative Acts' Ministry Protests More Greek `Provocative Acts' AU1504203994 Tirana TVSH Television Network in Albanian 1800 GMT 15 Apr 94 AU1504203994 Tirana TVSH Television Network Albanian BFN [Text] Provocative acts against Albania are still continuing. At about 1200 on 14 April 1994, approximately 150 Greek soldiers not only approached the official Albanian border in the Kakavije region but, after being deployed on the terrace of a Greek border post building, carried out surveillance of Albanian territory using a camera. At 1300 they withdrew deep into their own country. After the 10 April massacre, this action is another provocative act leading to a further aggravation of tension and military pressure by the Greek side on the Albanian border. This provocative act runs counter to the norms of good faith defined in international acts that regulate the good neighborly relations between states. We were also informed that at 1030 today, about 2 miles into our territorial waters, at latitude 40 degrees and longitude 19 degrees 41 minutes, one of our naval patrol boats in Borshi Bay detained a Greek fishing vessel, the Aios Vasilis, captained by Petro Xharka, for violating Albanian laws by carrying out unlicensed fishing in Albanian waters. In conformity with the rules and legal procedures, this ship was accompanied to the port of Sarande and was handed over to the relevant authorities for further action. At 1125 today a Greek military patrol vessel was detected approaching the Greek fishing boat detained by our naval patrol boat. At 1130 this Greek warship stopped at latitude 39 degrees 38 minutes and longitude 19 degrees 43.5 minutes, about 20.5 miles into our waters. Considering that the Greek warship violated Albanian rules, our patrol boat requested that the warship left Albanian waters immediately. At first the Greek P-52 vessel refused to accept that it was in Albanian waters. However, later, at about 1230, the warship left for Greek waters, where it remained until 1320. This incursion and stay of the Greek patrol boat is another provocative action that may cause extremely grave consequences. Our navy is seriously committed to defending legality and sovereignty in our territorial waters. Under these conditions, the Defense Ministry of the Republic of Albania asks the relevant authorities of the Greek Army to prevent and avoid such military actions that incite and increase tension on the official border of the Republic of Albania and further aggravate interstate relations that may lead to dangerous consequences.
