A Citibank official reported the measure was adopted because of the White House decision to freeze the funds of Haitian citizens in U.S. banks, without regard to the currency in which they are registered. "We are taking necessary steps to obtain permission to continue operating, however in a limited capacity... that is why we prefer to close our doors today. This is not a definitive closing," the source declared. Haiti's Ministry of Finance and Economy warned that if these banks do not resume their operations, the government will sue them to force them to respect Haitian laws. The closing of the banks (the fourth and fifth largest of the nine banks operating in the country) caused discontent among patrons who are not on the lists of people sanctioned by the U.S. Government. Together with the order, which expands on the one issued on 10 June, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a list containing the names of 250 members of Haiti's political and economic elite, in addition to the nearly 650 supporters of the coupists. The government of President William Clinton suspended the visas and resident status of Haitian senators who appointed Emile Jonassaint as de facto president. In response to the U.S. measure, the Interior Ministry announced this Thursday that all foreign citizens will require a visa to enter the country, for which they will have to pay $50 upon arriving in Haitian territory. The Interior Ministry added that the foreigners who reside in the Caribbean country must renew their residence permit at the end of the current fiscal period. Foreigners must also prove that they have paid their taxes to the Haitian State. Meanwhile, Army Commander General Raoul Cedras, whose resignation the U.S. Government demands as a condition to lifting the blockade, visited military garrisons in Port-au-Prince to "lift the morale of his troops." The blockade against Haiti will be more restrictive as of 0900 next Saturday, when American, Air Canada, ALM, and COPA airlines suspend their services to the Caribbean nation. Only Air France will maintain its three weekly flights. As the date approaches, the coupists increase the aggressive tone of their speeches against the international community and even participate in voodoo ceremonies to invocate the "protection of the guardian gods against foreign intervention." According to political analysts, however, the coupists have a less aggressive position than the one they held last October when they opposed the return of deposed President Jean Bertrand Aristide although they had signed the Governors Isle Agreement accepting Aristide's return. The paramilitary Haitian People Armed Revolutionary Front (FRAPH) canceled a strike it had announced for this Friday. This contrasts with its patrol operations to oblige people to respect the strike it decreed last October. This Thursday, the two most important Haitian labor unions asked Cedras to resign from his post to ease the return of constitutional order and the lifting of the penalties that have negatively affected the population.
