Our military observer Vladimir Klimov asked him to talk about the committee's work plans. [Yushenkov] We will be approving the work plans at a committee sitting in the very near future. The draft laws we will be preparing and the changes to existing laws can be split into several groups. In the first I would place laws envisaged by the Russian Federation Constitution: the Law on Martial Law, the Law on the State of Emergency, and the Law on Alternative Service. That represents our foundation. The laws are extremely wide-ranging in their effect and they require meticulous, detailed study. The next group comprises laws connected with the main points of the military doctrine. Basically we will be examining amendments to existing laws. For example, the Law on Military Obligation and Military Service must be brought in line with presidential edicts and the military doctrine. Changes will be made to the Law on Defense, the Law on the Status of Servicemen, and the Law on Additional Guarantees and Compensation for Servicemen. The third group -- perhaps it should be regarded as the second in terms of importance -- will include laws that will set parameters for the reform of the Armed Forces. First, the Law on Defense Expenditure. That is, the economic and financial aspects of the reform and the identification of the structure of expenditure and the quantitative parameters. Equally important is the Law on Civilian Monitoring. If we are building a rule-of-law state, then this implies civilian monitoring of the activities of the power structures, glasnost, and access to information -- in fact, hitherto, certain topics that are not state secrets have been declared closed. The next group of laws regulate military service in the border forces, internal forces, and special services. They might include social guarantees for servicemen, members of their families, and people who have been discharged into the reserves. [Klimov] What is your relationship, Sergey Nikolayevich, with the power structures, in particular with the Defense Ministry? [Yushenkov] Above all I must stress that we are not the Armed Forces Committee, but the Defense Committee. Anything relating to defense falls within the sphere of our activity: the military-economic, military-technical, and the actual military policy of the state. And the part of the military-industrial complex that services defense. We have not been operating for long, so we do not have any close contacts with the power structures as yet. But we are already developing a working relationship with the Defense Ministry. [Klimov] Sergey Nikolayevich, what can be regarded as the priority problems in the social sphere? [Yushenkov] Things are difficult for society and even more difficult for the Army, since it is very hard to be a stable organism in an unstable society. You know what a problem the draft is at the moment. As a result officers are sometimes performing the functions of privates: guard details, alert duty. But they are not getting paid and are not being given apartments. The Army needs to be thoroughly reformed, not merely for the sake of it, but in order to be able to achieve the goals the Armed Forces face. [Klimov] Only a very strong team can tackle such important and extensive plans. Who is on the committee? [Yushenkov] There are 16 people. Some of them are very well known. For example, Artur Nikolayevich Chilingarov, president of the association of polar expedition members, a man who spent six months at the North and South Poles and got in the Guinness Book of Records. Dmitriy Antonovich Volkogonov needs no introduction. Colonel General Yuriy Nikolayevich Rodionov is Russian Federation deputy chief military inspector. [Klimov] The current composition of the State Duma is extremely varied. Are you optimistic about the future, Sergey Nikolayevich? [Yushenkov] There are questions on which common sense must prevail. Although there are bound to be people in the Duma who will place political and ideological functions before actual legislative activity. This must be seen as inevitable. Churchill said that demcracy is the worst form of government, but mankind has not come up with anything better.
