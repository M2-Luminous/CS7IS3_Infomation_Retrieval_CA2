It has been learned from the Israeli delegation that about 60 percent of the economic agreements have been drafted. Last night Israeli and PLO representatives discussed worker traffic. The remaining unresolved issues are the imports from Arab countries and the value added tax rates. Our correspondent Gid'on Kouts reports that the PLO has agreed to establish a monetary authority instead of a central bank, and as for Palestinian currency, there will be a limited token issue. This round of the Paris talks will continue until 11 April.
