Speaking following separate meetings with a delegation of the Republic of Yemen, led by 'Ali Mansur Rashid, and a delegation of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which recently proclaimed independence, Ibrahimi said that the aim of his talks with the two delegations was to establish a cease-fire in Yemen and devise a mechanism to monitor it. Ibrahimi said that he will submit a full report on his mission to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali, who will in his turn present a report to the UN Security Council proposing a course of action on the crisis. [passage indistinct] The UN secretary general's envoy said that he will continue to seek a stable cease-fire in Yemen, reiterating that both sides are aware that continued shelling is against their interests. Ibrahimi said that continued fighting is neither acceptable or sensible, expressing hope that the cease-fire will be upheld as soon as possible. Meanwhile, 'Abdallah Muhsin al-'Ikwah, spokesman for the northern Yemeni delegation, described as good the delegation's talks with Ibrahimi, which focused on ways to stabilize the cease-fire. Al-'Ikwah told journalists that the delegation is in Cairo "to meet with the brothers of the Yemeni Socialist Party, our partners in the coalition." Asked about the creation of borders splitting the countries in half, al-'Ikwah said that this is an inappropriate development. For his part, Muhsin Bin-Farid, head of the southern Yemeni delegation, said that the delegation seeks the implementation of Resolution 924 as a first step that could lead to the discussion of other matters. Concerning the need for a peace-keeping force to support the resolution, Bin-Farid said that such a force is needed; otherwise, UN resolutions will not be respected by any side. Bin-Farid said that the southern delegation conveyed to Ibrahimi a call on the UN Security Council to take deterrent action against any side violating its resolutions.
