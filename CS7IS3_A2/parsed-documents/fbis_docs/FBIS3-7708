Senator Ernesto Herrera, chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, said that this year, the committee will not discuss the five tax measures endorsed by Malacanang and the 20 percent excise tax on non-essential commodities, the stocks transaction tax, the re-imposition of dividends tax, and the tax increase on beer and soft drinks. The five bills are expected to yield an annual net increase of 4.4 billion pesos in tax revenues to the government. Herrera stated that many senators disagree with the idea of creating new taxes because they believe that what must be done is for the government to revamp its system of collecting taxes, and change them so as to improve tax collection methods. Herrera pointed to the inefficient performance of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and of the Bureau of Customs, in 1993, despite the passage of legislation designed to improve tax collection efficiency. In the study of the work done by the Philippine Institute For Development Studies, it was revealed that the government had failed to bring in 29.1 million pesos, or 14 per cent of the national tax revenues due in 1992. At present, the Senate is still studying the bill designed to widen the scope of the VAT. In the bill are recommendations relating to the additional collection of 2 billion pesos in government revenues annually, by means of the passage of the VAT bill, including taxes on hotels, restaurants, and highly paid professionals, like athletes and movie stars.
