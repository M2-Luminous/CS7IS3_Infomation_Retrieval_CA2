University Board Now Islamically Run Candidates from the "Islamic current" have reportedly won all the seats on the board of directors of the Suez Canal University's Teaching Club. Names of the winning professors and the number of votes they obtained are cited in a 400-word front-page report. Dr. Muhammad Abazah, head of the Alexandria University Teaching Club, said that the Ministry of Social Affairs is stalling on setting a date for new elections at the club because opinion polls tip in favor of the Islamic current candidates. Anti-Islamic Books To Be "Confiscated" A "responsible source" at al-Azhar Islamic Research Academy reportedly stressed that "all publications on display at the Cairo Book Fair will be scrutinized by the Academy's Composition and Translation Committee and that any written works containing ideas that conflict with our Islamic culture will be confiscated." The source also emphasized that "the grand imam of al-Azhar has ordered banning from the fair and confiscating all books published by the Ministry of Culture, supervised by the Book Authority, that contain ideas conflicting with Islam." The source added that "all pavilions at the fair will be supervised by the Composition and Translation Committee" and pointed out that "the campaign against the Islamic Research Academy launched by secular weekly magazines will not dissuade al-Azhar from combating the stray ideas promoted by the advocates of secularism and communism in Egypt." Ministry, Book Fair Literature Criticized People's Assembly deputy Jalal Gharib has reportedly filed a new request for a briefing by Culture Minister Faruq Husni on the ministry's publications and periodicals, which he said contain material "that defames the prophets and divine nature" as well as "poetry that runs contrary to society's public ethics." He also protested the festivals organized by the Ministry of Culture, which he said include performances by "nude" and "gay" actors and other shows that ridicule religious symbols in violation of the Constitution, which names Islam as the state's religion and the Islamic shari'ah as the "primary source of legislation." West Accused of Attacking Islam Reporter Taha Khattab cited Dr. Jamal 'Abd- al-Hadi, a professor of Islamic history, saying that foreign experts, in cooperation with the education minister and a U.S. center for curricula development, are trying to "obliterate the Islamic identity" of students by undermining their sense of patriotism, distancing them from their creed, and making them loyal to the West. Dr. 'Abd-al-Hadi noted: "Whoever defends the Islamic identity is branded as extremist and a fanatic by the education minister, who has reassigned thousands of teachers to administrative positions without specific charges, only that they are religious." He concluded, saying: "It seems that the education minister is implementing the Protocols of Zion, which want education in the Islamic countries to be theoretical only." ROSE AL-YUSUF "Practicing Terrorism" Chief Editor Mahmud 'Atiyah criticized the weekly ROSE AL-YUSUF, without naming it, for publishing secular and political "garbage," such as extracts from the book by the "apostate" Salman Rushdie (see nc1901121794). Addressing an unnamed "communist" writer in charge of a literary publication for his remarks on the writer Fahmi Huwaydi, 'Atiyah said: "You are practicing the worst kind of terrorism, for you indeed are a terrorist group of a dangerous type that must be eliminated by being discarded from among the sons of the homeland and the body of the nation, because your ideas belong in the garbage can." 'Atiyah then criticized Culture Minister Faruq Husni for setting up a higher council for censorship, most of whose members are "secularists and communists, whose slogan is no to Islam, no to protecting religious and national ethics and values, and yes to permissiveness." Islamic Shari'ah Advocated Dr. al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Sattar al-Miliji, secretary general of the Scientists Association, in an article entitled "The Fatal Error," contended that Third World governments are moving in a vicious circle because of a fatal error, namely, separating themselves from their people. Noting that Muslim people wish to apply Islamic shari'ah, he pointed out that the "governments in our countries mostly tend to follow a Western mentality, be it American or Russian." He added that these governments are so engrossed in this fatal error that they have become hostile to the desires and the creed of the nation and have made plans to fight religion and religious people. In conclusion, he noted that no social or political change could be brought about unless "free and fair elections" are held that could give real legitimacy to all the winning quarters. Islamic Preacher's Ban Questioned Writer Dr. Faruq 'Abd-al-Salam asked: Why is Shaykh 'Abd-al-Hamid Kishk, a famous Islamic preacher in a Cairo mosque, prevented from giving religious lessons, delivering the Friday prayers, and leading people to prayer. He claimed that there isn't one reasonable explanation for the authority's insistence on preventing Shaykh Kishk from doing his religious duty, although he is one of the ulema of al-Azhar and an articulate orator whose fame is known to Muslims worldwide. He further asked: "On what constitutional and legal basis in Egypt, the seat of al-Azhar, are people like Shaykh Kishk and Shaykh al-Mahallawi denied the right to speak and deliver sermons in God's house and public places, if, as you claim, Egypt is democratic and the oasis of democracy in the region?" He noteed that Shaykh Kishk's sermons are taped and broadcast against the authority's will in public squares, such as "Al-'Atabah Square." Islamic Thinkers on Islam, Extremism Reporters Hani al-Mikkawi and Yasir al-Dukkan noted a recent seminar held at the Islamic Thinking Institution of the Islamic Education Society. Among the attendees were writer Fahmi Huwaydi, Islamic preacher Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, and Islamic thinker Dr. Muhammad 'Imarah who spoke at the seminar on local and international Islamic affairs. Huwaydi is quoted referring to a cultural "crisis" in the country resulting from Israeli, American, and Western "infiltration of Egyptian universities and culture, while Islam is busy defending itself against attacks by various quarters." He continued: "We are living in a society the political orientation of which does not specify the enemy or the friend." While admitting that the "acts of violence" have harmed the "Islamic movement," Huwaydi called for the need to revert to an Islamic "point of reference" (marji'iyah) that truly expresses the requirements of the age. Asked about the gap between Islamists and secularists, he admitted that such a gap exists despite Egyptian society being Islamic, adding that had this been properly highlighted, the current dispute over Islamic shari'ah and Islamic penalties would not have existed. Asked how sincere is the call for national dialogue, Huwaydi said: "The call for dialogue is a noble call and Muslims advocate dialogue. The broader the dialogue the more serious it is, since it will include all national forces that have a presence in the Egyptian community." But Huwaydi cautions that the dialogue may be a "trap" for the people or an opportunity for the people to merely "vent" their misgivings. Huwaydi added that although he sides with the Islamic movement, this does not mean that he supports violence, noting that the problem of violence is a "political, economic, and Islamic problem." He pointed out: "The Islamists are ready for dialogue despite the campaign of defamation waged against them in the press," adding: "We want the Islamic current to acquire its due legitimacy; we want Islam to enter various walks of life." He said the Islamists are a "genuine" party in this country and are entitled "to express themselves and their Islamic identity, which everybody must defend." He also said: "Supposing some factions of the Islamic trend have made mistakes, this does not justify the attack against the Islamic movement and Islam. The Islamic trend is not a group of angels, but human beings who react to reality." He noted that communists and secularists have various factions and asked: So why blame the Islamists for this? Asked how violence could be handled, Huwaydi pointed out that the current "security" method is unsuitable. He asked that instead of branding these youngsters gangs of outlaws, "Why don't we say there is a political and economic problem that has resulted in frustration leading to despair?" Huwaydi added that some people are trying to widen the differences between the Islamists and the government. Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali attributed the disarray in the Islamic world to the Islamic nation having abandoned the "book the teachings of which it was ordered to comply with." In harsh remarks against secularists, al-Ghazali claimed: "Cockroaches are filling the press with their secularism and lies." He adds: "These frogs and cockroaches, from the secular and leftist writers, are the reason for the defeat of this nation; they represent the ugly face of the Islamic nation. They try to undermine the Islamic trend and even side with those hostile to Islam." Dr. 'Imarah said that the Islamic movement is standing alone to defend the Islamic nation in the face of the "Israeli enemy." Asked why Islamists declined to take part in debates at the Book Fair, he answered: "How could we have a debate about the Islamic movement with 'Adil Imam and Samihah Ayyub [Egyptian artists]? They asked us to debate with them."
