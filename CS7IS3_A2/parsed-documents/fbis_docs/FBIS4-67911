Impressed with the performance of the Space Department, the Government is likely to double the Plan outlay on space research in the on-going Eighth Plan period from 1,804 crore to Rs.[rupees] 3,500 crore, originally sought by the department. This is revealed in the tenth report submitted to the Standing Committee of Parliament on Science and Technology, comprising members of both Houses. Though the contract between the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Russian space organisation Glavkosmos had been modified under the threat of U.S. sanctions, ISRO was in a position to develop indigenous technology, the panel said. The committee was informed by the representatives of the Space Dapartment that industries like L&T [Larsen and Toubro], Walchand Industries, Godrej, NOCIL [National Organic Chemical Industries Limited] and Andhra Sugar had been involved in producing various subsystems and hardware for the cryogenic engine. Secretary (Space) Dr. K. Kasturirangan informed the committee that according to the modified agreement with Glavkosmos, in addition to the supply of the originally planned two cryogenic blocks, two more flight stages and two ground models would be supplied in lieu of the technology transfer, within the original agreement cost of Rs. 235 crore. ISRO has also exercised the option to buy three additional cryo stages at a cost of U.S. $3 million each as negotiated in the original contract, Dr. Kasturirangan told the committee. The committee was also informed that, for this programme, the Government has approved an outlay of Rs. 245 crore. The body wanted the Department of Space to make concerted efforts in this direction because with the realisation of the cryo stage, if the GSLV is operationalised, the Indian launch services would be priced much lower than the current international market price. The indigenous cryogenic engine, burning liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen, will power the upper-most stage of the GSLV which will give ISRO the capability to launch 2.5-tonne class communication satellites into geostationary orbits. Such a capabilily, married to the ISRO's success in fabricating low-priced satellites, would provide the Indian space organisation a major slot in the international space launch market. The committee was informed that the work relating to GSLV was proceeding and that, so far, 216 technologies or processes developed had been transferred to the firms. ISRO representatives told the committee that the next flight of the PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) would take place later this year. Asked about the reason for the failure of the PSLV's first flight last September when it failed to place the IRS-1E [Indian Remote Sensing-1E] satellite into orbit, they told the committee that the launch was ``almost a success'' and that barring a software implementation error, all the stages and their sub-systems had performed very well.
