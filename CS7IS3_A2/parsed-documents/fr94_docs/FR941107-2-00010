FR941107-2-00010 FR941107-2-00005 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;823&hyph;806] Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination: Pure Magnesium From Ukraine AGENCY: Import Administration, International trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ellen Grebasch or Erik Warga, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;3773 or (202) 482&hyph;0922, respectively. PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION: We preliminarily determine that imports of pure magnesium from Ukraine are being, or are likely to be, sold in the Untied States at less than fair value (``LTFV''), as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on April 20, 1994, (59 FR 21748, April 26, 1994), the following events have occurred. On May 16, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified the Department of Commerce (the Department) of its preliminary determination that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured, or threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of pure magnesium from Ulkraine. The ITC also determined in the companion investigation of alloy magnesium from Ukraine that there is not a likelihood that a U.S. domestic industry is materially injured, or threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of alloy magnesium from Ukraine, thereby terminating that investigation. On June 13, 1994, we sent the antidumping questionnaire to the Ukrainian Embassy and the two Ukrainian manufacturers of pure magnesium, Concern Chlorvinyl and Zaporozhye Titanium and Magnesium Plant. (The antidumping questionnaire was divided into three sections: section A requesting general information on each company; section C requesting information on, and a listing of, U.S. sales made during the period of investigation (``POI''); and, section D requesting information on the production process, including specific amounts of each input used in manufacturing pure magnesium.) We requested the Embassy's assistance in forwarding the questionnaire to all exporters and producers of pure magnesium from Ukraine and submitting complete questionnaire responses on their behalf. On August 8, 1994, the Department postponed its preliminary determination until October 27, 1994 (59 FR 42200, August 17, 1994).
