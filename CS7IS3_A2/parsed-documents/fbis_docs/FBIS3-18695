The Nordic prime ministers, meeting in Stockholm, thought it important that the Russian soldiers should withdraw from Estonia and Latvia by the end of August as Russia has promised. Prime Minister Esko Aho stressed that Finland will not offer to act a mediator in the dispute, even though Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will be visiting Finland at the end of the week. According to Aho, it is important for Finland, however, to maintain contacts with both sides. The prime ministers of the Baltic countries were also in Stockholm today. Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar stressed that the Russian troops pose no direct military threat to Estonia, but the issues concern environmental problems and crime.
