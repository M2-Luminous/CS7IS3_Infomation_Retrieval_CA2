Hiroshi Takauchi, president, said the company's plant currently has an annual production capacity of 49 million audio and 13.4 million video cassettes. The plant occupies 52,000 square metres of land at Ladkrabang industrial estate. Its registered capital is Bt272 million and it employs 540 staff. He said the company has invested [yen] Y400 million to increase capacity to 107 million audio and 20 million video cassettes. The firm is in the process of installing machines and expects to begin production in October this year. He said the company currently exports 98 per cent of output to Europe, Japan, the US and Southeast Asia. Europe is the biggest market for exports, accounting for more than 50 per cent of the total volume, followed by Southeast Asia with 30 per cent, Japan with 10 per cent and the US, 10 per cent. The company plans to increase domestic sales to 20 per cent of total sales. Audio cassettes will be the major products, which should account for 70 per cent of the domestic sales. He said the domestic market is affected by "dumped" products from Korea and Taiwan. For Sony, several components and raw materials have to be imported from Japan resulting in higher costs. For fiscal 1993 which will end next month, the company expected exports of Bt1 billion. It hopes to increase sales 150 per cent by the end of 1994. He said the company also suffered from the strengthening of the yen which raised costs by 5 per cent. The company plans to invest Y50 million to shift production of small parts of audio and video cassettes to Thailand. Three or four items will be produced here this year. Local production will reduce costs by 3 per cent. Some components such as punching dies and mold dies cannot be produced domestically. The company is looking for supporting industries to supply these components to the plant. Thailand will be a production base for Sony in Southeast Asia. He said Thai staff can meet Sony's standards but a shortage of infrastructure such as roads and communications is still a problem.
