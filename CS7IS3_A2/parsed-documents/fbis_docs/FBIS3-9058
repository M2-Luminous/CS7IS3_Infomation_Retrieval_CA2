An MP for the Bulgarian Socialist Party asked the defence minister if some destabilization of the Bulgarian Army could be expected after some ten days ago part of the members of the Rakovski Officers Legion launched a sign-in for an address to the Ministry of Defence and parliament setting out their demands; the officers who signed the address were disciplined. The sign-in campaign is not a revolt against the Ministry of Defence as the press wrote, Mr. Aleksandrov said. In his opinion, the case is a reflection of the army's actual problems which have been raised and discussed more than once. The officers' major demand, out of 21, is unacceptable, Minister Aleksandrov said. It is for a budget appropriation of 37 billion leva for the army in 1994; under the National Budget Act which Parliament already passed, the army is allocated 12 billion. The 1994 Budget Act is already a fact and there is no room in the army for those who do not want to comply with it, the defence minister said. As to the other demands, Mr. Aleksandrov admits that "though disputable and badly worded, they are grounded to some extent." According to the defence minister, the real problem is not the officers' demands but the means they have used in trying to resolve the existing issues. He described the sign-in campaign as "a conspicuous violation of the Constitution and breach of the Armed Forces' statute"; in his opinion, the culprits got their just deserts: A commander was punished by a dishonourable discharge from the army on disciplinary grounds, the other officers who had taken part in the sign-in were disciplined. The defence minister said that according to a special poll conducted in the army by his order, the seeds of populism fell in good soil in the armed forces, while the financial difficulties and the opportunity for manipulations they offer could explode the situation.
