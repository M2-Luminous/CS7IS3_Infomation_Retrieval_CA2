An officer of the 6th Infantry Division based in the town of Dinaig said the hostilities began 27 January when a combined force of about 600 Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) fighters attacked three security checkpoints of the Consunji logging company. The logging company has been operating in the area for many years. Two security guards died during the attack on the checkpoints located a few kilometers from MILF's Camp Abubakar Sedik. Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for operations and concurrent chief-of-staff of the Bangsamoro Islamic Army, denied the military's allegations. Murad said the fighting started when combined forces of the logging company's security guards and the military encroached on and penetrated the defense perimeter area of their camp. Murad said there has been a standing formal agreement between the MILF and the government for a cease-fire. The agreement, respected until the incident of 27 January, was entered into in 1984. The clashes also constitute a gross violation of the ongoing government-MNLF cease-fire agreement, Murad said. The MILF, he added, had always supported the peace negotiations between the government and the MNLF and the cease-fire agreement forged earlier this month. The MILF, he said, has not been formally included in the ongoing peace talks but had pledged support to it. He hoped the clashes will not escalate into major hostilities. He called on all concerned to find ways to stop this even as he ordered MILF fighters and supporters in Mindanao to be on a more "active" defense posture.
