In an interview with the No. 2 German television station ZDF, Woerner said that NATO does not intend to send ground troops to the region. The NATO chief said the western alliance favors negotiations backed with "limited military actions" in hopes of giving a push to the negotiating process. His statement came after NATO launched its second air raid earlier in the day on Serb positions around the U.N.-designated safe area of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. NATO bombed on Sunday and Monday Serb positions around the Muslim enclave in order to halt the Serb advance and protect U.N. personnel there from the Serb attackers. U.N. special envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi, who authorized the two air strikes in less than 24 hours, warned Serbs of more air raids if they continue attacking Gorazde. Woerner hoped the air strikes would produce "expected results" as was the case in Sarajevo, Earlier this year, NATO succeeded in making Serbs withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo and lift the siege of the Bosnian capital by threatening air strikes against Serbs.
