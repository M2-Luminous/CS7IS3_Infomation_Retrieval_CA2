FR941212-0-00008 FR941212-0-00005 14 CFR Part 73 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ASW&hyph;11] Alteration and Subdivision of Restricted Area R&hyph;5111C and Establishment of R&hyph;5111D; NM AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action modifies Restricted Area R&hyph;5111C, Elephant Butte, NM, by vertically subdividing the area into two separate areas designated as R&hyph;5111C and R&hyph;5111D. The present vertical dimension of R&hyph;5111C is from the surface to unlimited. This action will amend R&hyph;5111C to 13,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) to unlimited and establish R&hyph;5111D from the surface to but not including 13,000 feet MSL. The lateral dimensions will remain the same. Stratification of the present R&hyph;5111C will enable the military to activate only that portion of the airspace that is actually needed to contain their operations. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, February 2, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steve Riley, Military Operations Program Office (ATM&hyph;420), Office of Air Traffic System Management, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;7130. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Rule This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations modifies Restricted Area R&hyph;5111C, Elephant Butte, NM, by vertically subdividing the area into two separate areas designated as R&hyph;5111C and R&hyph;5111D. This action does not change the activities conducted in the area. This action will create an effective management tool for the military by allowing it to activate only that portion of the special use airspace that it needs to contain hazardous activities. This action does not alter the boundaries of restricted airspace, nor is the mission conducted within the airspace changed, therefore, I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public is not particularly interested. The coordinates for this docket are based on North American Datum 83. Section 73.51 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8B dated March 9, 1994. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Environmental Review Since this action will not change the type of activity conducted in this airspace and does not alter the geographic boundaries of this airspace, the FAA has determined that this action is not subject to environmental assessments and procedures pursuant to FAA Order 1050.1D, ``Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts'' and the National Environmental Policy Act.
