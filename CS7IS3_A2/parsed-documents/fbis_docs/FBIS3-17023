Kondratyev said, the losses were 53 dead and 77 wounded in Tajikistan, 28 dead and 60 wounded in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. The corresponding figures are 16/25 in Transdniestria, 6/15 in Abkhazia, 2/1 in South Ossetia and 2/15 in former Yugoslavia. Kondratyev did not think that any group of countries or international organization would be able to perform peace missions as effectively as Russian troops in the former USSR. Answering an Interfax question Kondratyev said that the country had spent 26 Bn [billion] rubles for peacekeeping activities in 1993. He thought that this amount would increase in 1994. He emphasized that the money had been made available by the Defense Ministry and that the Peacekeeping Activities Bill under consideration in the State Duma called for financing such operations from the state budget. Kondratyev said that the Russian Defense Ministry would deploy its observers in the Karabakh war zone within two or three days, once the waring sides separated and a security zone set up.
