The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the recently released U.S. "Annual Report on Human Rights in the World" statement that the DPRK violates human rights was a "shameless intervention" into DPRK's internal affairs. The U.S. move was aimed at harming DPRK's image so as to isolate the country in the international community, said the agency. In fact, it stressed, the government of the DPRK guarantees genuine freedom and rights for all citizens. On the other hand, it added, the United States is one of the countries that most gravely tramples human rights. The KCNA urged the United States to immediately stop activities which attack the DPRK and socialism using the excuse of "human rights issue."
