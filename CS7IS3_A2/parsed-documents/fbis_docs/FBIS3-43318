Saro-Wiwa is president of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP), a minority rights pressure group representing about 500,000 people. Soldiers arrived Sunday morning at his residence in the oil city, surrounded the premises and prevented Saro-Wiwa from going out and receiving visitors, the reports said. Also held in the building with him were members of his family and some visitors who were there the previous night. The telephone lines of Saro-Wiwa, a former president of the Association of Nigerian Authors, appeared to have been tampered with and AFP was unable to contact him on Tuesday morning. Saro-Wiwa was detained for some two months last year by the previous military regime of General Ibrahim Babangida for championing the cause of the Ogoni, who have in past years complained about what they describe as the neglect, injustice and degradation suffered by their community despite the fact that large amounts of crude oil, the mainstay of the economy, are produced in their area. The Ogonis are one of some 250 ethnic groups in Nigeria. Ledum Mitee, MOSOP deputy president, and Monday Wiwa, another MOSOP official, were a week ago led away by soldiers to an unknown destination, the reports said. Their arrests appeared related to the authorities' decision to abort the celebration of an "Ogoni week" scheduled to start on December 28 and to which Saro-Wiwa was invited as a guest speaker. The Campaign for Democracy (CD), an umbrella organisation for human rights groups, has condemned the arrests of these minority rights activists in a statement and called for their immediate release.
