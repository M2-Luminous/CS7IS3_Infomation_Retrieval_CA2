The following day, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution, calling on the Clinton administration to unilaterally lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. In response to this, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev pointed out in Moscow on 14 June that such a move would lead to a complicated political situation. General Ross, commander of the UN peacekeeping force in Bosnia, expressed disappointment, saying that the U.S. congressional decision was tantamount to "undermining the Bosnian peace process." In September 1991 the UN Security Council passed a resolution calling on all countries to impose an arms embargo on all republics in the former Yugoslavia. The current U.S. congressional decision actually wants the U.S. Government to ignore the Security Council resolution and act independently. Judging from their reactions, the relevant quarters obviously find it hard to understand and cannot agree with the idea of unilaterally lifting the arms embargo. On the question of maintaining the arms embargo on all parties in the Bosnian conflict, there always have been differences of opinion between the United States, the European alliance, and Russia. The United States has constantly stressed that failure to provide arms to the Muslims has "undermined the military balance among all the parties in Bosnia" and is "not conducive to the peace process." In the view of European countries, however, the argument that it would be conducive to peace to provide a large amount of weapons to a certain party in Bosnia is "illogical." Although the United States intends to lift the arms embargo on the Muslims, it does not want to act alone for fear that this would undermine cooperation with the allies and Russia on the Bosnian issue and would bring about "serious consequences." The aforementioned resolution of the U.S. Congress has deepened people's impression: Just as the Bosnian peace process is making some headway, there seem to be some discordant voices coming from the United States to cause fluctuations in the peace process. People still remember that when the seven foreign ministers of the United States, Europe, and Russia reached an agreement on the Bosnian issue in Geneva a month ago, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution calling on the government to unilaterally lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. It aroused a strong reaction from the Russian parliament. On this occasion, just as the three parties in Bosnia had reached a cease-fire agreement, the U.S. Congress again called on the government to unilaterally lift the arms embargo on Bosnia in an attempt to place its own resolution above that of the Security Council. The month-long cease-fire agreement reached in Geneva among the three parties in Bosnia is the first complete cease-fire agreement reached by all parties since the Bosnian civil war broke out two years ago. It was not easy to come by and generally has held so far. All parties to the Bosnian conflict, as well as the major powers concerned, should treasure this achievement. Particularly in a crucial situation, it is better to act with prudence.
