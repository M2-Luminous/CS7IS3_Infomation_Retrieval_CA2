Archbishop Tutu said the conflict in Thokoza had been brought under control by the SADF in recent months, but it had again intensified since the withdrawal to the point when 19 people had died violently since the weekend. The church, said Archbishop Tutu, had supported the formation of the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF], but the NPKF was being asked to do an impossible job. "Reports from church members indicate there is a strong desire that the SADF should return and we call on the Transitional Executive Council as a matter of urgency to send the soldiers back."
