PT candidate Lula has said that he wants to revise the agreement. How would a prospective PT government address the Brazilian foreign debt issue? [Mercadante] We are not planning to begin the government with any unilateral measure, but the PT believes that the debt remains a major foreign policy issue. First, the guarantees that the agreement demanded from Brazil are totally inappropriate. The cost of obtaining the reserves ($2.5 billion) for guaranteeing the accord was tremendous for public finances. The guarantees are absolutely unacceptable. It was an agreement made by a weak, dismantled government that had no political support. We cannot allow that instead of Brazil managing its debt, the debt should manage Brazil. This will not happen with our government. [FOLHA] The debt agreement that was negotiated is better than the agreement signed by Mexico and Argentina. [Mercadante] In those cases the countries received money from the International Monetary Fund to finance their guarantees, something that did not happen with Brazil. The fact that the economic plan was not ready, and that the IMF refused to provide the funds, proves that the agreement was hastily concluded. Why wasn't it possible to wait two more months after 11 years of negotiations? [FOLHA] What will be the party position toward foreign investment in Brazil in areas like the stock exchange? Will that money be considered speculation capital? [Mercadante] We want development to promote our massive consumer market, and to this end we need investment, foreign investment. We want to attract that money, and stock markets are mechanisms for attracting it. Yet we have to see that the money is used for economic growth, creating long-range financing funds. We must be competent to attract that money. Otherwise, it will end up going somewhere else. [FOLHA] Isn't there any bias over the money that enters or leaves the stock market? [Mercadante] Not at all. What we have been unable to do is to transform the capital inflow in productive investment. We will not solve the problems by either closing the markets or rejecting the money. Our economy must remain open, but we should also reform the financial system in order to attract productive investment.
