'Arafat, at the end of a two-day visit, said that continued "manoeuvering and marking time" by Israel in concluding the Israeli-PLO autonomy deal would only "give a chance to all extremist elements on both sides to undermine the peace process." "The 13th of April, the final day to finalize the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho passed and nothing concrete happened," he said during a press conference before his departure. He added that Israel "must bear responsibility in all events" and accused Rabin of stalling the peace negotiations on purpose. "Rabin is not in a hurry because he has received from America the price of peace: all kinds of armaments, state of the art, including 25 airplanes, the hugest and very sophisticated computers, a garantee for a 10-million-dollar credit, all kinds of financial, economic, political and diplomatic help," he said. "This had been achieved before the implementation of the accord." 'Arafat called for Russia as a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process along with the United States to press the Israeli prime minister, when he visits Moscow next week, "not to waste time."
