Mayor Li told a press conference that the bonded capital goods market will become a national market where prices are about five to ten percent lower than those on the world market. Foreign investors in China can buy whatever imported products they need in Shenzhen instead of going abroad so as to lower production costs, he added. The Shenzhen bonded capital goods market has 12 affiliates specializing in various kinds of capital goods, with a total transaction reaching 400 million U.S. dollars in 1993. The opening of the market, he said, will help bring the role of the city as a coastal special economic zone and an economic information center into fuller play.
