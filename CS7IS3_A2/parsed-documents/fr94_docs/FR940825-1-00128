FR940825-1-00128 FR940825-1-00009 C. Executive Order (EO) 12875 EO 12875 is intended to reduce the imposition of unfunded mandates upon State, local and Tribal governments. To that end, it calls for Federal agencies to refrain, to the extent feasible and permitted by law, from promulgating any regulation that is not required by statute and that creates a mandate upon a State, local, or Tribal government, unless funds for complying with the mandate are provided by the Federal government or the Agency first consults with affected State, local and Tribal governments. The issuance of this proposed rule is required by statute. Section 301(d) of the CAA directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations specifying those provisions of the Act for which it is appropriate to treat Indian Tribes as States. Moreover, this proposed rule would not place mandates on Indian Tribes. Rather, as discussed in section V.B above, this rule authorizes or enables Tribes to demonstrate their eligibility to be treated in the same manner as States under the Clean Air Act and to submit CAA programs for the provisions specified by the Administrator. Further, the proposed rule also explains how Tribes seeking to develop and submit CAA programs to EPA for approval may qualify for Federal financial assistance. D. Paperwork Reduction Act OMB has approved the information collection requirements pertaining to grants applications contained in this rule under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. and has assigned OMB control number 2030&hyph;0020. This collection of information pertaining to the grants application process has an estimated reporting burden averaging 29 hours per response and an estimated annual recordkeeping burden averaging 3 hours per respondent. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The information collection requirements in this proposed rule pertaining to an Indian Tribe's application for eligibility to be treated in the same manner as a State or ``treatment as a State'' have been submitted for approval to OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 1676.01) and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M St., SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. This collection of information for Treatment in the Same Manner as States (TISMAS) to carry out the Clean Air Amendments has an estimated reporting burden of 20 annual responses, averaging 40 hours per response and an estimated annual recordkeeping burden averaging 800 hours. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of these collections of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M St., SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will be accompanied with responses to OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal. VI. Request for Public Comments EPA requests public comments on all aspects of today's proposal, including the following: EPA's proposed interpretation of the Clean Air Act as delegating to Tribes jurisdiction over all air resources within the exterior boundaries of the reservation; EPA's proposed interpretation of the term ``reservation''; EPA's proposed interpretation that in enacting the CAA, Congress found that the activities regulated under the Act constitute a class of activities that, if left unregulated, could have serious and substantial adverse effects on public health and welfare, and accordingly, that these activities would generally be within the inherent civil regulatory authority of Tribes; EPA's position regarding Federally-administered Clean Air Act programs to provide protection for Tribal air resources; EPA's proposed implementation of its policy for streamlining eligibility determinations; the CAA provisions for which EPA is proposing to treat Indian Tribes as States, and the proposed exceptions that EPA has identified in this rule; EPA's general approach to encourage Tribal participation by allowing Tribes to submit reasonably severable portions of CAA programs; EPA's proposed procedures for reviewing Tribal air programs, including Tribal implementation plans developed under Title I of the CAA; EPA's proposed revisions to its implementing regulations, and; EPA's proposed administration of Federal financial assistance to Tribes. VII. Electronic Filing of Comments A public docket has been established for this proposed rule under docket number ``A&hyph;93&hyph;3087'' (including comments and data submitted electronically as described below). The public docket is located in M1500, 401 M Street, Washington, DC 20460. The information contained in this public docket, including printed, paper versions of electronic comments is available for inspection from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday thru Friday, excluding legal holidays. Starting October 1, 1994, the docket will be open 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., excluding legal holidays. As part of an interagency ``streamlining'' initiative, EPA is experimenting with submission of public comments on selected rulemaking actions electronically through the Internet in addition to accepting comments in traditional written form. This proposed rule is one of the rulemaking actions selected by EPA for this experiment. From the experiment, EPA will learn how electronic commenting works, and any problems that arise can be addressed before EPA adopts electronic commenting more broadly in its rulemaking activities. Electronic commenting through posting to the EPA Bulletin Board or through the Internet using the ListServe function raise some novel issues that are discussed below in this Section.
