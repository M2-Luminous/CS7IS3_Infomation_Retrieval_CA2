The king said, well, he addresses the people. This was the address by King Goodwill Zwelithini a short while ago: [Zwelithini] The long awaited election has been held in our country, on the 26th, 27th, and 28th, and other regions were still finishing their voting process on 29 April, 1994. We all in our joyful stance witness the beginning of the new era in South Africa. We know that the international community has been watchfully monitoring the progress of change in this country, and that they have contributed a lot toward that direction. I, as the king of the Zulu nation, wish the entire South African community a joyful and prosperous transition toward their freedom. I say these things knowing full well that we still have a very long and hard road to travel. By voting we have just taken the first step toward the direction of our destiny, and we still have to take a million more steps to accomplish our freedom. At the outset I wish to sound a very clear warning to you, the people of South Africa. I know that we have suffered uncomfortable misfortunes for many hundreds of years under the then apartheid system. I therefore wish to warn that whichever party wins the election, we must not celebrate that victory to the detriment of our well-being. People must not over enjoy themselves in such a way that other people might feel offended. We must not celebrate our victory in a way that will shame our freedom and our country. We must teach ourselves from the outset to respect other people and properties because that is our philosophy of ubuntu [humanity]. It is my wish as king of the people, that the people must realize the basic necessities of life. Killing one another is surely not a basic necessity of life. I therefore urge you to stop doing unnecessary things. Rather take a good look at yourselves and try to understand what freedom means to you. I have a very good understanding of that. It means dedication and hard work. I therefore once again wish to appeal to the people of KwaZulu-Natal, and the rest of South Africa, to turn their backs against violence and squarely face the future. Having said these things I now wish to place a challenge to you, the people of this country. You have now fought, won the battle, and political freedom. Let us now join hands and fight to win the battles of poverty, disease and ignorance. To me that is the final attainment of freedom. The international community has helped us to win our political freedom. Let us now challenge them in unison to help us win our final freedom, which is freedom to know, freedom to practice, and freedom to do. We have been promised by our political parties a lot of good things. Let us give them a chance to practice what they have been promising. I myself am very keen on developmental projects, and I therefore promise to lead exemplarily toward that direction. A nation without development projects is doomed to fail. I urge you to join hands to develop South Africa to its maximum. In conclusion I wish to thank the people of KwaZulu-Natal for heeding my call to go to vote. Let the example that you have shown in this crucial period be the (?feet) to carry you in more years to come. I want to thank the Almighty God for having saved the entire South Africa through the important period of our history, and I pray that you should now go back to your roots and practice ubuntu.
