The meeting was also attended for Romania by Mr. Dan Martian, parliamentary deputy and PDSR vice president, Grigore Zanc, prefect of Cluj County, and Dumitru Paslaru, deputy. Here is a dispatch from Budapest by our correspondent Dorin Suciu. [Begin Suciu recording] The meeting that the two party presidents held this morning was an opportunity for a first contact between them. The sides examined aspects of Hungarian-Romanian relations and the PDSR-MSZP relations. In the afternoon, the talks focused on the integration of the two countries into the European Union and NATO. During a news conference after the talks, MSZP President Gyula Horn said: There is a need for a historic reconciliation between Hungary and its neighbors. In concrete terms, this means that we should push aside the so-called prejudices or historical injustices, or at least remove them from the sphere of politics. Otherwise, they will continue to be a source of tension. Let us leave it up to the scientists and historians to elucidate the white or dark spots in our common history. In the MSZP's opinion, it is possible to reach a common denominator on the issue of the basic treaty between the two countries, Gyula Horn said. An essential aspect of this treaty is Point No. 4, that is recognition of the integrity of borders and, closely related to that aspect, the full ensurance of the rights of the minorities living on the territory of the two countries. One would like to see a law on minorities being passed in Romania and Hungarian-language education based on legal grounds. The MSZP president expressed serious reservations on these two issues. According to Horn, the Hungarian minorities both in Romania and Slovakia should enjoy internal self-determination. I do not want to be misunderstood, the MSZP president emphasized. I am referring to an administrative autonomy in the regions inhabited by compact masses of Hungarians. We have reservations about the way in which the new Romanian Constitution safeguards the rights of the minorities. Of course, this is an internal matter, but we would positively receive a possible modification along these lines, Mr. Horn added. The socialist leader also emphasized the need to enhance economic and trade relations and advocated closer links and more contacts between the parliamentary deputies and politicians of the two countries. I found in the PDSR a constructive partner and I am convinced that future talks at expert level and a subsequent meeting at a higher level would lead to a mutual understanding, Mr Gyula Horn said in conclusion. As far as PDSR President Mr. Oliviu Gherman is concerned, he said that the following: From the list of problems raised by President Gyula Horn, one might come to the erroneous conclusion that there is a huge number of unsolved problems between the two countries and that we are only at the beginning of the road. Then, Mr. Oliviu Gherman continued: [Gherman] In reality, many problems have been resolved and I express the conviction that, with the signing of the fundamental treaty of cooperation between the two countries, we will create conditions for solving the key problems remaining between our two states. I would like to point out that the party I am representing sets out from the premise that real relations of friendship and cooperation should be established between the two countries. Unfortunately, the absence of a fundamental treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two countries has generated a sentiment of suspicion, at least in Romania. The resolution of the problem of the minorities in Romania is fully covered by the constitutional stipulation which confirms the prevalence of the provisions of the international laws on human rights endorsed by the organizations to which Romania belongs over the internal laws. This means -- if not explicitly, at least implicitly -- that we are fully aligning ourselves to international standards in the matter. I would like to stress that the MSZP statement gave us the feeling that we must start these initiatives to accelerate the normalization of the relations between the two countries and even raise them to a higher level. We express the hope that -- after the commissions of experts Mr. President Horn referred to are going to start putting together a list of problems and various ways and means for their resolution -- we will reach a situation wherein the two parties will develop relations of preferential cooperation links. [Suciu] At the end of the news conference, MSZP President Gyula Horn was asked the following question by a journalist: If you become head of government, will you also say, as your predecessors Joszef Antall and Peter Boross, that you consider yourself spiritually the prime minister of 15 million Hungarians? The socialist leader gave the following answer: I would not like to make forecasts in connection with the post of premier. However, if this were to happen, I would refrain from such statements, which are bound to irritate our neighbors. In my opinion, the future government should establish the best possible relations with our neighbors. On the other hand, it should do everything that it can to ensure the rights of the Hungarian minorities living beyond the borders. [end recording]
