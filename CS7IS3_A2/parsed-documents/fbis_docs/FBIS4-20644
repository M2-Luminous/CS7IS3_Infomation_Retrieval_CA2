The liposome was developed as a way to extract useful products made by cells in a new type of bioreactor being developed in Japan called the micro-cell reactor. But it also appears to be a promising vehicle for delivery of drugs to target cells in the body. The work was carried out by the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology's National Institute of Bioscience and Human-Technology. The liposome readily fuses with fatty membranes because it incorporates the same protein that the influenza virus uses to breach the cell membrane and infect cells. Cholesterol and another compound are mixed. This viral protein is then affixed around the periphery, producing a protein-studded liposome less than a micron in diameter. When these liposomes and red blood cells are mixed in a neutral solution, nothing happens. But when the acidity is raised a little, as many as 80 percent of the liposomes fuse with the red blood cells. This experiment shows that it is possible to control fusion events between the liposomes and cells. The micro-cell reactor differs from conventional bioreactors in that all processes, from the introduction of raw materials and energy, to the final stage of production when it is time to extract useful substances, takes place inside living cells. The process is designed to boost productivity. The national institute developed the liposome as part of its effort to develop an exocyte system to extract useful products from the reactor.
