The certification notice was published in the Federal Register on September 2, 1994 (59 FR 45711). At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The Department is changing the March 25, 1993 impact date to August 25, 1994 for the subject workers at Beloit, Wisconsin because they were already covered for certification under petition TA&hyph;W&hyph;27,235 which expired on August 25, 1994. Accordingly, the Department is amending the subject certification by deleting the old impact date of March 25, 1993 and inserting a new impact date of August 25, 1994. The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,737 is hereby issued as follows: All workers of United Industries, Inc., Beloit, Wisconsin engaged in the production of stainless steel tubing who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after August 25, 1994 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.
