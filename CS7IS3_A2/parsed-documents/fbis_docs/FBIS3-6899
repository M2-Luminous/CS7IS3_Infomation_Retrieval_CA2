The bill, to be sent soon to the Diet for approval, stipulates the retirement age should "not be below 60" but exempts jobs which are considered difficult for older workers. It also gives the labor minister the authority to recommend that employers secure jobs for employees until 65. The bill, which would revise a law on job security for older workers, also contains a relaxation of restrictions on the kinds of jobs temporary workers are permitted to perform. Under existing law, temporary staff are allowed for only 16 kinds of jobs, such as translators and secretaries, but the bill would expand the scope for older workers to include all jobs except cargo handling at ports, construction and security.
