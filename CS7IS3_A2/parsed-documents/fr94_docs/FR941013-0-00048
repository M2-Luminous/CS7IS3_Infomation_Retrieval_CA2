FR941013-0-00048 FR941013-0-00025 Administrative Matters Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. §§601&hyph;12, the Commission's final analysis with respect to the Fifth Order on Reconsideration is as follows: Need and purpose of this action. The Commission, in compliance with section 3(i) of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 pertaining to rate regulation, adopts rules and procedures intended to ensure cable subscribers of reasonable rates for cable services with minimum regulatory and administrative burden on cable entities. Sumary of issues raised by the public comments in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. There were no comments submitted in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the United States Small Business Administration filed comments in the original rulemaking order (``SBA''). The Commission addressed the concerns raised by the SBA in the First Report and Order, MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266, FCC 93&hyph;177. The SBA filed reply comments in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;215 and the Small Cable Business Association filed reply comments in MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266. Those comments will be reviewed as part of the instant Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Significant alternatives considered and rejected. Petitioners representing cable interests and franchising authorities submitted several alternatives aimed at minimizing administrative burdens. The Commission responded to these comments in previous Orders in these dockets. Although the Commission is issuing this Fifth Order on Reconsideration on its own motion, the Commission has attempted to accommodate commenters' concerns and to reduce administrative burdens by providing an additional period of time for small cable operators to comply with the rate regulations.
