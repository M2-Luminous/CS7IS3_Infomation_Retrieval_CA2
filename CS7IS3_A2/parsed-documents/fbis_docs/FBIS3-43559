About 500 AZAPO central Wits [Witwatersrand] region members also decided at a meeting in Dobsonville, Soweto, that "hostile media" would be targeted and that an anti-election drive would soon be started. The meeting vowed to remove any NP or DP poster found in black townships, saying that it was "undemocratic and opportunistic for oppressors to organise among the oppressed people of Azania". The DP and NP should put up their posters in white areas, the meeting resolved. It was further decided that the newly formed campaign committee would conduct "house-to-house voter education" in Alexandra and Bekkersdal. From next week the committee will also be visiting Lenasia, Eldorado Park, greater Soweto, Mohlakeng, Kagiso to introduce AZAPO's anti-election campaign. The region further resolved to take "immediate action against hostile media... by all means necessary". No specific newspaper or news organisation was mentioned. The meeting also called for the immediate release of all detained Azanian Liberation Army cadres.
