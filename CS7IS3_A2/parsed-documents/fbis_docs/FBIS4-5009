If Matsushita is appointed to the BOJ position, although he was a former career official of the Ministry of Finance including service as a vice minister, he will be the first governor with private banking industry experience since Governor Jun Usami who served with the BOJ from 1964 to 1969 after an earlier career with the Mitsubishi Bank. News of the strong potential for appointment of a governor with a "private industry background" has already caused ripples in financial circles. Officials of the leading city banks worry that, "Perhaps the appointment of a BOJ governor with private banking industry experience when the condition of banks has weakened will pose difficulties." Governor Usami who had gone to work for the BOJ after serving as president of the Mitsubishi Bank won fame for his actions in implementing a special BOJ loan and resolving the difficulties of Yamaichi Securities in coordination with Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka during the securities market panic of 1965. The current situation is similar in that we face a financial recession following the collapse of the bubble, but the foremost difference is that the recession is not limited to the securities firms but encompasses the structural weakening of banks. Government aid in the 1965 recession was limited to the securities firms, but the current recession is expected to require some form of aid for banks as well. There is the fear that "if the BOJ governor is one that has a private banking background, he may examine the banks with a prejudiced eye." On the other hand, it is a fact that hope is being placed on the appointment of a governor with solid experience in banking operations as reflected by some who say, "Mr. Matsushita has private banking experience as well as a career background with the Ministry of Finance. He's the best candidate for the position in terms of the coming age." The Sakura Bank at which Mr. Matsushita serves as chairman has avoided the issuance of official comments noting that, "An official decision has not been made." However, other banks take the view that, "Sakura Bank is not in a position to celebrate the potential appointment on an unqualified basis." Mr. Matsushita was appointed as president of the former Taiyo-Kobe Bank in 1987 and collaborated with current Sakura Bank President Kenichi Suematsu to complete a merger with the Mitsui Bank in 1990. From prior times, there was a history of coordinating roles played by former Ministry of Finance vice ministers between the former Taiyo and Kobe Banks. Even after the Sakura Bank was formed, Chairman Matsushita observed procedures whereby he would first coordinate with officials within the former Taiyo-Kobe Banks on important personnel actions and then consult with President Suematsu. Some banking officials take the position that departure of Mr. Matsushita who has provided strong support for the former Taiyo-Kobe banking system may "pose some difficulties for the Sakura Bank." However, Sakura Bank officials stress that they have reached the final phase of the merger actions to include the integration of former Taiyo-Kobe and former Mitsui Bank personnel departments in June and that, "Even if Chairman Matsushita departs, we should have no problems." Even some rival banks take the view that, "The departure of a coordinating official will mean that parties concerned will cease to present parochial positions and former Taiyo and Kobe Bank elements will exercise a greater degree of solidarity." Nine months remain before the appointment of the new BOJ governor and many obscure facets remain in the race for the next governor to include future political developments. The true sentiment in private banking circles appears to be that "We are not too sure that we can be positive about a BOJ Governor Matsushita."
