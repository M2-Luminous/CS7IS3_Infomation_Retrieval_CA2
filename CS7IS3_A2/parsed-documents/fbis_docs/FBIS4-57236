No matter how hard he tries to hide it, however, he knows that everyone is aware of his key role in these events. When he occupied the choicest office at La Moneda, he was instrumental in the first chapter of the current imbroglio, which culminated with the resignation of General Cesar Mendoza. Now, given the weight his opinion carries in the Armed Forces, he has a monumental influence on what happens in the crisis that has placed General Rodolfo Stange's head on the block. The general had agreed to this interview before the crisis broke, and it was supposed to focus on the release of the second part of Volume 3 of his memoirs and on his current concerns. In the event, however, the general revealed some valuable hints about his position on this new chapter. He also discussed a number of other issues, such as his relations with the current government, his conversations with Margaret Thatcher, and the wasted opportunity to privatize the Copper Corporation (Codelco). [Bofill] When you were president, the case of the beheadings came to light, and the solution adopted was the departure of Cesar Mendoza, then director general of the Carabineros. Do you think that the same thing should be done now with Gen. Rodolfo Stange? [Pinochet] I did not oust Gen. Mendoza. That case led to a series of problems that raised many obstacles. The general chose to tender his resignation and to clear the way for the removal of obstacles. It was his decision. [Bofill] Did you suggest to him at that time that he obey his conscience, as the current government has done in the case of Gen. Stange? [Pinochet] To tell someone to obey his conscience, you have to be rather monastic, rather...ascetic. [Bofill] Why? [Pinochet] Because you cannot have a devil selling crosses. It is like having a sinful person tell another person not to commit sins. There is a reason why Christ said that he who was without sin should cast the first stone, and no one threw any stones. What we have now is a whole lot of Pharisees casting the first stone. That has to be examined very closely. This problem is very deep; it has other facets. [Bofill] What other facets? [Pinochet] There is a trial that has not finished yet. It is in progress. The final word has not been spoken. As I said, you have to look at other facets. As for the comparison with the case of Gen. Mendoza, this is quite different. Mendoza, who wanted to clear up matters, was a member of the Military Junta. He was in the government. But now Gen. Stange is only director general of the Carabineros. He does not have any government responsibilities, as the other general did. [Bofill] Aside from that difference, do you believe that Gen. Stange should step down? [Pinochet] That is up to him. I cannot tell him whether he should resign. I do not know. I cannot get into Gen. Stange's head. [Bofill] It is known that Gen. Stange has talked to you and asked for your opinion. What did you tell him? [Pinochet] You are wrong. I have not talked to Gen. Stange about this matter. [Bofill] But you do, at least, admit that you have talked about it with Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma? [Pinochet] What I have talked about with the defense minister are matters related to the Army and the ministry. We have talked about the military missions and the visits he plans to make to Army units. I have not discussed this issue with either Gen. Stange or the defense minister. [Bofill] Does that mean that your position on the matter will be made public only if the government convenes the National Security Council to propose the retirement of Gen. Stange? [Pinochet] In my opinion, it should think more than twice before convening the National Security Council. In the first place, it is questionable whether this case falls within the purview of the National Security Council. [Bofill] But that is the legal mechanism the government has available to it to bring about the retirement of Stange or of the commanders in chief of the other branches. [Pinochet] Yes, that is the legal mechanism. But it should think twice before using it, because it is an extreme measure. You go to the National Security Council after numerous events have taken place, and once you get there, that is the end of the line. Everything ends there. That is why I say it is an extreme measure. [Bofill] For that same reason, would it not be a good idea to go right away to the National Security Council to bring the matter to a conclusion as quickly as possible? [Pinochet] The problem lies in what I pointed out earlier: The situation should be studied very thoroughly, and everything should be considered several times before making a decision, because first it must be determined whether this is a matter for the Council to deal with. I will not tell you what my position is, but I do want to make it very clear that this problem must be analyzed through and through. [Bofill] Supposing that the National Security Council is ultimately convened. How would you vote? [Pinochet] That will be revealed at the time of the vote. [Bofill] When there were problems between the Army and La Moneda in the previous administration, there were some very tense times, such as the liaison exercise and the so-called boinazo [display of force by the military in May 1993]. Do you think similar situations could occur now between the Carabineros and the current administration? [Pinochet] I cannot tell you anything about the current situation in the Carabineros. What I want to make very clear is that during the previous administration, the Army always respected the law that was in effect at the time. On the other hand, I think that the periods of good relations far outweigh those that you have mentioned, and in any case, they were resolved satisfactorily. [Bofill] With regard to the human rights cases involving the Army, what problems do you see in the future? [Pinochet] I do not see any problem in the future. The normal course of action is being taken. The majority of the cases have qualified for amnesty. What problem could there be? [Bofill] The case of General Manuel Contreras, for example. [Pinochet] And why will there be a problem in that case? He had his trial, the case is on appeal, and ultimately a final judgment will be forthcoming. I do not see any hindrance. The courts are handling pending human rights cases, and that is the branch of government that will make the final decision, and that decision, of course, will be respected. [Bofill] Many people say you seem more serene than before, and they say it is due to.... [Pinochet] (Laughing) Due to my age, no doubt. [Bofill] Some may think that. But the majority say it is because you have good relations with the new government, especially with Minister Perez Yoma. [Pinochet] There are several things going on there. I like to see military matters treated as military matters, without interference from people who want to insert issues that are of concern to people who know nothing about the military. Things must be viewed with professionalism. [Bofill] Does that mean that former Minister Patricio Rojas knew nothing about the military? [Pinochet] No, I am referring to people. What I am saying is that I see a difference in the approach. Now, issues are dealt with, they are discussed, and ideas and concepts are seen with precision. It is very clear what actions will be taken. I see that difference. For me, it is very important for issues to be dealt with properly. I have been in the military for 62 years, and I have held every job. I have a lot of experience, and that is very valuable for a commander in chief. [Bofill] There has been a lot of talk about a number of signs that you are more in sync with this government. One of them is the fact that your wife recently attended a reception at La Moneda, where she had not set foot in four years. [Pinochet] Our visit to La Moneda was a friendly gesture. [passage omitted] [Bofill] Getting back to the previous administration, did the contact you had during that period with Socialists such as former Minister Enrique Correa change your opinion of that political sector? [Pinochet] I do not want to get into that, because it is a political matter. I will answer questions about the Army. I must be extremely prudent about this. [Bofill] One of the most controversial issues involving the Army recently was the departure of General Jorge Ballerino.... [Pinochet] That is a very simple problem. Gen. Ballerino was 10,000 kilometers away, and he saw the situation from a different perspective. Gen. Lucar was able to remain one more year in the job of vice commander in chief, which blocked the way for Gen. Ballerino. So he had to remain in the post of inspector general of the Army, which is the same as the chief of staff or the commander of the First Corps, because they all come under me. But someone butted in and gave him bad advice, and, well, everyone knows how things turned out. [Bofill] Who was it who butted in and gave him bad advice? [Pinochet] Someone. [passage omitted] [Bofill] You do acknowledge that you had problems with the United States. [Pinochet] No one has behaved more badly toward us than the Americans did during our time in government. I will always remember that. Today I refuse to buy as much as a rifle from the United States, because tomorrow I may have a problem and they will not give me ammunition. [passage omitted] [Bofill] One issue that is in the forefront throughout the world at this time is corruption. Can you say for certain that during the 17 years you were in power, not a single high-ranking official abused his office for some purpose? [Pinochet] I never had any complaints about my officials, with very few exceptions. And when I did have a complaint, I had the official investigated. The officials in my government, first of all, earned less than they do now, and people worked more for the good of Chile than for their own good. I had very dedicated mayors, and I had officials who could have earned 20 times more working for a bank than for the government. [Bofill] That is all very well, but human weaknesses do not recognize ideological or political borders. Why do you think the corruption issue is so hot now? [Pinochet] Well, because people want to own more things. And television and advertising undoubtedly contribute to that. Everyone wants to have a nice car, a nice house, a nice swimming pool, they want to have a good time, go to a nice place and be served a good whisky. Those things do not tempt me. Unfortunately, I do not drink, not even copper [yo no tomo ni cobre]... [Bofill] All of these temptations that you mention are seductive not only to civilians, but also to military men. To what extent are the low salaries in the Armed Forces a dangerous factor in the spread of corruption? [Pinochet] Look, it might be dangerous, but we take steps to make sure our men are well off. They are able to go on very inexpensive vacations, something that other people have to spend much more on. They wear uniforms, so they do not have to spend money on civilian clothing if they do not want to...I will not tell you they are not asking for raises--they do ask. The cost of living has gone up a lot, more than the CPI. You used to be able to fill your cart, buy a whole week's groceries at the store for 1,000 pesos. Now that does not buy enough for two days, not even one. They are asking for raises to cover necessities, but this is not a problem that can affect us in the sense that your question implies. [Bofill] One of the great contradictions that people mention about your government was that it never privatized Codelco. Why not? Do you think that if that had been done, scandals like the current one could have been avoided? [Pinochet] I do not buy the notion that scandals happen only in state-run companies. Scandals happen with or without privatization. [Bofill] But why did you not privatize Codelco as you did with so many other state-run companies? [Pinochet] In the first place, because it was important for national defense. It was thought that we needed to have all the copper in our hands. Later on, however, I favored privatizing it. What happened was that internal factions formed in opposition to it, and even though it was a good idea, I could not do it. [Bofill] You were in charge of this country. There were a lot of other things that people opposed, but you did them anyway.... [Pinochet] Well, there are things and there are things. As I said, if it were just up to me, Codelco would be in private hands right now. Do not forget that I was not alone. A number of steps had to be followed to privatize a company, and that was the idea. In the northern section, the southern section. It did not just happen. You cannot do everything. [Bofill] Former President Aylwin had a problem with the Codelco scandal that has affected you as well: seeing relatives involved in scandals. In your case, it was the matter of your eldest son's checks. How does that affect you? [Pinochet] I think it is a great injustice, because people immediately connect it with the person who is at the top. In the case of my son's checks, it was concluded that he was telling the truth. People kept the issue alive because I was commander in chief. The goal was to attack the commander in chief. [Bofill] Is that kind of problem more difficult to face than others? [Pinochet] (Smiling slyly and touching his left hand with the tips of his right fingers) In time, you develop a thick skin. You learn how to confront these things. I have the hide of a crocodile. [Bofill] Do you think former President Aylwin does, too? [Pinochet] Do not get me involved in that. [Bofill] Is it true you plan to travel to Russia? [Pinochet] I will tell you a story. I was invited to Russia, before Yeltsin assumed power. The people who brought me the invitation were right there where you are sitting and in the chair across from you. But later they came back and asked me to please postpone the trip for a little while because everyone was in the KGB. There was a woman who controlled them with her glance. Then the Yeltsin problem arose, and I did not have anything more to do with them. Since then, I have not accepted any invitations. But of course I would like to visit Russia, a country with a long history, and I like history a lot. [passage omitted]
