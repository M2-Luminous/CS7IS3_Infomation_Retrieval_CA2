These remarks were made by Qiao Shi, chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, in an interview with a local correspondent, Babara Scheer, from the "Deutsche Welle" (the Voice of Germany) here this evening. He said China and Germany have no fundamental conflict of interest, but shared many identical or similar views on international issues. Their mutually supplementary economies have laid a good basis for bilateral cooperation, he said Over the past few years, Qiao said due to the concerted efforts, bilateral ties have appeared a good momentum for development. Political relations between the two countries have been growing closer and economic ties and trade progressing, he said. During German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's China visit last November, he said the two sides signed a series of agreements, contracts and letters of intent in the fields of politics, economy, science and technology and culture. This demonstrates that the Sino-German ties have entered a new stage of the all-round development. Qiao said China always places great importance on developing its ties with Germany and hopes for strengthening such cooperation in political, economic and other areas. He said China is also willing to develop its long-term and stable relations with Germany according to the principles of seeking common ground while reserving differences, mutual respect, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit. "We hope that Germany will play greater roles in international affairs with a view to maintaining the world peace and development. "To conduct friendly cooperation between a reforming and opening up China and a unified and peace-loving Germany is not only in the interests of the two peoples, but also an important contribution to the world peace and development," he added. Answering a question on what kind of hope that he will place on his current visit to Germany, Qiao said "I hope my visit will help deepen our mutual understanding, expand exchanges and strengthen cooperation so as to newly promote such ties." At the correspondent's request, Qiao briefed him on the latest development of China's culture, economy and politics. He said China will continue to deepen its reform and open the door wider, focusing on its economic construction as its major task. Qiao stressed that China's policy of reform and opening up will remain unchanged because it has won a country-wide support and the people have got benefits from it.
