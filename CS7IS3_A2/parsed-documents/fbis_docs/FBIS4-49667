Over 200 delegates from the UN and international cartographic organizations and cartographic departments of various countries are attending the conference. At the opening ceremony, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing praised the UN's role in promoting international cartographic cooperation and development. The Chinese Government has always encouraged China's cartographic departments to strengthen economic and technological cooperation with their foreign counterparts, said the vice-premier. To date, China's cartographic management departments have signed contracts with cartographic organizations in more than 10 countries and set up technological cooperative relations with dozens of countries. Meanwhile, they have actively participated in related activities of the United Nations and international cartographic organizations, Li said. With a stable political situation and rapid economic development, China now is speeding up its reform and opening to the outside world, said Li. He hoped the United Nations and other countries in the world would support restoration of China's status as a signatory state to GATT so as to further promote China's economic development.
