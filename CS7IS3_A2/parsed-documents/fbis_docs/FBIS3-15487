He believes that this is a matter of relations between the suppliers and consumers not only in Russia but also abroad, including the CIS countries. He categorically denied the assertions that Russia was manipulating difficulties in this sphere in order to save energy for its own needs. We must get used to the idea that according to the market laws energy supplies must be regulated during talks between the supplier and consumer. The state, including the Ministry for Energy and Fuel, must not be involved in tackling such problems. Speaking about cuts in Russian gas exports to Ukraine, he emphasized that they had been caused by the Ukrainian consumers' debts, not by problems in Russian-Ukrainian relations.
