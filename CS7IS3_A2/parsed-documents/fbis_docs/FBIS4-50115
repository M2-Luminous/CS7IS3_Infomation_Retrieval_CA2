The meeting was held to popularize across the country the successful experience of the Wujin County CYL Committee in youth labor service cooperation. As many enterprises in Wujin county were in need of high-quality workers while a large number of migrant workers from out of town could not find jobs and caused social problems, the Wujin County CYL Committee actively introduced workers to enterprises from as early as July 1992. Over the last two years, the county CYL committee has introduced more than 3,000 qualified young people to some 200 enterprises in the county, with the quality of new workers guaranteed by "four documents" (CYL membership card, ID card, diploma, and proof of good physical condition). The retention rate of the new work force exceeds 90 percent, showing satisfaction among the enterprises, young workers, and parents. The economy-related new undertaking of the county CYL committee has been praised by the CYL Central Committee as the "rainbow project." Bayinqolu, secretary of the CYL Central Committee, said at the on-the-spot meeting: The essence of the "rainbow project" is to introduce labor service in an organized way and enable developed regions to employ the surplus labor force of less developed regions. During the process, we should strive to achieve a virtuous circle of "young people seeking employment outside their home towns, becoming specialized personnel, returning home, and becoming successful entrepreneurs in their home towns." The "rainbow project" is of great significance to our country's economic development. At the Wujin meeting, representatives of 50 county CYL organizations in 19 provinces and municipalities conducted negotiations on labor service cooperation. Wujin county alone signed contracts with Sichuan, Jilin, Guizhou, and Henan Provinces on hiring a total of more than 4,000 workers.
