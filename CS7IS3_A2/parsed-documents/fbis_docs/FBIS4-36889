[Begin recording] [Al-Husayni] What we are doing is to make a sort of coordination between the Palestinian institutions. So, we will have no duplication, we will work with minimum resources that we have to create the maximum work that we could. [Sandler] And that is specifically what? Who are the people that will be involved in this shadow government that you are setting up, and will they be residents of East Jerusalem? [Al-Husayni] Another time: We are not talking about a shadow government. We are talking about institutions which is in Jerusalem, and we are talking about education and decisions we are [words indistinct] education, culture, health, other institutions who are from long, long ago, which is work for the peace and for creating the peace process. So all these institutions, who are helping the Palestinian people, are in need of a sort, as I told you, of coordination. [Sandler] Now, how do you think this will sit with what Prime Minister Rabin has said about the fact -- and other Israeli ministers -- about Palestinian institutions that should be located in Jericho and not in Jerusalem? [Al-Husayni] I don't believe that we have any of these institutions who are part of the Palestinian Authority in Jericho and Gaza. What we have here is institutions who were working all the time before the Oslo agreement and after the Oslo agreement. It was here before the Cairo agreement, and it will continue after the Cairo agreement. There is some institutions which is related to the peace process, and it will going on until we will end all our negotiations concerning the whole issue, including Jerusalem. [end recording]
