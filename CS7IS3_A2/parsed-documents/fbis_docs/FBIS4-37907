Detainees are released after changing their deviated ideas, and after being closely observed. In statements made today following the release of 22 repentant extremists, the spokesman said that meetings and debates are being held with them in the presence of al-Azhar scholars and then they are secretly monitored after their release. He added that the Interior Ministry solves the extremists' financial or moral problems with the other executive groups through the Interior Ministry's "post-release care" program. He stressed that the intellectual combating of terrorism is a unique and new experience that many societies before us have followed and it is constantly being developed in light of the new security changes. The official spokesman went on to say that whenever a number of prisoners repent, they are then released; but stressed that this does not mean that the Interior Ministry has huge numbers of prisoners to whom the emergency laws are applied, adding that the majority of those in prisons are held for crimes they committed. He said that the remaining extremists who declare their repentance will be released during the next four months. He added: We regard the extremist as a sick person and we try to treat him by arresting him therefore discontinuing his activities and restraining him. The law will be applied to anyone who commits a crime or abets it. Regarding repentant Hasan al-Hillawi who played a major role in making the terrorist groups' members repent, the spokesman said that the ministry is studying the possibility of reducing his seven-year prison sentence. Reviewing the Interior Ministry's security strategy of dealing with terrorism and extremism, the spokesman said that there is a short-term plan that involves upgrading the Interior Ministry's facilities and equipment, by training policemen, and modernizing transport and communications. He noted that there is a medium-term strategy that the Interior Ministry is currently implementing and is based on involving all executive and popular organs in confronting the causes of extremism. He added that among the organs that have already started their action are the Education Ministry, the Youth Organization, and the Awqaf Ministry. He noted that there is a long-term strategy that involves developing all the facilities that serve the people, such as the police stations and centers, the passport and civil records departments, and the traffic department.
