Xu, a leader of the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement and one of China's longest serving political prisoners, had been detained Friday as part of a police sweep of dissidents in Beijing and Shanghai that coincided with the visit of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. Journalists were prevented from entering Xu's home Tuesday evening by uniformed and plainclothes police. There was no official confirmation of the release by the Chinese authorities, who said Monday that they were continuing "investigations" into Xu and China's most celebrated dissident Wei Jingsheng who was detained April 1. According to the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry, Xu was detained for having "violated the terms of his parole." Xu, 49, was released on parole in May last year after serving 12 years of a 15-year sentence for "counterrevolutionary" crimes. The detention of Xu -- who has always had a strong interest in France and, in particular, its revolutionary history -- was an embarrassing snub to the French Government during Balladur's visit. It was also followed by the detention of three dissidents -- Wang Fucheng, Bao Ge, and Yang Zhou -- in Shanghai, when Balladur visited the eastern Chinese city after Beijing. All three dissidents were released Sunday. Wei Jingsheng, who had been released in September six months short of a 15-year sentence, is still in detention and officially being investigated for "new crimes." Wei's sister, Wei Ling, said Tuesday that she had heard "no further news" of his present circumstances.
