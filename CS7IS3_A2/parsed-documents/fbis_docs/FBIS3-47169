These forays will include allowing private companies to introduce commercial loans for investment in facilities and granting massive tax breaks to participating companies, an official at the Economic Planning Board [EPB] said. At the same time, participating companies belonging to the 30 largest business groups will be exempted from the application of intricate rules of investment ceiling stipulated in the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act for up to 30 years, the EPB said. The EPB said these incentives will be contained in a new draft bill now in the making. It is learned that the government is due to complete the formation of the bill by this weekend and the bill will go before the Democratic Liberal Party-controlled National Assembly for legislation. Officials said these incentives will be effective in encouraging private companies to take part in the expansion of social overhead capital projects. Specifically, allowing private companies to introduce low-interest commercial loans for their investments in facilities will boost corporate eagerness to take part in the expansion of social overhead capital, the officials said. With regard to tax reductions, the government is allegedly planning to cut acquisition, registration and corporate taxes. The government has been preparing legislation to give the private sector greater incentives to invest in public-works projects in its belief that government spending alone is unable to offer a clear-cut solution to the looming shortage of infrastructure. [passage omitted] In the past, the government had sought to encourage private companies to invest in infrastructure but withdrew its plan in the face of strong criticism about any "special favors" for the large business conglomerates known as chaebol. Conglomerates, for their parts, were also reluctant to get involved in taking part in infrastructure projects as the government didn't allow them to charge sufficient tolls to recoup their investments. This time, however, the government appears more aggressive. "The government is mulling substantial incentives for participants to ensure returns on their investments which were hardly expected under the past regime," an EPB official said. Under the new law, companies will be given more freedom to levy tolls and rents from the public-sector projects in order to help them recover their investments more easily. They may also be allowed to build leisure and tourist facilities alongside the roads or railways to attract more users.
