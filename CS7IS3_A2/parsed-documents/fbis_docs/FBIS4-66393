The microcrystalline layer has homogeneous structure and very fine grain size (less than 0.1 ï¿½m) consisting of only _g_-phase, while the cast alloy is composed of _g_, _g_' and carbides. The oxidation resistance of the microcrystalline layer was much better than that of the cast K17F alloy, and was even superior to that of the aluminized alloy. At first, the oxide scales formed on the cast K17F alloy were composed of mainly Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] with small amounts of Cr, Ti and Ni oxides. However, after 500 h oxidation, the content of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] in the oxide scales reduced because of its spallation during exposure, and the oxide scale was mainly composed of Cr[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and TiO[.sub]2[/]. On the contrary, the oxide scale formed on the microcrystalline layer of alloy K17F was found to consist of only _a_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] which had excellent adhesion and did not spall in the duration of exposure. The beneficial effects of microcrystallization on the oxidation resistance of the superalloy are briefly discussed.
