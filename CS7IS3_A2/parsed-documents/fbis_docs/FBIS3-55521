Akhsarbek Galazov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of North Ossetia, today sent a telegram to Boris Yeltsin expressing categorical disagreement with the assertions of the Ingush president. The position of the Ingush president is described as a "desire to draw the federal authorities into resolving the complex refugee problem by force, to destabilize the situation and hamper the normal process of preparing for and holding elections for president of the Republic of North Ossetia on 16 January." "Attempts to impose conditions from the outside while resolving internal matters of our republic," the telegram says, "are leading to the disruption of the difficult negotiating process of settling the relations between the peoples of the neighboring republics and are aggravating the situation in North Caucasus."
