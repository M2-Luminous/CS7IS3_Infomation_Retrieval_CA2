TWA One-C 76 0.073 0.025 1500 25 0.055 0.01 645 49 0.011 0.003 28 19 0.02 0.003 1114 7 0.023 0.007 (From Ex. 123, p. 1) The authors also pointed out that because air monitoring and third party oversight during these activities, they probably represented situations in which proper precautions were taken. They concluded that ``the data presented indicates the necessity of controlling asbestos exposure during the type of [small-scale, short duration] activities represented in this study. However if appropriately performed *␣*␣* exposures well below the current OSHA exposure limits can be maintained'' (Ex. 123, p. 26).
