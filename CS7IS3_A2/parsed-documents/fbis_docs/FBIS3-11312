Humberto de la Calle Lombana has repeatedly denied he will accept this nomination. Nevertheless, within the past few hours, following extensive consultations within the PL, he has accepted the nomination. A few minutes before entering this hall at the Gonzalo Jimenez de Quezada Convention Center, where the PL convention is being held, Humberto de la Calle Lombana said he decided to accept the nomination for the sake of the fatherland and not as a personal challenge. We have prepared a report on why Humberto de la Calle's acceptance of the nomination is a key victory for Ernesto Samper Pizano. [Begin unidentified reporter recording] Humberto de la Calle holds the key for Samper to become the president of the Republic. He is at the top of the polls, and he finished second in the primary. There is no significant opposition to him within the party, which should guarantee at least 80 percent of the party's support for a Samper-De La Calle ticket. He comes from the provinces, which means he can garner regional votes, and he is associated with the Gaviria government and is considered to have the utmost integrity. In vain, De la Calle had struggled to coerce Samper to face him in a public debate, and he had vowed he would never become a vice presidential candidate. He is a neoliberal, and, in sharp contrast to Samper's status quo views, he personifies a political renaissance. De la Calle is well-know throughout the country thanks to a Conservative, Belisario Betancur, who appointed him registrar during his administration. His other great promoter was Cesar Gaviria, who appointed him government minister to serve as his right-hand man in political matters. As minister, he presided over the National Constituent Assembly, and ironically, as the presidential designate he led the battle for the creation of the vice presidency. His work in the assembly groomed him as a PL presidential hopeful. [end recording] Humberto de la Calle has just been officially named the vice presidential candidate on Samper Pizano's presidential ticket, and the news is being well received. The convention also has just proclaimed Ernesto Samper as the party's official presidential candidate and sole leader of the PL. Samper Pizano is already presenting his platform. Right now, Ernesto Samper is presenting his economic proposals. His main issue will be employment. He also says, if he is elected president, he will appoint a peace commissioner at the ministerial level. This would mean the elimination of the Office of the Peace Adviser, as well as the elimination of the Government Ministry, which would then be called the Ministry of the Interior and would be placed in charge of developing a policy to decentralize the state. Samper Pizano also has voiced full support for the pastoral work of the bishops of Colombia, who have been seriously questioned in recent days. He also said he will promote women into various government posts. Ernesto Samper Pizano has just announced a very radical proposal in his peace policy. He says he will wage an all-out fight against the guerrillas without any negotiations whatsoever. Likewise, he has announced he is favor of Colombia ratifying the Second Geneva Protocol, which would include the guerrillas in reports that pertain to human rights violations.
