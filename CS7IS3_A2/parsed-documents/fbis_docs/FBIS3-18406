Why now, and why out of the blue? In fact, NATO registered a thousand violations of the flight ban over Bosnia-Herzegovina since it was imposed by the United Nations in November 1992. Even after it was tightened about one year ago, that is after the adoption of UN resolution 816, which threatened the use of force, the infringements of the air space continued to take place regularly. The alliance has registered approximately 500 violations so far, but it did not attack the intruders. Why did it do so now? If rulers like Bismarck and Talleyrand were still shaping foreign policy today instead of men like Kinkel, Christopher, or Hurd, one might picture an extremely subtle game behind the scenes. The story begins on 17 February, 100 hours before the expiration of the ultimatum against the Serbs in Sarajevo. All of a sudden, Russia appears on the scene like a deus ex machina, dragging the Serbs by the collar. There is no longer any need for the ultimatum and bombs because the Serbs promised to withdraw their heavy artillery according to schedule. This was good for Sarajevo but not so good for NATO and the United States, because the alliance had labored in vain and Washington had to watch how the old and seemingly toothless rival was suddenly pulling all the strings. For four decades, the West had tried successfully (with Tito's help) to keep Soviet influence out of the Adriatic. Now Moscow was the mastermind, the "lead in the tumbler," as Bismarck used to describe the role of the German Reich. NATO was neutralized, and the Russians -- half protectors and half conquerors of the Serbs -- showed that they alone directed the play. Cynics might now believe that the downing of the Serbian Jastrebs ("hawks") which attacked Bosnian ground targets earlier represents an elegant Western countermove. Thus, the operation of the U.S. F- 16 Falcons might be viewed as a signal that NATO is still in charge. It was as difficult for the Russians to protest against this move as it was for the NATO allies to reject the coup of the Kremlin two weeks ago. After all, Moscow voted in favor of the flight ban, supported by a threat of violence, together with all other members of the Security Council on 31 March 1933. Yet this is mere fantasy -- at least this is what NATO claims. The downing was merely a matter of routine. The F-16 pilots did not even have to consult anybody because the rules adopted by the United Nations stipulate clearly that shots can be fired after two warnings. Why were the shots fired now? Because the NATO planes were always "in the wrong place at the wrong time" in the past. Or: Because it was usually helicopters that were involved, which landed immediately. One party that does not believe in the theory about the routine operation are the Serbs. They immediately sent their own signals -- in the form of heavy shelling of the Muslim enclave of Tuzla. The conclusion is that the world rejoiced too soon. After the withdrawal of the Serbian guns from Sarajevo, some problems seemed to dissolve. The Serbs hinted for the first time that they might become sensible, and the Muslims and Croatians started to talk with each other again. Yet the most recent cease-fire between the two groups has again collapsed, and the use of the Serbian jets shows that the tactical withdrawal has by no means changed the overall strategy of the Serbs. For this reason, NATO "reported back" -- drastically but regularly. The rapid approval from Bonn and Paris underlines that there is no dissent within the alliance. Still: A seemingly insuperable threshold was crossed with this attack. Thus, a new chapter has begun in the two-year-old Bosnian drama. Only one thing is certain: Although the Serbs showed their readiness for escalation with the decision to attack Tuzla, they will not be able to keep it up. The U.S. aircraft carrier Saratoga is already moving toward the Adriatic to make this clear. Yet he who takes the first step must know what the second should be. Violence on a regular basis -- once here, once there? This would be no military problem for the alliance but a political one. One reason is that Russia is a member of the Security Council, and that the Serbs will be clever enough to avoid such a clear provocation. With the F-16 operation, the West has drawn level with Moscow in the political power game. This creates on opportunity to test a joint strategy. As the protectors of the Serbs as it were, the Russian possess a degree of influence that the West does not have. If Washington and Moscow curbed their rekindled rivalry in favor of cooperation in the Balkans, they might succeed in bringing the Serbs to their senses (on the basis of the threat of violence). Bonn would have to play a similarly disciplined role vis-a-vis the Croatians who firmly believe that the Germans will block all sanctions against them. Is this unrealistic? Maybe, it is. However, even the best F-16 planes cannot create a modus vivendi by firing shots.
