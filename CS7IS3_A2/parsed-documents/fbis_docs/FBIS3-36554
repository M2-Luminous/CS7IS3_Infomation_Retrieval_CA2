Katsman: "Missiles -- Merely the First Step"] [Text] Dnepropetrovsk regional organizations of the Party of Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine and the New Ukraine association have adopted a joint declaration in support of the tripartite Ukrainian-U.S.-Russian agreements on nuclear weapons. The declaration points out that courageous and resolute steps should be taken to save Ukraine's economy, including those in foreign economic and diplomatic spheres. Leonid Kravchuk's actions, although a little too late, give some hope for the improvement of economic indicators as a result of a decrease in expenditures on maintenance of nuclear arms. On the other hand, an urgent need for Ukraine's domestic economic reform has become even more evident. The road to the world community has opened before Ukraine, but to set out upon it, Ukraine must prove to its own people its loyalty to progress, market principles, well-being, and prosperity. Sergey Mikhaylenko, leader of the regional organizations of the two parties, who has been nominated candidate in Dnepropetrovsk electoral district No. 76, underlined that fidelity to economic reform will be the distinctive feature of the centrist forces' electoral platform. In particular, four principles represent the epitome of S. Mikhaylenko's electoral program: Priority of human rights, the curbing of inflation, reform in the system of ownership, and increased independence of regions.
