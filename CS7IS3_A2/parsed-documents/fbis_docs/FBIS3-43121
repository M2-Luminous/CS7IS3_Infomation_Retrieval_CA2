FBIS3-43121 "cr00000000794001" 4 January 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-003 SUDAN: POLITICAL HIGHLIGHTS This Foreign Media Note summarizes recent political events as reported by Sudanese expatriate oppositionists in the 12 December 1993 AL-ASHIQQA' (Brothers), a weekly page devoted to developments in Sudan that appears in Egypt's liberal opposition daily newspaper AL-WAFD. Extremist Groups Hold Secret Meeting in Khartoum Unnamed extremist organizations reportedly held a secret conference in the northern Khartoum suburb of Kafuri while the Popular Arab and Islamic Conference was in session at Khartoum's Friendship Hall on 2-4 December. According to AL-ASHIQQA' sources, attendees decided: To "support the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in Algeria as well as the FIS's recent decisions to escalate terrorist activities against foreigners in Algeria." "To totally support" Shaykh Rached al-Ghannouchi, leader of the Tunisian Islamic Movement. "To coordinate activity with Arab Maghreb organizations." "To prepare for the 'Islamic alternative' which will remove the ruling regime in Libya." "To support General Muhammad Farah 'Aidid in Somalia in overturning the Somali Reconciliation Accord held in Addis Ababa." "To support the holy struggle (al-jihad) in Eritrea and the Oromo Liberation Front." Sudanese attendees offered to support the conference resolutions "with weapons" and asked Iran "to increase and continue its petroleum aid." Some of the "traditional leadership" was said to have "arrived secretly and unannounced to participate only in the secret conference and not in the meetings at Friendship Hall" and that "for secrecy's sake their passport series were replaced at the airport with the series belonging to the National Islamic Front (NIF) so that news of the arrival of some of the names, whose passports have not been stamped for entry, would not leak out." DUP Leader on Civil Unrest, Secession of the South Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Secretary Muhammad 'Uthman 'Abdallah, describing a recent strike by merchants in the city of Wad al-Madani, said that "for the first time in the history of Sudan, businessmen and vendors are opposing and rebelling against government authority. This degree of confrontation, in our estimation, was inevitable and encompasses every sector of Sudanese society." 'Abdallah went on to say that "the recent bloody conflicts in al-'Abyad and Madani where the public announced in the capital of al-Jazirah its civil rebellion, merchants closed their stores and distributed leaflets declaring a political strike, and government security forces randomly arrested a number of citizens and merchants, as they (previously) did students at al-Jazirah University and the higher secondary schools, all of these uprisings are small in size but large in significance. They are without a doubt consolidating even as we speak and flaring up throughout Sudan with an aim to finally get rid of the despotic regime." 'Abdallah also addressed the issue of southern self- determination, equating it with secession which he said is "no solution to the problem but rather more complication." He said, "A large degree of sensitivity related to higher national interests has surrounded the issue of self-determination. Therefore, discussion of self-determination must be completely responsible, frank, with a sense of national awareness and be done in moderation with both its opponents and supporters in the context of one Sudan, one people." Concurring with Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) Leader John Garang on conditions under which a united Sudan could be achieved, 'Abdallah stressed that the DUP is "not satisfied with simply realizing equality. We demand compensation for the south and its people for the oppression and losses they have suf fered over the past years. Balanced economic, social, and geographic development must include all of Sudan which has become mostly marginalized." He added that the DUP has "laid down laws and plans guaranteeing this balance and fairness, without which there will be no united Sudan." Retired Colonel Under Detention at Biological Weapons Camp "Informed Sudanese sources" reported that NIF security forces "are still detaining retired Col. Hasan Sayyid Ahmad at the biological weapons camp in Umm Durman." The colonel was arrested more than three months ago without being charged" despite his poor health. After leaving the service, the colonel opened a commercial office "joined by a number of currently retired officers whose source of income was cut off when they separated from the service because they refused to join the NIF's party." Government Raises Airport Departure Tax by 200 Pounds The government has decided to raise country departure fees from 300 to 500 Sudanese pounds. The Civil Aviation Authority is sending an announcement of this to "all domestic and international airline companies to apply this increase immediately." Since November, the authority has raised air travel fees "by 75 percent."
