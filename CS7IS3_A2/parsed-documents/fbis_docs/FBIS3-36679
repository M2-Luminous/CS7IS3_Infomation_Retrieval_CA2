In the program, Filatov denies media reports that Georgians are not satisfied with the results of the Russian president's recent visit to their country, adding that more than 90 percent of Georgians welcome the new relations between Georgia and Russia. Filatov said that 300,000 Russians lived in Georgia and 150,000 have already fled the country; the Russian army and the Russian border guards there are not defended by any legal regulations. Filatov goes on to say that Duma criticism of this visit was not "ethical," because President Yeltsin did say that the documents of the visit would not be ratified until political settlement is reached with Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Referring to the issue of assistance in the establishment of the Georgian army, which Filatov describes as a sensitive issue where Abkhazia is concerned, Sergey Filatov says that "since Russia agreed with Georgia that we will have, as it were, a common border protection, both for Georgia and Russia and on the territory of Georgia, then it follows that we should jointly take care of the Russian and Georgian security interests alike and that is why there is an accord to set up three military bases on the territory of Georgia; it is precisely for this purpose and not for the purpose of occupation, as many say, but for the purpose, as it were, of preserving that state's security, and this includes the preservation of the security of the Russian state as well." Filatov then reads out Article Three of the Russian-Georgian treaty: "The sides will take measures to implement effectively the agreement concerning the temporary stay of the Russian Federation military formations on the territory of the Republic of Georgia and they will also conclude -- and here I stress that it does not say they have concluded already, but just that they will conclude -- an agreement to render assistance in the establishment of the armed forces of the Republic of Georgia." Filatov says that the Russian press regards this as already done, alleging that such an agreement had already been signed. Not so, says Filatov, adding that this agreement also depends on the resolution of the South Ossetian and Abkhazian problems. Asked by an unidentified interviewer about the economic aspects of Yeltsin's visit to Georgia, Filatov quotes Yeltsin as having said that "we would not take any steps which would be detrimental to Russia," and notes that he has nothing to add to that. Asked why former finance minister Fedorov and former first deputy prime minister Gaydar were not included by Yeltsin in his decree on the composition of the Security Council, Filatov says that this consultative body was appointed by the president, and stresses the consultative nature of the council. By law, people would join the council by virtue of the posts they held and neither man could any longer be held to qualify. In conclusion, Filatov says that he looks forward to the coming signing of the treaty on demarcation of federal powers with the Republic of Tatarstan, as part and parcel of the ongoing decentralization process.
