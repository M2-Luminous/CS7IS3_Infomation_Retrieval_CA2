FR941110-1-00021 FR941110-1-00006 A more detailed analysis of the submittal is contained in the Technical Support Document. The following is EPA's review of the major elements of the State's submittal. Type of Program and Oxygen Content Requirement New Jersey has elected to adopt a regulation requiring 2.7% oxygen content for each gallon of gasoline sold in a control area. The regulation also contains a variance that allows, upon individual facility request and subsequent State approval, the establishment of a 2.0% minimum oxygen content. Under EPA's credit program guidelines, all gasoline sold or dispensed during the control period by each control area responsible party (CAR or Blender CAR) must contain an average oxygen content of not less than 2.7% by weight. New Jersey has adopted an oxygen content requirement, though it also provides for variances from this requirement. Applicability and Program Scope Section 211(m)(2) requires oxygenated gasoline to be sold during a control period established by the EPA Administrator based on air quality monitoring data. New Jersey has established control periods consistent with the EPA guidance. Subchapter 25 has an ``averaging period'' scheme which provides that all gasoline sold or dispensed within the control areas during a one month averaging period must comply with the 2.7% average oxygen content standard. Subchapter 25 requires oxygenated gasoline to be sold statewide and divides New Jersey into a northern and southern area. The two areas differ only in the relative length of their control periods: seven months (October 1 to April 30) in the northern area and four months (November 1 to the last day of February) in the southern area. The length of each control period is consistent with the requirements of section 211(m)(2) of the Act. Registration and Reporting Requirements EPA's credit program guidelines specify that all parties intending to sell or dispense gasoline obtained from a Control Area Terminal should register with the state at least 30 days in advance of each control season. At the time of registration, every CAR will be required to declare its intention to comply with the regulation. Upon acceptance, CAR identification numbers should be issued by the state. EPA guidelines specify that no party should be allowed to generate, trade, buy or sell credits without a CAR identification number. Subchapter 25 provides CAR identification numbers. However, if the applicant fails to provide all information requested by the NJDEP, the application may be denied. EPA has also specified that records should be retained by all parties in the gasoline distribution system. EPA's guidelines impose responsibilities on various parties in the gasoline industry. Persons who produce or import gasoline are responsible for assuring that the gasoline is tested and that the accompanying documentation accurately reflects oxygen content. Persons who transport, store, or sell gasoline have various responsibilities associated with assuring that only oxygenated gasoline is sold or dispensed for use in control areas. Terminal owners and operators are responsible for assuring that the oxygen content of the gasoline they receive, handle, or dispense is accurate. Retailers and wholesale purchaser-consumers are responsible for assuring that gasoline intended for sale during the control period contains at least 2.0% oxygen by weight if they are participating in the averaging program.
