This is the substance of the speech given by Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, at the forum sponsored by the provincial party committee on the morning of 13 January during his investigation and study tour to a party school. His speech aroused a sympathetic response among the trainees. The forum was held in the meeting room on the third floor of the newly-built party school's building. The atmosphere was as warm as spring though the weather outside was extremely chilly. Cao Mingyuan, president of the provincial party committee party school, first delivered a report on the school's teaching reforms and on the construction of the school teachers' contingent. Gu Jinchi fully acknowledged the achievements scored by the school in this regard. He said: Party schools are in an important position to enhance party building. In order to enable various circles to pay attention to the work of party schools, we must have party committees at all levels to place the work of party schools on their important daily schedule, to conduct regular research, and to help party schools deal with their difficulties on the one hand and have party schools do a good job in self-improvement to win over the attention from various circles, on the other. Meanwhile, various localities and departments should also do their best to help party schools improve their school conditions and particularly and actively dispatch their trainees to the party schools in line with the demands. Gu Jinchi particularly stressed: The more heavy tasks the leading cadres have assumed, the more attention they should pay to participating the training of party schools. In citing the teaching reforms of party schools, Gu Jinchi said: Party schools should further deepen their teaching reforms and collect all questions raised by the trainees during the course of their studies in a certain period. They should also have their teachers analyze and study these questions by applying dialectical and historical materialism, as well as have them successfully do their papers in line with these questions. Only by so doing can the party school reinforce their teaching targets. Party schools should make efforts to have their teaching systems suit the tremendous changes cropping up in the transition between the planned economy and the socialist market one. After the forum with the leading personnel and a number of teachers of the party school, Gu Jinchi cordially called on the third class attended by cadres from the units at the department (city) level, who were engaging in the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Ai Tingjuan, representative of the trainees and vice mayor of the Shenyang City People's Government, briefed Secretary Gu Jinchi on their study situation. Then, he delivered a short speech and said: In studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, leading cadres must concentrate their efforts on carefully reading the original writings. Efforts should be made to foster a correct idea of development and to correctly understand that it will not do without the theoretical guidance of socialist market economy. He urged the trainees to firmly bear the reality in their minds while studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; to further emancipate their minds; and to emphatically study the issue of how to have the province's economy achieves sustained, rapid, and healthy development. He also urged them to work out ways of how to have their ideological and working methods truly suit the demands of establishing the socialist market economy, to heighten their spirit, to seize the opportunity, and to make contributions to restoring the province's imposing prestige. Gu Jinchi also visited the trainees' dormitory and the reading room of the newly built library. Yu Junbo, member of the provincial party standing committee and director of the organizational department under the provincial party committee, accompanied Gu Jinchi during the investigation and study tour.
