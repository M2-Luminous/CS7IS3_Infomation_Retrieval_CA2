More than 20 such talks were held before but failed to produce any success because the Finance Ministry, which is in charge of the country's taxation policy, considered the conditions proprosed by the U.S. side execessively disadvantageous to Thailand. A source in the Finance Ministry noted that the outcome of this round of negotiations, which will last until 10 February, will be crucial to both countries because its success means the breakthrough of the over 16-year-long stalemate. During his meeting with U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen on 18 January, Finance Minister Tharin Nimanhemin reaffirmed his endeavors to make the negotiations successful for the benefit of the the two countries' trade and investment. However, he stressed that the agreement must not put Thailand at a disadvantage. However, this will be a tough job for Director General of Revenue Department M.R. Chatumongkhon Sonakun, who will conduct the negotiations with the U.S. side. He also knows full well that several U.S. demands were detrimental to Thai interests and caused failure of the past talks. In addition to that, the United States itself is also influenced by pressure from various interest groups and thus has to carefully consider the impact on them. Otherwise, the U.S. Government will face assults from professional lobbyists of these groups. [passage omitted] A source said: "Our estimation of the percentage of success for this round of negotiations is very low because the conditions proposed by the United States are too disadvantageous to Thailand. It is unlikely that the United States will adopt a compromising stand during the talks. Although Bentsen said when he came here that efforts would be made to ensure flexibility, the U.S. side will attach more importance to the interests of their people. If we yield to some of their demands, we will be in a disadvantageous position. In short, it is very likely that no agreement can be reached this time."
