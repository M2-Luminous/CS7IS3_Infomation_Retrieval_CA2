FR940505-1-00253 FR940505-1-00012 (G) Use of an adaptation to any of the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(vi) (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this section may be approved by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis. An owner or operator must submit sufficient documentation for the Administrator to find that the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(vi) (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this section will yield inaccurate results and that the proposed adaptation is appropriate. (vii) Leak Detection Methods for Volatile Organic Compounds . Owners or operators required by the various subparts of this regulation to carry out a leak detection monitoring program shall comply with the following requirements: (A) Leak Detection Monitoring. (1) Monitoring shall comply with 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 21. (2) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 21. (3) The instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the methods specified in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 21. (4) Calibration gases shall be: (i) Zero air (less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air), and (ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane and air at a concentration of approximately, but no less than, 10,000 ppm methane or n-hexane. (5) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible as described in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 21. (B) When equipment is tested for compliance with no detectable emissions as required, the test shall comply with the following requirements: (1) The requirements of paragraphs (a)(4)(vii)(A) (1) through (vii)(A) (5) of this section shall apply. (2) The background level shall be determined as set forth in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 21. (C) Leak detection tests shall be performed consistent with: (1) ``APTI Course SI 417 Controlling Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Leaking Process Equipment'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;82&hyph;015 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161) (2) ``Portable Instrument User's Manual for Monitoring VOC Sources'' EPA&hyph;340/1&hyph;86&hyph;015 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161) (3) ``Protocols for Generating Unit-Specific Emission Estimates for Equipment Leaks of VOC and VHAP'' EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;88&hyph;010 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161)
