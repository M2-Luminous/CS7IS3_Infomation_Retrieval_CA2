FBIS4-36970 "drnes115_l_94009" FBIS-NES-94-115 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Five Senior Rabin Aides Quit in 6 Weeks Five Senior Rabin Aides Quit in 6 Weeks TA1306133794 Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew 13 Jun 94 p 2 TA1306133794 Tel Aviv DAVAR Hebrew BFN [Report by Moti Bassok] [Excerpts] The prime minister's bureau has recently been emptying of its senior officials, and the prime minister is not taking care to fill the ranks. The last person to leave was Jacques Neriya, the prime minister's political adviser. Several days ago Neriya advised Rabin of his intention to leave the bureau. He will join the new secretary general of the Histadrut labor federation, Hayim Ramon, and will head the Histadrut International Affairs Department. [passage omitted] Neriya's resignation was the last in a series of resignations from Rabin's bureau over the past several weeks. Hayim Asa, who was slated to head the national security team at the Prime Minister's Office, was recently forced to resign. Asa charged that Shim'on Sheves, Prime Minister's Office director general, and Eytan Haber, head of Rabin's bureau, the two most senior aides to Rabin, were to blame for his resignation. According to Asa, the two are preventing other bureau employees, including very senior ones, from having access to and contacts with Rabin, thus harming the bureau's proper working procedures. The officials who left Rabin's bureau over the past six weeks are: Cabinet Secretary Elyaqim Rubinstein; Gad Ben-Ari, the prime minister's media adviser; Attorney Nira Poran, adviser on information and public affairs; and Colonel 'Amos Gil'ad, the prime minister's army affairs adviser. Despite this mass desertion in a relatively short period of time, none of the evacuated posts has been permanently manned -- although the posts are most important and some are very sensitive, and despite the fact that candidates who are considered to have particularly good backgrounds and potential offered themselves for all of the posts. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 13 June reports that "Shim'on Sheves, the director general of the Prime Minister's Office, denied that Jacques Neriya, the prime minister's political adviser intends to resign from his post. Sheves confirmed that Hayim Ramon had offered Neriya a senior position in the Histadrut labor federation several weeks ago; however, Neriya had not given Ramon a positive answer. In an interview with Qol Yisra'el, Sheves denied that advisers were resigning from the prime minister's bureau en masse, and said that everyone leaving was had viable and different reasons."]
