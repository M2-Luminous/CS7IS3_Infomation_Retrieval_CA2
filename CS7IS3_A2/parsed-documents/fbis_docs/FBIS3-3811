At a national family planning forum sponsored by the State Council, Jiang urged local governments to make efforts to realize plans to control population growth and to raise family planning work to a new height. Premier Li Peng and other Chinese leaders Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing and Hu Jintao attended the forum. After analyzing China's population situation, Jiang said that while the achievements in family planning work have been confirmed, the task of China's family planning work remains arduous. He pointed out that China's family planning policy is based on the Marxist theory that population growth must fit in with the production of materials and therefore is a correct policy decision in line with China's basic conditions. He said that now there is a viewpoint that under the market economic structure, population control should also be regulated by the market. He noted that the viewpoint is incorrect. The family planning policy is decided by China's basic conditions and the demands of socialist modernization. He said that the problem of a huge population coupled with underdeveloped production will result in a series of problems in food supply and education. He said that even though China's population has ceased to grow, the huge size of the present population will continue to last for a period. He said that if China does not carry out the family planning policy, the uncontrolled growth of the population will produce an adverse effect on economic development and the interests of both the state and individuals. He stressed that under the circumstances of establishing a socialist market economic structure, population control is a function of the government and the attempt to regulate population growth through the market cannot realize China's plan for population growth. He called for mobilizing the people in family planning work. It is every citizen's obligation and contribution to the state and society to abide by the family planning policy. He urged officials and party members to take the lead in carrying out the family planning policy. Jiang said that this year the CPC Central Committee will take measures to enhance the construction of the party organization in rural areas. The family planning work will be one of the elements in appraising the party's work in rural areas. Jiang also talked about study of the population policy and measures for promoting family planning work. Premier Li Peng said that the key to family planning work is in rural areas and he stressed conducting family planning work among the floating population.
