"We express gratitude to the Indonesian Government whose positive attitude towards our stand on the nuclear issue gives us some support," North Korean Ambassador to Indonesia Han Pong-ha said at a press conference here on Wednesday. Han was responding to President Suharto's recent statement urging North Korea's conflict with IAEA, particugarly the United States, to be settled in a peaceful way. According to the North Korean ambassador, Indonesia, being the chairman of the Non-aligned Movement, has shown encouragement in defending the interests of developing countries. He appreciated Indonesia's opposition towards IAEA's plan to bring the North Korean nuclear issue to the United Nations Security Council for its settlement. Indonesia rejects the idea on the grounds that the issue should be settled in a dialogue between the country involved and the IAEA, Ambassador Han said. The conflict between North Korea and IAEA, particularly with the United States, began when North Korea rejected earlier the nuclear international body's inspection team to observe its nuclear facilities. North Korea withdrew its Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) membership on March 1993 but later deferred the withdrawal after conducting talks with the United States. Han threatened that his country will withdraw its NPT membership if the United States continues to break the agreement signed by both sides in New York last February 25, 1994. According to Han, under the agreement, the United States, announced the suspension of the "Team Spirit '94" -- a joint military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea -- and that it would set a date of the opening of third round of North Korea-U.S. talks. "However, the United States said it would keep the promise only after the inspection of IAEA had been made satisfactory and special envoys are exchanged between the North and the South," he added. The ambassador also disclosed that the meeting agreed on four steps of simultaneous action for a package solution to the nuclear issue, including the suspension of the "Team Spirit '94", resumption of the working level meetings, acceptance of the IAEA inspection and holding of the third round of U.S.-North Korea talk. The ambassador said that North Korea has accepted the IAEA's inspectors. It has held several rounds of working level meetings and made every possible efforts for an early exchange of special envoys. "But the U.S. side has fulfilled none of its obligations," he said, adding that, "if the U.S. continues to break the agreement we will withdraw our NPT membership."
