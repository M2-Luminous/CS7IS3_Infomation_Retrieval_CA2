FBIS4-4411 "dreas063_d_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-063 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 South Korea U.S. Trade Pressure Focuses on Car Market U.S. Trade Pressure Focuses on Car Market SK0104083994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0457 GMT 1 Apr 94 SK0104083994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 1 (YONHAP) -- U.S. trade pressure on South Korea this year will focus on the country's annual 1.1 million-car market, Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry officials said Friday. In a comprehensive survey of the practices of its trading partners called the National Trade Estimate (NTE) released recently, the U.S. Government designated South Korea as a country erecting unfair barriers in the automobile sector -- a target of investigation by the U.S. Trade Representative under the revised Super 301 Trade Provision -- the officials said after analyzing the NTE report. Less pressure is expected on the country's services and intellectual property markets. Washington demanded that Seoul remove or lower such trade walls as auto import duties, car taxes and national campaigns against luxury imports that limited automobile imports to 1,463, or 0.2 percent, of the 1.1 million-unit market last year. Early this year, the government lowered car import duties to the European union level of 10 percent, yielding to U.S. pressure, but Washington continues pressing for a further cut to 2.5 percent, the same as the American rate. It also demands removal of restrictions on foreign car advertising and dealers. The officials said the U.S. call for a further cut in car import duties is unacceptable because Washington "is putting this demand to Korea only, putting aside many advanced countries." They admitted, however, that the 15-percent acquisition tax on cars priced 70 million won or more is too high compared with the 2-percent tax on autos worth less than 70 million won, suggesting that the tax on luxury cars will be lowered. Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su will meet U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor during talks on economic cooperation slated for April 4-5 and again during the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) ministerial meeting opening in Morocco on April 12. He will also visit Washington in May in a bid to ease trade friction over automobiles. Meanwhile, trade circles expect American pressure for a broader opening of the services market, intensified protection of intellectual property rights and a further reduction in export subsidies to ease somewhat, as many of the U.S. demands related to these issues were met during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations last year. But Washington will include South Korea in the priority watch list being announced at the end of April to push for a wider Korean market opening.
