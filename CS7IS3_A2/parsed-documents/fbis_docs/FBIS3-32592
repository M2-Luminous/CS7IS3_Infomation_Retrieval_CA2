Since the EZLN revolted in Chiapas on 1 January, dozens of human rights, political, religious, Indian, and peasant organizations have expressed their "moral support" for the rebels' demands, especially the fight against poverty. In past weeks, however, many of those organizations have taken more radical positions by demanding immediate solutions to their economic problems and threatening to join the EZLN ranks. Approximately 400 peasants who grow sugar cane in the eastern state of Michoacan threatened today to take up arms and join the EZLN if the government does not reopen its sugar mill, which was closed one year ago. The peasants are former workers of the Puruaran sugar mill, which is located 120 km from the Morelia, the capital of Michoacan. The peasants asserted that they will muster hundreds of Purepecha Indians in the area to join an armed revolt to continue the neo-Zapatist movement. Confronted with this situation, the 21st Military Zone troops are currently guarding the region to forestall any rebel movement. The Michoacan rebel leaders have agreed to meet on Wednesday with Jaime Serra Puche, commerce and industrial development secretary, to negotiate the reopening of the sugar mill. Meanwhile, five rebel leaders have gone to Chiapas to deliver a letter to the EZLN asking to be allowed to join its ranks. Furthermore, 1,000 members of the Democratic Peasant Union (UCD) [Union Campesina Democratica] in Torreon city in the northern state of Coahuila expressed their support for the EZLN's demands and demanded that the local government provide immediate solutions to the agrarian problems in the area. "The Torreon peasants will initiate an offensive in defense of the ejido (community land). We demand the suspension of Banco Rural's land seizures and the cancellation of the expired portfolio," which amounts to approximately $233.3 million, their communique stated. In the southern state of Guerrero, authorities have warned that several people are distributing leaflets to the Indians calling them to an armed revolt against the government. Authorities are currently investigating those reports. One week ago approximately 300,000 members of the "Guerrero 500 Years of Indian Resistance Council" [Consejo Guerrerense 500 Anos de Resistencia Indigena] asked to be accepted in the EZLN ranks and requested that they be allowed to support the armed movement from the mountains of the southern state of Guerrero. The Zapatists accepted the request. The Guerrero Indians have started collecting food, clothing, and medicine to support their "war brothers" in Chiapas and will send the provisions to Chiapas in the next weeks. A dozen religious and human rights organizations in the northern state of Chihuahua, which borders the United States, have formed the "Peace and Justice in Chiapas Coordinator" [Coordinadora por la Paz y la Justicia en Chiapas] that demands that the EZLN be accepted as a belligerent force. The coordinator demands a halt to the repression against the Indians in Chiapas and to the "manipulation of information" by the television media. It has warned that it will support the rebels in all their demands to the government. In the southern state of Oaxaca, neighboring with Chiapas, many residents in the mountain areas have warned authorities of the alleged presence of armed groups that are preparing to rise up against the local government. The authorities, however, have repeatedly denied those reports. At least 108 people were killed and approximately 500 injured in the armed clashes between the EZLN and the Armed Forces during the first 10 days of the conflict.
