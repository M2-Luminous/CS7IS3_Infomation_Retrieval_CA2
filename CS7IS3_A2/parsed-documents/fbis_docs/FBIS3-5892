It was also learned that in the high-level meeting on the North Korean nuclear issue held at the Foreign Ministry today, the ROK and U.S. Governments agreed that if North Korea agrees to conduct an envoy exchange by 21 March, the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks will be postponed for the same amount of days it takes for North Korea to actually conduct an exchange of special envoys. Present at the meeting were working-level officials from relevant ROK ministries and agencies, such as the Chongwadae [presidential office], National Unification Board, Foreign Ministry, Defense Ministry, and the Agency for National Security Planning, headed by Kim Sam-hun, the ROK Foreign Ministry's nuclear ambassador, and the U.S. side was composed of working-level officials from the White House, the State Department, and the Defense Department, headed by Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary of state. It has also been learned that the two countries agreed that if North Korea does not properly guarantee IAEA inspections and does not agree to the envoy exchange, the announcement on the third round of talks and the suspension of the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise will be withdrawn, and the two countries will push ahead with the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise. The ROK and the United States agreed that if the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks are held, North Korea's full return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, special inspection of the undeclared nuclear sites, assistance in the replacement with light-water moderated reactors, and improvement of North Korean-U.S. relations will be dealt with comprehensively [pogwalchoguro]. The two countries evaluated the current status of the IAEA inspections and the last two rounds of the inter-Korean working contacts, and agreed that, on the whole, the IAEA's nuclear inspection has proceeded smoothly so far and that a last-minute settlement of the issue on exchanging special envoys remained possible.
