Minister Shim'on Shetrit complained that Israel's position on the status of Jerusalem is unclear. Mr. Rabin replied that Jerusalem is not an issue for negotiations at this time, adding that Israel has made no concessions whatsoever on this matter. Rabin noted that he had underestimated the extent of the widespread support among settler circles for the Hebron massacre. The prime minister said that the deliberations of the Shamgar Commission, which is investigating the Hebron massacre, undermine the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] credibility in the eyes of the public. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the cabinet also discussed the continuation of the closure on the territories. One of the possibilities discussed was extending the closure on the territories until after the holidays. Police Minister Moshe Shahal supports this proposal.
