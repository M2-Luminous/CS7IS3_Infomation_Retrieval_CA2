The Russian Far East is made up of seven administrative units, such as the Maritime Kray, the Sakhalin Oblast, Khabarovsk Kray, and the Sakha Republic. In this region are such resources as rich timber (30 percent of the total for the former Soviet Union), aquatic products (40 percent), diamonds (98 percent), gold (50 percent), and tin (80 percent). In terms of industrial structure, lumbering, nonferrous metals, and fisheries make up 50 percent of the extractive and manufacturing industries. Its secondary industries lag markedly, with 80 percent of consumer goods and 50 percent of the food brought in from other areas. Efforts were made to develop defense industries in the 1930's; and the city of Komsomolsk-na-Amure became a center for steel, petroleum refining, shipbuilding and aircraft industries. Vladivostok provided supplies and repair as a base for the Pacific Fleet. Far Eastern Area in Era of Reform In a speech in Vladivostok in July 1986, Secretary General Gorbachev stressed that economic development of the Far Eastern region was inseparable from the strengthening of economic cooperation and trade relations with Asian nations. Keenly sensing that if carrying out the "Program for Far East Regional Development by 2000" (August 1987) were to end in failure each region, would require economic self-reliance, Nakhodka, Sakhalin, and Vladivostok applied to the union in 1988-91 for conversion into free-economy zones. The Yakutia, Kamchatka, Sakhalin, and Maritime regions are proclaiming sovereignty over management and utilization of resources within their areas. Also, in August 1990 they set up a Far East Economic Association, taking up such matters common to each state as energy, foodstuffs, construction, transportation, and military-to-civilian conversion, and they plan to pull together. One of this association's achievements was drawing up the May 1991 "Concept for Solving the Far East Region's Crisis and Economic Development by 2000"; but due to the coup of August 1991 and the breakup of the Soviet Union in December that year, they did not get so far as to draw up an action program. After that, based on a September 1992 presidential decree, they deliberated on the "Far East development program" in light of Russian and Far East conditions; and there are moves to try to draw up the policies. Economic Cooperation in the Far East What actions might be needed for now to bring about further development of economic cooperation? 1. Expansion of Trade Deals With trade between Japan and Russia totaling $3.48 billion in 1992, it has fallen to 57 percent of its peak. Likewise, imports also were down 26 percent to $2.5 billion; but a majority of that was foodstuffs, lumber, coal, etc., for which the Far East is a producing area. Hence, the Russian Far East is unchanged in being a supplier of raw materials. As disruptions in the economic system are causing the import reductions, considerable recovery of trade volume is possible by bringing about quality guarantees and strict observance of delivery dates (normalization of rail transport and port operations). 2. Effective Use of G-7 Economic Aid Aid totaling $43.4 billion was set for 1993; but it is necessary to place all possible emphasis on the Far East for the portion that is bilateral aid, to quickly set up also the Far East region's receiving facilities and to put into effect an aid program for shifting to a market economy. 3. Assistance for Preparing Infrastructure With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia lost 60 percent of the port facilities, making the bolstering of its Far East harbors an urgent task. Also called for are double-tracking of Amur River bridges which are a bottleneck to Siberian rail transport, electrification of some rail lines, and adding to and rebuilding power generation facilities so as to improve the energy balance. Since these items will be the basis for future development of the Far East, is not the time upon us when we must consider the methods for cooperation between Japan and Russia? 4. Resource Development Projects "Siberian development" in the 1970's gave birth to an era of Japan-Soviet cooperation centering on coal, lumber, and harbors; and pushed Japan-Soviet trade up sixfold over a 10-year period. Areas for cooperation henceforth may center on energy, especially oil and gas. For the present, it is important to continue the forestry development and Sakhalin continental shelf gas and oil exploitation projects that are ongoing and to get them on track. Also, the Republic of Korea is considering development of Yakutia gas by tieing up with the Sakha Republic, and it has particulars from joint Japan-U.S.-Soviet investigations conducted in the 1970's. Furthermore, since Yakutia gas also is positioned to be a major source in Russia's own Far East energy development plan (the Vostok plan), the chances are high of its becoming a project for multinational cooperation. For other subsurface resources as well, the exploitation of such metals as gold, tin, and lead, construction of iron mills due to development of Aldan iron ore and copper smelters due to development of the Udokan copper mines (Chita region), etc., may become objects for study as future projects. Pressing To Improve Japan-Russia relations As discussed above, there are any number of subject areas for economic cooperation in Russia's Far East. The premises for that are Russia's political and economic stabilization and clarifying the authority of the center and local regions; but resolution of the territories problem--a longstanding issue between Japan and Russia, establishing neighborly relations by concluding a peace treaty and resolving these by organically linking them with economic cooperation are to be hoped for. The cold war structure having collapsed, a situation has emerged in which Japan, as one of the G-7 nations, will take on a major role in aiding Russia. Russia's Far East has made requests to the center for assistance; but those have not been met. There has never been a time like the present when "new thinking" has been so required of both Japan and Russia.
