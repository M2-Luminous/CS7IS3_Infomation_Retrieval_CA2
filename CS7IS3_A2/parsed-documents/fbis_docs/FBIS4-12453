The radio of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia [Kafr Killa Voice of the South] said rockets crashed onto the villages of Dibil and 'Ayn Ibil, on the border with Israel, wounding seven civilians and setting fire to several houses. Earlier, artillery battles between a radical Palestinian faction and the Israeli army left a militiaman and an anti-Israeli fighter wounded, security officials said. The militiaman was wounded when fighters of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine fired at an SLA position in Bayt Lif, in the western sector of the security zone, they said. The post was attacked by two Sagar shells, six anti-tank rockets and automatic weapons fire. The Israeli army retaliated, firing back 20 mortar shells and 10 anti-tank shells, wounding one of the attackers who was evacuated from the area, they added. Three hours later six Katyusha rockets hit an SLA position in Marwahin, 300 metres (330 yards) from the border between Israel and Lebanon, sources in the occupied border strip said. The Israeli army retaliated by raining 30 mortar and tank shells on five villages just outside the zone known to be strongholds of Iranian-backed Hizballah fighters, police said. There were no further reports of civilian casualties.
