What is the most important thing that perhaps could not be heard at the news conference is that the police of both sides will enter these buffer zones, depending on the side to which settlements belong. The territories held by one and the other side remain completely intact. [Kosaric] What about the deadline for the implementation of this agreement? [Jarcevic] The deadline for the realization of this agreement is eight days, including the withdrawal of both sides and the police remaining in the buffer zone. [Kosaric] What about UNPROFOR, when will it be deployed? [Jarcevic] UNPROFOR will be deployed within 10 days. It will, for example, issue documents to the policemen who will be in the buffer zone. In this way only those who will obtain special UNPROFOR badges will be allowed to serve. UNPROFOR will control both sides, and this is perhaps a novelty of this agreement, as all earlier plans did not envisage control of the arms of the Republic of Croatia. Now they will be controlled, too, and positioned 20 km away from the border. In places where the Croats do not have a border, like toward the Adriatic Sea, they will be more tightly concentrated closer, but it will be also allowed that, in the areas were there is no 20 km distance, for example in eastern Slavonia, Srem, and Baranja, the Serbian Army concentrates more tightly. [Kosaric] This, therefore, means that heavy arms must be at a distance of 20 km from the front. [Jarcevic] Yes, with the exception of those emplaced for which we have agreed that they will remain. [Kosaric] Is there anything else that is specific in this agreement? [Jarcevic] There is nothing specific with the exception of that we announced the talks about communications, the economy, trade, and the normalization of all relations. Only after this phase can we discuss issues of political weight. [Kosaric] Is the date of this meeting already known? [Jarcevic] Well, we said, in roughly two weeks.
