The Chetniks have been pounding Visoko from their positions in Dolipolje, Kriva, Jelica, and Siljak. The Vares area has also been exposed to heavy artillery fire, particularly the defense lines in (Mesevicko Brdo) the villages of Rokoc, [words indistinct], and the town itself. The aggressor has been using his entire artillery arsenal in these attacks, including howitzers, tanks, mortars, heavy guns, and antiaircraft guns and machine guns, from his positions in Brezac, Jeljani, [words indistinct]. Several Chetnik infantry attacks on the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army positions have been routed, but the enemy plans to continue to attack the free territory. This is [words indistinct] bringing in new forces and digging in. All these attacks and preparations have been under way in the exclusion zone, says the Army Press Center, and adds that -- considering such an indolent attitude of the UN Protection Forces -- the fighters and the units of our army are even more determined in their defense.
