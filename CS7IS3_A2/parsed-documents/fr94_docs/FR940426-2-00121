FR940426-2-00121 FR940426-2-00075 (C) Impact on the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this notice does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being within the meaning of the Executive Order and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. This is a funding notice and does not alter any HUD program requirements affecting the family. (D) Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance HUD has promulgated a final rule to implement section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act). The final rule is codified at 24 CFR part 12. Section 102 contains a number of provisions that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types of assistance administered by HUD. On January 16, 1992, HUD published at 57 FR 1942, additional information that gave the public (including applicants for, and recipients of, HUD assistance) further information on the implementation of section 102. The documentation, public access, and disclosure requirements of section 102 are applicable to assistance awarded under this NOFA as follows: (1) Documentation and Public Access. HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than 30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly Federal Register notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) (2) Disclosures. HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure reports, but in no case for a period generally less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.)
