Government forces lost control of the highway Tuesday following heavy Khmer Rouge [KR] guerrilla attacks through the week, the report said. Col. Surat Vorarak, an officer attached to Aranyaprathet's military unit, confirmed Khmer Rouge activity in the region, saying guerrillas have used "hit and run" tactics against government posts but would not be allowed to control those they have overrun. Poi Pet is a busy border town through which consumer goods pass between Cambodia and Thailand. The report said the price of goods in Poi Pet market has risen by several times and the supply of drinking water has reached a critical stage. About 12,000 villagers and merchants remain in the town, some of them preparing to cross the border into Thailand, the report said.
