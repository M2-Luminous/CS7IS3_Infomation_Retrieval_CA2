Lukyanov is in no need of any special introduction. He became particularly well known as chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and as M. Gorbachev's perestroyka associate. A former leader of the disintegrated CPSU, he is now a deputy of the State Duma from the slate of the new communist party--the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. [Leontyev] Anatoliy Ivanovich, how do you evaluate the Duma's work? [Lukyanov] The State Duma and the Federal Assembly as a whole have sensed quite rapidly that they cannot linger over organizational matters and must embark as quickly as possible on a resolution of the problems which are troubling the people. This process has begun, it is moving quite actively. The Duma has also taken up questions of payment of the arrears to the peasantry and the structural reorganization of industry and national problems and questions of protection of research and the child and many international problems. So all this is taking place. But at the same time I understand full well that the powers of the Duma and the Federation Council are very, very limited. They cannot tackle much by virtue of the constitution that was adopted by only one-third of the population of the country and that was foisted on our society. I cannot yet say, therefore, that there will be big results from the Duma's work. [Leontyev] With which factions are you prepared to cooperate? [Lukyanov] I am a member of the Russia's Way group of deputies, and we are prepared to cooperate with any faction in the Duma that defends Russia's interests and contributes to at least some slowing of the country's decline into the abyss of crisis. [Leontyev] Is the formation of a bloc of all patriotic forces possible? [Lukyanov] Such a bloc has already been formed. It is called Accord in the Name of Russia. It includes the Agrarians, the Communists, and leading figures of the Democratic Party, the Free Russia People's Party, and the Russian National Union, that is, of the most important public associations. In terms of numbers the bloc is superior to all other associations put together. This is a hand proffered the president. [Leontyev] What is your attitude toward Zhirinovskiy's party? [Lukyanov] One of composure. I believe that V.V. Zhirinovskiy's party is very diverse in terms of its composition and the positions of the people who are members of it. To take the program principles of this party, they largely coincide with the program principles of Russia's Choice. For example, V.V. Zhirinovskiy and Russia's Choice concertedly support this constitution, while the parties of the left, the communists included, are opposed. Zhirinovskiy and Russia's Choice are for stringent and strong presidential power. Many communists are altogether opposed to the institution of a presidency in Russia. In their view, it corresponds neither to our mentality nor to our traditions. The LDPR, like Russia's Choice also, agreed, on the whole, to the exclusion from the constitution of the term "sovereignty" as applied to the components of the Federation. Zhirinovskiy altogether proposes that Russia be divided into provinces. The communists, like the Russia's Way group also, have a more balanced position. [Leontyev] Do the terms "province" and "oblast" really have a different semantic content? [Lukyanov] It is not a question of the name but of the fact that Russia should not have national-territorial division. [Leontyev] Perhaps this would lessen the interethnic discord, and the peoples would cease their disputes as to whom this territory or the other belongs? [Lukyanov] It is a complex issue. Entirely different forms became a part of Russia: the Bukhara Emirate and the Khiva Khanate, the parliamentary Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Poland, Estland, in which serfdom was abolished almost 50 years earlier than it was in Russia, and others. Entirely different components, but they were formed with regard to the national composition of the population. There were the Turkestan and Transcaucasus governorships general.... Account had to be taken of the nationality factor after October 1917 also, otherwise the country would have fallen apart. The concentration of production, integration, and the economy as a whole would, in principle, develop better were there simply administrative-territorial division with the existence in a number of places of national-cultural autonomy. But such are the specific features of Russia. And it is not a question of names here, it is simply necessary to take account of the social and economic features of the country and its national composition: More than 130 nations and national groups live here. [Leontyev] And if each national group conceives a desire for its own statehood, will this not signify a constant struggle for a recarving of borders and interminable conflicts? [Lukyanov] There was none of this in the Soviet Union. A certain consensus was found. Saying that the national-state division of the country inevitably causes conflicts is, from my viewpoint, improper. There could be conflicts in certain cases. But there are political and other solutions also. [Leontyev] How do you evaluate the present situation in the country? [Lukyanov] Extraordinarily complex. A slow-moving civil war is under way, in the outlying areas particularly. We are undergoing several revolutions simultaneously: geopolitical, which has cast Russia to the back of beyond, and social, when 5 percent of the wealthiest strata of society has emerged and more than 35 percent are on the verge destitution and when Western individualist and egotistic aspirituality has been foisted on society. It will be extraordinarily difficult to find general agreement in this division: There is social discord in society, and the president, with his statement concerning the need for social accord and civil peace, may be heard by far from everyone. Qualitative changes in policy and the abandonment of shock therapy are essential for such peace to be lasting and stable. [Leontyev] How do you evaluate the personality and activity of the president? [Lukyanov] I have known him as an individual for a long time. As far as the president's activity is concerned, its essence consists to a considerable extent of the pursuit of a policy which expresses the interests of the "new Russians" who are coming to power in coalescence with mafia circles and orienting themselves toward Western capital. But I do not believe that it will be that simple to impose the ideas and practice of capitalization: Russian conciliarism, spirituality, community living, and collectivism are too deeply ingrained in us. I am sure that neither American jeans nor European sleeveless jackets will suit the living mighty Russian organism. [Leontyev] Will you be running in the presidential elections? [Lukyanov] I have given absolutely no consideration to this step. I am a lawyer. A doctor of legal sciences. Each person should operate in the sphere he knows best: I am in the right place in parliament. [Leontyev] Who might the next president of Russia be? [Lukyanov] I am opposed to the institution of the presidency altogether. A collective president, such as the Supreme Soviet Presidium was, handled these functions. The foisting on Russia of an independent presidential office counterposed to parliament and the elective authorities, especially the elevation of the president above all branches of power, corresponds, from my viewpoint, neither to national traditions nor to genuine democratism. [Leontyev] You believe that the present constitution is of a temporary nature? [Lukyanov] I believe that sooner or later the people will understand that society needs a constitution that is supported by the majority of the population, not one-third of it. [Leontyev] How, in your opinion, will events develop further? [Lukyanov] It will all depend on how realistically the government evaluates the current situation and the mood of the populace and how quickly the authorities understand that it is essential to change the policy of "shock therapy." Its abandonment is inevitable. Fundamental changes are needed. The opposition is not calling for backward moves here but it is convinced that the reforms should serve the good of the people, the majority of the people, not their impoverishment. [Leontyev] What needs to be done for an improvement in people's lives? [Lukyanov] The president told us in his message, having adopted statements that have been made repeatedly by the opposition: Government regulation of the entry into the market, government control of prices, if only of the basic prices, of energy particularly, a strengthening of the social focus of each step of the state and the reforms, stimulation of the investments of national capital in the development of the native economy, not in foreign banks, and protection of the interests of Russia and its wealth are essential. [Leontyev] Do you believe in the reconstitution of the Union, as before? [Lukyanov] I am sure that the great community of peoples living on our territory will necessarily be victorious, will necessarily be reconstituted, and that there will be a new, renewed Union. In other forms, possibly, but it will necessarily happen. [Leontyev] On what are you working currently? [Lukyanov] There is much work in the Duma, in the Legislation Committee, of which I am a member. Much time is spent on work in my group of deputies, it being necessary to interact with various factions. I receive a tremendous number of letters from all regions, incredible for one man, and I have to work on these also. In addition, a resumption of the trial is possible. I have to prepare for this also. [Leontyev] What were your prison conditions like? [Lukyanov] I was in Matrosskaya tishina. Perfectly normal conditions, although I spent six months in solitary. The attitude was quite calm, restrained, benevolent, and I do not, therefore, paint prison in total black. Gandhi said: "Every politician should spent some time in a national prison." [Leontyev] Who shared your cell? [Lukyanov] One person, who ultimately said that he had been planted there specially. We had a normal relationship. [Leontyev] The downfall of the CPSU and socialism: Was this logical or historical chance? [Lukyanov] We need to separate the demolition of the CPSU from the downfall of socialism. Socialism and communism will live.... I believe that in our country socialism was realized in an early phase. Sooner or later a society of social justice will be built. It will be popular and nonbureaucratized and will have a democratic system of government. And, generally, what is currently called the postindustrial society is to a considerable extent a society that has imbibed and continues to imbibe many principles of socialism. Production itself, the economy itself socialize society. [Leontyev] How do you assess the personality of Lenin? [Lukyanov] Lenin was a child of his time, and all his publications, merely a particle of his life. Lenin cannot be detached from his cause, his gentry family, his beliefs, and his activity abroad. We must take him as he was. As a whole, he did for Russia, for the people, a great deal, particularly for the people who had been humiliated for centuries: for the workers and peasants. [Leontyev] Do you idealize Vladimir Ilich? [Lukyanov] No. I view him objectively: I have been through many of his documents which are quite frightening, quite painful. But politics is politics. An icon should not be made of any politician. [Leontyev] Do you support Lenin's reburial? [Lukyanov] This would be blasphemy. Lenin is buried in practice, his body is below ground level. He left no testament on this matter. Do people want yet a further inflammation of passions? The authorities could take this step, of course, but there would not be the support among the bulk of the people. There would probably be people who want this, but they would be the minority.
