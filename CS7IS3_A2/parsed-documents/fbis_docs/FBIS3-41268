State House correspondent Mohammed Labo reports: [Begin recording] [Labo] Inaugurating the task force, Lt. Gen. Diya said that it is ironical that the government agency, created to fight drug abuse and trafficking in narcotics, has become prone to corrupt tendencies. He described the recent disappearance of some wraps [individual packages] of heroin seized last year from a suspected hard drug trafficker as a manifestation of the level of corruption and collusion that emasculates Nigeria's anti-narcotic efforts. The terms of reference given the panel include: Eradication of all problems associated with hard drugs in the country, enforcement of security checks at all ports and international routes with immediate effect, working in close liaison with the Armed Forces, police, and particularly the Ministry of Justice to ensure immediate arrest of culprits through investigations and prompt prosecution in the courts. The chief of general staff has the other terms of reference: [Diya] [video in progress shows chief of general staff seated, reading out terms of reference to the task force] ...render monthly reports to the head of state and commander-in-chief, through the office of the chief of general staff on all activities of the task force.
