The Economic Planning Board [EPB] said Wednesday that the government is preparing countermeasures in the judgement that the situation is likely to worsen rapidly after U.N. sanctions go into effect. An EPB source said the government had started reviewing economic measures taken during such emergencies as the Pueblo and Oct. 26 incidents. In January 1968, the U.S. intelligence vessel Pueblo was seized by North Korean naval ships off Wonsan in the East Sea, and former president Park Chung-hee was assassinated on Oct. 26, 1979. The source added the government measures will be determined through consultations among concerned cabinet ministers as soon as sanctions against Pyongyang are adopted by the United Nations. If sanctions were imposed, economic, political and military unease could prevail in South Korea, leading to an imbalance in the supply and demand of daily necessities, the source explained. This highlights the need for government measures to ensure stable supply and demand of major items used by the general public. In addition, the government will take steps to clear up uneasiness among foreign businessmen so that they do not avoid transactions with their Korean counterparts. The EPB official explained, "Although we have not yet prepared detailed measures, we are studying programs minimizing the possible economic impact following a resolution on U.N. sanctions. We are preparing scenarios from diverse angles for the economic situation in accordance with the degree of North Korea's reaction to the sanctions."
