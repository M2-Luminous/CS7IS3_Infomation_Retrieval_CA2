In an interview with INDIAN EXPRESS Sethna who was AEC chief from 1972 to 1983 during which time the country exploded an experimental nuclear device at Pokhran in Rajasthan said contrary to Pakistan's claims, it had not been able to achieve more than 60 per cent uranium enrichment with the centrefuge technology that it had acquired. The enrichment required for gas to be converted into bombgrade heavy metal was at least 90 per cent, he pointed out. Besides, it had never seriously taken the plutonium path whereas India had started reprocessing plutonium way back in 1967-68. Sethna said the Americans were given to exaggeration and it suited Pakistan to be seen as a burgeoning nuclear power in the region for domestic political reasons. While contending that India was way ahead of Pakistan in the nuclear field he denied that it ever had aggressive intentions. Reacting to the reported claim by an American journalist William E. Burrows in his book Critical Mass that Indira Gandhi had made elaborate plans to bomb Pakistan's Kahuta enrichment plant before she was assassinated in 1984 he said this was a blatant lie. Being in a vantage position in the AEC and the Government there was no way such a plan could have escaped his attention, he added. Asked how he felt now about the 1974 Pokhran blast as he looked back, Sethna said he was confused as to what purpose was served in exploding a device and then not following it up. "We should have gone flat out, acquired the status of a nuclear power and bargained for a place in the Security Council," he said with authority. Reacting to a question on how secure Bombay's nuclear installations were from enemy air attacks, Sethna said the Cyrus and Dhruva reactors as also the plutonium reprocessing facilities were well protected. However, the radio metallurgy and radio chemistry labs in the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre were vulnerable. Queried about the possibility of a nuclear arms race in Asia in the wake of North Korea's acquisition of nuclear capability he said American attempts to bring the North Koreans to heal were in order. However, reports about US plans to supply Scud missiles to South Korea were disturbing. The Scuds were proved ineffective during the Gulf War and any effort to arm South Korea with them would fuel suspicions that the US is pandering to its strong arms suppliers lobby.
