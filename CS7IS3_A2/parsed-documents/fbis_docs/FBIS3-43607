It implies that prices of the country's products -- agricultural and industrial products which are exported and services -- will decrease, thus enabling one to sell more abroad. However, in Gabon's case, the country depends mainly on oil, timber, manganese, and uranium today. The devaluation of the CFA franc would not enable us to sell more oil or timber. The price of oil has decreased because there is a current glut in the international markets. There is overproduction of oil and OPEC's major debate is, precisely, on trying to regulate production to prevent oversupply. Therefore, based on the analysis of the structure of our country's economy, I can affirm that Gabon does not expect to gain from the devaluation of the CFA franc. Now coming back to your question, the problem of price control is effectively a central one in the manipulation of exchange rates. There is a great risk of inflation. Why? Because the consequence of the devaluation of a currency is that all imported products automatically become more expensive in proportion to the devaluation, of course. It also means that human beings being what they are, each of us individually and, collectively -- groups, societies, nations -- each one will leave no stones unturned to restore the predevaluation situation in order to gain, as it were, what it would have been lost in the devaluation. All these phenomena create a spiralling price increase that must be controlled. If it is not controlled, the possible benefits of the devaluation will be annulled. The success or failure of any decision to manipulate the exchange rate in a country hinges on this price control. [De Louamiy] I will go deeper into the question, Mr. Prime Minister. In a context of devaluation, the state, of course, finds itself in a situation where it has less income because exports remain at about the same level for certain countries like Gabon and are no longer able to fetch as much money as before. At the same time, the prices of imported goods remain at the same level. Since the state no longer has the full capacity to subsidize the prices of essential commodities, will we not end up in a situation where the purchasing power of citizens will be decreased? [Oye-Mba] Of course. Effectively, the risk of a devaluation is that the purchasing power of the people decreases because the value of the currency they use in acquiring goods reduces after devaluation. Besides, the state no longer has the same possibility to subsidize the prices of goods both for equipment or consumption. It is more difficult to do so, therefore, effectively, the consequence is the risk of decreased purchasing power which it is appropriate for one to examine. It is a question of making the right decisions for things to continue to move on even better than before the devaluation. I would say it is a whole alchemy; it is an art, it is an art. [Mbinamanza] Has the Gabonese Government thought about these compensatory measures? [Oye-Mba] Well, I am telling you that in the meantime, we consider that there should be no devaluation. There should not be any devaluation because Gabon will not benefit from any devaluation. Nevertheless, we are aware that our country is in an extremely difficult economic and financial situation. I have never hidden this from the Gabonese. We intend to pursue the policy that we have started, that of controlling the [words indistinct] of our country, notably the [word indistinct] of the state in the strict sense of the word.
