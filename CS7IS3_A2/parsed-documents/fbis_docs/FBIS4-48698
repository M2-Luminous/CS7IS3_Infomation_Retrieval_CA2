FBIS4-48698 "drafr101_d_94017" FBIS-AFR-94-101 Daily Report 18 May 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Namibia President Requests Special Status From EU President Requests Special Status From EU MB2105191894 Windhoek DIE REPUBLIKEIN in Afrikaans 18 May 94 pp 1, 2 MB2105191894 Windhoek DIE REPUBLIKEIN Afrikaans BFN [Unattributed report: "President Again Begs Abroad"] [Text] The Presiden?, Mr. Sam Nujoma, in Brussels yesterday, on a working visit to Belgium and the European Commission, requested that Namibia's present status as ab underdeveloped country be extended for another five years due to poor economic development since independence, following the severe effects of the drought and the global economic recession. He also applied for a bigger export quota for seedless grapes for the European market, assistance with the expansion of the NBC [Namibian Broadcasting Corporation] transmission network, and an additional 2 million EC [European Currency] Units for the completion of the part of the Trans-Caprivi highway funded by the European Union (EU). Concerning the issue of underdeveloped status, he said that this "status" should be granted to Namibia to enable the country to overcome economic hitches experienced in the first few critical years after independence, adding that economic indicators did not reflect changes which the country hoped for. "We therefore intend to apply for the extension of this status for the second half of the Lome IV Convention." President Nujoma said that the country benefited from the least developed country [last three words in English] status over the past five years and from the special treatment given to countries in terms of Article 329 of the Lome IV Convention. "To my deepest regret expectations were not realized. Namibia experienced a serious setback because of two unforeseen developments -- the drought and the global recession which retarded our economic advancement." The president made a personal request to the vice president of the Economic Commission, Mr. Manuel Marin, to support Namibia's application according to the Lome IV revision agreements. Mr. Nujoma addressed a luncheon hosted by Mr. Marin. The President said that Namibia had every reason to be proud of its relationship with the EU, especially against the background of the 525 million Namibian dollar aid package granted to Namibia since independence, in accordance with the Lome Convention. "The real challenge in dialogue on development issues between the EU and the ACP countries (African-Caribbean-Pacific) did not concern the issue of assistance, but trade -- in particular, the matter of duty free access of goods destined for the European market." "In this regard I am reminded of Namibia's request to deliver duty free seedless grapes to the European market out of season, when there will not necessarily be any competition with European products. The EU's reaction was not exactly encouraging because the European Commission only proposed a quota of 500 tonnes while Namibia has the potential to deliver a quota of 5,000 tonnes." "I am mentioning this particular aspect because it embodies the spirit of the Lome Convention in that it provides work for approximately 7,000 people in the south of the country. It also promotes agricultural and rural development and encourages private initiative, in respect to private investment in an ACP country. This bold private sector initiative, supported by capital from two EU members, namely the United Kingdom and Germany, must be supported so that it can succeed. I am, therefore, calling on the commission to reconsider its position and to create a duty free opportunity for Namibia." Co?cerning the expansion of the NBC transmission network, Mr. Nujoma requested that a consultant be provided to assist with this task. "It is our dream to put up transmitters countrywide for the education of our people." -- The ACP group of developing countries and the European Union are meeting from today for three days in Mbabane, Swaziland, for the medium-term revision of the Lome IV aid and trade agreements over 10 years, to expire in the year 2000.
