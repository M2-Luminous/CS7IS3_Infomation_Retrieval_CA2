He also stated that this meeting will be different from the others. It will be new in various ways, he said. [Begin Bolanos recording] Cuba is attending the summit with an interest in achieving a specific action or project for the integration of Latin America. When I say integration, I am speaking of trade, investments, exchange in technical assistance, and scientific-technical cooperation. This was not achieved on previous occasions of the Ibero-American Summit. Documents were issued reflecting the wishes of Ibero-America in that respect, but when you analyze the agreements you will see that very little was achieved. Also, very little was achieved in other aspects. Specifically, there will be an important difference. I say important because each scenario and each person imparts a given style and personal touch to the event. A delegate can have an idea of what is going to take place. I can tell you, for instance, that the event will not be the same as previous ones. It will be a more dynamic summit and there will be less protocol. I believe it will be more substantial. More time will be given to interviews and to debates by the chiefs of states than on previous occasions. There is something new which must be stressed. It is that, in addition to a speech by each head of a delegation, who will each speak seven minutes, there will be a panel divided into subjects. One of the subjects will be the flow of investments. There will be the subject of integration, social changes, and how to achieve integration and social change from the social and economic perspectives. There also will be other subjects. The topics will be given to a group. Those topics are to be given to a group of Latin American personalities. I think the fact that we are participating on equal terms is somewhat of a reaffirmation of the principles for which we have struggled so much, and for which Latin America has struggled so much. These principles are sovereignty and free determination. I think this summit is a rejection, or I might use a stronger word, a repudiation of the exclusive and exclusivist policy that has been implemented against Cuba throughout its history since 1959. It is a reaffirmation of the existence, strengthening, and consolidation of the revolution, even during difficult moments for our country, and even in very difficult international conditions. I think this is the most important aspect of the summit. [end recording]
