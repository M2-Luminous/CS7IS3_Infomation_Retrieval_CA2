Drawn up on the initiative of the Socialist Party, the motion criticizes the Balladur government's record since it came to power a year ago and calls for the repeal of the five-year law on employment. The 83 MPs who signed the motion say that the law "relies on the deregulation of labor, the massive insecurity of employment...and the undermining of the status of employees."
