Both men agreed that the NATO decision was a strong incentive to resume negotiations, thanks to the military and other pressure being applied to the Serbs. Nevertheless, Napolitano and Butrus-Ghali hoped that there would be no need for recourse to military intervention, and that the political will to find a solution to the conflict would prevail. During his two-day visit to the United States, Napolitano has met congressmen and members of the Clinton administration as well as members of the Italian community and those from the world of economics and finance.
