Abou also noted that such an agreement would create the correct impetus, as he put it, for achieving an overall Cyprus solution. In a statement after his meeting with Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis this morning, Abou described the contacts he had with President Glavkos Kliridhis and Gustave Feissel [the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus] as very important in view of the report on the Cyprus issue, which he will start preparing for the EU's Council of Ministers. Asked if the CBM's are compatible with EU norms, Abou said the United Nations has assured him that there is no problem. But, he added, there is no easy answer to this issue. Answering another question on Turkey's stance, he noted that during his recent visit to Turkey, he received assurances that Turkey supports the CBM's. Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said in his statement that the government will assist the observer in his task in every way. He added: The government's goal is to explain to the EU observer the government position on how the various approaches toward a Cyprus solution are linked with Cyprus' efforts for accession to the EU. Abou completed his orientation visit and left Cyprus this afternoon.
