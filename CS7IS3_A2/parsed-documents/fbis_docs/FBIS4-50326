On Sunday [15 May], Mitchell solemnly told the American public China needed to improve its human rights in the next two weeks. Yes, two weeks is left for the Chinese government to change its human rights policy. What is so daft and so objectionable about Mitchell's pronouncement is that, on the one hand, it is a totally unreasonable demand and on the other, he does not mean it. Mitchell, however, accurately reflects the dilemma of the Clinton administration, which has talked big about human rights in China and is looking for a way to act small so that MFN can be renewed with some kind of face-saving formula. Now, we learn Wei Jingsheng, China's most famous dissident, only recently released from jail, is about to be charged with the capital crime of treason. His apparent offence? Urging the U.S. to withhold China's MFN status unless Beijing genuinely improves its human rights policy. China clearly had no intention of publicising the charges against Wei until after Washington had issued its expected decision to renew -- at least in substance -- China's MFN status. The United States, prone to posturing, has its hands firmly tied by linking its avowed commitment to human rights with trade policy. Withholding MFN, as we have argued before, is a crude and inappropriate instrument for the purpose at hand. But, having publicly adopted this stance, the U.S. should at least be seen to follow through on these principles. Secretary of State Warren Christopher should at the very least press Beijing for an immediate clarification of Wei's status. If Clinton truly intends to make China's trade status conditional upon its human rights performance, then the prospect that China's most famous dissident may be charged with treason for remarks he made to the State Department's top human rights official is surely relevant. China's policy makers have correctly sensed the uncertainty and lack of commitment in Washington and exploited it to the full. The traditional offerings of nominal dissident prison releases have been made, a few Christians here, the more prominent Chen Ziming there and, no doubt, a couple more releases to come as the June 3 deadline for an MFN decision draws close. However, by word and by deed, the Chinese government has made it crystal clear it has no intention of making any fundamental changes to its human rights policy. The point was underscored when John Shattuck, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, visited China, and a number of human rights activists were rounded up under his very nose. The interests of human rights in China are not advanced by mixing this issue with the recidivist protectionism of many vested interests in the United States. The annual sham of trading a few political prisoners for Chinese footware, etc. is neither dignified nor a suitable method of securing more far-reaching changes in the human rights situation. We are sick and tired of the way in which the U.S. pursues its human rights policy. We should add that China is not a special case; the Clinton administration's bungling and ineptitude is equally evident in the tragedies that have befallen Haiti and Rwanda. However, we are based in Hong Kong, so we have parochial interests in the affairs of our big neighbour and the repercussions of these affairs on our circumstances. We suspect the government has overstated the impact of losing MFN status for the Hong Kong economy. We are also suspicious about other figures being pumped out, purporting to demonstrate the impact of losing MFN. None of this really matters, however, because the MFN charade is likely to run for a little while yet, without anyone seriously losing or gaining trading advantages as a result. What matters is the situation of human rights, an issue somewhat sidetracked in the MFN debate. So let us state clearly what we fear. We fear that the human rights situation is deteriorating. We fear, but cannot quantify the extent of the deterioration, because controls on the media are being stepped up. When President Jiang Zemin chooses to tell the world that the Tiananmen massacre was worthwhile, when even the most famous dissidents cannot be protected by their international fame and when the international community chooses to acknowledge its impotence with a collective shrug of the shoulders at events in China, then things are serious. The time will come when recognition of this serious matter will not be obscured by the MFN debate. It cannot come too soon.
