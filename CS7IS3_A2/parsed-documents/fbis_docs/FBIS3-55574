The state commission has removed German Arzamazov from the stand- by crew in which he was included as a medical researcher, following his statement opposing the candidature of Valeriy Polyakov as a member of the main crew. Arzamazov vowed that Polyakov had not practiced medicine for a long time and therefore cannot fly as a medical researcher. He offered his own candidature. However, Vasiliy Agapov, Russian deputy health minister, believes that Polyakov is a highly skilled professional who has been working as a deputy director of the institute of medical and biological problems for a long time. Additionally, he has spent 241 days in space. During the flight, Polyakov will carry out medical experiments on himself. As for Arzamazov, he has developed some "psychological problems" in relations with his colleagues. Besides, he has never been in space before, Agapov said. The deputy minister said that taking account Arzamazov's experience -- he has been in the cosmonauts's team for 17 years and been included in stand-by crews twice, -- he may be included as a crew member for the future Russian-American joint space flight. Agapov stressed that according to the standing rules, the entire crew has to be replaced if one of its members is removed. However, in this particular case, because of the extraordinary nature of the situation, a "reserve cosmonaut" has been prepared for a flight "in case of emergency."
