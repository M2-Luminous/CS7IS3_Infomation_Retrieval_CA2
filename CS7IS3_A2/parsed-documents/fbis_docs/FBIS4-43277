First of all, the dramatic fall in PASOK's [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] electoral power, despite the attempt to "depoliticize" Sunday's election results, has weakened Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's position within the party. Consequently, according to government sources, Papandreou will contemplate running for the country's presidency. Given the level of power of the political parties in the Chamber of Deputies, the election for a new president would require the cooperation of PASOK, which has 170 seats, and Political Spring, which has 10 seats. However, this association is not possible because if Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras were to contribute to the extension of the current government's term, it would diminish whatever hopes he has to draw new support from the conservative faction's pool. If the Political Spring does not make a clear decision or if it demands Papandreou's positions before it makes it own decisions, this is because Samaras wants to publicly deny his assistance to Papandreou in order to increase his own support within the electorate. By getting into a confrontation with another "established" political leader, Samaras will conclude the cycle of "conflicts" with the political leaders, following his confrontation with President Konstandinos Karamanlis and Konstandinos Mitsotakis, former prime minister and New Democracy chairman. KKE [Greek Communist Party] has said that it will not vote Papandreou into the presidency, but has not ruled out the possibility of supporting another candidate nominated by the majority. However, KKE currently holds nine seats in the Chamber of Deputies, and this does not solve the problem. As a result, the issue is what will happen with the New Democracy parliamentary group, whose leaders cannot cooperate with PASOK on the presidential election. Some circles claim that the significant decrease in New Democracy's power in Sunday's elections will intensify the confrontation within the party, which in turn will increase the insecurity of some deputies who want to exhaust their four-year term rather than have early elections because of the inability to elect a president. The fact that the vote for president in the Chamber of Deputies will again be a secret one, will certainly help some deputies to vote for PASOK's candidate. However, well-informed sources stress that, besides the fact that the above scenario is offensive for the deputies of the conservative faction, it will create huge problems for New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert and mainly for Mitsotakis who will be blamed for this "unofficial rebellion." It is wise for one to expect that the political leaders' decisions regarding the presidential elections will begin after the results of the municipal elections and the elections for the second level local administrations, as it will be possible to evaluate more solid trends of the electorate.
