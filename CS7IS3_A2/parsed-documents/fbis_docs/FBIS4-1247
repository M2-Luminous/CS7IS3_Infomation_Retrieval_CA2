At least four people have been confirmed killed, but according to reports the death toll already stands at seven. Several people were injured by glass fragments, and a spokesman for the Hillbrow Hospital says 79 people have been admitted, 11 of them in a serious condition. The explosion took place in Bree Street, between Von Wielligh and Kruis Streets, close to the ANC headquarters. There is no confirmation that there are possibly more bombs in the vicinity. [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Unidentified eyewitness, in English] We all saw....[pauses] The only thing we saw is we saw the police search the car here. After the police searched the car they went off; they drove. They parked down there and that's when the explosion came. [Unidentified correspondent, in English] Now you said the police were here, and they searched the car? [Eyewitness] They searched the car here, here, here. Right here. [Correspondent] And the car came through. [Eyewitness] The car....[pauses] They left the car in the car park there. It was about plus five minutes, I say three to five minutes; then the explosions came. [end recording] The police estimate that between 70 and 90 kg of explosives were used. The front of a shop was completely destroyed and there was a fire inside the building. The police, fire brigade, and paramedics were on the scene within minutes and four street blocks around the scene of the accident were cordoned off. The explosion was heard by inhabitants in Hillbrow and Kensington. A spokesman for the ANC, Mr. Carl Niehaus, says extensive damage was done to the organization's headquarters and telephone lines were damaged. He said the explosion took place shortly before an ANC election bus was due to depart from the building to embark on voter education. He described the explosion as an attempt at blatant intimidation. [Begin recording] [Niehaus] We believe that this is an attack on the entire democratization process in South Africa, and specifically on the ANC, and we call on all our people not to allow themselves to be provoked by this attack. We must remain as calm as possible and ensure that we win this election in the best possible way, that everyone turns up to vote. The best way to fight this type of terrorism is at the polls. [Archbishop Desmond Tutu, in English] I hope very much that we will not panic and as long as the security forces show that they are going to be effective in following up all of this kind of thing, we should be saying....[pauses] Quite obviously there are those who want to subvert and sabotage the efforts, and we mustn't allow them. First of all we mustn't panic, and we must go along because there isn't as much violence as they had hoped there was going to be, and I just beg our people to remain calm and to let the security establishment deal with it. We are going to vote and these elections are going to be free and fair, and so there to all those ghastly creatures who are trying to subvert us. We are not going to allow them to do that. [end recording] The PAC's regional office is also in the vicinity. A spokesman for this organization says he is convinced that the explosion was aimed at the PAC.
