This decision is calculated to achieve smooth operation of intellectual property right systems while, at the same time, protecting Japanese companies from the onslaught of the imitation products now flooding the market. The Patent Office will make arrangements for trainees to be received by private companies and patent attorneys' offices where they will be given the opportunities to learn and practice patent administrative work. The Patent Office is seeking the cooperation of invention-related groups under its umbrella, as well as that of private companies. This is the first time the training involving overseas private sector personnel is supported by the Patent Office. With the consent of the Uruguay Round of GATT, ASEAN countries' intellectual property system and the functions of related government bureaus are rapidly being reorganized and improved. For instance, the Thai Government has raised its intellectual property section to the status of "bureau," while working on the idea of establishing within the baht economic sphere (which also includes Vietnam and Cambodia) a copyright center designed to provide guidance in the matter of copyright protection. Indonesia, in the meantime, began strengthening its intellectual property protection measure by establishing its own copyright-patent-trademark bureau. In contrast to these governmental actions, very little has been accomplished by the private sector. This is attributed to the fact that companies in ASEAN countries, as a rule, do not have a section devoted to patent administration; moreover, lawyers or patent attorneys qualified to handle matters related to patent application and processing as well as protection are rarely found among company personnel. For this reason, each country was searching for ways to open pipelines to private sectors. At the Japan-ASEAN patent specialist meeting held on January 15, 1994, in Changmai, Thailand, an overwhelming number of participants urged Japan to provide assistance in the training of private-sector patent specialists. The Patent Office, therefore, had decided to involve Japanese companies and patent attorneys' offices in the program, arranging them to receive ASEAN trainees and providing necessary in-service training. Specifically, using Hatsumei Kyokai (Japan Institute of Invention and Innovation), (which made a good showing when it undertook the JICA-based training program), as a point of contact, and through the Japan Patent Association and the Society of Patent Attorneys, the Patent Office will request corporations, patent attorneys' offices, and invention-related groups to receive ASEAN trainees for in-service training. As for dispatching patent specialists abroad, the Patent Office already has sent examiners to Thailand and Indonesia to do consulting work as special advisors to the bureau chief of each government for a period of two years. What the Patent Office will do now is to offer this arrangement to businesses as well.
