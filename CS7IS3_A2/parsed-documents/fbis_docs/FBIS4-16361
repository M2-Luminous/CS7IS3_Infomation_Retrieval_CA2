Grigoriy Karasin was referring to the arrival of the first shipment of nuclear fuel assemblies from Russia to the Ukrainian Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, the largest of its kind in Europe. The shipment was sent as compensation for Ukraine's dismantled nuclear warheads. As the spokesman, in accordance with the three presidents' statement, all nuclear warheads should be transferred from Ukrainian to Russian territory, where they should be dismantled as soon as possible. Russia is then required to compensate Ukraine in the form of fuel assemblies for the latter's nuclear energy programme, also as soon as possible. In order to begin the process of compensating Ukraine, Russia agreed to provide the fuel assemblies, containing 100 tonnes of lowly-enriched Uranium, within ten months. In the same time period, at least 200 nuclear warheads from RS-18 and RS-22 rockets will be transported from Ukraine to Russia for dismantling. According to Russian specialists, the first shipment of fuel to the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant is enough to enable one of the plant's five reactors to work for an entire year, which will give Ukraine 5.5 to 6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.
