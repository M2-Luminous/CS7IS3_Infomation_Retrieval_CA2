FR940630-0-00038 FR940630-0-00012 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement 30 CFR Part 901 Alabama Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program AGENCY: Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior. ACTION: Final rule; approval of amendment. SUMMARY: OSM is announcing the approval of a proposed amendment to the Alabama Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AMLR) Plan (hereinafter referred to as the Alabama Plan) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), 30 U.S.C. 1231 et seq ., as amended. Alabama proposed revising its procedures for ranking and selecting abandoned mine land reclamation projects and procedures for obtaining right-of-entry by changing the eligibility date for abandoned mine land reclamation. Alabama also revised its statutory definition of ``abandoned mine lands.'' The amendment is intended to meet the requirements of Title IV and the Federal regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jesse Jackson, Jr., Director, Birmingham Field Office, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, 135 Gemini Circle, Suite 215, Birmingham, Alabama 35209. Telephone: (205) 290&hyph;7282. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background on the Alabama Program II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment III. Director's Findings IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments V. Director's Decision VI. Procedural Determinations I. Background on the Alabama Program Title IV of SMCRA, Public Law 95&hyph;87, 30 U.S.C. 1202 et seq ., establishes an AMLR program for the purposes of reclaiming and restoring lands and water resources adversely affected by past mining. This program is funded by a reclamation fee imposed upon the production of coal. As enacted in 1977, lands and waters eligible for reclamation were those that were mined or affected by mining and abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under State or Federal law. The AML Reclamation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, Title IV, Subtitle A, Nov. 5, 1990, effective Oct. 1, 1991) amended SMCRA, 30 U.S.C., 1231 et seq ., to provide changes in the eligibility of project sites for AML expenditures. Title IV of SMCRA now provides for reclamation of certain mine sites where the mining occurred after August 3, 1977. These include interim program sites where bond forfeiture proceeds were insufficient for adequate reclamation and sites affected any time between August 4, 1977, and November 5, 1990, for which there were insufficient funds for adequate reclamation due to the insolvency of the bond surety. Title IV provides that a State with an approved AMLR program has the responsibility and primary authority to implement the program. The Secretary of the Interior approved the Alabama AMLR Plan on May 20, 1982. Information pertinent to the general background, revisions, and amendments to the initial plan submission, as well as the Secretary's findings and the disposition of comments can be found in the May 20, 1982, Federal Register (47 FR 22062). Actions taken subsequent to the approval of the Alabama AMLR Plan are identified at 30 CFR 901.20 and 901.25. The Secretary has adopted regulations at 30 CFR Part 884 that specify the content requirements of a State reclamation plan and the criteria for approval. The regulations provide that a State may submit to the Director proposed amendments or revisions to the approved reclamation plan. If the amendments or revisions change the scope or major policies followed by the State in the conduct of its reclamation program, the Director must follow the procedures set out in 30 CFR 884.13 in approving or disapproving an amendment or revision. II. Submission of Proposed Amendment By letter dated October 1, 1993, Alabama submitted a reclamation plan amendment to OSM (Administrative Record No. AL&hyph;0504). The proposed amendment consists of revised narratives to replace portions of the approved Alabama Plan as provided for by 30 CFR 884.13. The Alabama Plan was revised to change the eligibility date for AMLR reclamation from August 3, 1977, to November 5, 1990. OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the October 21, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 54313) and, in the same notice, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The comment period closed on November 22, 1993.
