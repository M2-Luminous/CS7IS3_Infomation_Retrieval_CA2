He stressed, therefore, that "I do not believe that the NATO threat will be realized." In an interview with GLAS SRPSKI, Ninkovic said that if, however, the aggression were to take place, "we must not bow, we must defend ourselves and succeed at it." Therefore, if the threat is carried out, it will mean that we have been forced into fighting. In that case, we would use all available means for defense, claims General Ninkovic.
