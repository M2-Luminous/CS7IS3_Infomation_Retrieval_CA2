At an informal meeting, held unusually ahead of a summit of the G7 countries scheduled for July, the ministers said they were convinced environmental projects could generate 2.1 million jobs in Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. They agreed that preservation of nature could be financed by "environmental accounting" or better distribution of taxes. "No one talked about creating new taxes," said Italian Environmental Minister Valdo Spini at the end of the two-day meeting. French Environment Minister Michel Barnier said Europe must "implement such reforms together," noting that "pollution has no boundaries." On safety at nuclear plants, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, the ministers pledged to "promote aid and economic and technological assistance to countries with the biggest problems." They also discussed the greenhouse effect -- or warming up of the earth's climate through pollution -- as well as deforestation, desertification and water pollution. G7 heads of government and state are to meet in July in Naples.
