Traditionally, the government spends money during election years to help its favorite candidate. Will this happen during your tenure? [Ricupero] I want first to make it absolutely clear that I will play an entirely impartial role. I am a public servant. I have devoted my whole life to this. I may have my preferences as a citizen, but as finance minister I will keep in mind collective and public interests which are today embodied in economic stabilization. As I said earlier in some articles, I believe this is in the best interests of all of the candidates too. Anyone seeking a federal or state office will win if he gets elected when the economy is already at an advanced stage of stabilization. If there is no awareness of this fact, those elected will have to rule under the excessively heavy burden of an economy out of control. [Sotero] Will government coffers continue to be locked? [Ricupero] The government has clearly defined its position on spending: It will seek a strict balance between public accounts and the federal budget. The budget is both small and behind schedule. Many sectors will suffer hardships, but the budget was prepared along those lines. It is important for it to be approved so that clear guidelines may be established for the administration, and to enable it to be rigorously implemented. We only need the budget to ensure the success of the program. The budget will be the law for the government. This will preclude any possible use of it for electoral purposes. [Sotero] Do you attach any significance to the fact that it was [Former Finance Minister] Fernando Henrique Cardoso who proposed your appointment to President Franco? [Ricupero] I am a friend of Cardoso. I will not say that this is meaningless, because I am honored by his proposing me. This will be very important in ensuring the continuity of the plan. I fully endorse the plan. [Sotero] Do you have any doubt about achieving fiscal adjustment with the measures adopted thus far? Is it a question of just implementing them? [Ricupero] I believe fiscal adjustment has been basically achieved. We have to formalize it through the approval of the budget. It would have been better if the original Social Emergency Fund proposal had been approved. Unfortunately, it was not possible to have it approved without changes. Even so, we can achieve fiscal balance with what we have. New decisions, like salary changes for personnel of other branches of government, would make this goal more difficult. These expenses are not included in the budget. This is why I have insisted on the need for a final solution to these structural problems in the Constitution itself, whose provisions have led to salary differences among the branches of government and to decisions that provoked new problems. All this must be addressed with a desire to promote harmonious coexistence among the three branches. I have never addressed this problem without observing absolute respect for the Supreme Court, for the judicial branch, and for Congress, while bearing in mind the aim of their members, as Brazilians, to reach stability. We have to address the causes of these problems. If we find that the present legal system jeopardizes stability and that the country is thus finding it difficult to bring inflation under control, then the current constitutional revision process, which still has two months of sessions, should focus on this problem. There is no reason why we should not to try to improve those constitutional provisions. [Sotero] In the wake of your appointment, it has been speculated that you might have problems because you will not enjoy the same type of relationship Cardoso had with President Franco. [Ricupero] I am glad you mentioned that. I maintain very harmonious relations with the president and with members of his staff. I am a close friend of all of them. I am on very good terms with Henrique Hargreaves, who was my colleague during [Former President Jose] Sarney's government; and with [Presidency Secretary General] Mauro Durante, who helped me the most when I was appointed minister for the Amazon region. Besides, I have my own staff at Planalto Palace, whom I intend to keep with the president's concurrence. I am a close friend of Jose Castro Ferreira and the other presidential advisers: Osiris Lopes is a longstanding friend. I am also on good terms with the members of Cardoso's team, and I feel one of them because they are all longstanding friends. Thus, I cannot see any incompatibility, and I feel I will be able to move smoothly from one position to another. [Sotero] Do you find it necessary to adjust the plan? [Ricupero] I do not see any flaw in the plan. Respected economists like Mario Henrique Simonsen have praised the plan and have described the concept behind it as excellent. The issues we will have to address from now on will be focused on how to translate all this into our daily life. As the American saying goes: "The devil is in the details." Details have not yet been worked out. One cannot speak of adjustments, because this means correcting the plan, which would not be the case. As scheduled, we will now define all the financial, economic, and legal rules for the transition into the real cruzeiro. This process, which is now under way, requires an enormous amount of work. The legal side alone poses intricate issues. By arranging the transfer of office on 5 April, Cardoso and I will, in our speeches, touch on certain general guidelines for the next stage -- although still in very general terms -- because it is still in the preparatory stage. [Sotero] Has a date been set for the change of currency? [Ricupero] No. This is one of the topics under discussion, not just by the team but by the president and members of the government, because we need to find a point of equilibrium. We can neither be hasty nor wait for too long. This is not an easy task. It requires fine tuning with economic developments. The only firm information is that which has already been announced; that is, that the date for the implementation of the new currency will be announced 35 days in advance. Thus, no one will be taken by surprise. [Sotero] Do you have a date in mind? [Ricupero] You know I am not inclined to lie. Whenever I cannot tell something to the press, I state my reasons. The issue here is not that I cannot disclose a conversion date, written on a piece of paper, that is being kept in a safe. The truth is that no date has been set. [Sotero] Does the same rule apply to the various exchange rates of the new currency? Does the internal debate indicate that the government is moving toward a fixed rate or a system of levels? How will the question of convertibility of the new currency be resolved? [Ricupero] Those possibilities are being duly assessed, one in relation to the other. There has yet been no definition. I hope that by early next week the economic team will give me some paragraphs on the general characteristics of stage three of the plan. One thing I have sharply emphasized is that I will first examine any proposal brought to me by the team and then take it to the president. I want to do everything in absolute agreement with him, just as Cardoso used to do. [Sotero] Is Brazil prepared to end inflation? [Ricupero] I believe Brazilian society is mature enough to undertake the final effort toward stabilization and reform with a view to resuming development. People are weary of inflation and hope the country will find its course. There are still some problems stemming from our political institutions and constitutional provisions. I believe our objective economic conditions are good. We did not have these conditions during the previous transition period in 1989. We have a high level of reserves that enable the Central Bank to overcome any speculative maneuvers. We have concluded our foreign debt negotiations. In a few more days, the foreign debt will be a finished business. Furthermore, contrary to the situation prevailing a few years ago, our economy grew in 1993 and continues to grow in 1994. This has brought us relief. This growth has been achieved through an extremely high productivity rate. Our agricultural harvest could be the largest ever because the Northeastern region again figures for statistical purposes and companies have been streamlined. The rate of indebtedness within the private sector is currently the one of the lowest in the world. I believe the subjective conditions influencing business and workers confidence are equally good. There are also favorable international economic conditions because there has been an acceleration in the U.S. growth with reasonable interest rates, and there are signs of an economic recovery in Europe. All these point in a positive direction. All that is required now is to be very firm in the subject of balancing the budget and of improving our constitutional provisions.
