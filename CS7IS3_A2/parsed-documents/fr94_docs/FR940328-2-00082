On March 16, 1994, the Exchange submitted Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change to make certain technical corrections to the text of the original filing. 3 The CHX has requested accelerated approval of the proposal. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 See letter from David T. Rusoff, Foley & Lardner, to Sandra Sciole, Special Counsel, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated March 15, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Exchange proposes to extend the pilot program for stopped orders in minimum variation markets for an additional one (1) year period. The pilot program is currently set forth in interpretation and policy .03 to Rule 37 of Article XX of the CHX rules. This is the third requested extension of the pilot, originally approved on January 14, 1992. 4 The first requested extension of the pilot was approved on March 10, 1993. 5 The second requested extension of the pilot was approved on June 11, 1993. 6 The pilot program is set to expire on March 21, 1994. 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30189 (January 14, 1992), 57 FR 2621 (January 22, 1992) (File No. SR&hyph;MSE&hyph;91&hyph;10) (``1992 Approval Order''). 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31975 (March 10, 1993), 58 FR 14230 (March 16, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;MSE&hyph;93&hyph;04) (``March 1993 Approval Order''). 6 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32457 (June 11, 1993), 58 FR 33681 (June 18, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;MSE&hyph;93&hyph;14) (``June 1993 Approval Order''). II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The purpose of the proposed rule change is to extend the pilot program implemented to establish a procedure regarding the execution of ``stopped'' market orders in minimum variation markets (usually an 1/8th spread market). In 1992, the Exchange adopted interpretation and policy .03 to Rule 37 of Article XX, on a pilot basis, to permit stopped market orders in minimum variation markets. 7 Prior to the pilot program, no Exchange rule required specialists to grant stops in minimum variation markets if an out-of-range execution would result. While the Exchange has a policy regarding the execution of stopped market orders generally, the Exchange believes it is necessary to establish a separate policy for executing stopped market ordes when there is a minimum variation market. 7 See 1992 Approval Order, supra, note 4. The Exchange's general policy regarding the execution of stopped orders is to execute them based on the next primary market sale. If this policy were used in a minimum variation market, it would cause the anomalous result of requiring the execution of all pre-existing orders, even if those orders are not otherwise entitled to be filled. 8 8 For example, assume the market in ABC stock is 20&hyph;201/8; 50 x 50 with 1/8th being out of range. A customer places an order with the Exchange specialist to buy 100 shares of ABC at the market, and a stop is effected. The order is stopped at 201/8, and the Exchange specialist includes the order in his or her quote by bidding the 100 shares at 20. If the next sale on the primary market is for 100 shares at 20, adopting the Exchange's existing general policy to minimum variation markets would require the specialist to execute the stopped market order at 20. However, because the stopped market order does not have time or price priority, its execution would trigger the requirement for the Exchange specialist to execute all pre-existing bids (in this case, 5,000 shares) based on the Exchange's rules of priority and precedence. This is so even though the pre-existing bids were not otherwise entitled to be filled. In the above example, Exchange Rule 37 (Article XX) requires the Exchange specialist to fill orders at the limit price only if such orders would have been filled had they been transmitted to the primary market. Therefore, the 100 share print at 20 in the primary market would cause at most 100 of the 5,000 share limit order to be filled on the Exchange. However, the Exchange's general policy regarding stopped orders, if applied to minimum variation markets, would require the 100 share stopped market order to be filled, and, as a result, all pre-existing bids at the same price to be filled in accordance with Exchange Rule 16 (Article XX).
