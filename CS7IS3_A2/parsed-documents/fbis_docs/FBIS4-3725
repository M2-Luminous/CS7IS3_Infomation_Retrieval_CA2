Trade unions and individual workers are to be empowered with rights involving labour contracts, freedom to express opinions about the firms management, and representation on boards of directors and supervisors. Entitled "Suggestions on the Trade Unions' Role and Workers' Democratic Management under the Modern Enterprise System," the document will be submitted to the State Council for approval this month. The modern enterprise system, put forward by the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee last November calls on enterprises to operate in line with international practices. The State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System launched a pilot project earlier this year to establish the system initially in 100 State-owned enterprises. Most of these State firms will be restructured into limited-liability companies. On behalf of workers', ACFTU "warmly" supports the pilot project, said Wang Chidong, Deputy Director of the Grass-Roots Work Department of ACFTU. In such a system, trade unions have an even bigger role to play, said Wang. The workers should enjoy the freedom to attend and organize trade unions. They are also entitled to sign labour contracts with the company on the basis of free will and equality, to express disagreement on management policies and criticize managers, and to enjoy reasonable pay, work hours, labour safety, professional training, labour insurance, and welfare. In the 100 enterprises, trade unions are given authority to negotiate with the representatives of the board on labour disputes.
