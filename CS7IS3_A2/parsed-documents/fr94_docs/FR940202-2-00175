FR940202-2-00175 FR940202-2-00074 2. Technical Processing All applications will be placed in technical processing upon receipt of the response to the deficiency letter or at the end of the 14-day period. All applications will undergo a complete analysis. If a reviewer finds that clarification is needed to complete the review or an exhibit is missing that was not requested after initial screening, the reviewer shall immediately advise the Multifamily Housing Representative who will: (a) Request, by telephone, that the Sponsor submit the information within five (5) working days, and (b) follow up by certified letter. Communications must be attached to the technical review and findings memorandum. As part of this analysis, HUD will conduct its environmental review in accordance with 24 CFR part 50 on only those applications containing evidence of site control. Examples of reasons for technical processing rejection include an ineligible Sponsor, ineligible population to be served, lack of legal capacity and insufficient commitments or indications that supportive services will be available. The Secretary will not reject an application based on technical processing without giving notice of that rejection with all rejection reasons, and affording the applicant an opportunity to appeal. An applicant will be afforded 14 calendar days from the date of HUD's written notice to appeal a technical rejection to the Field Office. The Field Office must respond within 5 working days to the Sponsor. The Field Office shall make a determination on an appeal prior to making its selection recommendations. All applications will be either rated or Technically rejected at the end of technical processing. Technical processing will also assure that if the Sponsor has been found by a court or by a Federal, State, or local agency, in noncompliance with any of the statutes, regulations, or other requirements listed in the civil rights certification (ยง890.265(b)(9)(i)), HUD will obtain from the Sponsor a statement of the actions taken to correct that noncompliance. There must be no pending civil rights suits against the Sponsor instituted by the Department of Justice and no pending administrative actions for civil rights violations instituted by HUD. Moreover, there must not be a deferral of the processing of applications from the Sponsor imposed by HUD under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Department's implementing regulations (24 CFR 1.8), procedures (HUD Handbook 8040.1), and the Attorney General's Guidelines (28 CFR 50.3); or under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Department's implementing regulations (24 CFR 8.57), and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Upon completion of technical processing, all acceptable applications will be rated according to the selection criteria in ยง890.300(d) (also below in I.D.3). Applications which have a total score of 50 points or more will be eligible for selection and will be placed in rank order. 3. Selection Criteria Applications for section 811 capital advances that successfully complete technical processing will be rated using the following selection criteria: (a) The Sponsor's ability to develop and operate the proposed housing on a long-term basis, considering the following (50 points maximum): (1) The scope, extent and quality of the Sponsor's experience in providing housing or related services to those proposed to be served by the project and the scope of the proposed project ( i.e. , number of units, services, relocation costs, development, and operation) in relationship to the Sponsor's demonstrated development and management capacity.
