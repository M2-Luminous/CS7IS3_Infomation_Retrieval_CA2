FR940426-1-00017 FR940426-1-00004 B. Offerings Concept One: Regulation should be limited to securities offerings that give rise to a readily identifiable incentive to manipulate the market. 1. Definition of ``Distribution'' In imposing restrictions on the market activities of persons participating in a securities offering, the Commission has focused on ``offerings of such a nature or magnitude as to require restrictions upon purchases by participants in order to prevent manipulative practices.'' 40 The Commission has characterized such offerings as ``distributions,'' 41 and codified a definition of the term in Rule 10b&hyph;6: ``[T]he term distribution means an offering of securities, whether or not subject to registration under the Securities Act, that is distinguished from ordinary trading transactions by the magnitude of the offering and the presence of special selling efforts and selling methods.'' 42 This ``functional'' definition is intended to provide a greater degree of guidance on, and certainty to, the types of offerings that would give rise to an incentive to artificially condition the market for the offered security. The identification of these types of situations, however, needed to remain sufficiently flexible to permit the protections afforded by Rule 10b&hyph;6 to evolve with changes in the practices and methods of offering securities. 40 Bruns, Nordeman, 40 SEC at 660. 41 Accordingly, in this context the terms ``offering'' and ``distribution'' are not synonymous. See, e.g., 1982 Release, 47 FR at 11485. Generally, the term ``offering'' is used to encompass all methods by which securities are offered and sold to investors. In Rule 10b&hyph;6, the term ``distribution'' is used to identify an offering that can be presumed to raise an incentive to manipulate securities prices in order to facilitate the offering. See Bruns, Nordeman, 40 SEC at 660. This use of the term ``distribution'' should be distinguished from its use in the context of the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''), 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq. Collins Securities Corp., 46 SEC 20, amended, 46 SEC 213 (1975), rev'd on other grounds, Collins Securities Corp. v. SEC, 562 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1977). For a discussion of how the Commission has used the term ``distribution'' under the Securities Act, and relevant references, see Securities Act Release No. 6806 (October 25, 1988), 53 FR 44016, 44026 n.145 (proposing Rule 144A under the Securities Act). 42 Paragraph (c)(5). A ``distribution'' must have two elements: ``Magnitude'' and ``special selling efforts and selling methods.'' 43 Factors relevant to the magnitude element are: the number of shares to be registered for sale by the issuer, and the percentage of the outstanding shares, public float, and trading volume that those shares represent. 44 The Commission has indicated that providing greater than normal sales compensation arrangements pertaining to the distribution of a security, 45 delivering a sales document, such as a prospectus or market letters, and conducting ``road shows'' are generally indicative of ``special selling efforts and selling methods.'' 46 Based upon an analysis of their individual characteristics, the following transactions, among others, have been viewed as involving distributions under this definition: registered public offerings, private placements, Rule 144A transactions, rights offerings, warrant exercise solicitations, dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans, the issuance of securities in connection with a merger or exchange offer, 47 ``major sales campaigns'' by a broker-dealer, and sales made pursuant to a shelf registration statement. 43 As the definition was proposed originally, either element alone would have been sufficient. See 1982 Release, 47 FR at 11484. 44 1982 Release, 47 FR at 11486. 45 See 1983 Release, 48 FR at 10630 n.13. 46 See, e.g., Note, The SEC's Rule 10b&hyph;6: Preserving a Competitive Market During Distributions, 1967 Duke L.J. 809, 823&hyph;824 (``1967 Note''); III L. Loss, Securities Regulation at 1597 (2d. ed. 1961) (``Loss''). 47 1983 Release, 48 FR at 10638. See also Chris-Craft Industries, Inc. v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 480 F.2d 341, 377 (2d Cir. 1973), rev'd on other grounds, Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., 430 U.S. 1 (1977). Moreover, the restrictions of Rule 10b&hyph;6 also have been interpreted to apply to those periods when a security's market price is used to value the consideration in the distribution. 1983 Release, 48 FR at 10638 n.61. In addition to identifying the type of offerings that may present the incentive for the particular harm that Rule 10b&hyph;6 was intended to address, it also is necessary to determine when a distribution begins and when it ends. ``A distribution commences at the point when the incentive to engage in manipulative conduct is first present,'' 48 and a distribution is complete when the securities ``come to rest in the hands of the investing public.'' 49 Rule 10b&hyph;6(c)(3) specifies when a person's participation in a particular distribution is deemed to have been completed. For example, the rule states that an underwriter's participation is over when it has distributed its portion of the offering, including any securities of the same class that were acquired in connection with the distribution, and when any stabilizing operations and trading restrictions in connection with the distribution have been terminated. 50 In addition, a person is deemed to have distributed securities acquired by him for investment. The determination of how long securities must be held to constitute an investment will depend upon the facts and circumstances. 51 48 SEC v. Burns, 816 F.2d 471, 476 (9th Cir. 1987), citing 1982 Release, 47 FR at 11485 (in the case of a registered offering, the distribution may commence not only before the registration statement for those securities becomes effective, but also before such statement is filed with the Commission); Gob Shops of America, Inc., 39 SEC 93 (1959) (bids and purchases by a prospective underwriter four months before the filing with the Commission of a notification relating to a Regulation A offering were manipulative). 49 See, e.g., R.A. Holman & Co., Inc. v. SEC, 366 F.2d 446, 449 (2d Cir. 1966), amended on reh'g, 377 F.2d 665 (2d Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 991 (1967), rehearing denied, 389 U.S. 1060 (1968) (``Holman''); Rooney, Pace Inc., 48 SEC 891, 898&hyph;99 (1987). 50 Paragraph (c)(3)(ii). The Commission has held that completion of an underwriter's participation in a distribution ``does not mean substantial completion.'' Shearson, Hammill & Co., 42 SEC 811, 821 n.20 (1965). 51 See Holman, 366 F.2d at 450. Simply placing shares in an ``investment account,'' however, is not conclusive as to whether the securities are acquired ``for investment.'' See C.A. Benson & Co., Inc., 41 SEC 427 (1963).
