Additionally, six out of 10 Panamanians think that the cost of living has increased the last four months. The survey conducted exclusively for EL PANAMA AMERICA details that 69 percent of 1,218 people polled hope that the U.S. Southern Command remains in Panama after the year 2000, and 23 percent reject the U.S. presence. Regarding the cost of living increase, it is mostly felt by 40-year-old women and those with a high school education. Despite the cost of living increase experienced by Panamanians, the poll showed that 62 percent believe the country's situation will improve in the next two years. Regarding the creation of jobs, nearly half of those interviewed said the government is responsible for hiring more people in government positions, but four out of 10 Panamanians think the private sector must increase its efforts to create new jobs. The view of those polled contrasts with the objectives of government and international organizations economists, who think the state must reduce its payroll, which employs 140,000 officials earning monthly wages totalling 69 million balboas. The CID/GALLUP poll also revealed 55 percent of those polled prefer to work in the private sector and only 27 percent favor a job in the public sector.
