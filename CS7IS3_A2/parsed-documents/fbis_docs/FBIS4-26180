Delivering a summation speech at the conference on behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council, Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, called on the whole party and all sectors of society to act energetically to implement the guidelines of the conference and to strive to make contributions to help China's education system flourish. Ding Guangen, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and Secretariat, presided over the closing ceremony. Attending the conference were leading comrades, including Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, Song Jian, Li Guixian, and Ismail Amat. Responsible comrades from the central committees of the various democratic parties and leaders of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce were invited to attend the conference. In his speech, Li Lanqing said: In convening this high-level conference, the party Central Committee and the State Council aimed to mobilize the whole party and all sectors of society, beginning with high-ranking leaders of the party and government, to earnestly implement the "Outline" [Outline Program for the Reform and Development of Education in China], push forward the reform and development of education in China, and enable education to make greater contributions to China's socialist modernization drive. Delegates attending the conference said unanimously that Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech and Comrade Li Peng's keynote report showed great foresight and contained both strategic principles and pragmatic and specific policies and measures, all of which demonstrated the determination of the party Central Committee and the State Council to attach importance to the development of education, and also demonstrated their ardent expectation that all sectors of society would attach importance to the development of education. Li Lanqing stressed: The fundamental way to solve educational problems in China is reform. Of course, we must also make conscientious efforts to tackle the practical difficulties and problems facing education. China is a developing country with nearly 1.2 billion people and a relatively backward economy, but it is running education at a scale that surpasses that of every country in the world. With limited financial strength, China will not be able to put sufficient funding into education to meet practical needs. This will remain a contradiction for a long time to come. We must proceed from reality, improve educational efficiency in China through reform of education, and find a new path for the development of education that suits China's national conditions. He pointed out: Making nine-year compulsory education universal and eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in China by the end of this century constitute the foundation for raising the quality of the whole nation and the cornerstone for China's socialist modernization drive. The whole party and every sector of society must take the realization of these "two basic goals" as an urgent and magnificent historical mission. To ensure the realization of the "two basic goals," they must vigorously create conditions and overcome difficulties. The "two basic goals" set by the conference are: To make, by the end of this century, nine-year compulsory education standard in about 85 percent of the populated areas, with school attendance rates in middle schools reaching 85 percent; and make the literacy rate among young and middle-aged people 95 percent. This is in accord with China's national conditions, and we are confident of fulfilling the objectives. We have made elementary education universal in 91 percent of the populated areas, with attendance by school-age students in elementary schools reaching 98.3 percent, and that of students in junior middle schools 73 percent. The development of the economy in the 1990's will provide a better material basis for educational development. Because China is a huge country with a vast territory, and conditions in each area differ considerably, we have formulated a principle according to which programs will be drawn up in line with the characteristics of each region, guidance will be offered in line with specific conditions, and implementation of programs will be carried out step by step. In line with the actual conditions in each region, we have set the goal and a deadline for making education universal, and put forward methods and modes of running schools as well as corresponding measures for educational reform. We will not insist on uniformity, and this will help enhance the initiative of different regions in fulfilling the "two basic goals." At present, three are 36 million illiterates among China's young and middle-aged people. In the past few years, the number of illiterates has been reduced by about 5 million each year. At this rate, it is possible essentially to eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people by the end of this century if governments at all levels and all sectors of society work conscientiously toward this goal. Li Lanqing said: The difficulty in making nine-year compulsory education universal lies in the countryside, especially in poor areas. In developing education in the countryside, we must resolutely change the guiding principle of running schools divorced from rural economic construction, which exists in varying degrees, and find a way of running schools suited to local conditions. In developing rural education, we must increase investment and improve the conditions for running schools. At the same time, we should vigorously encourage overall planning for elementary, middle school, and high school education and the integration of agriculture with science and education. In either nine-year education or six-year education, students should learn to read and write well and cultivate fine moral integrity and civilized habits. On this basis, some vocational skills and knowledge of applied science should be taught. Li Lanqing said: In achieving the "two basic goals," efforts should also be made, first, to go all out to cultivate qualified teachers and run normal schools well; second, to continue to run enterprise-affiliated middle and primary schools and kindergartens well while changing the operating mechanisms of enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise system; third, to give special aid to the education of ethnic minority people; fourth, to pay close attention to various kinds of special education and nursery and preschool education and attach importance to problems related to girls' school attendance; and fifth, to combine the drive to wipe out illiteracy with programs on studying general knowledge and technical skills and disseminating socialist spiritual civilization. Discussing vocational and adult education, he said: Vigorously promoting vocational and adult education is the only effective way to train large numbers of skilled people, which conforms with China's national conditions; it is also the only way to modernize education and revitalize the economy. In China today, those who are able to attend colleges and universities are, after all, the minority. The overwhelming majority of young people, after undergoing basic education up to a certain age, can acquire skills only through vocational education. We must vigorously promote vocational and adult education so as to provide opportunities for them to receive technical and professional training and to enable them to become qualified workers with suitable skills needed by society. He said: Adult education is a new form of education which develops the traditional school education to a life-long learning process; and it is of great importance to raising the quality of the nation and directly and effectively promoting economic and social development. We should go all out to run various adult educational institutions well so as to update the knowledge of people who are employed and to continually raise their ideological and cultural qualities and professional capabilities. Discussing reform of the higher educational system, he said: Schools of higher learning are the primary bases for training high-level talented personnel and developing science and technology, and the development of science and technology is the fundamental guarantee for realizing China's second- and third-step strategic goals of development and for meeting the challenges in the 21st century. To accomplish this glorious and yet arduous task, China's schools of higher learning must further improve the quality of education and efficiency of school management through reforms. He discussed, in particular, views on reforming schools administered by departments. He said: The system of running schools of higher learning by departments took shape when the structure of a planned economy was in effect; and it played an important and positive role in developing higher education in the past. However, such a system of administering schools of higher learning, characterized by barriers between different departments, was one of the major causes for the "small but comprehensive" system, redundant establishment of schools and majors, and poor efficiency. Along with the gradual deepening of the economic structural reform, such maladies have become increasing obvious, causing more and more serious problems for schools of higher learning. Therefore, it is imperative to carry out reform systematically in line with the goal set forth in the "Outline." At present, there are some 300 schools of higher learning administered by ministries and central departments. Through the joint efforts of various sectors in the past more than a year, dozens of them have shifted or are trying to shift to joint management with local communities, while many of them are preparing for reform. In the future, schools of higher learning administered by ministries and central departments should focus reforms on expanding their services and increasing majors. They should gear themselves to the needs of society, run schools independently, encourage management of schools in various forms, rationalize the distribution of schools, and raise the efficiency of school management. Except for special trades and professions in need of continued management of a few backbone schools, the majority of schools should gradually shift from the system of management at the central and provincial levels to the system at the provincial level so as to allow provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to map out overall arrangements and rationally distribute schools of higher learning within their jurisdiction, thereby reducing the unnecessary redundant establishment of schools and majors and concentrating manpower and material resources on improving the quality and standards of a number of schools of higher learning. All relevant central departments should continue to strengthen support and leadership over their affiliated schools of higher learning. The purpose of reform is to improve the quality and efficiency of these schools and alleviate their difficulties in running schools. He pointed out: The task is difficult and needs all-out cooperation and support from all sectors. In carrying out the reform, it is necessary to proceed from the realities, adopt a positive approach, and take prudent measures. The majority of ministry-affiliated schools may begin various kinds of joint management with local communities and then later delegate managerial autonomy to them after conditions are ripe. Where conditions permit, managerial autonomy can be delegated to local communities immediately. In a nutshell, it is necessary to stress actual benefits, and guard against formalism and rushing headlong to delegate managerial autonomy. As for intensifying and improving schools' moral education, Li Lanqing pointed out: While intensifying education on patriotism, socialism, and collectivism, we should also compile Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics into teaching materials for educating young people. We should attach importance to education about China's moral traditions, living examples should be used for education about the national situation, attention should be paid to aesthetics education, and efforts should be made to educate students about the Constitution and to be law-abiding citizens. Commenting on issues of common concern within educational circles and in society as a whole, Li Lanqing said that more resources must be channeled to education. He said: The State Council departments concerned and governments at all levels must carry out the specific requirement which Premier Li set out in his report -- that governments must increase their investment in education. All provinces must increase their educational budgets in light of their goals for educational development. Meanwhile, in accordance with the needs for deepening various reform projects, educational funds should be raised through various avenues and continual efforts should be made to improve the mechanisms that ensure inputs for education. Li Lanqing pointed out: Teachers hold the key to educational reform and development. Governments at all levels are duty bound to raise teachers' social status and their pay as the "Teachers Law" requires. This responsibility should be shared by governments at all levels and all relevant departments. While the Central Committee, the State Council, and governments at various levels have done a great deal of work since 1993 in paying teachers' unpaid wages, new arrears have again been incurred. This problem should never be treated lightly. We must clearly understand that teachers' being able to receive their wages in full and on time is an important provision of the "Teachers Law" as well as a basic right of the vast number of teachers. It is a direct responsibility of governments at all levels to resolve and guard against the problem of the delayed payment of teachers' wages. Principal leading comrades of all party committees and governments must seriously approach and resolve this problem. Li Lanqing also commented on issues concerning teachers at nongovernment schools, the unauthorized establishment of universities and colleges, unauthorized student enrollment, improving the quality of meals at universities and colleges, and subsidizing students who have financial difficulties. Li Lanqing told all localities and departments that they must promptly convey the guidelines laid down in the educational conference and organize the vast number of cadres and masses to study Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech and Comrade Li Peng's report. He said: Relevant departments of the State Council and party committees and governments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities under the central government's direct jurisdiction must earnestly study and draw up plans and measures for implementing the guidelines laid down by the conference. He stressed: Implementing the "outline" as well as the views on implementing the "outline" is the responsibility of governments at all levels. Party committees and governments at all levels should place the implementation of this "outline" high on their agendas and should draw up specific measures for implementing the "outline." Leading cadres must earnestly change their leadership style and methods of work; and principal leaders must personally investigate, study, and handle major problems arising from implementing the "outline." In his speech, Ding Guangen said: This conference was an important conference in China's history of educational development. The conference is a complete success thanks to the direct leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council, as well as to the efforts exerted by comrades attending the conference. Education has a close bearing on training personnel for the 21st century, on China's economic revitalization, and on the nation's future. We must display the spirit of holding ourselves responsible for the state and the nation and earnestly follow through with the assignments put forward by the conference so as to create a situation in which China's educational cause will continue to thrive.
