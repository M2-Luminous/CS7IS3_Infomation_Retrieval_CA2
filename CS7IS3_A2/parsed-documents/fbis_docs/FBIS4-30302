The letter is as follows: Pyongyang. To DPRK President Comrade Kim Il-song: Dear Comrade Kim Il-song, on behalf of the great Russian people and the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, which was chosen by the Russian people to speak for their interest, I send you a solidarity letter. The Russian people are facing the world imperialists' pressure, which is being inflicted upon the fraternal DPRK, with anger and indignation. We, who are Russians, regard that as a sovereign state, the DPRK has a complete right to conduct voluntary science and research work to safeguard its people's welfare and interest. I attentively studied your country's history and know very well that just like Russia, Korea's patriotism was not to occupy another country's territory, but to safeguard even an inch of their land. Korea has never committed an aggressive war. The chuche idea is a manifestation of the traditional Korean-style patriotism. Russians are well aware of the fact that the DPRK never threatened another country and does not threaten another country, but that as a sovereign state, it will not allow anyone to attempt to yield the DPRK for its interest. Also, we do not want other countries to force their intention on the DPRK. History shows that when it came time for the DPRK to defeat outside aggression, the Russian people sincerely helped the DPRK. Currently, we are supporting your policy to peacefully resolve the country's division. I think that the 10-point program of great national unity for the fatherland's reunification, which you put forth, is the most magnificent, practical, and just road for the country's reunification. In the name of the Russian people, I wish that the fraternal Korean people can establish a national, peaceful, nonaligned, and neutral reunified state in the form of a confederal system as soon as possible. [Signed] Zhirinovskiy [Dated] 21 June 1994, Moscow
