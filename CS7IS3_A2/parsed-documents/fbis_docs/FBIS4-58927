PLO Executive Committee Member Samir Ghawshah said that Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), Faruq Qaddumi, Jamal al-Surani, Sulayman al-Najjab, and he himself declined to participate in the Council. Ghawshah disclosed that he is seeking clarification from 'Arafat concerning the Council's mode of operation, 'Arafat's leadership style, and the relation between the PLO Executive Committee and the Council, before he decides whether to participate in the council. Ghawshah pointed out that Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh and Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi have both asked for some time to think about participating in the Council. Yasir 'Amr and Juwayd al-Ghusayn have agreed to participate in the Council. Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, former head of the Palestinian negotiating delegation, and Mahir al-Misri, a prominent figure in Nabulus, have both refused to take part in the Council. There is a consensus among Palestinian officials inside and outside the homeland not to take part in the Council until they are offered clarification about the Council's operating procedure and guarantees that 'Arafat will not be the sole decision-maker. These officials also call for a clear definition of the relation between the PLO Executive Committee and the Council. They believe that the PLO Executive Committee should control the Council that it will form and retain the authority to shape Palestinian policy, Ghawshah declared. A committee formed of Faruq Qaddumi, Abu-Mazin and Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh will get in touch with Palestinian figures at home and abroad to explore the conditions under which they would be willing to participate in the National Authority Council and ascertain their opinion concerning the Council's mode of operation.
