The Agricultural Administration Council, an advisory panel to the prime minister and farm minister, is expected to discuss ways to help Japanese farmers, particularly those growing rice, to survive in the face of growing international competition. In December last year, Japan agreed to gradually open its heavily protected rice market as part of a deal struck in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. The panel is expected to examine the various aspects of the nation's agriculture, from the nature of farm areas to product prices and distribution systems. It is scheduled to issue a mid- term report by the end of July. Hosokawa attended the first day of the panel meeting Tuesday, along with Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Eijiro Hata. Hosokawa stressed that the government is set to take all possible measures to help Japanese farmers. Hata pledged that his ministry will ensure stable production, particularly of rice, on the basis of the panel's recommendations, and will maintain balanced demand and supply as well as prices. Members of the panel said they should examine the Foodstuff Control Law, other related laws, and ways to revitalize farm areas.
