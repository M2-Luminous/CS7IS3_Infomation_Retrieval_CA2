Several senior government officials, and especially serving officers of the Namibian Defense Force, are also named as beneficiaries of the plan in which, among other things, provision is made for the "expropriation" of farms being used by the National Development Corporation (NDC) in Kavango for beef production. The project includes the handing over of altogether five NDC farms, comprising more than 24,000 hectares in the Kavango Mangetti region, to the Namibian Defense Force to begin a farming project. The reason for the army taking over farming activities is apparently to make the Ministry of Defense less dependent on the private sector for the provision of meat and vegetables to military units in the north. Confidential sources in the defense force say that the once the development of this gigantic farm is completed at state cost it will be handed over to the former fighters. According to documents in the possession of DIE REPUBLIKEIN, the awarding of farms to former members of SWAPO's [South-West African People's Organization] armed wing, PLAN, is taking place under the guise of a resettlement project. An inter-ministerial pilot committee comprising the Ministry of Land Affairs, Resettlement and Rehabilitation, the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Rural Development, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, and the NDC has already been established to finalize the project. The former fighters are represented by the "SWAPO Veteran's Trust," who liaises directly with the new committee through a representative, Mr. Mzee Kaukungwa, also a prominent SWAPO leader and member of the party's Central Committee. The SWAPO organization for war veterans, in collaboration with the pilot committee, is also responsible for the appointment and approval of PLAN members who will qualify for farms. An initial list of approximately 200 former PLAN members was rejected by the technical committee under the chairmanship of the permanent secretary of Land affairs, Resettlement and Rehabilitation, Mrs. Ulitala Hiveluah, after members of the committee found that names of people on the list included those of people who had died under unknown circumstances in the bush war. A second list with approximately 100 names is being studied by the committee. Several of the former fighters are hailed as "war heroes of SWAPO" and are also the relatives or recipients of the so-called Ongulumbashe medals. The secret project was approved by the cabinet on 18 January this year after which an order, not a request, was issued to begin with the identification and demarcation of suitable farming land in the Okavango Mangetti region. The setting up of infrastructure such as bore holes and fences on the farms, the upgrading of roads, the provision of accommodation and telephone links, a clinic and even a school, will be carried out at an initial cost of approximately 12 million Namibian dollars before the farms are handed over to the beneficiaries. An amount of 1 million dollars has already been made available from state funds for the purchasing of livestock for the former PLAN members, while an unknown amount from the budget of the Ministry of Land Affairs will be contributed towards the resettlement fund for the new community. [passage omitted] Yesterday the government denied any knowledge of the two projects -- which has to be started before the forthcoming presidential general and presidential elections (that is the former PLAN farms and the army farms) -- at the highest level. [passage omitted] The official spokesman for the NDC, Mr. Mathew Gowaseb, confirmed the existence of the two projects but referred all enquiries to the head of the agricultural department, Mrs. Anna Shiwedha. She was not available for comment, however. [passage omitted]
