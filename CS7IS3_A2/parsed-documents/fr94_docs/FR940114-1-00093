FR940114-1-00093 FR940114-1-00018 (ii) A loan is conclusively determined to be legally unenforceable to the extent that the guarantor determines, pursuant to an objection presented in a proceeding prior to credit bureau reporting, tax refund offset, wage garnishment, or other administrative proceeding, that the loan is not legally enforceable; and (iii) If an objection has been raised by the borrower or another party about the legal enforceability of the loan and no determination has been made under paragraph (a)(4) (i) or (ii) of this section, the Secretary may authorize the payment of a claim under this section under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate. If the Secretary determines in that or any other case that a claim was paid under this section with respect to a loan that was not a legally enforceable obligation of the borrower, the recipient of that payment must refund that amount of the payment to the Secretary. (b) Death. (1) If an individual borrower dies, or the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan dies, the obligation of the borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is canceled. (2) In determining that a borrower (or student) has died, the lender may rely on a death certificate or other proof of death that is acceptable under applicable state law. If a death certificate or other acceptable proof of death is not available, the borrower's obligation on the loan can be canceled only if the guaranty agency determines that other evidence establishes that the borrower (or student) has died. (3) After receiving information indicating that the borrower (or student) has died, the lender, if it believes the information to be reliable, shall suspend any collection activity against the borrower and promptly request that the borrower's representative (or the student's parent in the case of a PLUS loan) provide the documentation described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. During the suspension of collection activity, which may not exceed 60 days, the lender shall diligently attempt to obtain documentation verifying the borrower's (or student's) death. If, despite diligent attempts, the lender is not able to confirm the borrower's (or student's) death within 60 days, the lender shall resume collection activity from the point that it had been discontinued and is deemed to have exercised forbearance as to repayment of the loan during the period when collection activity was suspended. (4) Once the lender has determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that the borrower (or student) has died, the lender may not attempt to collect on the loan from the borrower's estate or from any endorser. (5) The lender shall return to the sender any payments received from the estate or paid on behalf of the borrower after the date of the borrower's (or student's) death. (c) Total and permanent disability. (1) If the lender determines that an individual borrower is totally and permanently disabled, the obligation of the borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is canceled. A borrower is not considered totally and permanently disabled on the basis of a condition that existed at the time he or she applied for the loan, unless the borrower's condition has substantially deteriorated later, so as to render the borrower totally and permanently disabled. In the case of a Consolidation loan, the borrower must certify that the condition did not exist prior to the time the borrower applied for each of the underlying loans, unless the condition has substantially deteriorated, so as to render the borrower totally and permanently disabled. If the condition existed prior to the date the Consolidation loan was made, the borrower must provide the lender with the disbursement dates of the underlying loans. * * * * * (d) Closed school. (1) General. (i) The Secretary reimburses the holder of a loan received by a borrower on or after January 1, 1986, and discharges the borrower's obligation with respect to the loan, if the borrower (or the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan) could not complete the program of study for which the loan was intended because the school at which the borrower (or student) was enrolled, closed, or the borrower (or student) withdrew from the school not more than 90 days prior to the date the school closed. (ii) For purposes of the closed school discharge authorized by this section_
