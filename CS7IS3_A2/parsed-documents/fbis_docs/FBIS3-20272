[Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur's advisers stressed on Monday [28 March] that there was "nothing of concern" in this formula which, as France and most of its partners had wanted, keeps the blocking minority in the Council at 30 percent of the votes. To take into account the enlargement of the European Union [EU] to 16 members, this minority will pass from 23 votes out of 76 to 27 out of 90 on 1 January 1995. The compromise reached to meet the concerns of the British and the Spanish -- the obligation to arrive at a consensus agreement within a "reasonable time" in the event of there being a minority of 23 to 26 votes opposing a decision -- appeared yesterday to pose less of a problem to Paris than it had the night before when Foreign Minister Alain Juppe had considered this arrangement to be "too imprecise." A government expert on European issues said: "We have put into writing what is currently the usual practice." To illustrate the artificial nature of the debate on the voting rights, he stressed that it is very rare that a formal vote is needed (in his opinion "10 times at most" in more than 30 years of European Council meetings, which is probably a considerable underestimation) and that "each time a EC state considers that a decision poses a problem for it, either politically or economically, and even if it stands alone in this, no decision is made." More Reservations in Brussels Than in Paris Unless it is given a legal value by writing it into the EU treaties, as London has demanded, the formalization of what was until now simply common practice has apparently led to more reservations in Brussels than in Paris. In the European circles of the Belgian capital, it is suspected that the Ioannina compromise will aggravate the risks of paralysis of the European Council, at least until 1996 when the reform of Community institutions begins, as provided for in the Maastricht Treaty. The French Government does not underestimate this risk, but nor does it regard it as a catastrophe. After all, a senior French official observed, the ability of the European Council to make decisions has only been partially altered since several areas -- some of the most important ones -- of Council activity are not affected by the Ioannina procedure. This notably includes decisions relating to the budget, taxation, and trade policy. The European governments have until this evening to make their feelings known on this institutional compromise. In Paris yesterday it was hoped that no one would now block an arrangement that had had such a difficult birth.
