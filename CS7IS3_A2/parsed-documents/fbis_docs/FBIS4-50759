FBIS4-50759 "drchi099_a_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-099 Daily Report 21 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General Official Views Status in `Copyright Community' Official Views Status in `Copyright Community' OW2105135494 Beijing XINHUA in English 1315 GMT 21 May 94 OW2105135494 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, May 21 (XINHUA) -- A senior official at the State Copyright Bureau (SCB) today described China "an active member of the international copyright community." He cited numerous facts to show that China sets great store by protecting the intellectual property rights in line with international standards. Shen Rengan, deputy bureau director, noted that under China's copyright law, works of foreigners first published in China will enjoy copyright. The law protects any work of a foreigner published outside China which is eligible to enjoy copyright under an agreement concluded between the country to which the foreigner belongs and China, or under an international treaty to which both countries are parties, he said. Addressing an international seminar here on intellectual property protection, he said that China makes such protection "an important part of the policy of reform and opening to the world." Work began in 1979 to draft the law, which was promulgated in September, 1990 and went into effect in June 1991. "In drafting the law," he said, "judicial organs and the drafting group seriously studied the international copyright convention and see to it that the law meets the requirements of that convention." China became the 93rd country to accede to the Berne Convention when it joined in October, 1992 and accordingly, the State Council published a set of rules to implement it. That means, he said, that China provides protection to authors of all member states of the convention and their works. According to the State Council document, foreign computer programs, once imported into China, automatically enjoy protection for a period of 50 years, in conformity with stipulations of the convention. When foreign works are performed in China, the Chinese users are obliged to acquire agreement in advance from the authors and duly pay them afterwards. The Copyright Bureau and the Ministry of Finance see to it that Chinese users acquire the foreign currency needed to pay the owners of the copyrights they have used, he said. The copyright law, he said, "basically conforms to the standards of the Berne Convention," but differences do exist. "Preparations are under way to revise the law so that it conforms entirely to the convention." He added: "China has established a rather complete copyright law system and implemented it." Last May, he said, the Enesco Corporation in the state of Ohio requested the SCB to investigate and redress a case of alleged infringement of its copyright in China. It complained that counterfeit copies of its toys were displayed on exhibition counters during the Guangzhou Spring Export Commodities Fair. After investigation, the SCB ordered the infringers to stop reproducing and selling the counterfeit toys, to turn over all the counterfeit toys to the local copyright administration, and to pay a fine. "The doors of the Chinese people's courts and the SCB are always open," he said. "Anyone who possesses valid copyright finds it infringed upon can, and is welcome to bring the case before a people's court or the SCB." He admits that some copyrighted works were and still are pirated in China, especially books and video works. He said China has spared no efforts in cracking down on copyright infringements and will continue to do so. According to shen, the SCB has submitted a draft bill to the legislative body to impose criminal sanctions against piracy and other serious copyright infringement acts. "In the international copyright community," he said, "China is still a relatively young member and therefore, needs the assistance of those countries with a more developed copyright system."
