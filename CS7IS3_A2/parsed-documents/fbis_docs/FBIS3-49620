The letter, signed by four HZDS deputies and leaders of east Slovak HZDS branches and published today in the pro-government regional daily LUC, opposes President Michal Kovac's proposal to form a broad coalition government. The letter questions the right of those who in the past had refused to vote for the current Constitution (the Christian Democratic Movement and ethnic Hungarian parties), created new groups of deputies (former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko who formed 8-deputy strong Alliance of Slovak Democrats), and who called for early elections (Democratic Left Party). Salczerova said that it was common for regional leaders to send an open letter to a state official or to issue a declaration after their meeting. The open letter has not been consulted with the nationwide HZDS leadership, she added.
