The resolution ignores the new Russian constitution and brings back the atrocities of the 1930s. Mr. Yeltsin's other latest decisions are meant to leave the national economy in ruins and run counter to his own message on strengthening Russian statehood. The communist group also demands the suspension of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA daily revoked by an ad hoc commission to be set up for the purpose. The group called former mps from all ex-Soviet republics to a congress of June 25 to demand the USSR re-established.
