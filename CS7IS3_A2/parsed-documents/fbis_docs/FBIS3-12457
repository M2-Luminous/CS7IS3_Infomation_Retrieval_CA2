The holy communion was chaired by Maronite Patriarch Mar Nasrallah Butrus Sfayr, assisted by a group of patriarchs and priests. President Ilyas al-Hirawi and his wife attended the mass. The prime minister was represented by Minister Hagop Demerdjian and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri was represented by Deputy Rashid al-Khazin. A large number of ministers, deputies, and key figures also attended. In his homily, Patriarch Sfayr said: Some say that such crimes happen in the best of countries, but this is not satisfactory. There they capture the culprits, who then receive the punishment they deserve. Here however, the perpetrators remain unknown, either due to impotence or willingness to keep people in the dark; both amount to the same thing. These two reasons do not exempt the state from its responsibility for finding the culprits; they do not alleviate the obsessions and fears; and they do not insure safety for citizens. The Maronite patriarch urged a state that applies right and justice and treats all equally. President al-Hirawi said in a speech: I came to this church to accept condolences in the name of the whole country, and to say that for thousands of years we have been destined to stand fast, from Wadi Qannubin to the cedar-clad mountains, to any spot in this sacred land. He added: I came to this church to say, in front of Your Beatitude, the other priests, and the representative of the Pope that we will remain faithful to this pledge, standing fast in Lebanon. [(Clandestine) Radio Free Lebanon in Arabic at 1010 GMT on 28 February adds: "President al-Hirawi said: We will remain faithful to the pledge, and the hands that encroach upon Lebanon will be cut off. Tendentious people have no place among us. When peace began its march, they began their shameful acts."]
