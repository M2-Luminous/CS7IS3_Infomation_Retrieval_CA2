Since its arrival here on February 8, the Albanian parliamentary delegation led by Mr. Arbnori met Bulgarian Deputy Foreign Minister Todor Churov, Bulgarian Patriarch Maksim and President Zhelyu Zhelev. Its meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev initially scheduled for today was not held. The Albanian guests yesterday had talks with National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov and representatives of the four parliamentary factions. The bilateral relations, the situation in the Balkans and the project for the construction of the east-west trunk road were high on the agenda of the meetings. "The major thing is that there is not a single issue in the bilateral relations we cannot settle. We are in favour of peace in the Balkans, a just peace in agreement with the international principles for observation of human rights, we are in favour of promoting our economic, political and cultural contacts with Bulgaria and bringing our countries closer by means of the east-west trunk road that will link Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Turkey," Mr. Arbnori said after his meeting with President Zhelev. He also said that Albanian minister of transport and communications, as well as Albania's President Sali Berisha will visit Bulgaria some time soon. Following a meeting at the Foreign Ministry, Deputy Foreign Minister Churov and Mr. Arbnori said that the two countries share identical views on the Yugo-war, based on support for a peaceful solution to the conflict and prevention of its spill-over. Voicing a serious concern over the condition of Albanians in Kosovo, the Albanian People's Assembly chairman underscored the need for observation of their human rights. Mr. Churov said that the Bulgarian side has expressed its principled stand on the observation of human rights and the status of Kosovo and has stressed that Kosovo should be prevented from turning into a bridge between the conflict already existing and a large-scale Balkan war. The Bulgarian side reiterated the stance it has adopted at the very outbreak of the conflict: This country is against the setting up of ethnically-based states, the transgressing of existing borders and forcible territorial gains, Mr. Churov said. He went on to say that, on the other hand, Bulgaria is ready to accept decisions taken by the sovereign will of the countries immediately involved in the conflict. Commenting on his failed meeting with the deputy prime minister, Mr. Arbnori explained with understanding that Mr. Matinchev has been urgently summoned in parliament to attend a closed-door sitting on the 1994 security and defence budget bill. The Albanian guests met Bulgarian Patriarch Maksim at their request. Speaking on the national radio, Bishop Neofit of Lefkia quoted Mr. Arbnori as saying at the meeting that the Albanian Orthodox Church seeks to maintain good contacts with the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and is supportive of extending grants to Albanian students to study at Bulgarian theological schools. Patriarch Maksim is reported as expressing a hope that the relations between the two Orthodox Churches will be further promoted in the future. Tomorrow the Albanian delegation will visit cultural and historical sites in the countryside.
