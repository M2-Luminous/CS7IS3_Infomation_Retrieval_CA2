Asked about his position on Aleksander Kwasniewski's statement that the president had no right to withdraw his representative from the Constitutional Commission, Lech Walesa said: [Walesa] "If postcommunists and Kwasniewski were to have the real power, his idol Stalin would surely lock me up for that." [Announcer] Lech Walesa said that he is ready to talk with the Sejm speaker about issues which have prospects for being resolved. [Walesa] "The president has to talk and will talk with the speaker on issues which have prospects for being resolved. Nothing can be done on this issue of constitutional conflict, unless the speaker secures different voting." [Announcer] President Walesa probably will not visit the Sejm building again. [Walesa] "As I have noticed, there is no point, and I think that we are going to have ever fewer things in common."
