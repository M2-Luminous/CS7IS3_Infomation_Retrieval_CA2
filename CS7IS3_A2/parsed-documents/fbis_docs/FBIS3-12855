FBIS3-12855 "drnes044_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-044 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Mar 1994 SYRIA UN Urged To Take Action on Massacre, Settlements Press Urges `Firm' Resolution JN0603084894 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0545 GMT 6 Mar 94 JN0603084894 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [From the press review] [Text] Under the headline "Israeli Hypocrisy," the newspaper TISHRIN editorial says: The world is awaiting a positive UN Security Council [UNSC] stand condemning the heinous Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, providing for protection of Palestinians under occupation, and underscoring the foundations of just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Israeli officials have been making a flood of statements, demanding the immediate resumption of the negotiations, as if the massacre did not take place, as if the settlers problem has been resolved, and as if there are no longer any threats to Arab lives. TISHRIN adds: Israeli officials have leaked reports to the effect that they have disarmed only two settlers. We should remember that the population of Zionist settlers in the occupied territories stands at 150,000. The settlers, who are armed to the teeth, have not concealed their determination to persist with their murders, sabotage, and massacres. This shows the immense deception in which the Israeli officials are engaged, as well as the immense disregard in which they hold the international community. The paper notes the Israeli officials' zeal for the resumption of their stalled talks with the Palestinians. The paper maintains that this reflects their fears over the future of the Oslo and Cairo accords. This is because the two accords have, practically speaking, given Israel a free hand in the occupied Arab territories, and consecrated fully the Zionist domination of affairs there. The paper says: The two accords provide for security arrangements, as well as a redeployment of Israeli troops to protect settlements. By contrast, these accords have failed to include any provisions regarding the protection of Palestinians from the attacks of settlers or the Israeli Army. TISHRIN believes that the Israeli demand that Syria declare commitment to just and comprehensive peace is a clear manifestation of Israeli hypocrisy. The paper reiterates that Syria, through President al-Asad, has repeatedly declared such a commitment. Moreover, Syria repeatedly saved the Washington talks from collapse, and made repeated calls for a true peace in the Middle East. However, Israel has lent deaf ears to these calls. It has done all it can to blackmail the Palestinians and push them toward a separate deal that neither realizes the Palestinian people's aspirations, nor meets the requirements of the desired peace in the region. Concluding its editorial, the paper urges the UNSC, which is continuing its debate on the Hebron massacre, to uphold the principles enshrined in the UN Charter and prove the credibility of the world community by dotting the i's and crossing the t's and condemning settlement activities as a policy, approach, and practice. In a commentary published today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH addresses the savage practices the Israeli occupation authorities are perpetrating against the Palestinians of the occupied Arab territories, saying: Since the Hebron massacre, Israel has been enforcing a military siege against the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, isolating their residents from the outside world. It has clamped a curfew on some 2 million Palestinians, and given its troops a free hand to spread fear and terror throughout the occupied territories. These troops have perpetrated murders, repression, and terrorism that are no less heinous or hideous than the Hebron massacre. The paper adds: What has taken place, and is currently taking place in the occupied territories has failed to move the conscience of the international community. To date, no punitive measures or actions have been taken to make Israel halt its bloody repression. Nobody has asked Israel to lift the curfews, which have turned the lives of hundreds of thousands of people into an intolerable inferno due to the acute shortages of food and medical supplies. AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: The reactions to the Hebron massacre have been confined to useless condemnations and denunciations that cannot prompt the Tel Aviv rulers to halt the savage practices being perpetrated by their troops and settlers. Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: If it is really concerned about security and stability in the Middle East, and if it wants the peace process to achieve its objectives, the world community must urge the UNSC to adopt a firm and decisive resolution providing for the dismantlement of settlements in the occupied territories, and for protection of Palestinians. Such a resolution must make Israel do all that needs to be done to promote the cause of peace.
