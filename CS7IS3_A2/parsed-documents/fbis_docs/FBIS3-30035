In the Japan-U.S. economic consultations that broke down recently, the U.S. Government strongly demanded setting targets to expand imports of finished automobiles. The U.S. auto industry has called on Japan to expand its sale of U.S.-made automobiles to 100,000 units over the next three years (19,000 units sold last year). Certainly, it is difficult not only for foreign companies but also for domestic companies to break into the Japanese market. Commercial practices of a closed nature as well as excessive government controls must be remedied. Still, however hard other companies may try to pry open the markets of Japan through government-to-government treaties, unless they can interest the dealers, who sell the automobiles, and the consumers, who buy them, business can never materialize. Japanese dealers may be called keiretsu dealers, but they are different from the past, and they are not bound by contracts with manufacturers as to which manufacturers' vehicles to sell. Besides, lately, the business of selling domestic automobiles is not going well. If the dealers confined themselves as keiretsu dealers, their business would only suffer more. Individual dealers now need to establish independence for themselves, and to get rid of the old way of thinking which took controls by keiretsu-connected manufacturers for granted. On the other hand, U.S. manufacturers need to get more serious in the efforts to break into the markets. Specifically, they should put more efforts into selling to dealers directly. Some of the Big Three auto makers are selling their products through the sales outlets of Japanese auto manufacturers. This means they do not want to develop their own sales outlets and instead want to let their competitors sell their products. That attitude is too easy-going. Secondly, what needs to be done to get the dealers interested, naturally, is to offer commodities which are appropriate for, and can be sold in, the Japanese market, and also to present attractive business terms. The manufacturers need to offer right-hand drive automobiles, ensure high performance and good quality products, not overprice the products, and be able to provide good after-sales service. Americans consider cars as something like shoes, while Japanese value them as if they were part of their own houses. The U.S. manufacturers should recognize this different cultural view, and pursue efforts to develop markets with the business-version perception of "In Rome, do as the Romans do." Japanese consumers are prone to buy foreign-made products. The Japanese market is worth U.S. manufacturers going after seriously. Recently, the results of a joint survey by Japanese and U.S. consulting companies at the request of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the U.S. Department of Commerce were released. The survey analyzed the Japanese market with respect to dealer networks, distribution costs, prices of cars, purchasing practices, permits, and customer satisfaction. The survey presented an estimate that the U.S. Big Three's annual sales in Japan will grow to 57,000 units if all existing problems in Japan -- like closed keiretsu relations between manufacturers and dealers, and the U.S. manufacturers' inadequate efforts -- are resolved. Some of the premises for the estimate are questionable, but the survey does show there is plenty of room for both Japan and the United States, particularly in the private sectors, to make efforts for improvement.
