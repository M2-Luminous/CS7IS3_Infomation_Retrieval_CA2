"I am very satisfied with the Duma intention to follow the path of national reconciliation, civil peace and accord. I am convinced this intention is sincere. This is what I call for in my annual message that was passed over to you on February 24, 1994," says the document. Recognizing and respecting constitutional powers of the Duma, including those related to the amnesty issues, Boris Yeltsin noted that the formula used in the resolution is rather not an amnesty but a pardon, which is a prerogative of the president. He also thinks that the resolution did not fully develop the practical side of the issue, insufficiently considered and ensured political and social consequences of the decision. "In this connection and aiming to consolidate the spirit of constructive cooperation and accord, I suggest to: 1. Improve the resolution and bring it in full correspondence with the Constitution and the Russian legislation. 2. Develop and adopt as a memorandum a system of criteria, forms and mechanisms of responsibility of state institutions and politicians for decisions whose consequences hamper our joint policy towards national reconciliation, civil peace and accord. I would be grateful if you consider it possible to do this work together with presidential representatives," says the letter. Sources at the presidential press service told ITAR-TASS, State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin met presidential adviser Georgiy Satarov today to discuss the implementation of measures suggested by the Russian president in the letter to the Duma speaker.
