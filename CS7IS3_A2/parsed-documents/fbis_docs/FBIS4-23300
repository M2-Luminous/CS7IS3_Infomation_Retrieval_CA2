[Guirao] We spent very very harsh moments in detention. Our comrades who were detained at the police academy turned out to be "guinea-pigs" for the police trainees who flogged them all the time. Some of them were even admitted in hospital, thus prompting the trainees to stop torturing them. I was personally subjected to special treatment for allegedly writing a letter to General Ouassenan Kone about the genocide of the Guebies. I was tortured day and night so that I would no longer feel like being an activist of the Federation of University and High School Students of Cote d'Ivoire [FESCI]. We all fell so sick that the government was forced to buy up to 115,850 CFA francs worth of drugs to treat us. [Glazai] Yet, you said in a statement on television that you were well treated. [Guirao] Everyone knows that we performed a play in several acts, in which each of us had a carefully defined role. Minister Kone was the director and we were the forced actors. All this was to make us dismiss -- under Minister Kone's supervision -- the "allegations" made by LA VOIE about our detention conditions and to give an account that would be favorable to the government. We were also forced to apologize to our parents and to ask for the government's forgiveness. Minister Kone ordered me to read and sign the statement. He said he would reconsider the decision to release us if I dropped even one comma while reading the statement, so that is why I had my eyes riveted on the sheet of paper while reading. It was a true play in which I denied being a FESCI member whereas I remain the movement's second in command. I conclude by saying that we were not well treated, the proof being that we were drugged. The government must stop those old methods which consist in forcing people to make statements. [Glazai] Now that you are free, how do you feel? [Guirao] I feel scared and disgusted. I think of the democrats who are targeted through our movement. It is time for the forces of change to wake up; our country is in danger. What we could see and hear at the police academy proves our thinking right and disturbs us. For example, Minister Kone said he is ready to repress and crush all those who break law and order which, according to him, means all those who make demands, stage marches, and so on... He intends to do this fully in the name of peace. I would like to shout and say that my heart aches for Cote d'Ivoire. This is a country in which so-called legalists have come to power through the law but who persist in violating this same law. They violate the citizens' liberties with impunity. The people should not remain silent in the face of the regime's acts of aggression because democracy is actually at stake in our country. Ouassenan Kone has even stated that he is ready to stage a coup d'etat if the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire loses power through the ballot box in 1995. [passage omitted]
