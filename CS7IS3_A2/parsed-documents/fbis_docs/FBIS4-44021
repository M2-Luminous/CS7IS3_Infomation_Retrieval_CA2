In France itself, objections have been raised from within the government majority. The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], speaking of "aggression," on Tuesday stated that it would oppose French troops "by all possible means." On the same day, the Organization for African Unity (OAU) refused to support the French initiative, which is also opposed by a number of humanitarian organizations. In Rwanda, Africa, and Europe, the reactions to the French initiative are such that its very principle is now in doubt. Pierre Messmer declared angrily: "This operation is badly planned, ineffective, and dangerous." In the opinion of the former prime minister, an old hand in African affairs, "the chances of success are low and the risks are considerable." This opinion is shared by many in the French military, the partners initially sounded out by France -- who politely declined Paris's invitation -- and even the Africans. Events have taken such a turn that on Tuesday, 21 June, [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur announced that the initial aims would be revised downward, and he placed five conditions on French troops being sent to the Rwandan border. In particular, there was no question of going into "the heart of Rwanda," nor of intervening without the support of contingents from other countries. However, Paris still is still not making the agreement of the RPF a precondition. France is ready to intervene even though one of the two warring factions, the RPF, has assured that it will consider any French soldier to be its enemy. This is precisely the flaw in the operation. [Italian Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi pointed this out to Edouard Balladur in a telephone conversation on Tuesday, stating that his country was prepared to supply 400 men (250 for the special forces and 150 for logistics), but only on condition that the United Nations gave the operation its go-ahead (the same condition that applies for France) and that the agreement of the belligerents was obtained. Paris's initial idea was to supply some impetus to solving the crisis by triggering an international operation. Now the operation being planned is practically unilateral. For the time being, with the exception of Senegal, none of the hoped-for partners has made a firm commitment to send in troops. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino on Tuesday confirmed that intervention by "one or two white countries would be viewed as an act of recolonization." The Italians are ready to participate in an international humanitarian operation, but not in "the action that the French would want to take, alone or with us." He added that this would constitute "a major factor for conflict." Such reticence does not stop the French Foreign Ministry from believing that Italy or other countries will still participate. [passage omitted] The ministry does not believe that France is alone against the world, rushing into an operation that is destined to fail. [passage omitted]
