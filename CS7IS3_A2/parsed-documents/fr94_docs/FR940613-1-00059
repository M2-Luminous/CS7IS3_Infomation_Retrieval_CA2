FR940613-1-00059 FR940613-1-00006 (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof, or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this proposed rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' because it raises policy issues. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, agencies must evaluate the effects of a regulation on small entities. If the rule is likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' then a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis must be performed. Because this proposed rule may actually result in cost savings for small entities that hold security interests in USTs or UST systems, EPA certifies that today's proposed rule would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. C. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule does not contain any new information collection requirements under the provision of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 USC 3501 et seq. To the extent that this proposed rule discusses any information collection requirements imposed under existing underground storage tank regulations, those requirements have been approved by the OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act and have been assigned control number 2050&hyph;0068 (ICR no. 1360).
