Cristiani said: "We believe the judge should find Major Ismael Lopez, or whomever he represented, guilty." Lopez, who was transferred to the headquarters of the U.S. Southern Command in Panama, is accused of shooting to death his bodyguard, Jose Crescencio Diaz, when they were returning from a party in Cabanas Department. The body of Diaz was found in a U.S. Embassy vehicle on the outskirts of Soyapango, a densely populated city east of San Salvador. Lopez is to be tried by a U.S. military court, U.S. embassy spokesmen said in San Salvador. Cristiani indicated he asked the United States to let the Salvadoran Office of the Prosecutor General participate in the Lopez trial. "We want a representative of the Office of the Prosecutor General to be present during the trial of Maj. Lopez, but we have not received an affirmative or negative response," he stated. The Office of the Prosecutor General indicated Maj. Lopez killed bodyguard Diaz since the shot was fired from the back seat of the vehicle in which they were riding, according to the only eyewitness. Special prosecutor Ricardo Larreynaga made that statement after hearing the eight-hour testimony given by the only two witnesses at the Sensuntepeque lower court. The witnesses are Israel Vasquez, Maj. Lopez' driver who was in the vehicle the day of the murder, and Miguel Tomas Nerio, who received the embassy vehicle with the body in it. The special prosecutor explained Vasquez did not see when the shot was fired but that it must have been fired from the back seat and not from outside because it was an armored vehicle. This testimony made it clear how the incident took place and who did the firing, Larreynaga indicated. Although the eyewitness did not identify the person who pulled the trigger, "it is truly valid now to say that the major was the one who did the shooting." The records show the Criminal Investigation Division of the National Civilian Police conducted a paraffin test on Vasquez and Lopez hours after the incident, but the results of both tests were negative.
