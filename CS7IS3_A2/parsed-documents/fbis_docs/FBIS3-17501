"Reactivating the atomic electric power station in Armenia is dangerous for Azerbaijan especially since a war is being waged between the two countries. There is no doubt that Armenia will use the nuclear materials for military purposes which violates international norms. It is also dangerous for ecology", says the document. The statement further reads that in this context, the Azeri government calls upon the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to consider the power plant's reactivation; ecological, military and political consequences of this step should be thoroughly examined and Armenia must observe its obligations of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
