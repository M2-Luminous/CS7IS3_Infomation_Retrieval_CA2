Hosokawa, speaking to a House of Representatives Budget Committee session, said North Korea's agreement last week with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is not enough to diffuse suspicions about the country's nuclear weapons program. "The acceptance of (the IAEA's) inspections at only seven (declared nuclear facilities) cannot solve the problems," Hosokawa said. In coordinated steps with the United States, South Korea and China, Japan will continue to urge the north to abandon its threat last March to withdraw from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), the premier said. He said Pyongyang must allow IAEA scientists to inspect two undeclared nuclear plants at Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north of the capital. Some Western nations suspect the sites are being used to produce weapons-grade plutonium. Hosokawa also urged the north to join South Korea in declaring the Korean peninsula a nonnuclear zone. He said his government does not believe the north has already developed nuclear weapons but he voiced concern about the nuclear issue. "We have heard various reports." On the Japan-U.S. trade dispute, Hosokawa said both nations "should move ahead toward the direction of revising the trade imbalance" out of a fear that worsening relations would have an adverse effects on the global economy. Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton met earlier this month in Washington but failed to strike a deal on a new framework to slash Japan's trade surplus of more 50 billion dollars. The collapse of the talks stemmed from a disagreement over a U.S. demand to set numerical targets to measure the openness of Japanese markets. Japan rejected the demand which it said would lead to managed trade.
