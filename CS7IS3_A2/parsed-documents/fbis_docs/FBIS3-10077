The ANDINA board of directors issued a communique announcing that overdue accounts have kept the agency from having the necessary liquid funds to maintain operations. ANDINA was financed through the sale of advertising space to state enterprises. One of the agency's main debtors is SUNAT [National Superintendency of Tax Administration], which owes ANDINA more than 1 million new soles. ANDINA Information Manager Francisco Perleche said that until the liquidity problem is resolved, employees will continue doing internal work.
