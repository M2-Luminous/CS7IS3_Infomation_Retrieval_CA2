Vladimir Nicu, PCNM chairman, said that "PCNM is a political party of Romanians from territories east to Prut and of Christian Orthodox spirit of this suffering land." The party enters the electoral battle to liquidate in law and in fact the consequences of Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact with "the sacred goal to reintegrate the Romanian nation," said Nicu. Referring to the Congress of Moldovan Civic Alliance, PCNM representatives stated that the congress was held from Moldovan Government's initiative. They called it "an insult to the Romanian's dignity, tricolor, hymn and blazon." "These insults were made in the present of President Mircea Snegur, Speaker Petru Lucinschi and Premier Andrei Sangheli, and they applauded at them," said Nicu. He asked rhetorically "what sort of common house is Moldova if PCNM representatives were not allowed to take part in the congress?" PCNM representatives called the movement "Pro Moldova" a subdivision of "Moldovans' Alliance" in Dniester organized by KGB and Maracuta. PCNM declared itself a nationalist party, saying that "it would be better for Moldova to be a Romanian province than a Russian colony." "Our chances in elections are little, but we shall prepare ourselves for the next elections," said Nicu. He added that "if we obtain the majority of seats in future Parliament, the next day we leave for Bucharest where we shall decide the fate of Moldova, together with the Romanian Parliament."
