Kim Chong-pil, from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), told a meeting of senior party officials that a man who once served as an ambassador and now works in foreign relations gave him a small booklet last Saturday which had been sent to him. Kim later presented the booklet titled "21st Century and Leader". "The contents of the booklet praise Kim Il-song's chuche ideology and stress that Kim Chong-il will play a greater role as leader (of the North) after assuming power from the great leader (Kim Il- song)," the DLP chairman said. "In particular, the phrases and words in the booklet are not ones used by the northerners but expressions we use here. The style of printing also seems not to belong to the North." Accordingly, the booklet must have been printed here and then distributed, said Kim, advising the party to take action on the matter. Kim criticized the attitude of law enforcement authorities, saying, "I heard from the man who passed the booklet on to me that policemen ignored him when he brought the booklet to a police box. I'm concerned about the police if they take such an attitude."
