The foreign purchase of Norwegian fishing boats and their quotas was the topic for Morten Lund (Center Party). Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen pointed out that the EU agreement prevents such purchases for three years. It will also be possible to retain Norwegian rules that stipulate that only those actively engaged in fishing can own fishing boats. Finally, licensing regulations and considerations of resources and regional policy can be invoked. The minister gave advance notice of his own law covering the right to engage in fishing. Syver Berge (Center Party) wanted more information about the agricultural agreement. [Agriculture Minister] Gunhild Oyangen pointed out that some questions need to be clarified, including those to do with the food industry, environmental programs for primary agriculture, and investment arrangements. Clarification is also needed on the boundaries of the northern agricultural support area. She expects that there will be an agreement containing the necessary clarifications before the referendum. Differentiated employers' contributions need to be clarified, but there is every indication that we can keep our present arrangement, Municipal Affairs and Labor Minister Gunnar Berge told Eilef A. Meland (Socialist Left Party). The results of the talks with the EU on this matter will be available in a few weeks. Paul Chaffey (Socialist Left Party) sought guarantees from the EU in areas affecting asbestos, CFC gases, solvents, and mercury. Thorbjorn Berntsen responded that our rules on CFC's are not in conflict with the EU's rules. We can also keep our ban on the import and manufacture of asbestos. We can keep our regulations covering the labeling of solvents, but Norwegian regulations covering mercury in batteries can only remain in force for four years. But in this area there is an agreement committing the EU to revising its rules. In some areas Norway will have to tighten up its environmental regulations. This applies, for example, to the substance pentachlorophenol. Chaffey also wanted information about "EEA [European Economic Area] fish" that had been handed over to the EU in the negotiations. The minister informed him that the pattern of fisheries that would have been set up in 1997 has been brought forward to 1995 with slightly larger quantities than applied after the EEA agreement. Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa (Center Party) raised the question of duty-free alcohol allowances within the EU. Social Affairs Minister Hill-Marta Solberg was able to announce that the government has no plans for a comprehensive reorganization of Norwegian alcohol policy. Vinmonopolet [state alcohol monopoly] will continue as it is today, import allowances will be maintained with small additional quantities bought at full price, the advertising ban will continue, and the duties on alcohol will continue to be fixed by Norway. But border checks will be more difficult to carry out, she thought. Arvid Vegger (Center Party) wondered whether the EU agreement is binding in international law. The trade minister replied that before it is binding the parliaments of the various countries involved must have ratified it. However, first it must be scrutinized by the European Parliament and then signed.
