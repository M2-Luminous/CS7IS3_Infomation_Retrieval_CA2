[Paulo da Silva] You mean after the president flirted with a girl without panties? Without being falsely moral, I was ashamed. Regarding the government, we will continue to criticize what we have always criticized. The measures being prepared offer us no guarantees. Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso makes more mistakes than the ministers of the military regime. He knows that easy measures like increasing taxes are not enough. Such measure will appease the crisis only for a few days. [Pinheiro] Has the government taken too long to react? [Paulo da Silva] Look at the car industry agreement which obtained a collective commitment and which created jobs. Unfortunately the agreement was not repeated in other industries. The government has been very shortsighted because it could have made everyone committed to the development of the country. [Pinheiro] What does the labor movement expect from the creation of the URV [Real Value Unit]? [Paulo da Silva] To establish salaries based on a URV calculated from the previous month's average price increases represents a salary squeeze. In our case we would loose one month's salary increase which amounts to 40 percent. What can the URV do against inflation? Does this mean the government will create a currency that can be manipulated, that will not take into account price increases? Will salaries be controlled by this currency? The government cannot do this. This could worsen the already poor distribution of wealth in Brazil. It is condemning those in the slums to stay in the slums. Beside this, there is no mechanism forcing the businessmen to establish their prices in URV. [Pinheiro] What if salaries are related to the previous month's average price increases? [Paulo da Silva] We will hold an assembly next 25 February to discuss the salary campaign. If a salary squeeze is imposed on us, a general strike will have to be considered at a national level. [Pinheiro] A national general strike? [Paulo da Silva] We cannot allow society to again pay for the bankruptcy Brazil has been led to. I am speaking of the workers, the small businessmen, who pay more taxes than big businessmen, than everybody else. [Pinheiro] You will probably win the CUT [Sole Workers Center] elections in three months. Will your administration be marked by large mobilizations? [Paulo da Silva] The CUT cannot lose its great weapon which is its mobilization capability. Negotiation is worthwhile only if you are strong. Current conditions to defend the workers are concrete. The government better not fool around. Remove our accomplishments and see what happens. Perhaps because of its immaturity, the government is overlooking the labor movement's mobilization potential. [Pinheiro] The Union Force is also calling for a strike. Could labor unions unite in a national strike? [Paulo da Silva] The CUT will not negotiate with [Labor Force President] Luiz Antonio de Medeiros. There are different interests and total antagonism. There is a possibility of dialogue but with serious people of the Labor Force. Medeiros is losing credibility. [passage omitted] [Pinheiro] You will support Lula [Workers Party President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva] for president. Is the labor union structure part of this support? [Paulo da Silva] The labor union cannot remain isolated from national changes. It must not favor a party but it can be politicized. We will call the candidates we like and place our support at their disposal. The labor union will not lend money to any political party but we are free to politically support Lula, just as Medeiros is free to support Collor or Maluf.
