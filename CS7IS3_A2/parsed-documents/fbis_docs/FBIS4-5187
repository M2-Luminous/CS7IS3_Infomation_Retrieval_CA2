Cambodian government soldiers moved to seize the ancient landmark from the Khmer Rouge this week. More than 400 government soldiers supported by artillery and mortars, began to storm Khao Preah Vihear on Wednesday [6 April] to capture a Khmer Rouge stronghold on top of the ancient remains but they failed to gain control since the faction fought back with heavy gunfire. The Phnom Penh forces had to back down and lay siege at the foot of the mountain. Details of casualties are unavailable. Heavy shelling by government soldiers however, was believed to have caused some damage to Khao Preah Vihear itself. During the clash, four artillery shells reportedly strayed across the border and landed near a Thai rangers' base in Kantharalak district but no one was injured. The sound of gunfire was heard in Kantharalak district yesterday. A Thai soldier yesterday said Thai forces were on alert and had reinforced para-military troopers near Khao Preah Vihear. The Suranari Task Force had prepared to fire back if more shells from the fighting landed in Thailand.
