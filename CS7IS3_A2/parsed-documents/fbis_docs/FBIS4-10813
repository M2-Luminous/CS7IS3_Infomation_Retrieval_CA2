FBIS4-10813 "drlat075_c_94010" FBIS-LAT-94-075 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 MEXICO Official: Drug Interdiction `Noticeable' Official: Drug Interdiction `Noticeable' PA1604172794 Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 12 Apr 94 p 24 PA1604172794 Mexico City LA JORNADA Spanish BFN [Article by Evangelina Hernandez] [Text] Thanks to its interdiction policies, Mexico has prevented 50 tons of cocaine annually from entering the U.S. market over the last five years. This places Mexico third in world drug trafficking control. However, this "noticeable" level of interdiction prompted the proliferation of "drug pushers," especially along the northern border, who have triggered hard drug consumption where there was none before. Miguel Angel Gonzalez Felix, Human Rights and Drug Trafficking coordinator of the Foreign Relations Secretariat, pointed out that we are running the risk that drug trafficking money, which will eventually be "laundered," could enter the Mexican financial system thanks to the opening of trade. As for the U.S. State Department's International Drug Trafficking Control Report disclosed last week, the official said that the Mexican fight against drug trafficking is currently taking place without any pressure from the United States. He added: "It is a more balanced struggle" due to President William Clinton's efforts to fight local consumption, not foreign production." [quotation marks as published] As he emphasized that our country's fight against drugs is due to internal reasons, Gonzalez criticized the report, which indicated that 50 percent of the drugs coming into the United States enter through our territory. He stressed that at the beginning of the current six-year presidential term, the detection and interception of cocaine failed to reach 10 tons; during the last few years, however, drug seizures amounted to about 50 tons annually. The report should state the opposite: "Thanks to the efforts of Mexico, the amount of cocaine that enters the United States has been curtailed by one fifth. Should we look at it from this viewpoint, it would be exactly the opposite." [sentence as published] We increased drug seizures from 10 to 50 tons. Should we take into account that drug interdiction amounts to 100 tons at the U.S. border, 60 tons in Colombia, and 50 tons in Mexico, and that Spain, among the European nations, intercepts the most cocaine, 10 tons, then the detection level will indeed be "very noticeable." Gonzalez admitted that one of the big problems with the interdiction policies is the proliferation of "drug pushers." Although there is no widespread and serious drug consumption at the border, it is a problem that worries authorities nonetheless, because it is a situation "we never thought we would have to deal with." The diplomat [title as published] added that another problem that Mexico could face in view of the free trade is money laundering, which could emerge at the same time as the market opens. This is an issue that the Finance Secretariat and the Attorney General's Office have already began to work on. The interdiction systems were more vulnerable to drug trafficking money before the opening, but these mechanisms are currently being strengthened to ensure that "ill-conceived money" operations could be foreseen, detected, and controlled. Gonzalez said that this is a vanguard issue on the American continent; Europe and Asia do not have to deal with this problem despite their open markets. He insisted Mexico is at the vanguard. The so-called U.S. report on our country on the drug issue is secondary for the official. What is really important is the Clinton administration's shift to concentrating more on local consumption aspects, not on the cooperation systems of other nations. It is not that we want to praise his job, but we could say that the most praiseworthy part of it is the change Clinton made with regard to local drug consumption. "They are channeling more resources to their consumption problem; they are also realizing that although the strategies that they implemented in the past indeed diminish drug inflows to the country, said strategies generated a number of unexpected conflicts." This does not mean that the United States will drop international cooperation programs altogether. The official maintained that cooperation systems with Latin America and Mexico still prevail, but they are now very respectful of the nations' sovereignty. The United States is tackling these problems, as Mexico has done for many years, from an integral viewpoint that will combat not only production and trafficking, but also consumption. Does this mean the United States is exerting less pressure on us? The situation changed when President Clinton came to power. It is very respectful of sovereignty, and this makes us have fewer conflicts and more expeditious cooperation.
