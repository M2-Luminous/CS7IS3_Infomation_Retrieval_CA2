FBIS4-12092 "drnes065_m_94001" FBIS-NES-94-065 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 JORDAN Washington Meeting on Ship Inspections To Be Held Washington Meeting on Ship Inspections To Be Held JN0504075494 Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic 5 Apr 94 pp 1, 25 JN0504075494 Amman AL-RA'Y Arabic BFN [By Caroline Faraj in Amman] [Text] An expanded meeting will be held tomorrow Wednesday [6 April] comprising representatives of U.S. Government departments and bodies concerned with foreign affairs to discuss available options concerning the U.S. Navy's inspection of ships bound for the Port of al-'Aqabah. Well-informed sources have said that a number of concerned U.S. departments and institutions are trying to obstruct the holding of this meeting. However, the U.S. State Department intends to make a final decision during Wednesday's meeting. A political observer believes that the U.S. State Department's inclination toward making a decision should lead to a positive one in Jordan's favor. This expected decision will be the result of the clear and frank stand expressed by His Majesty King Husayn during his meeting with ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council last week. The previous meeting scheduled for last Thursday was postponed for reasons the U.S. State Department spokesman said were connected with fixing an appropriate date and time among the bodies concerned with foreign affairs. It is worth noting that three months ago Jordan proposed the appointment of a third technical and neutral party such as Lloyd's Register to inspect ships at the Port of al-'Aqabah rather than by the U.S. Navy in the Straits of Tiran as the situation is now.
