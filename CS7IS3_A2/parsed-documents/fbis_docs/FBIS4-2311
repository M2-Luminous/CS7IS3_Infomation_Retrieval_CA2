The event took place while the satellite was tested in the technical zone, which damaged the satellite and the workshops on the testing site. The satellite was originally planned to be launched by the "Long- March 3" carrier rocket in the Xichang Satellite Launching Center recently. China is making great efforts to complete the follow-up work and ensure the full implementation of this year's launching plan.
