Welcome to "Up to Date's" interview segment. As we announced on our newscast this morning, we have with us today Dr. Ruben Zamora, presidential candidate for the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front], CD [Democratic Convergence], MNR [National Revolutionary Movement] coalition. Welcome, Doctor. [Zamora] Good morning, Mauricio, and good morning to everyone watching and listening to us this morning. [Funes] This is the first interview I have given following Sunday's elections, and it is the first comprehensive interview with one of the two candidates who will definitely compete in a runoff election, judging by the results which, although they have not been declared final by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE], show a trend that will be difficult to change because they reflect over 75 percent of the votes counted nationwide. As of last night, the TSE's figures gave 49.20 percent of the vote to ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance]; 25.73 percent to the coalition; and 15.95 percent to the Christian Democratic Party. In your opinion, Doctor, what do these results mean? [Zamora] The first implication, Mauricio, is that the strategy we established a year and a half ago when we initiated this process is working. We said at the outset that a coalition of progressive democratic forces had to be formed that would allow us to move ahead and win first or second place, then move on to a runoff election. We have accomplished those things and we will now implement the second part of our strategy, which is to broaden this coalition of forces so we will win the presidency in the runoff. [passage omitted] [Funes] It came to our attention yesterday that the Chamber of Commerce president said it is unfortunate that El Salvador must hold another election for just a few points. If ARENA had won a simple majority of the vote, it would unquestionably have won the elections in the first round. Do you agree with that party's view that it is an unnecessary effort and expense to hold a runoff election? [Zamora] I do not think so. Perhaps the Chamber of Commerce president did not use the right words about a runoff election. I believe just the opposite is true. Elections are a democratic exercise by the people. They are an opportunity for the Salvadoran people. We should welcome every opportunity the people have to express their will and choose a government. That is the essence of democracy. The very thought that elections are somehow unfortunate could be very dangerous and end democracy in the country. I would say that we must hold the runoff elections with the attitude that they are an opportunity to broaden our political knowledge and the information given to the people and to truly try to involve more Salvadorans in the decision. You must remember that 49 percent is percentage data, but half of the population has not voted. In other words, 49 percent in terms of the voting population is less than one-fourth of the Salvadoran electorate, and it might not be a good idea to believe that an election should be decided by less than one-fourth of the people who should be making the decision. It is to our advantage to have another opportunity to correct all the serious deficiencies of the first election so we can broaden the spectrum and allow more Salvadorans to decide their future. [Funes] The distribution of support demonstrated in the presidential elections was practically predicted by the public opinion polls. All polls indicated that ARENA was the top force, followed by the leftist coalition and the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] in third place, approximately six months ago. They did not, however, predict the percentages and the way they would change. For example, the UCA's [Central American University] Public Opinion Institute gave the coalition a certain percentage that was way below the ARENA figure. Do you think the 49.20 percent is a solid ARENA vote? [Zamora] It is not a solid ARENA vote because I think the polls were showing something different. I think a lot can be attributed to the occasional vote, due in part to the fear instilled in voters by a campaign carried out toward the end. In fact, it was a campaign held on a day when campaigning was no longer allowed. Certain media, like EL DIARIO DE HOY, continued a harsh campaign against us. I believe it was outside the boundaries permitted by law or that it bent the law over backwards. All of this had some impact, and that is one of the things that we want changed in the runoff elections. In other words, we do not want the kind of campaign where a party officially shows one face but then pays a front organization to do the dirty work, the derogatory campaigning against another party. I think all these elements had some influence, but I also insist that there was a large number of new voters who we feel supported us but who could not find their names on the list, their numbers did not match, their names were misspelled, that another person had already voted there, or people whose names simply did not appear on the lists. [Funes] Dr. Zamora, no one can deny that the left has won a political victory by the fact that there was no clear winner in the first round of elections, thus forcing ARENA to go to a second round. What will be the practical impact, from the standpoint of political pragmatism, of going to a second round when, if you add up the percentages, regardless of the efforts made by the leftist coalition, the percentages received by the PDC and other political parties would still not come close to the 49.20 percent received by ARENA in the first round. [Zamora] We must keep something in mind: The results of one election will not necessarily be the results of the next election. We are witnessing that throughout Latin America. Second, our strategy is not only to add other parties -- we will obviously try to do that -- but to guarantee that the large number of voters who were unable to vote in the first round will be able to do so in the second round. The runoff election will be an opportunity to see that our electoral system is not so exclusive. It will become an open electoral system that will allow people to vote instead of a system to prevent people from voting. Our hopes and efforts lie in the affluence of new voters as they are the ones who will create a new scene next month. [passage omitted] [Funes] I want to analyze some of the irregularities observed yesterday. I heard Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] Chief Augusto Ramirez Ocampo say that, generally speaking, the elections were acceptable. Despite the fact that there were some irregularities, when the elections are considered acceptable, when missions from different countries and international organizations finally reach the opinion that the elections were acceptable, any irregularity they may have detected simply becomes a logistical problem, some of which are considered normal and others simply the product of an organization that is still new. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal was created in the wake of the peace agreements. I would like to discuss the possible impact of the irregularities that prompted the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front to hold a news conference on the same day of the elections but which at the same time led Onusal to state that the elections were generally acceptable. [Zamora] I believe that is where part of the problem lies. If the option is between acceptable elections and fraudulent elections, obviously the elections were not fraudulent. No one has characterized them as such. We would not term an election fraudulent in which we have become the country's second political force with people participating for the first time in the country's history. This must be given due consideration. The problem is not whether the elections were fraudulent or acceptable. The problem is, as the United Nations pointed out -- and I think it is the correct term and share it -- that the elections were held in adequate conditions of liberty, competition, and security despite the serious organizational and purity deficiencies noted beforehand. In other words, what these organizations had the first time around were serious deficiencies; not simple, but serious. Such deficiencies can be corrected. That is the important thing, Mauricio. I think we must face the problem with a positive attitude. These are things that can be corrected, so let us correct them for the good of the Salvadoran people. We have a great opportunity to do it now; so let us do it. I think everything is directed at that goal. We must recognize one thing: There were no complaints of general fraud in the '91 elections. There were complaints of local fraud. Now the problem is centered on the serious deficiencies of our electoral process. Such deficiencies can be corrected. In essence, the deficiencies impeded people from participating. Let us look, for instance, at the 200,000 people who could have legally participated. Our count here in El Salvador shows that 10 percent of the people did not participate because they did not appear on the register because of problems such as a lack of a voter registration card and so forth. Okay, 200,000 people can totally change the percentages. In fact, they could have changed the percentages in the primary and could still change them in the runoff elections. It could have been the case. I think, however, their participation would have reduced ARENA's percentage and increased ours. That is my observation. Right now we cannot say, but we can say that those problems must be corrected quickly. [passage omitted] [Funes] One objection that persisted and which surfaced publicly during the campaign by the Liberty and Democracy Institute [ILYD] was the FMLN's past. Do you think that if this is not handled properly, no matter how civilly the FMLN conducts itself these days, if it is continuously brought up, it will make a large sector of the population afraid? [Zamora] Yes. In fact, that is something we must look at in the runoff election. I do not think it is right for ARENA to promote this type of propaganda, through the ILYD, which is paid by ARENA. It has its station announcers, and we know that the ILYD and ARENA make their advertisements at the same place. They are sort of name borrowers. We have seen them campaigning wearing an ILYD sweatshirt, and when they get into the truck, they are wearing an ARENA sweatshirt underneath. In that sense, they are ARENA supporters. I do not think it is right for them to do that. If ARENA wants to campaign that way, they should do it and we will respond appropriately. If ARENA wants us to debate the impact of the war, what it meant, what each person did for the war to take place, we can discuss it in the runoff elections. We have told Dr. Calderon Sol time and again that we are interested in a lofty debate, an in-depth debate on the country's problems. One of these problems is our past, which we must discuss face to face with the people. The ARENA gentlemen, however, totally reject a debate. They do not want to show their faces. They hide behind an institute that continued to do what they were doing despite a warning from the TSE to stop. We do want the TSE to adopt a clearer and more energetic attitude against the low, dirty, and illegal campaigning by this so-called institute before the runoff elections. [Funes] Aside from the legality or illegality of this type of campaigning, I am talking about what is being said. Organizations that support the FMLN or organizations that could be on the left always drag out reports on the past war or resurrect the death squad activities. The death squad topic was somehow in the political debate when the secret documents were declassified. The position, then, should be that either both forces should forget about discussing the past and stop delving into it, or if one drags out reports on death squad activities, then the other drags out the report on the war, or vice versa. [Zamora] That is exactly what we have tried to avoid. It would not have cost us anything to get copies or facsimiles or whatever of the documents released by the State Department, the Pentagon, and the CIA, but we wanted to avoid that. We did not think it conducive to focus on for our people. It would have turned the past into a battlefield instead of a field of experience. Mauricio, we want to move on. We must look back, but we should do it without slinging mud at one another. We must take a serious look at the past. That is what we want. I am personally opposed to engaging in that type of propaganda which is so common in our country. One is either a terrorist or a death squad member. That sort of thing does not educate our people. It causes us to regress. I am convinced that, rather than winning or losing an election, the important thing is to move forward. Democracy in our country can only be cemented on firm foundations. I do not think it is a firm foundation to insult one another. On the contrary, that would be the worst basis upon which to try to develop democracy. I insist that we must ask ourselves whether what we are doing for the country is good or bad. Another way is to have an in-depth discussion of the war in a serious manner, with arguments. I am ready to engage in such a discussion at any moment with Dr. Armando Calderon Sol so we can clear things up. [Funes] I think fears about a lack of guarantees are fundamental. No matter how much one appeals for an electoral process in which the voters vote for certain projects, one often wonders whether the candidate he chooses is in a position to resolve the country's problems? I think that in this case it is asking for more than voters are able to give, considering traditions and past elections when people were afraid so they asked for guarantees. I understand there are fundamental sectors of the country, such as the private sector, that ask for guarantees. The armed institution asks for guarantees. The social sectors and the labor sectors also have certain fears, and certain candidates ask for guarantees. This is something that might be relevant in the runoff election. In that sense, there is the case of the Armed Forces. I spoke with the defense minister the other day and asked him what the victory of one party or another could mean for the Armed Forces, but basically what a leftist party would mean. He insisted that there is some fear in view of the past. It is a reasonable fear because the parties are asked to consider the armed institution as something permanent, as a key organization in the country's development. How would you face such fears in light of what the Armed Forces' role might be? [Zamora] I think that the only way to handle fear, personally, socially, or collectively, is face to face. In other words, we have to recognize that the Armed Forces and its officers are concerned about the triumph of a coalition that is formed in part by a component that the Armed Forces faced militarily for several years. I think we must confront our fears by making things clear. My view of what the next five years should entail for the Armed Forces is to complete what has been called the demilitarization process. The first two years have been what we might call the negative part of the process: purging, downsizing, separating policemen and Armed Forces members, redistributing the constitutional role assigned to the Armed Forces, and so on. Now comes what I would call the positive part. In my opinion, it must be based on two fundamental pillars, the first being recognition that the Armed Forces is a legitimate institution in this country. Its existence and function are provided for in the Constitution. It is the government's job, in this case the president's job, to make sure that the people accept the institution's legitimacy. That is the fundamental pillar upon which relations will be rebuilt. Equally fundamental is recognition that the armed institution's policy must be subordinate to the decisions of the power elected by the people, in this case the civilian power. The armed institution must be totally isolated from party politics. Based on those two premises, we must rebuild the relationship between civilians and military personnel to make it a modern relationship in which civilian-military relations will no longer be a problem. It should be a nonissue like relations between lawyers and nonlawyers. No one worries about that situation. We must reach that point when society accepts a military career as a valid profession with a valid role in society. [Funes] Have the two parties that faced each other and led the war matured? For instance, I have heard officers say they are afraid that a majority in the Legislative Assembly could vote for a constitutional amendment to eliminate the armed institution. Such a proposal was on the agenda some years ago. [Zamora] Regardless of whether the parties have matured, I look at it this way. We are on the path to building maturity. I do not think we not achieved it yet. If we had, the problem would have been resolved. We are in the process of resolving it. It will be a difficult process, but I think we are clear about what we are aiming for and what must be resolved. As for eliminating the Armed Forces by a constitutional amendment, I think that is totally senseless. A constitutional amendment in this period has to be made by consensus. It is not a question of majority. It would be the most serious mistake if a majority, because it is a majority, were to introduce a constitutional amendment that is opposed by another important part of the country. Why? Because it would destroy what we have achieved in this country, which was to change the Constitution by consensus among everyone. This heightens the awareness of the need for consensus in our society. We must not abandon this. There can be constitutional amendments here so long as they are approved by consensus. Even if we had a majority to pass it, if a sector of society or a part of the Legislative Assembly opposes it, I think we have to forget about the majority because that is the new style of government that we propose. [passage omitted] [Funes] I want to close with this question. Yesterday a CNN reporter asked you -- the interview was broadcast yesterday -- if there was any difficulty going from the right to the left. That is a topic I have tried to explore in the past few days prior to the elections in terms of governability. Will the coalition you represent be able to create the conditions for governability? [Zamora] That is precisely the point. If we talk about of moving from right to left, we are going it about it the wrong way because the country is not moving from right to left. There is a fundamental historical fact: The right and the left sat down and signed peace agreements. This puts the center of the dispute in our country not between right and left but between those who want to progress toward the new things that will emerge from the peace agreements and those who would like to return to the past. I think that is where the problem of the primary elections lies. The electoral struggle dealt with the path from the left to the right. I disagree with that approach because it leads to a false polarization in the country. If there is going to be a polarization in the country, it must be a polarization in the new terms. The interest is not in whether there is going to be a government of the right or of the left because there will not be a leftist government in El Salvador. It will be a government of the past or the future. ARENA represents a government of the past that says: I am in command and you will obey. We represent a government of the future born from the spirit of the agreements. We are all going to work together and seek a national consensus to take the country forward without exclusions. This, for me, is the real and central point that we must explain clearly during the runoff elections, because I think it will help clarify the country's real situation. [Funes] We thank you for your visit this morning, Dr. Zamora.
