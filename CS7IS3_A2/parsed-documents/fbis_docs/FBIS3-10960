Political work -- in its noblest form -- seeks to create the opportunities and conditions to achieve the basic human aspiration of true happiness. This higher objective of politics becomes more evident in countries like ours, where government actions many times play a decisive role in people's destiny. Yesterday, I became the president of all Chileans [applause], and I now announce the way in which I will conduct the national community in this march toward solidarity, justice, and freedom. My position stems from Chilean history, and I will seek to answer the following question: On what foundations should we base the new meaning of our mission? It is essential to listen to our heroes, to our poets, and to our saints. General Bernardo O'Higgins is behind me; Minister Diego Portales is in front of me; Captain Arturo Prat is further away, near the sea. They are the nation's liberators, the builders of the Republic, and the heros of the Republic. They remind us of our tradition of honor, dignity, sacrifice, and the impersonal nature of power. Can you here the noise of the boys and girls of Elqui [a region in Chile], preaching to the kingdom of children around the earth? Do you know that in every language and in every city of the world a poet is singing verses of love for the women and men of all races and cultures? Can you see Father Eduardo Hurtado [whose canonization has been requested] crossing Mapocho River bridges, gathering the children who choose hope and the city as their home? We have many heroes, poets, and saints in whom we can find the inspiration to give dignity to our lives and to the lives of all our fellow countrymen. There are many, and they belong to us all. Chile has recovered its tradition. We are the children of a single historical adventure, the heirs of a single, powerful will to be. A stage ended yesterday: Under President Aylwin's patriotic leadership we achieved national reconciliation. [applause] Now we can look each other in the eye and shake hands with peace in our spirits. In all collective tasks, the director should indicate his style of work. With even more reason, a president must explain the exercise of power to his assistants, to the citizens who support him, to those who oppose him, and even to those who are indifferent. First, I will exercise authority, that is, legitimate democratic power. I will respect the principle of authority, the majesty of the law, and the impersonal nature of power, and I will have them respected. I make an appeal for order to avoid confusion. I will speak little, yet I will act firmly. [applause] I must be very clear concerning authority. I will exercise the powers of president in the presidential system of government under the rules of which I was elected. Reforms in the political system, if there are any, will take place in the future. It is necessary, however, to end the illusion of reducing authority. In nearly all countries of the world the public is demanding an increase in authority, in light of the large number of corporate interests, the rule of parties, and the de facto powers of individuals and groups. As always, Chile requires authority above individual perspectives and the interests of groups. I will be the president of all Chileans and the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, as a symbol of national unity. [applause] Second, under a democratic system, the opposition has the double task of achieving consensus and exercising criticism. I call upon the leaders of the opposition parties to fully meet their responsibilities. Our country requires both their cooperation, in drawing up the state's policies, and their supervision in order to correct mistakes and failings. I call upon them to persevere in the quest for civilized dialogue, in which mutual respect, civic friendship, and joint patriotism prevail. My heart is free of resentment and rancor, it is open to all spiritual and political families of our nation. New time brings new demands. Broad transformations in our country and in the world have made democracy and development face a superior phase of evolution. New times compel us to rethink our style of government. That is why this evening, rather than outlining the specific objective of our program -- which has been widely publicized and made known to all Chileans during the electoral campaign -- I wish to concentrate on the style of work that I will demand of myself and of all my assistants within the government. I want my government to be particularly alert to the needs and concerns of the people. The people's needs should be our needs. The heart and the eyes of this government should focus on the routine life of Chilean people. [applause] Let us not allow government work isolate us in our offices. Let us not assume that things must be handled in the way a small group of people say. Let us go meet people, listen to them. Let us not be afraid of criticism. Let us check offices, schools, enterprises, hospitals, and administrative methods. Let us invite people and the broader sector to participate. Let us cast off any traces of sectarianism, bureaucracy, or statism. Let us join efforts to solve the real problems of each Chilean. I will be the first to do this, and I call upon my assistants to adopt the same style. I will be a president in-the-field, on a permanent campaign, not to gain votes, but to be up to date with the concerns of my country and to make government action dynamic. [applause] Another attitude that must be adopted all over the nation -- in the central, regional, and municipal governments -- is that of devotion to work. This means to do things well, with diligence, and with special care for detail. All sluggishness should be eliminated, from the most important to the most insignificant. No streets with garbage, no place without ornaments, no dead trees. In the fight against uncivilized apathy, the government must be the example. I want those in charge to know every detail of the services for which they are responsible, to identify their weak points, and to adopt measures to correct deficiencies. I do not want study and analysis to become an excuse for indefinite postponement of decisions. I do not want perpetual delays to projects that are vital for entire cities. [applause] You have many times seen teams working and achieving fine results for people, and others -- with the same resources -- simply dragging their feet and accumulating problems. I want this difference to stop. The entire administration should become a working mechanism that systematically improves the quality of its operation and its decisions. I want relations between citizens and the administration to be based on maximum respect for people, especially if they are old, poor, weak, or sick. [applause] Routine administration service is the minimum that a democracy should offer its citizens, whose dignity stems from the mere fact of being fellow countrymen. A well-completed job considers details, respects citizens, and -- above all -- efficiently serves them. Our work must be transparent, without nebulous or dark corners. Let us work with our faces toward the country, and with frankness. Let us tackle problems instead of burying them. Let us maintain our style of never promising what we are unable to fulfill. This will be our best guarantee for the people. [applause] I want an honest fulfillment of public functions. Our society fully disapproves of public officials who profit by or misuse resources that belong to all Chileans. [applause] We need to convert this consensus into a will for action. I expect officials to be accurately aware of what is happening in their respective services, departments, and units, because it is part of their responsibilities. As president I will strictly counter any action that perverts the true sense of public service. In this field I do not want any indulgence, no matter how difficult it will be to face bitter realities. It is better to act firmly today than to be swamped tomorrow by a nationwide practice of corruption. I want to clearly say that I will not yield to any type of pressure in order to stop these nefarious practices. I will be a president with a firm hand against corruption. [applause] In this task, the practice of the impersonal nature of power will be very useful. In everyday practice, Chileans must be equal before the law, in big and small issues, in paying taxes, and in paying traffic fines. If power is not impersonal, we will be building the foundation of corruption, a scourge that once unleashed ravages all possibilities of properly running a state. The style of this new administration stems from the spiritual meaning of our action. The objective of the fight against poverty, which faces the danger of becoming rhetorical, must be clearly outlined. This is an all-encompassing fight. It calls for advanced science and technology. Yet above all it calls for sound ethics. The poor who demand immediate action are the poorest among the poor. They are spread in the countryside and in the outskirts of our cities. They have been punished, generation after generation. Their dignity must be returned to them, and the price of this work is constant, systematic sacrifice. It is not enough to allocate subsidies to eliminate poverty. Routine practice, procedures, priorities, and policies must be modified. I call upon all Chileans -- especially women and the youth -- to devote their best energies to free the poor from their slavery, thus making their own life more noble by fulfilling a noble mission. [applause] Chileans: I am aware that this style of government is demanding. Yet you, who were elected to accompany me in this task, were chosen to work for the good of people. You were elected to break barriers and problems, and to tirelessly work. To govern is a nice task in which our energies are used for serving our fellow countrymen, and this is our main reward. I think I have clearly outlined the style that I want for my government, and -- within this framework and in this long effort -- my team will always have my confidence, support, and encouragement. Let me now say a few words about our relations with the international community. From time immemorial, we Chileans have lived with the mentality of island dwellers. Now the world is one, and we must trade products and services with all nations. Likewise, our culture is exposed to all the influences of the international centers of power. Our nation can no longer seek refuge between the mountains and the sea. We have unavoidable requirements and international obligations. The globalization of the economy requires from us an effective performance in all our world's markets, under all skies, within all cultures, in all languages. The entire world was very generous with Chile at a time when Chile was in pain and division. We must return what we have received, with increased solidarity. [applause] Our main duties involve the Latin American community, our neighborhood in the international community. My administration will dedicate its best efforts to enhancing ties with countries in our region. The key to success lies in transforming the diversity of the Latin American peoples into unified goals, in order to bolster our economies, improve our sovereignties, and have a say in the community of nations. We call ourselves brothers, and we will prove it with friendship and mutual cooperation. Fellow countrymen: Being president is not an easy task. I am aware that as president I will face disappointments, that many times I will feel the heavy burden of major decisions, and also the distress of being unable to do anything else. To overcome the loneliness of power, I want to recall the faces of thousands of Chileans who have accompanied me in countless days. I want to recall the peasants who have expressed their hope to me, the youth who have talked to me about their dreams, the humble housewife who opened the doors of her house to me. I want to recall the workers who in factories and mines told me: You can always count on our support. This will be the great force that will accompany me during these years, the force to which I will always return for strength. This nation, these people have given me multitudinous, systematic support. I opened that door [he points at La Moneda Palace] with overwhelming electoral support. I have received all types of expressions of support, backing, and confidence. I heard my name being said on streets and squares. I have reached a very high position. But from this high position I can hear my father's voice, 30 years ago, repeating an old proverb: You placed me in a very high position, but you have abandoned me. This evening, with deep humbleness, I ask you: Do not abandon me, always accompany me, at the service of the nation. Thank you very much. Long live Chile! [applause]
