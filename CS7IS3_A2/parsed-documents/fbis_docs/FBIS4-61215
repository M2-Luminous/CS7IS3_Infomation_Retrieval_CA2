Svanidze is speaking to Viktor Vasilyevich Ilyushin, President Yeltsin's adviser, on the work of the Presidential Council -- the president's personal think tank. Ilyushin says experts for the Presidential Council are normally recruited on an ad hoc basis, usually to give expert advice on a specific problem. They are drawn from a wide range of specialists who are well-known in their field of expertise and are politically loyal to the president. [Ilyushin] "It is assumed that even when the experts invited to discuss a certain issue have opposite points of view on a given subject, they are not in opposition to the president himself. For example, you remember there was a well-known expert on Yevgeniy Kiselev's `Itogi' program -- Yuriy Baturin. There was also Georgiy Satarov. Both of them are now the president's aides." Ilyushin says the Presidential Council does not meet on a regular basis. "At the beginning, the question of regular meetings was raised by members of the Presidential Council. We tried to do this, but after a while, arrived at the conclusion that this is an outmoded way to work. We should meet only when the president needs our advice. One knows Boris Nikolayevich [Yeltsin]: If he has already decided something, it will be difficult to make him change his mind, although not always impossible." Asked why it is so difficult for Russian journalists to get an exclusive interview with Yeltsin, whereas several were recently given to foreign media, Ilyushin says perhaps this has something to do with the president's personal preferences. Yeltsin does often answers journalists' questions nevertheless, and the recent interviews with foreign agencies were connected with the publication of Yeltsin's latest book. Svanidze rounds up the program by saying that due to the nature of his work, Viktor Ilyushin is a man who knows a lot and says very little and this is why he has been working with and has enjoyed the confidence of the president for such a long time.
