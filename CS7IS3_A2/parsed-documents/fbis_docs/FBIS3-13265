In Hebron, a Jew has massacred dozens of Palestinian Arabs praying in the mosque, in Beirut, Lebanese Christians have been butchered during a church service, and in New York, a Lebanese has opened fire on orthodox Jewish students, two of whom are at death's door. Meanwhile, a sequence of further deaths in the occupied territories, which are once again in revolt, is adding, drop by drop, to the trail of blood. Agreements, negotiations, and expectations have gone by the board, reason and history have retreated in the face of raging fanatism. Does peace remain an impossible dream? Advisor Raphael Gamzou, spokesman for the Israeli Government, and Nimr Hammad, the Palestinian representative in Italy, answered this question from, respectively, Jerusalem and Rome. [Gamzou] In the long term, I am optimistic. All the parties concerned know full well that there are no alternatives. Negotiation remains the only way open. Breaking off means rewarding the extremists. [Hammad] The massacres have opened people's eyes to reality. The front is everybody's now. The future of the peace is in the hands of the Israeli government. Six months have gone by since that 13 September when the Washington agreements were signed, and nothing has changed. All we have seen is delays in their application. If the Hebron massacre induces Prime Minister Rabin to be intransigent with the settlers and persuades him to withdraw them from the settlements, there will be greater grounds for optimism. But if Rabin thinks that the PLO has no choice but to negotiate at all costs, he is making a mistake and giving greater grounds for pessimism. [Zambonini] Is it feasible to disarm the settlers completely, as the PLO has demanded as the first condition for resuming the negotiations? [Gamzou] Total disarmament is impossible and unacceptable for us, even after the Hebron massacre, which has filled us with grief and shame. Every day brings acts of terrorism on the part of the Islamic extremist of the Hamas movement, and the settlers must be in a position to defend themselves. But the government has already begun disarming the hard core of fanatical Jews and it has ordered their expulsion from the territories and the administrative arrest of the leaders of the extremist movements, such as the Kakh. [Hammad] The measures adopted by Rabin are a cosmetic operation that does nothing to treat the real sickness that the settlements represent. What does disarming only the extremists mean? All the settlers are extremists, because their movement has a precise ideology: that of Eretz Yisrael [name as published], the Land of Israel that they consider theirs by divine right. Rabin must understand that this ambiguity is playing into the hands of the extremist fanatics. It is true that Rabin has freed 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. But why did he wait so long? Shall we need another massacre before he takes another step forward? [Zambonini] PLO Chairman 'Arafat has called for an armed international force to be sent in to protect the Palestinians. The government of Israel has said no. Was it right or wrong to do so? [Hammad] It was very wrong. We called for an armed international force because the Israeli army gives us no guarantee of protection. Quite the contrary. Israeli soldiers have killed more than 20 Palestinian demonstrators over the last week. Even before the Madrid talks that opened the way for the peace negotiations two years ago, the European Community had proposed an international presence in the cities, the villages, and the Palestinian refugee camps, accompanied by the withdrawal of the Israeli troops from the occupied territories. The proposal was accepted neither by Israel nor by the United States. These rigid stances are tombstones for peace. [Gamzou] The Israeli Government was right to say no. The best way ahead is direct negotiation between ourselves and the PLO, without foreign interference. We had already reached an understanding on the first part of the Oslo Agreement, on autonomy for the Gaza and Jericho areas. But then the psychopath from Hebron ruined everything. Now we have an explosion of Palestinian rage, which is quite understandable. We are putting our money on American mediation and the multilateral negotiations that have the task of building the new Middle East. Article 3(d) of the supplementary protocol to the Oslo Agreement provides for a temporary international presence in the Gaza and Jericho areas to supervise the implementation of the agreements. This article may help us find a compromise between the PLO's requirements and our own. I would not rule out an agreement on a certain nonmilitary international presence, but it must remain within the context of the negotiations between the PLO and ourselves. [Zambonini] Have the tragic events of the last few days weakened 'Arafat's position? [Gamzou] Definitely, just as they have weakened all those who support him in his decision in favor of dialogue. But our government, too, is having difficulty with public opinion, because the Palestinian terrorist attacks have continued even after the recognition of the PLO and since the start of the negotiations. There has been a succession of victims. Nevertheless, we have said that we shall carry on with the negotiations as if there were no terrorism, and we shall continue fighting terrorism as if there were no negotiations. [Hammad] The whole of the PLO has been weakened. After the signing in Washington, the opinion polls showed 68 percent of Palestinians in favor of the agreements. Today I am not sure we would reach 50 percent. We have regressed to a worse position than before. The lay portion of the Palestinian movement, which was pursuing the political solution of "two peoples, two states," has failed to get results, and the hope of peace has thus become more remote. [Zambonini] What is the alternative? [Gamzou] There is no alternative to the negotiations. We have learnt in the last few days what great damage a minute fraction of extremists can do to the peace process. In the Knesset last week, all the parties, from the Right to the Left, voted the same motion condemning all forms of extremism is the strongest terms. Such great unanimity had never been seen before in our parliament. This is a sign that, regardless of political divisions, the overwhelming majority of Israeli society is united in the quest for peace. [Hammad] The alternative is a tragic one. The Middle East is entering a new phase in which anyone can grow a fundamentalist's beard and launch a new war. Rabin does not have the strength to dismantle the settlements, claiming that it would provoke a civil war. In this way, he stands firm on his principles and wants to force the PLO to accept them, while the settlers can destroy what we are laboriously building up to create a climate of mutual confidence. We are stuck in a blind alley, while the extremists have the upper hand.
