Credit investment (debt owed under credit issued by all banks and credit institutions) grew six times over the year and amounted to 30.5 trillion rubles as of 1st January 1994 and by the end of the first quarter this sum amounted to 39.8. Experts of the Ministry of Economics believe the growth of credit investments is outstripping the growth in the volume of products which have been dispatched and the volume of work which has been carried out. This bears witness to the fact that credit resources are going not to the expansion of production, adding to enterprises' circulating capital, but to the circulation of goods and money. The ceiling of credit resources was set at 11.48 trillion rubles in the first quarter, and at 13.6 in the second quarter. The lion's share of it is going to cover the budget deficit. According to data of the Ministry of Economics, in the first quarter, debts owed by enterprises amounted to 69 trillion rubles, including 25.8 in defaulted payments. Debts owed to enterprises amounted to 67.9 trillion, including 27.3 in defaulted payments. Mutual non-payments by enterprises and organizations are characterized by the following figures: debts of purchasers -- 56.9 trillion rubles, including 31.3 in defaulted payments; debts to suppliers -- 44.6, including 20.4 trillion rubles in defaulted payments.
