Meanwhile Fernando Egana, deputy minister of the secretariat of the presidency, said "the government hopes the local community's many sectors and especially the business sector will exercise common sense and a sense of responsibility and support the measure implemented by the government, which is aimed at inspiring greater security and confidence in the country's economic recovery." The deputy minister added that the decision to suspend economic guarantees is not "one of ideology but of practicality, given the serious economic and financial circumstances the country is experiencing. It is the Executive Branch's duty to deal with the situation and to take safe and prompt action." The business sector's negative reaction contrasts with the reaction of the consumers because, according to the government spokesman, "the measure has been very well received by the Venezuelan people in general, who hope the government will act responsibly and look after the people's interests, especially those involving the VAT [Value Added Tax], which is an unfair and regressive tax." This opinion was supported by a poll conducted by the official news agency VENPRES. Egana likewise denied that foreign investors may be affected by the new measures, going on the assumption that to provide security in this area, in the midst of the difficult situation the country is experiencing, "the government must have extraordinary powers." Regarding the duration of the suspension of economic guarantees, Egana warned that it will be restored "as soon as possible" after economic recovery is achieved. Meanwhile, President [Caldera] stressed during his speech on the 20th anniversary of the National Experimental University of Tachira, that the government will send to Congress a tax reform bill whereby the VAT will be replaced with a tax on luxury items, income taxes will be increased, and taxes will be imposed on "certain wholesale transactions." Regarding the financial system's precarious condition, President Caldera has warned that "at present, through the Finance Ministry and other presidency offices, we are maintaining a very fluid relationship with the commissions that are working on the subject so that the situation created by the Banco Latino crisis and the threats on the financial system may be resolved harmoniously with the cooperation of various branches of government."
