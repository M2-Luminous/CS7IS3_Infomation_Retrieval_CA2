The step was taken as the ministry prepares to introduce an open bidding system for large-scale projects in the current fiscal year that started April 1, the officials said. They said safety records and measures to promote the welfare of workers will be added to the existing 17-point screening process to calculate the quality of bidding firms. At present, the value of works completed in the past was given heavy weight in evaluating contractors. Under the new method, small-scale firms with high technological standards and management foundations will receive high marks, the officials said. As for foreign bidders, the number of engineers they employ and the length of their service in their home countries will be taken into account, they said. The qualifications of general contractors are reviewed every other year in order to select reliable contractors. The new evaluation method will be introduced in the next fiscal year that begins April 1, 1995, the officials said.
