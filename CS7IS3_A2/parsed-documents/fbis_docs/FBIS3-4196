According to Ms. Peng, China is seeing over 20 million births annually with a net growth in the country's population of about 14 million, causing the absolute number of births in the country to still remain very large and putting a heavy burden on the country. Ms. Peng said that since there was a big gap between the state family planning policy and the desire for having children by farmers, the policy on family planning in the country was being carried out mainly through powerful executive measures and if there was any relaxation in this sector, the birth rate would soon deteriorate further. The country has seen a serious problem in imbalance in the control of population growth in the country with children-bearing women in the 7 provinces and autonomous regions of Jiangxi, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Tibet, Ningxia and Xinjiang to be in their peak birth state between 1997 and 2000. The country is, according to Ms. Peng, aso facing arduous tasks in the raising of the quality of population. The country now has 51.64 million disabled people, accounting for 2.4 percent of its total population, the disabled at the age of 0 to 14 years make up 3.66 percent of the total of the same age group, 65.96 percent of whom are suffering from a mental problem. The rate of physical defects in newly-born babies is 1.3 percent of the total births in the country with Shanxi having a rate of 2 percent, ranking the province first in the country. There are 400 million people living in areas with an iodine-shortage problem, making up 40 percent o the total population facing the same problem in the world. Illiterate and semi-illiterate people in the country are now put at over 180 million with females accounting for 70 percent, posing a problem for the control of population growth and the raising of quality of people. In addition, there are many problems in the population structure with boy births far exceeding those of girls. Owing to the drop in births and increasing life-span, China will enter peak aging society in the next century.
