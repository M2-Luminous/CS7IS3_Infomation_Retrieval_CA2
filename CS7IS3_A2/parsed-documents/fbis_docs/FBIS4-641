Now, hard on the heels of this week's big shakeup in the high echelons, including the removal of the Army chief, the new head of the Army, Colonel Kelly Conteh, is promising a new look into Army policy. From Freetown Victor Sylver telexed this report. In an interview this afternoon, the new Army head, Colonel Kelly Conteh, just back from a command course in Nigeria, emphasized the need for all Sierra Leoneans to be involved in eradicating the rebel menace throughout the country. He said that the relations between civilians and soldiers should be cordial and that he would not treat lightly incidents of soldiers acting as members of an occupation force. Colonel Conteh was of the view that soldiers are servants of the people and that they have to protect civilians in whatever situation. Although he couldn't tell me what new strategy he intends to adopt in bringing the war to a speedy end, Col. Conteh hinted that the main cause of the reverses in the war could well be due to leadership and stressed that the enforcement of discipline will receive top priority from now on. He agreed with me that the Sierra Leonean Army, like all others, has its crop of bad eggs and appealed to the civilian population to show understanding and patience. Col. Conteh also made a direct appeal to those who had taken up arms against their brothers to realize that it is their blood that is being shed and urged them to lay down their arms and make use of the amnesty being granted to all those who surrender.
