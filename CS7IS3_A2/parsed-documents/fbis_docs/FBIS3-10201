Hector Luna Troccoli, secretary general of the presidency, told the media that the request made by Attorney General Telesforo Guerra was "on a personal basis, and as any other citizen, he has the right to give his opinion." Luna explained that this extreme measure -- which is part of the Public Order Law -- can only be issued personally by the president, Ramiro de Leon, or with the consensus of the cabinet when the situation merits it. According to the official, that is not the situation in Guatemala at this time. Luna Troccoli admitted that these "comments have been made in informal talks," but he reiterated that De Leon "has not given any consideration to declaring a state of emergency because the circumstances do not really call for it." The Attorney General's Office charged there is a plan to destabilize the government of Ramiro de Leon in which politicians, judges, and union leaders are reportedly involved, but he abstained from giving their names. Nonetheless, the political parties and the union leaders have demanded that Guerra present evidence of the alleged plot, which the attorney general linked to a strike movement of the public workers who are demanding salary increases.
