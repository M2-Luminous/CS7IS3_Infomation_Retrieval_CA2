FR940505-2-00108 FR940505-2-00079 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;317 and 50&hyph;318] Baltimore Gas and Electric Company; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;53 and DPR&hyph;69 issued to Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (the licensee, BG&E) for operation of the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, located in Calvert County, Maryland. Environmental Assessment Identification of Proposed Action By letter dated November 4, 1993, BG&E requested Technical Specifications (TSs) amendments which would allow the removal of an orifice in the 4-inch containment vent/purge line resulting in greater flow. The Unit 1 containment and the Unit 2 containment each have a separate but identical system. Penetration room exhaust fans in the auxiliary building draw air through an in-containment moisture separator and an in-containment motor-operated value (MOV). The air is passed through the auxiliary building via the vent lines which have an outside containment MOV, flow reducing orifice, a flow monitoring system, a motor-operated butterfly valve, and a set of two high efficiency particular air and two charcoal filters in parallel (the penetration room ventilation system filter bank). The air is then discharged by the fans through the main plant vent. Vented air is replaced through a separate penetration. The use of this system as a containment vent was approved by TS Amendment Nos. 115 and 98 for Unit Nos. 1 and 2, respectively, dated February 20, 1986. The maximum hypothetical accident doses in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR), Chapter 14.42, were revised to include venting of the containment at the initiation of an accident. The NRC staff's Safety Evaluation (SE) which supported TS Amendment Nos. 115 and 98 also approved the higher calculated offsite dose than was currently described in the USFAR at that time. Subsequently, BG&E identified calculational errors in the offsite dose, which when corrected, indicate an offsite dose higher than that approved in the NRC staff's SE. An orifice plate with a 1-inch opening was installed in each of the vent lines in order to maintain the approved offsite dose levels. Reanalysis have been performed to support the removal of the orifice plates which indicate that the offsite dose would be increased. Although the consequences of the maximum hypothetical accident would result in an increase in the fission product release, the total dose is well within the limits of 10 CFR part 100, ``Factors to be considered when evaluating sites.'' Need for the Proposed Action Restoration of full-flow capability to the 4-inch vent/purge lines by removing the orifice plates will significantly reduce the time required to vent or purge. It now takes 7 times longer to vent a containment than it did with a 4-inch line (28 hours versus 4 hours). In addition, venting now occurs over three operating shifts instead of being completely contained within one shift. Venting is a manually controlled operation, in that it requires operator attention (the operator opens and closes the valves from the control room). Stretching the venting over three shifts introduces the possibility of additional human error into the venting process. Another consideration is that the probability of an accident occurring during venting decreases with decreased vent time. Reducing the venting time will not increase the number of times BG&E needs to vent, because the starting and ending conditions for venting remain the same. Therefore, the total amount of time the containment vents would be open will be decreased. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The environmental impact of allowing increased flow results from consideration of the maximum hypothetical accident (large break loss-of-coolant accident) occurring when a vent is open. Fission products would be released until the in-containment and outside containment isolation valves receive a safety injection actuation signal (SIAS) or a containment radiation signal (CRS) which would close the valves isolating the vent line. BG&E's reanalysis of the hypothetical loss-of-coolant (LOCA) indicate a dose of 118 rem to the thyroid and 10.6 rem to the whole body at the exclusion area boundary (EAB) and 39.3 rem to the thyroid and 2.7 rem to the whole body at the low-population zone (LPZ) boundary. The previously approved doses in the UFSAR, Chapter 14, are a dose of 124 rem to the thyroid and 3.0 rem to the whole body at the EAB and 33 rem to the thyroid and 0.8 rem to the whole body at the LPZ.
