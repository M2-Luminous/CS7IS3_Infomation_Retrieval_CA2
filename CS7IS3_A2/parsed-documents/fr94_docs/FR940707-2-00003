ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The proposed information collection requirements described below have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for expedited clearance under 5 CFR 1320.18. The Agency is soliciting public comments on the subject submission. This action is necessary in order for the Agency to promulgate a new regulation to administer the Rural Technology Development Grants (RTDG) program as required by legislation.

It is essential that ample time be given for applicants to complete the application process. Failure to implement this program and award FY 1994 grants will result in a negative impact in the rural areas. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit comments regarding this submission. Comments should refer to the proposal by name and should be sent to: Lisa Grove, USDA Desk Officer, Office of Management and Budget, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503.
