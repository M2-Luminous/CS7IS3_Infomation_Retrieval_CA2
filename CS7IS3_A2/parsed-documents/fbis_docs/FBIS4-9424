However, the support of the deputies of the SDS [Serbian Democratic Party] of Krajina to the program and the government of the new prime minister, Borislav Mikelic, as thought, will affect party relations in the Krajina assembly and Babic's future position with regard to both his political rating in Krajina and the party that he leads. As stated by Vojislav Seselj, leader of the Serbian Radicals, by supporting a government that does not include members of the SRS [Serbian Radical Party], the second strongest party, Babic has "unilaterally broken the coalition alliance." The Radicals voted against Mikelic's program. Tomislav Nikolic, vice president of the SRS, says that the "Radicals will remain in the opposition." Regarding the possibility of the Radicals' entering the government (the departments whose officials have not been elected yet) and reaching an agreement with Krajina's new prime minister, Nikolic said that no agreement has been reached with Mikelic, and that Mikelic's recent statements on an agreement with the Radicals do not correspond to the truth. "The situation in Krajina is becoming increasingly better for the SRS and we will be ready for elections, when they are called," Nikolic said. What remains to be seen is how the multiparty bloc, which will play the role of the ruling authorities in the Krajina assembly, is going to function. The SDS of Krajina has the largest number of deputies, but without the Radicals, it can no longer count on the certain "endorsement" of its policies. The "marriage" of convenience between the two parties that until yesterday were fierce opponents, the "marriage" in which the SDS of Krajina won the greatest number of ministries, does not guarantee harmonious relations in the ranks of the ruling authorities. If Babic's entry into the government, as thought, represents an attempt to resist the pressure on the Krajina's SDS deputies (and the Radicals) aimed at forcing the political "transfer" of his deputies and breaking the coalition bloc with the Radicals, then Babic should explain the reasons for his decision, whose consequence is indeed the collapse of the coalition with the Radicals. The intention to preserve "peace in the house" with a compromise, at the time when the final stage in the denouement of the status of the Republic of Serbian Krajina is getting closer and closer, cannot be ruled out as having been in Babic's mind, but the fact that Babic has assumed a new post and is staying in power remains on the surface. Will this adversely affect his political rating? It has been unofficially learned that Babic's decision did not enjoy the unreserved support of all the deputies, and that it surprised members of the SDS of Krajina in Banija, who were against Mikelic's nomination for prime minister. According to some Krajina sources, an uncompromising faction among the deputies of the SDS of Krajina is led by Lazar Macura, who stated at the meeting of the party deputy caucus that he would not support Babic's decision. In any case, Babic cannot count on the support of the party membership that he enjoyed in the past, nor the support of the Radicals, considering the way in which he "paid for" his return to politics; here, the main creator is Krajina's President Milan Martic, who now has his men not only at the helm of the government, but also in the important ministries of defense and internal affairs.
