FR941019-1-00026 FR941019-1-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;207&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11, &hyph;2A12, and &hyph;2B16 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking; reopening of comment period. SUMMARY: This document revises an earlier supplemental proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11, &hyph;2A12, and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes, that would have required a functional check of the idle stop function of the engine throttle quadrant; repair or replacement, if necessary; and eventual replacement of the engine throttle quadrant. That proposal was prompted by reports of unintentional engine shutdown on certain of these airplanes due to problems associated with operation of the engine throttle quadrant. This action further revises the proposed rule by adding a second type of test of the engine throttle quadrant to determine if the throttle levers bypass the idle stop into the shut-off position. The actions specified by this proposed AD are intended to ensure the proper operation of the throttle quadrant so as to prevent inadvertent shutdown of an engine while the airplane is taxiing or in flight. DATES: Comments must be received by November 23, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;207&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;207&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to add an airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;1A11, &hyph;2A12, and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes, was published as a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register on June 28, 1994 (59 FR 33233). That supplemental NPRM would have required a functional check of the idle stop function of the throttle quadrant; repair or replacement of the throttle quadrant if the check failed; and the eventual replacement of the throttle quadrant with a new model. In addition, that supplemental NPRM expanded the applicability of the initially-issued NPRM to include additional airplanes that were found to be subject to the addressed unsafe condition. That supplemental NPRM was prompted by reports of unintentional engine shutdown that occurred on Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2A12 and &hyph;2B16 series airplanes when a throttle lever over-rode the idle stop during throttle retardation, due to a quick, sharp pull on the throttle levers, and the throttle lever consequently moved directly to the shut-off position. The proposed functional check (hereafter called ``the abrupt-movement check'') was intended to ensure that such unintentional shutdowns of engines would not occur while the airplane is taxiing or in flight. The abrupt-movement check procedures are described in Canadair Challenger Service Bulletins A600&hyph;0629 and A601&hyph;0410, both dated November 1, 1993.
