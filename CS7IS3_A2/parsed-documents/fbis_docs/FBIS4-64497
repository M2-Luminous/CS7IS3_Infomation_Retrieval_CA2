The statement was made by Roberto Maroni from the Northern League a few hours before a scheduled meeting of the Freedom Alliance. The League considers the Interior Ministry as its "bottom line." "We do not have to show why we want this particular ministry, our demand is a legitimate one. It is up to the others to explain to us why our demand is not legitimate," Maroni said. "If the others cannot give us an adequate explanation, then I do not think there is much point in talking, because it means they do not trust us in government. If this is the case, I do not see why we should be part of the government."
