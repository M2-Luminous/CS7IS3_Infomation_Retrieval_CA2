The resolution compels assembly plants to sell to authorized exchange brokers the dollars needed for financing costs and operational expenses. The Finance Ministry forwarded this proposal to Congress on Wednesday. The proposal suggests amending Article 1 of the Law on the Entry of U.S. Dollars From Exports because in the past few weeks there has been a tendency toward a rapid depreciation of the national currency caused mainly by speculation. The congressional session was attended by BCH President Hugo Noe Pino, who briefed the deputies on the purpose of the measure and the BCH's reasons for it. U.S. dollars have been exchanged on the black market in several industrial zones, thus contributing to speculation's harmful effects. Pino said the aggregate value of the assembly plants fluctuates between $70 million and $100 million. When corporations need lempiras, they have been exchanging some of this amount on the black market rather than through registered brokers. It was reported that the changes are aimed at eliminating legal obstacles so that if necessary the BCH can auction U.S. dollars for as long as deemed advisable to try and stabilize the lempira, a mechanism that has been used in other countries with satisfactory results. Article 1 used to forbid the BCH to auction U.S. dollars. But the amendment permits use of this instrument of monetary policy. The amended article states: Foreign exchange from exports is a national economic property. Persons or legal entities that export goods must report to the BCH in advance every export, the amount, value, and destination of the goods to be exported, the probable date of the export, and the type of currency in which payment will be received. "Export of goods originating in free zones, industrial zones of processing for export, retail exports, and those made by assembly plants according to the regulation of this law shall be excepted. Nevertheless, the foreign exchange transacted by persons or legal entities in free zones or industrial processing zones, including operators and assembly plants, to defray costs or expenses in local currency, will have to comply with BCH instructions." At the outset, Carlos Kattan, National Party deputy for Cortes Department, who almost never attends congressional sessions, opposed a proposal to exchange foreign currency through brokers, who would then report to the BCH. Arguing for his position, Kattan said this procedure scares away investors because it could be regarded as state interventionism. The motion was ultimately withdrawn. Congress President Carlos Flores Facusse said that this measure will help stabilize local currency.
