The US is still in the process of fully coming to terms with its status as the unchallenged global power. There is, however, one area where there are not only no signs of departure from the old cold war approach, but positive evidence of efforts to perpetuate and even enhance the traditional anti-Indian thrust of American policy in South Asia. This was clearly hinted by the Raphels and Mallots of the State Department last year that they were meant to prepare the way for a clear-cut anti-Indian edge to US policy now seems obvious from the Clinton administration's stubborn reluctance to heed the decision of Congress to persist with the Pressler Amendment. Since then Senator Pressler has found it necessary to reiterate, more vehemently than before, his charge that the administration plans to resume military sales to Pakistan banned by the 1985 amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act. Pressler's assertion that Pentagon is trying to achieve the aim of effectively removing the amendment through the back-door, namely, by making a "one-time exception" has now been confirmed by Robin Raphel in her deposition before the Ackerman sub-committee. The "exception" aims to clear the long-standing proposal to sell 71 F-16 fighter aircraft to Pakistan. Pressler has warned that the withdrawal of the only piece of non-proliferation legislation will have disastrous consequences. Before the Soviet Union crumbled in a heap, the rationale behind US mollycoddling of successive Pakistani military dictators was a blind hatred of the "evil empire" that played footsie with socialists in New Delhi. It would have been logical if in today's unipolar context, Washington no longer found it worth its while to accord preferential status to Pakistan. After all, in purely economic terms the lure of an untapped Indian market is worth more than the price of courting one Benazir Bhutto. However, precisely the opposite is happening. It is to be hoped that no security wiseacre will emerge in New Delhi to underplay the proposed sabotage of the Pressler Amendment as nothing but a ploy to prevent Lockheed, the manufacturers of F- 16, from going under. It is some reassurance that Narasimha Rao bluntly told Senator Pressler last month that the removal of the Amendment would force India to review its defence policy. The Prime Minister was, however, being characteristically mild. The antics of the Clinton administration call for an entire revision of Indian foreign policy to take into account the threat from a democratic, but no less "evil empire". Diplomacy is one facet of the counter-offensive, but New Delhi may also find it prudent to retaliate in other ways, namely by curbing its slavish endorsement of US economic hegemonism. There are risks, but India must be prepared to take them.
