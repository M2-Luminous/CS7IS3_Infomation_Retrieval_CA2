Eighteen months were set aside for reactivating one of the two 400 MW power units. However, soon it became clear that it was impossible to master this task single-handed, and that the station was not likely to resume production by the following spring. The signing of a Russian-Armenian agreement has brought new hope. According to this document, all restoration work including recommissioning will now be carried out jointly. The Russian side will be responsible for all engineering and technical operations necessary to start up the station again, as well as for the delivery of nuclear fuel and all help required in training specialists. The Armenian side will be in charge of the safety and physical protection of the nuclear power station. Furthermore, Armenia guarantees that it will not make use of nuclear and other special materials needed at the nuclear power plant for the production of nuclear weapons or the achievement of any other military aims.
