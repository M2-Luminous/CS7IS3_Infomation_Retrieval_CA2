FBIS4-52062 "dreas088_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 North Korea Remarks by Japanese Justice Minister Condemned Remarks by Japanese Justice Minister Condemned SK0605045594 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0450 GMT 6 May 94 SK0605045594 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Unpardonable Jargon of Japanese Justice Minister" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The new justice minister of the Japanese Government, Shigeto Nagano, when interviewed by MAINICHI SHIMBUN on May 3, openly let out an ugly torrent of words defending the Japanese imperialists' war of aggression in the past. Contending that "it is wrong to say the Pacific war" started by the Japanese imperialists "was a war of aggression," he went to the extent where he claimed without hesitation that the war was "a war for the liberation of colonies" and "a just war which may be tolerated." And he driveled that a notorious massacre by the Japanese imperialists in Nanjing, China, was a hoax. Nagano's shameless remarks are nonsensical outbursts for bringing the spectre of Japanese militarism back to life. Peoples of many Asian countries including Korea shed blood and died tragic deaths and underwent immeasurable misfortunes and sufferings due to the war of aggression provoked by the Japanese imperialists. This is a hard fact recorded in history and still vivid in the memory of people as bitter grievances. The Japanese authorities must apologize and compensate for the war crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against Korean and Asian peoples in the past. It is a downright challenge never to be condoned to defend and justify the war of aggression by the Japanese imperialists, far from making apology and compensation. It is by no means accidental that Nagano's grave remarks came at a time when the Japanese reactionaries, in conspiracy with the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets, are driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war, while the anti-DPRK campaign to stifle it is getting more open over its fictitious "nuclear problem". In justifying the past war crimes of the Japanese imperialists the Japanese reactionaries are foolishly attempting to justify their moves to stage a comeback to Korea and Asia for the realization of the old dream of "the greater east Asia coprosperity sphere". We cannot overlook the open remarks of a high-placed official holding the post of justice minister intended to make a clean sheet of and even justify the cursed history of aggression of the Japanese imperialists. The Japanese authorities must show a responsible attitude and a position of apology for this.
