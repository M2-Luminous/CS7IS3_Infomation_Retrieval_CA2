FR940110-0-00019 FR940110-0-00006 Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63120), concerning the proposed suspension of certain words from the route disposition definition of Order 106. The public was afforded the opportunity to comment on the notice by submitting written data, views, and arguments by December 7, 1993. One comment letter was received. After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice and other available information, it is hereby found and determined that the following provision of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Southwest Plains marketing area will not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act for an indefinite period commencing with the publication of this document in the Federal Register : In ยง1106.3, the parenthetical phrase ``(except to a plant)''. Statement of Consideration This document will suspend certain words from the route disposition definition of the order. The effect of this change will be to include transfers of fluid milk products to other plants regulated under Order 106 in determining if the transferor plant meets the pool qualification requirements specified in ยง1106.7(a) of the order. According to Mid-America and AMPI, two cooperative associations representing a substantial number of producers whose milk is pooled under Order 106, a Tulsa, Oklahoma, handler receiving milk from non-member producers is also supplied supplemental milk from cooperative associations that pool milk on the Southwest Plains milk order. The proponents argued that as a result of excluding transfers of fluid milk products to other plants regulated under Order 106, the handler has been a partially regulated plant in recent months and could be again in the future. Mid-America and AMPI explained that, since the handler's Class I utilization is higher than the market's average, the handler has been able to pay its non-member producers a price in excess of the order's blend price. In addition to the inequity resulting from this price disparity, AMPI, during the month of September, was required to depool milk that it had diverted from the Tulsa plant because the plant otherwise would have failed to qualify as a pool plant during the month of September. This resulted in additional financial loss to the cooperative. A letter supporting the suspension was filed on behalf of the proponents. There were no comment letters received in opposition to the suspension. It is hereby found and determined that thirty days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest in that: (a) The suspension is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to assure orderly marketing conditions in the marketing area; (b) This suspension does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective date; and (c) Notice of proposed rulemaking was given to interested parties, and they were afforded opportunity to file written data, views, or arguments concerning this suspension. Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective upon publication in the Federal Register . List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1106 Milk marketing orders. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, title 7, part 1106 is amended as follows: PART 1106_MILK IN THE SOUTHWEST PLAINS MARKETING AREA 1.
