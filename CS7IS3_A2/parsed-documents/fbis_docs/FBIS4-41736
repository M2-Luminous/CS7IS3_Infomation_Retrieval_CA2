The government made the resolution on selling private land in March, and Homeland's Union refused to agree with it. According to the resolution, the boards of the districts were commissioned until August 1 to register permissions to buy 2-3 hectare lots for those who would submit requests until July 1. Monitor of Homeland's Union Andrius Kubilius told a news conference that this resolution violated the Constitution. "The resolution denies the rights to the property of the former landowners", Kubilius maintained. He also reminded that the state could not sell out 2-3 hectare lots because it was not the owner of the land. The state had not bought the land from the owners. The law to allot 2-3 hectare lots for a certain category of people was passed by the Lithuanian Supreme Council in 1990. However, leaders of the opposition claimed that most of the lots were alloted illegally.
