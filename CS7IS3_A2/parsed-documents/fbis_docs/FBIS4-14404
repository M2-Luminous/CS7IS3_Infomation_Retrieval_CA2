Review of U.S.-Russian Relations Is Going on Behind the Scenes"] [Text] Washington -- Monday 28 March will go down in history as the day when, for the first time, a special briefing was organized in the White House for the Russian press corps accredited to the U.S. capital. Admittedly, this event was organized not by the principal occupant of the White House but by one of his staff, but it was a major event nonetheless. The briefing was organized to deal with a topic that is of utmost importance to us: The state of U.S.-Russian relations. On the whole the essence of what was said boils down to what Secretary of State Christopher stated on television last Sunday: Russia remains one of the administration's foreign policy priorities and it will offer every possible assistance in order to strengthen the democratic market road of development. There is no reason to doubt that this is how things will be. Just as there is no doubt that relations between our countries are visibly becoming more strained or at any rate less unequivocal -- a touch of what I would describe as rivalry has clearly crept in. Former President George Bush, a Republican, is being reproached because he was the first to have adopted a "Russia first" course, and because he arrived in Kiev after Moscow and "lectured" the Ukrainian leadership on the desirability of friendly cooperation with Russia. At the time the press christened this episode "Chicken Kiev," thus alluding to the second meaning that the word "chicken" has for Americans: weakness of character. Eminent observers here believe that Clinton has not only inherited this "Chicken Kiev," he has recently started to "have another think about it." At the White House briefing the changes were expressed in the same mild wording that was used in Moscow: The "honeymoon" in U.S.-Russian relations is over. At the same time it was stressed that they certainly cannot be described as being in crisis. On this there is clear agreement with Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev, who described the present stage as "mature partnership" in an article published in the THE NEW YORK TIMES. But this is seemingly the only thing which the denizens of Washington's corridors of power agree with in Kozyrev's program article entitled "You Should Not Frighten Us." For example, Professor Perlmutter, the well-known political analyst and editor of the magazine STRATEGIC STUDIES, thought that "Minister Kozyrev has started to talk the language of the Cold War." He took extreme exception to the accusation that "new chauvinist banners are fluttering in the air in Washington" and that the United States is striving to achieve "world hegemony." Perlmutter says that he is "slightly irritated" by the minister's tendency to include areas of "the former Soviet empire" in his concept of "our national interests," that is to say Belorussia [Belarus], Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. And there is much else besides he does not like about A. Kozyrev's position. It would be a small misfortune if just one expert or journalist were to get up and openly voice the question: "What precisely is the difference between 'national interests' according to the democrat Kozyrev on the one hand and the so-called reactionaries and ultranationalists on the other?" Especially as the specific accusations always boil down to the "unexpected interference" by Russia in the Bosnian crisis, thanks to which NATO air power has not been used to launch strikes against the Serbs. But it is quite clear that in addition to this unexpected briefing for the Russian press, other briefings are also being organized in Washington -- at a much higher level and with franker remarks on the very same topic. President Clinton spent one and a half hours chatting with representatives of ethnic minorities of East European origin, and one of the people who is closest to him -- Deputy Secretary of State Talbott -- has met with ambassadors of East European and Baltic countries. Judging by information which somehow leaked out of these meetings, we must draw the unambiguous conclusion that a review of relations with Russia is going on behind the scenes. We are not talking about a return to the mores of nuclear and political confrontation. However, again and again we are hearing a term which dates from that unfortunate period, namely "containment." The State Department's guests were informed that up to now the United States has not paid enough attention to states bordering on Russia, but from now on all this will change because, according to informed U.S. colleagues, "the United States and the West cannot basically ignore the legitimate concerns of these countries which have been provoked by Russian expansionism." It is also claimed that President Clinton has privately intimated that if Russian expansionist behavior spills over the borders of East European states, the United States will immediately change its position with regard to admitting East European countries to NATO. This is reported, for example, by the consistently well-informed R. Evans and R. Novak in THE WASHINGTON POST. They also believe that the pressure of public opinion polls is "drawing Clinton away from a love affair with Russia." They are referring to the fact that ethnic minorities, who put together constitute millions of voters, did not forgive Bush for his "chicken Kiev," and naturally they will not forgive the current President if he continues the "love affair." It should also be remembered that before breaking for the Easter vacation, the Senate adopted a resolution warning that the United States would rebuff "by all appropriate means" any Russian attempt to exert pressure on East Europe or the Baltic states. The conclusion? It was summarized by Evans and Novak in yesterday's article: "Bill Clinton and Strobe Talbott are the last people in the world you would suspect of wanting to return to the Cold War. But they are unambiguously letting it be known that they no longer intend to overlook Russia's imperialist aspirations." Let us not get into an argument about how justified the term "imperialist" is. Let us simply take it as given that on this side of the Atlantic, Russian foreign policy is for one reason or another being presented in this manner. In print, with quotations from the highest authorities. It seems the U.S.-Russian "honeymoon" really is over. It is a pity, but, as they say, nothing lasts for ever and we must see things for what they really are.
