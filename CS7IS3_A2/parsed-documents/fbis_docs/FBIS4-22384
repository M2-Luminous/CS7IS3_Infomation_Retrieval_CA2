It emphasizes that "the Crimea is an autonomous constituent part of Ukraine and therefore is not a bearer of state sovereignty and cannot enter into political relations with foreign states." The Crimea does not have its own citizenship separate from that of Ukraine. It cannot have its own military formations and its own monetary system. The Supreme Council of Ukraine proposed that the Crimean leadership bring the legislation of the autonomous republic into conformity with the legislation of Ukraine. Galina Khmilevskaya, a special correspondent of the KRIMSKAYA SVITLITSYA newspaper, met with Vasyl Vasylyovych Onopenko, minister of justice of Ukraine, on the eve of an examination of the Crimean question in parliament. We present the interview with him. [Khmilevskaya] It is being suggested to Crimeans that supposedly independent Ukraine, in contrast to the Crimea, does not have its own constitution, and that it is therefore living according to the old constitution, specifically the Constitution of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. What is this--a propaganda trick? Counting on the people's lack of legal information? [Onopenko] I am amazed by such a statement. Ukraine has its own constitution--the constitution of an independent, democratic, and rule-of-law state. And this, in particular, is indicated in paragraph 1 of Article 68 of the Constitution of Ukraine and other articles. [Khmilevskaya] Consequently, owing to amendments that were made, we have a constitution that is new in content... [Onopenko] Yes, we are living according to the Constitution of Ukraine and not according to that of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, as was the case at one time. Dozens of amendments have been made, according to which the Basic Law has been brought into conformity with current requirements. It is true that there are some old laws that we are compelled to use, inasmuch as Ukraine has not prepared and has not turned out all of the necessary laws. This is so, but the Constitution of Ukraine operates and regulates the basic social processes in the state, in particular, Ukraine's administrative-territorial system as well... [Khmilevskaya] ...Also establishing the status of the Republic of Crimea? [Onopenko] In accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine (Article 75 superscript 1), "The Republic of Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine that must operate on the principles of administrative autonomy." The legal status of the Republic of Crimea is determined not only by this article of the Constitution, but also by other laws, in particular, by the Law of Ukraine of 29 April 1992 "On the Status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea," and the Law of 30 June 1992 "On Making Changes and Additions to the Law of Ukraine 'On the Status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea,'" and also the important Laws "On Demarcation of Powers between the Organs of State Authority of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea," etc. [Khmilevskaya] Thus, no matter what we call ourselves: the Republic of Crimea, or the island state of Crimea, we will still be a constituent part of Ukraine according to its Basic Law? [Onopenko] Based on the Constitution of Ukraine in effect, this is precisely the case. [Khmilevskaya] Then why is the "Crimean question" so critical? [Onopenko] The fact is that the Crimean parliament has adopted many laws that do not agree with the basic laws and the Constitution of Ukraine. [Khmilevskaya] Can you name them? [Onopenko] Listing them would take a long time. But some can be mentioned. For example, the Constitution of Ukraine affirms the position on associations of citizens and political parties. This is a constitutional provision. The Constitution of Crimea also has such a concept; moreover, a law has been passed "On Association of Citizens." If you analyze Article 9 concerning the association of citizens, it states that political parties with an all-Ukrainian status can be established on the territory of Ukraine. In the Crimean Law "On Association of Citizens" it is an issue of some other kind of status, specifically--an all-Crimean status... So here is your first contradiction. [Khmilevskaya] It is this exact contradiction that blocked the path to the Crimean parliament for branches of Ukrainian parties operating on Crimean territory and compelled them to unite into one (but now Crimean) party--the Ukrainian Civic Congress of Crimea [UGKK]. The pro-Ukrainian (ruling) forces were drawn into a registration trap, which made it practically impossible for members of the Ukrainian Civic Congress of Crimea to take part in the elections to the Crimean parliament on party lists. The party was registered a week before the end of the campaign to collect signatures. No opportunities remained. Here is a significant fact for you that indicates in whose favor the contradictions of the Crimean laws are arranged and operate. Obviously, not in favor of the state-creating forces in Ukraine. [Onopenko] It is a pity, but even the very concept of an international political party or an international public association are treated absolutely differently in the law of Ukraine and the law of Crimea. After all, an international political party is a party that has its own cells in some other country. We find another contradiction between the legislation of the Crimea and Ukraine in the law on property, and even in the terminology. In particular, Article 75 of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea recognizes private, collective, municipal, state, and other property on the territory of the republic. According to the Ukrainian law on property of 7 July 1992, private property and collective and state forms of property exist in Ukraine. That is, there is an incongruity even in this. The concept of a judicial system is very dear to me. Therefore, in accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine that is in force, and in accordance with the laws on the judicial system and the law on the status of judges, the Supreme Court and the oblast court are elected by the Supreme Council of Ukraine. If you look into the Constitution of Crimea you find one more contradiction that works to weaken Ukrainian statehood: The oblast (now) court of Crimea is elected by the Supreme Council of Crimea. This is a very fundamental divergence, inasmuch as we cannot talk about a single judicial system on the territory of Ukraine, which can lead to very negative consequences. [Khmilevskaya] Vasyl Vasylyovych, does it not seem to you that after 5 May 1992, when the Constitution of the Republic of Ukraine was adopted, and later its operation was suspended, nevertheless, all actions of the Crimean parliament were openly or in a veiled way directed at separating the Crimea from Ukraine and making it independent? [Onopenko] You are touching on a very serious problem. Actually, if you analyze some very important acts adopted by the Supreme Council of Crimea (in particular, the "Act on Proclamation of State Independence of the Republic of Crimea" was adopted on 5 May, and later the decree "On the Conduct of an all-Crimean Referendum" and certain other acts), they actually denoted that the process for the legitimate secession of the Crimea from the Ukrainian structure was being started. [Khmilevskaya] At that time, Kiev reacted... [Onopenko] Actually, the recent acts of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Crimea associated with the proclamation of state independence and the conduct of an all-Crimean referendum were declared to be contradictory to the Constitution and laws of Ukraine in a decree of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 13 May 1992. It was recommended to the Supreme Council of Crimea that it revoke the aforementioned acts. Unfortunately, it must be said today that the Supreme Council of Crimea in fact ignored the decision of the Ukrainian parliament and did not revoke its constitutional decisions. [Khmilevskaya] Who in this situation was supposed to stand guard over the Ukrainian Constitution? Who was supposed to be the supreme observer looking after implementation and observance of the law? [Onopenko] The best solution for Ukraine would be the establishment of a Constitutional Court whose jurisdiction would include the resolution of precisely such problems and questions. Unfortunately, there is no Constitutional Court in Ukraine yet. [Khmilevskaya] Who was slow with this? Why did the law on the Constitutional Court not pass? [Onopenko] You see, it was the Supreme Council that was involved in the discussion of the composition of the Constitutional Court. Incidentally, the proposed standard for the establishment of this court has already been included in the current constitution. Therefore, we have a legal basis for the creation of a Constitutional Court of Ukraine. [Khmilevskaya] But tell me, who under these conditions is supposed to give an evaluation of the decisions of the Supreme Council of Crimea? [Onopenko] The Supreme Council of Ukraine was supposed to do this (and it actually did do so). Although a mechanism did not exist for implementing the decree of the Ukrainian parliament about bringing Crimean laws into conformity with Ukrainian laws. Therefore, the decree of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 13 May 1992 actually remained unfulfilled. [Khmilevskaya] Of course, this situation could not help but be exploited by those forces that are in power today... It is no secret that five out of six candidates for president ran under the slogans "Crimea in Russia!" and "The Ruble Zone, the Motherland, Russia!" Although purely economic problems here were of no small importance; after all, a crisis has enveloped Ukraine, and the impoverishment of the people is growing. Nevertheless, separatist aspirations played a definite role. [Onopenko] The situation in Ukraine is really not simple. There are extremely complicated questions of an economic, social, and political nature. We can only ascertain that the people decided precisely in the way that they did decide. Therefore, when it is a question of the will of the people and the actions of one or another leader, one or another person, then I would like to differentiate a little between the will of the people and the responsibility of individual officials for one or another action. People want to live better. Unfortunately, the situation is now such that it is not easy to live in general either in the Crimea or in Ukraine. But when it is a question of citizens of Ukraine who live in the Crimea, individual persons, then we can talk about juridical and, in particular, criminal responsibility, if premeditated actions take place that are associated with changes in the territory of Ukraine or its borders and are aimed at changes in the constitutional system and structure of Ukraine. Criminal proceedings can be instituted here that are envisioned in Article 62 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. [Khmilevskaya] It is personally insulting to me that in the course of two years some leaders uttered these criminal slogans at every rally, and one of them even permitted himself to call Ukraine "a neighboring state" at meetings of the Crimean parliament. And official Kiev observed all of this calmly, so no energetic actions were undertaken. Today these leaders can defend themselves with the will of the people. The situation, as you see, changed. Behind them are the people who gave them their votes, who voted for those slogans which are in themselves criminal to a certain degree. [Onopenko] You are right in saying that the situation has changed, and that the will of the people is present. But there is also the will of the people of Ukraine. Constitutional principles of an independent Ukraine as a legal democratic state exist. Therefore, here, if we are to conduct a policy with respect to the Crimea, it is impossible to use only legal language from the standpoint of legal norms only. In my opinion, Ukraine should have conducted a more subtle and flexible policy with respect to the Crimea: economic, political, and social. After all, where Ukraine and its state structures did not do enough work, this gap was inevitably filled by someone, which led to those shortcomings that are present now. As for the responsibility of certain specific persons, including criminal responsibility, I would not want to concentrate attention on this, inasmuch as the question of one or another legal responsibility of each specific person should be resolved only in the established order, and only on the basis of collected evidence can a court declare a specific person guilty of one or another act. [Khmilevskaya] But if there is no such evidence, then it is also impossible to institute proceedings against one or another person... Dear Vasyl Vasylyovych, I have already said that the heads of a good half of Crimeans have been zombie-ized or stupefied by the idea that the Crimea is "a separate state" (three years of psychological information "conditioning" have had their effect). This is what people write to me: "When will you finally stop conducting an antistate policy in the Crimea." But I stand on the official position of Ukraine! [Onopenko] You see, it is necessary to take into account what is put into these concepts. After all, if it is a question of broadening some powers of the Republic of Crimea that are established by its legislative, executive, and judicial organs, then this phenomenon is normal. But if the question concerns additional powers of the Republic of Crimea as an autonomous republic in the structure of Ukraine, then these questions should be resolved on a legal basis. Therefore, if the Republic of Crimea had broader powers for the benefit of the residents of Crimea and in their interests, and I do not rule this out, and, obviously, it will be necessary to take this path, then this is a normal phenomenon. I will say only that everything must occur within the scope of existing legislation and, specifically, the existing legislation that is in effect in Ukraine. If contradictions exist between legislation in effect in the Republic of Crimea and the legislation of Ukraine, then it is necessary to bring Crimean legislation into conformity with Ukrainian laws. [Khmilevskaya] What will be the attitude toward a Crimean referendum, if one is held? [Onopenko] I am only the minister of justice of Ukraine, and I cannot give any guarantees, let alone predict how specifically the state authorities of Ukraine will treat this. This falls in the jurisdiction of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. And it must react in an appropriate way to specific decisions. But I do know something else. And, unfortunately, I was unable to meet with President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov when I was in the Crimea recently to review the work of the institutions and organs of justice (we missed each other at the time). I know that he is a lawyer, and I also am a lawyer, and therefore I hope that Yuriy Aleksandrovich, as a responsible person to whom the people entrusted an exceptional amount of authority, and, first and foremost, I emphasize, as a lawyer, he will respect the law and will be guided by the laws of both Ukraine and the Crimea. [Khmilevskaya] Well, as our great countrywoman said in difficult moments, "contra spem spero!"--"I am hoping against hope!" Thank you for the interview.
