It appears that our correspondent in Murmansk, Valeriy Anuchin, is going to confirm this. He reports that someone has managed to steal nuclear fuel from one of the depots of the Northern Fleet, situated in the outskirts of the city. This was the kind of fuel used for nuclear submarines. Three uranium rods have disappeared. They pose no threat to [people's] health and the environment, and apparently the thieves knew this when they were stealing the rods.
