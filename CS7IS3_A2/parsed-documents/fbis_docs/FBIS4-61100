The intention to appeal to the new composition of the Supreme Council on the matter of revoking the resolution on pre-term elections of a president of Ukraine and postponing elections to local councils to a later date is being justified. Predictions with regard to possible anarchy, further confrontation and chaos, and threats to the very existence of the state are being repeated as arguments in favor of this decision. A number of parties have taken this same stand; these are generally of a right-wing orientation and conduct their politics via the presidential structures in oblasts and rayons." Oleksandr Moroz stated: "The poorly thought-out statements by the president about the supposed absence of a constitution in Ukraine and about the constitutional crisis, about the incompetence of the newly elected composition of Ukraine's Supreme Council, and so on, not only discredit him as a leader of the state, but also actually deepen the political crisis, which he is endeavoring not to allow, according to him." According to the leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, the election of the new composition of Ukraine's Supreme Council by the people is without a doubt the decisive factor in the political process, the democratic development of which requires the speedy formation of new structures of state power in the center and in the localities in order to, first of all, initiate a set of anti-crisis measures in the economy.
