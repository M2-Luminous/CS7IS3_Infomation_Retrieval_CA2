Atsushi Nishikoori, a Sakigake (Harbinger) member of the House of Representatives, told a press conference that the party's Shimane branch opened its membership to foreigners the same day. Other branches will follow the Shimane branch, he said. Sakigake was founded last June by 10 disaffected members of the Liberal Democratic Party. Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura joined the coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa as the chief cabinet secretary last August. It currently has 14 members in the 511-seat House of Representatives. Nishikoori said at least 14 foreign residents in Shimane Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan side of western Honshu Island, have expressed interest in joining the party. It will accept foreigners who have lived in the prefecture for more than five years or who have a Japanese spouse and have lived in the prefecture for more than two years, if nominated by more than two party members. Nishikoori said opening the party to members of all nationalities is an "appropriate" way to create a new party suited to the demands of the world community. "Based on the principle of equality, we will remove the obstacles one by one," he said. Japan's two largest political parties, the LDP and the Social Democratic Party, stipulate that their members must be Japanese nationals. A senior member of Zainichito, a group of Korean residents seeking the right to vote, said the Sakigake decision is "wonderful." Yi Chin-mi said "They're probably just aiming to expand the number of party members, but we should use this as an opportunity to work for getting the vote, given that it isn't even known that foreigners in Japan don't have the right to vote."
