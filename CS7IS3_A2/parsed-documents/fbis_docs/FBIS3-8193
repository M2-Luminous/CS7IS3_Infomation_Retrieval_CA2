Poland's involvement in Slovak trade is barely 2.4 percent. When will all of the declarations be implemented about improving this state of affairs and about the desire for cooperation? [Kovac] I am sure that this has already begun. My first historic visit--and I do not hesitate to describe it thus--to Warsaw at the invitation of President Walesa in January was the first step that brought very concrete results. I also spoke to politicians and economists. Among other things, I visited the Polish Business Center Club in the Lubomirski Palace, where you have your officers' club. When one bakes bread, one starts with the dough. Poland is the first partner with which we have developed genuinely practical cooperation in combating economic crime. Fourteen Polish-Slovak deals are waiting to be signed by Prime Minister Pawlak during his visit to Bratislava, which has been scheduled for April. These mainly involve an intensification of cooperation, but one of them is an agreement on avoiding double taxation and another deals with the protection of investment. [passage omitted] [Forowicz] The present process of democratization does not make it easy for our countries to appear as stable countries worthy of quickly joining Western security structures. [Kovac] It is quite normal for countries such as ours to have to adapt themselves. But, if we want to join NATO soon, we must show that we are a partner that one can depend on. It is essential to show that a potential NATO member has no quarrels with its neighbors and is pursuing a stable domestic policy. It is worth underlining how important it is for our countries' image to have such initiatives as the Visegrad Group, a group of countries that are friendly toward one another and are trying to tighten their cooperation. [Forowicz] What universal message would you have for the soldiers and politicians concerned with the defense capability of Poland and Slovakia? [Kovac] The armies of both of our countries are also experiencing a period of change. Nevertheless, they are presenting their countries' defense potential. Unfortunately, a situation has arisen in which the Army reforms must take place at a time of a shortage of funds. Added to this are the costly commitments brought on by Partnership for Peace [PFP]. Everything requires a lot of discipline and patriotism and an ability to extract the maximum effect from relatively meager funds. That is why we need excellent and rational leaders now more than ever. We need military men who speak foreign languages. Leaders are required who set an example of professional conduct to the people under their command. Thanks to people with such qualities, I expect each of our armies will strengthen its morale.
