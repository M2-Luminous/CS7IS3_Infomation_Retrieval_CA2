Wang, who has formerly served as deputy director of the Beijing Institute of Social and Economic Sciences, is to be released so he can receive medical treatment, the source said. During the U.S.-PRC summit meeting in Seattle last November, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressly cited Wang's name and asked Chinese President Jiang Zemin to have Wang released. In view of the approaching expiration of the most-favored-nation (MFN) status for China next June, it is believed China plans to release Wang as a gesture toward the United States for requesting renewal of the status. On renewal of the status, the Clinton administration has maintained it an imperative condition that improvements be made in China's human rights issue. U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen plans to address Chinese leaders to reiterate U.S. position on this issue during his planned visit to Beijing on 19 January. Moreover, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher plans to ask Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen during a foreign ministerial meeting in Paris on 24 January that improvements be made on the human rights issue. China has already expressed its willingness to accept inspections of its prisons by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Recently, it also dropped charges against two Tibetan political prisoners and released them. The United States, however, has asserted these actions are insufficient.
