The erosion of state assets occurs mainly during the establishment of "the three kinds of foreign trade" and shareholding-system enterprises, when scientific appraisals of state-enterprise assets are not or were not made, thus turning state assets through various channels into collective, individual, and foreign-firm assets, for a loss to the state. A survey conducted in 1993 found that of over 10,000 state enterprises operating as Sino-foreign joint or contractual joint ventures, evaluations of the Chinese side's assets had been conducted in only one-third of the cases. And most enterprises evaluate only book assets, creating a loss of state assets of about 30 billion yuan a year. Not evaluating or underevaluating state assets when organizing shareholding enterprises are also common. In addition, the uncompensated use of state assets to set up enterprises and administrative-institution units of all [ownership] natures, also causes erosion of state assets. It is estimated that in the last decade, state-assets losses have amounted to about 500 billion yuan, making tax and state-assets losses two major severe problems for the Chinese economy. While developing a market economy, the Chinese Government has always adhered to the dominance of the state-owned economy in our national economy. Even now, key products of importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood are still produced mostly by state enterprises, which still provide most state revenue. The economic might of state enterprises is growing steadily, with state assets worth 2.6846 trillion yuan in 1991, and growing 14.3 percent to 3.0697 trillion yuan by 1992. Analysis shows that the key reason for the loss of state assets is that the state has not yet established a uniform and effective state assets management system, with the functions of current state assets management departments at all levels not having been converted, and pertinent state assets management laws incomplete, leaving state assets management lacking a grounding in higher level and more authoritative laws. In addition, as property rights mechanisms have not yet been provided access to enterprises and, when property rights are sold, certain local governments practice improper administrative interference, artificially forcing down the proportion of state-asset shares in "the three kinds of foreign trade" and shareholding enterprises. To change this severe loss of state assets, China is now taking a series of steps. First, we are inventorying in a planned way state assets and funds, through which we are clarifying our resources, to verify and appraise state capital funds. We completed this task for 10,000 state enterprises in 1993, and will do so for another 10,000 in 1994. We have given permission to over 1,000 accounting and auditing agencies throughout China to provide assets-evaluation services, paving the way for valid and accurate assets evaluations of all concerned parties when state enterprises sell [transfer] property rights. Meanwhile, enterprise assets-evaluation certificates certified by the state assets management sector have become essential examination and approval documents for upgrading enterprises to Sino-foreign joint ventures and shareholding. It is understood that the NPC Standing Committee is now drafting a "State Assets Law," which will be included in its immediate legislative plans, and is speeding up the formulation of "Terms for the Oversight and Management of State Enterprise Assets," and evaluation targets and methods for state assets value-preservation and appreciation. State Administration of State Property officials say that for all future state-enterprise property-rights alterations, we will conduct inventories of assets and funds, delimiting property rights, settling bonded debts, and registering property rights, to establish a rigorous examination and approval system.
