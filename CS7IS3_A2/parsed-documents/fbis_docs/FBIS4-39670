The press secretary reacted to a report in the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA daily, which cited "informed sources in the country's leadership" as saying that "the question about Viktor Chernomyrdin's resignation from the post of prime minister for reasons of health has been decided in principle, as has the appointment of Yuriy Skokov to the post". The report said "Viktor Chernomyrdin has reportedly agreed with the formula, which accounts for his unexpected departure for Germany for medical examination and treatment for nephrolithiasis". The newspaper cited unofficial data about the president's meeting with Yuriy Skokov last Monday, "as a result of which, the relevant draft presidential decrees are awaiting Boris Yeltsin's signature". Yuriy Skokov is the chairman of the federation of commodity producers and entrepreneurs of Russia. Earlier, he was secretary of the Security Council and since October 1992 was closely involved with the affairs of the regions, where he won considerable popularity, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reported.
