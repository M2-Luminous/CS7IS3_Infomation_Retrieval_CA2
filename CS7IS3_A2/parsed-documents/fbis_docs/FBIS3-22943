"We have made no contact with the terrorist leaders who are free," Fujimori said, denying Lima newspaper reports stating the government and Shining Path are holding meetings aimed at initiating a dialogue. During a news conference, the Peruvian president added: "We have established contact via our intelligence services to capture their leaders but not to establish communication, let alone establish talks." "The policy of my government is to capture the terrorists or confront and annihilate them," said the Peruvian head of state. Fujimori warned: "I will not allow terrorists to continue perpetrating so many murders, and that is why we have adopted adequate measures, some of them harsh but effective." According to official figures, the Maoist organization has caused the death of 25,000 Peruvians. [passage omitted]
