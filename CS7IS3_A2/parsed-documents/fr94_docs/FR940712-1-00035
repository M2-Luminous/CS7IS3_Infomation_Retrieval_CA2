FR940712-1-00035 FR940712-1-00011 A summary follows of each Recovery Region's reclassification and delisting goals, an estimation of progress to date in achieving those goals, and proposed Service action. The terms ``occupied breeding areas'' and ``occupied territories'' are used interchangeably. Either term indicates that a pair of bald eagles has established a breeding territory and a nest site but was not necessarily successful in producing young. All numbers are based upon known eagle nests and not estimates; surveys, particularly those before the late 1970s, miss some pairs, so all counts are considered minimums. Chesapeake Recovery Region Threatened Goals: Sustaining 175&hyph;250 breeding pairs with a productivity level of 1.1 young per active nest, concurrent with sustained progress in habitat protection measures. Delisting Goals: Sustaining 300&hyph;400 pairs with an average productivity of 1.1 young per active nest over 5 years with permanent protection of sufficient habitat to support this nesting population and enough roosting and foraging habitat to support population levels commensurate with increases throughout the Atlantic coastal area. Progress to Date: 329 reported occupied breeding areas and 1.12 young per occupied area in 1993. Progress in habitat protection has been sustained and additional habitat is being protected. There have been in excess of 175 known occupied breeding areas since 1988; 1992 was the first year in which there were more than 300. Threatened goals have been met, delisting goals have not. Service Proposal: Reclassify to threatened. Northern Recovery Region Threatened Goals: No goal for reclassification to threatened status in present plan. Delisting Goals: 1,200 occupied breeding areas over a minimum of 16 States with an average annual productivity of at least 1.0 young per occupied nest. Progress to Date: In 1993, there were 1602 known occupied breeding areas distributed over 21 States with 0.95 young per occupied breeding area. Productivity was 1.00 in 1990, 0.97 in 1991, and 1.01 in 1992. (Productivity estimates exclude nest data from Minnesota and Wisconsin in 1992, and from Wisconsin in 1990 and 1991, because there were no productivity surveys done in these States during those years.) Delisting goals have been met for occupied breeding areas and are close to being met for productivity. Service Proposal: Reclassify to threatened; the species would remain threatened where it now has that status. The recovery plan describes the delisting goals as initial and tentative. The Northern States Bald Eagle Recovery Team has reconvened for the purpose of reviewing the plan and revising the goals, if necessary. Pacific Recovery Region Threatened Goals: Nesting populations continue to increase annually for the 5 years beginning with 1986 nesting season. Delisting Goals: A minimum of 800 nesting pairs with an average reproductive rate of 1.0 fledged young per pair with an average success rate per occupied site of not less than 65% over a 5-year period. Attainment of breeding population goals should be met in at least 80% of management zones. Wintering populations should be stable or increasing. Progress to Date: In 1993, 1066 occupied breeding areas were reported with 0.86 young per occupied breeding area. The number of occupied breeding areas has consistently increased since 1986 and exceeded 800 for 4 of the 5 years beginning in 1990 when 861 were reported. Productivity has averaged about 1.0 since 1990. Threatened goals have been met. Should this trend continue, the delisting goals for number of nesting pairs and productivity may be met in the near future. At present, less than 80 percent of the 37 specified management zones have met their delisting goals. In 1993, 20 of those zones had met or exceeded their recovery goals, and four other zones in addition to the original 37 had nesting eagles that are not part of the recovery goals for this region. Threatened goals have been met. Delisting goals are close to being met for all criteria except attainment of breeding population goals for 80 percent of the management zones. About 10 more zones need to meet their goals to fulfill this criterion. Service Proposal: Reclassify to threatened in California (except the 10-mile strip along the Colorado River), Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Wyoming; the species would remain threatened where it now has that status. Southeastern Recovery Region Threatened Goals: 600 occupied breeding areas distributed over at least 75 percent of the historic range contingent upon greater than 0.9 young per occupied nest, greater than 1.5 young per successful nest, and at least 50 percent of the nests successful in raising at least one young; based on a 3-year average and documentation of population vigor and adequate support habitat. Individual State goals are given. Delisting Goals: Delisting may be considered if the recovery trend continues for 5 years after reclassification goals are met. The criteria for delisting will be developed when the species is reclassified from endangered to threatened.
