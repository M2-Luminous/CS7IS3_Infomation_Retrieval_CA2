I understand, for example, that you have not found a common language with the leaders of "Democratic Russia...." [Gaydar] Of course, it is a complex process to find a common language among democrats, who do constitute, let us say, a specific milieu; but the organizational mechanism which we have proposed has, on the whole, been supported and will be realized. The "Russia's Choice" faction has come up with an appeal on the need to create a political party which will be able to become the democratic movement's reliable mainstay in the complex political clashes which await us over the next two years and on which a way out of the present indeterminate, intermediate situation will depend. There are two of them -- either restoration, or the continuation of the reforms. This appeal was discussed at two major forums held Saturday in the council of the "Russia's Choice" movement and in the council of "Democratic Russia." The "Russia's Choice" Council supported the faction's initiative and proposed that its regional organizations assist in creating the party. "Democratic Russia" discussed our proposal in detail, and various viewpoints were expressed, but in the end they nonetheless agreed to give "Democratic Russia's" regional organizations the opportunity to decide on the spot, proceeding from their own conditions. This accords with our programs and principles, since in creating the new party we will not rely on the bases of existing structures but will build the party on the basis of people's individual choice. [Kuzmishchev] In other words, will those political figures who have become familiar and even odious and who, nevertheless, automatically end up seated at the presidium table in democratic meetings not necessarily occupy leading places in this party? [Gaydar] Quite right. You can always gather together 10 or 100 chance people who would go and vote for you today and convince them that you are a great democratic figure, even if you do not have an ounce of authority left. If you have created an understandable and structured organization with a fixed membership, then that organization already has the opportunity to decide for itself what leaders it needs. [Kuzmishchev] At the word "party" people recall "democratic centralism," above all. Moreover, historians know that dictatorship came into being not in 1918 but in 1903, when the Leninist principle of party building was adopted. Will you have anything like that? [Gaydar] We are, of course, trying to build a party not of a totalitarian but a parliamentary type, i.e. a party geared not to full and comprehensive control of society but to efficient political campaigning and measures, striving to implement a policy which we consider feasible within the framework of the Constitution and existing legislation. [Kuzmishchev] How, then, will the party differ from "Russia's Choice"? Even now the faction votes uniformly. [Gaydar] We propose quite clear and definite discipline in implementing jointly adopted decisions. As in Western parliamentary parties. It is possible to debate endlessly and champion your own viewpoint and yet implement jointly adopted decisions in practical work. This is not some amorphous formation like what exists now, when the position can change any day depending on who has made himself today's leader. It is a broad association of people who share common views and fears, who work together, and who shape and implement decisions together. There has never been anything like this in the democratic movement. [Kuzmishchev] How will your organizational principle differ from, let us say, that of Travkin's party? [Gaydar] In principle not at all. Any party is a mechanism for realizing political power. Precisely because we are countering today not only Travkin's party but the perfectly capable and regrown Communist Party with its strong structure in the provinces, with a large aktiv and with established traditions of party work and propaganda and our national socialists' quite rigid organization which, although still weak, is rapidly taking shape, we must counter them not with a friable and uncoordinated association of democrats but with a quite efficient organization. It is like a rifle, you know: It is identically made, but shoots at different targets. [Kuzmishchev] An argument is taking place in the Democratic Party, as in the past between Martov and Lenin: Must a party member work within an organization, or is it sufficient to share ideas? [Gaydar] This question will ultimately be decided by the party's constituent congress. But we believe, nonetheless, that we are building a party of the parliamentary type, and so such rigid demands are hardly applicable. [Kuzmishchev] Why do people call you the presidential party? You know, this does not always produce political capital. [Gaydar] It is a case of inaccurate interpretation. Very many people hastened to imagine a party of chiefs headed by the president. As far as I understand it, the president simply has no intention of creating such a party. It was a question of creating capable, organized structures which can implement a policy of reforms. [Kuzmishchev] What if the party achieves success and becomes the ruling party? [Gaydar] It will not supplant the state. In the traditional Soviet society it was a question not just of the election-winning Communist Party's placing its own representatives in various posts, as is done in any normal democratic state, but of the party's essentially turning the state into a scarecrow, into some ritual mechanism existing in order to implement the decisions adopted by the party. The party not only appointed the minister but also decided who must be his deputy, head of department, etc. This was a party of the totalitarian type. We, of course, have no need of such a party. [Kuzmishchev] A party means a structure, money, and ideology. In my view, things are difficult for you with the latter. You say: We will create an economy which, in the final analysis, will itself resolve all problems. People remember that they were once promised: Communism will be achieved, and then everything will be good.... [Gaydar] In actual fact, the essence of what we propose consists in limiting the state burden and the burden of officialdom in every possible way for society. Our opponents say: If there is a problem, the state must solve it. This means in practice that they will put 1,000 more officials in place and give them the opportunity to share several trillion rubles. You will pay taxes, and the officials will extort them and decide to whom to give money and to whom not to give it. This is what our opponents propose. Our position is the direct opposite. We do not promise manna from heaven; we promise something else -- a society in which the official will not have the right to decide which enterprise will prosper and which will not, depending on who has given him a bribe; a society in which the official will merely keep an eye on compliance with the laws. [Kuzmishchev] But more specific proposals are also needed. In my view, unless you elaborate program decisions on the protection of the Russian population in the neighboring countries, you will find it hard to compete with Zhirinovskiy, let us say, who has made the national question his trump card. [Gaydar] In 1992, when we did not in actual fact have our own monetary unit and there was no separation of our economic area, everybody despised us. Why should I supply anything to Russia, why should I seek entry to the Russian market if I can print money? We were forced to run and plead: Please send meat to us in Moscow. Ukraine said: Why should we feed you? That was what happened, and that is what we are being pushed toward today. In 1991 Crimea together with all of Ukraine had voted to pull out precisely because there was chaos in Russia, precisely because we were not separated by anything and had no tool of influence. Crimea votes differently today precisely because we have been separated. Either we have an efficient Russian economy with its own money, when people reckon with us and stand in line wishing to cooperate with us, and then we have the opportunity to uphold the rights of Russians in the neighboring countries by economic methods; or we mess up this whole business, and then we ask in bewilderment why Russians are being offended. [Kuzmishchev] What did those Russians who graduated from Saratov Polytechnical Institute and were sent to Dnepropetrovsk or Karaganda do wrong? Why has big politics turned them into second-class people? How can Russia help them? [Gaydar] Of course they did nothing wrong. The question is: What is to be done? The most important thing that we can do is to have a competent Russian economy, because then we will be able to secure dual citizenship for them, we can welcome them home, if that is what they want, and we can hold talks and conclude an agreement on a common economic zone and create a customs union and, in time, a currency union. We can make Russia the center of the common economic area which is being formed. [Kuzmishchev] Your opponents also favor a single emission center.... [Gaydar] Well, that is not a bad political move on their part: to appropriate the idea for which they criticized us, for which we struggled, and which we implemented.... [Kuzmishchev] Yegor Timurovich, what would you say to people far removed from politics if, as they say in advertising, you had 30 seconds? [Gaydar] Today we must be conscious of the rigid need to unite all sober-minded people precisely because a sense of a real historical danger has come about once again. All people feel and understand this. They also see the gleam in the eyes of the Communists, who have forgotten nothing and renounced nothing. They also see the triumphal self-confidence of the national socialists. In general this is dreadful for normal people, who simply think about themselves and their children. There are two reactions here: either panic or, nonetheless, a courageous decision to counter this real and very serious threat. We are struggling for our country's future. We do not want to see it a totalitarian state with camps, with no signs of human freedom, with lines, with shortages, with humiliations before chiefs. In fact we see our country free, with everyone having the right to his own opinion, to choose, to vote, and to decide the country's future and the opportunity to work and earn.
