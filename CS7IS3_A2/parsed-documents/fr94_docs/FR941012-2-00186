FR941012-2-00186 FR941012-2-00117 Data from the 1993 National Transit Database (Section 15) Report Year submitted in late 1993 and early 1994 have been used to calculate the fiscal year 1995 Urbanized Area Formula apportionments for urbanized areas over 200,000 in population. The population and population density figures used in calculating the Urbanized Area Formula are from the 1990 Census. C. Adjustments for Energy and Operating Efficiencies 49 U.S.C. 5336(b)(2) (formerly section 9(b)(4) of the FT Act) provides that, if a recipient under this section demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that energy or operating efficiencies would be achieved by actions that reduce revenue vehicle miles but provide the same frequency of revenue service to the same number of riders, the recipient's apportionment under 49 U.S.C. 5336 (formerly Section 9(b)(2)(A)) shall not be reduced as a result of such actions. One recipient has submitted data acceptable to FTA in accordance with this provision. Accordingly, the revenue vehicle miles used in the Urbanized Area Formula database to calculate the fiscal year 1995 Urbanized Area Formula apportionment reflect the amount the recipient would have received without the reductions in mileage. D. Repayment of Temporary Matching Fund Waivers Under the Temporary Matching Fund Waiver provision authorized at 49 U.S.C. 5307(i)(3) (formerly Section 9(g)(3)), grantees have been able to request a Federal share of 100 percent up to the area's total apportionment. Four grants or amendments have been awarded which employ the temporary waiver of local matching funds for Urbanized Area Formula grants approved in fiscal years 1992 and 1993. The local share amounts for these grants had to be repaid by March 30, 1994. If not repaid, the amount owed will be deducted from the area's fiscal years 1995 and 1996 Urbanized Area Formula apportionments. All affected grantees have opted to have their future apportionments reduced rather than pay back funds. Accordingly, the FTA is reducing the areas' future apportionments to reflect the amount owed. The local share payment amount for each project was determined by dividing the project's total disbursement amount through September 30, 1994, by the project's total Federal capital obligations. The calculated percentage was then applied to the project's original local share waived amount. Of the calculated amount determined for repayment, 50 percent has been deducted from the fiscal year 1995 Urbanized Area Formula apportionment. The remaining 50 percent will be deducted in fiscal year 1996. The dollar amounts published in this Notice reflect these fiscal year 1995 adjustments, and the affected areas have been so advised. E. Urbanized Area Formula Fiscal Year 1995 Apportionments to Governors The total Urbanized Area Formula apportionment to the Governor for use in areas under 200,000 in population for each State is shown on Table 2. Table 2 also contains the total apportionment amount attributable to each of the urbanized areas within the State. The Governor may determine the allocation of funds among the urbanized areas under 200,000 in population with one exception. As further discussed below, funds attributed to an urbanized area under 200,000, which is within the planning boundaries of a transportation management area, must be obligated in that area. F. Urbanized Area Formula Operating Assistance Limitations The fiscal year 1995 limitations on the amount of Urbanized Area Formula funds that may be used for operating assistance are included in Table 2 with the fiscal year 1995 apportionment. The operating assistance limitations for all urbanized areas have been increased under 49 U.S.C. 5336(d)(2) (formerly section 9(k)(2)(B) of the FT Act) to reflect the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers during the most recent calendar years. The CPI Detailed Report, December 1993, published by the Department of Labor (DOL), indicates the calendar year 1993 CPI increase for all urban consumers is 2.7 percent. This increase was applied against the base operating assistance limitation calculated under 49 U.S.C. 5336(d)(2) (formerly section 9(k)(2)(A) of the FT Act). This increase results in an overall national fiscal year 1995 authorized operating assistance limitation level of $1,083,663,529. However, the 1995 DOT Appropriations Act limits the nationwide availability for operating assistance to a maximum of $710,000,000. Accordingly, the operating assistance limitation published in this Notice takes into account both the 1995 DOT Appropriations Act and Federal transit laws. Therefore, the higher operating assistance limitation under Federal transit laws ($1,083,663,529) has been reduced to the $710,000,000 required by the 1995 DOT Appropriations Act by taking a pro rata reduction across all categories of grantees.
