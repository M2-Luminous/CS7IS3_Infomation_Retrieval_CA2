Countries feel uncomfortable enough about their vulnerability to American cultural contagion when it is inadvertent. But when the American bug is set forth as an outbreak of deliberate policy, they feel more than entitled to expostulate. The expostulations can often seem like rabid anti-Americanism, but for many, particularly among the smaller countries, it evinces a helpless inability to resist the on-rush of American dogma and its policy consequences. This is where Washington so often gets it wrong. America asserts the right to spread its own gospel simply because it has the best means for doing so; while the "flu-prone" nations see their political sovereignty and cultural independence threatened by the corrosion of the worst incidental and side effects of that gospel. It is where America's preaching of its gospel is contradicted by the cynicism of its own national interests that expostulation rises to protest. Nowhere else is that more telling than in Asia and Bosnia. In this continent, America's broader aims from "engagement", through ramifying trade and business ties, may be turned round for the narrow purposes of retaliation. In trade, for example, America encourages imports from Asian countries only to hold their export market positions hostage to an extraneous agenda, such as on democracy, human rights and labour standards. It reserves the legislative right in the so-called super 301 provision to employ this trade-war option in defiance of its GATT avowals. Much of Washington's insensivitiy and dogmatism, however, arises from its distance, both literally and metaphorically, from those affected by its policies. The meeting between President Clinton and Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed on Saturday showed that when much of this distance is physically bridged, considerable space can be found for common ground. Part of the reason why that space appears so narrow is a matter of attitude and perception. The latter two are too often infused by the hubris that comes from America's pre-eminent power and position in the global order. "One should try to convince by pointing out right and wrong rather than anything which might be interpreted as arm-twisting," Dr. Mahathir told Clinton. Developing nations' nervousness to American bullying is more than justified by recent history. The US, no doubt, would insist that it means well and that it is often mispercieved. Misperceptions are the first to be brushed away by the cordial and candid meeting of leaderships. On Bosnia, for example, Clinton was disscovered to be highly sympathetic but added that nations were constrained in their power to act. This admission, however, only extenuates America's culpability. Clinton has also shown himself to be a considerable departure from the yankee conservatism of the Bush and Reagan years. Responsive rather than antagonistic to the concerns of countries such as Malaysia for greater intra-regional economic relations, the president has softened the previous hard line on APEC and the EAEC. Above all, Clinton has shown that he takes Malaysia and its leader seriously. He has respected the right of small nations facing the "flu" to berate the sniffling political and economic levia than to take some medicine of its own first.
