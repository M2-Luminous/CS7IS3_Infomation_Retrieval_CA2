Africa! Independence! Distinguished guests, comrades, compatriots, friends, members of the High Command of APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army]. On Wednesday when I spoke to you here I indicated that I would not keep you long, but I regret to say that today I might be longer. On the 25 January just after 10 o'clock that night I had a long and heavy conversation on the telephone with Sabelo. That was the last time I spoke to him. Today, on the 26 February and exactly one month after that happy telephone conversation it is my painful duty to deliver the main oration to Comrade Sabelo's funeral. I have come to say goodbye Sabelo! Painful because I have lost a comrade, a friend, a brother, and a son, and painful because we are witnessing the passing of yet another great son of our people who is following on the heels of the great leaders such as Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, Nyati John Phokela, David Sibeko, Lekwane Zach Mothopeng, Jack Masemula, and numerous others who have gone before. The loss of Comrade Sabelo is a severe blow not only to the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania and to APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army], which led with such unparalleled distinction, but to the broad liberation movement and suffering African masses as a whole. We shall miss him deeply. He will always be remembered by us! There is no need to sing Comrade Sabelo's praises because his life, which he dedicated selflessly to the service of the oppressed African people, is an open book which is there for all to read. He led by example -- a true warrior and illustrious leader in the noblest tradition of our forefathers. There is no need to extol his commitment to the liberation of his motherland and his people, indeed when death struck its cruel blow Sabelo was on the road to yet another meeting which would have advanced the course of our liberation struggle. His life was cut short on a long and lonely road in Tanzania -- the African skies and the African bush his only cover. It is an indelible indictment of the racist apartheid policies that such a gifted man, so loyal and African, so dedicated a husband and father, so trustworthy a companion and friend, should die far away from home, precisely because he had been driven away from home and country by a burning desire to rid his land of the scourge of racism and imperialism. It is a cruel irony that Comrade Sabelo died at dawn of a new era on the eve of elections for a constituent assembly in which he would have taken his rightful place with other leaders of the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC], to shape and determine the destiny of African people as desired by the African people themselves. If only we had the power to shape and determine our destiny as we desire! For Comrade Sabelo and for all our comrades in APLA, the army of the African people fighting for the genuine liberation of our country from colonialism and racism, there was no alternative to the violence of the regime but the response of the barrel of the gun. Against our will we were forced into battle by the political tyranny of apartheid and its violent and barbaric army and police. We took a decision that a gun will be answered with a gun! Yet, our position has always been quite simple. If we are hit we hit back and we hit back hard. Among us today are senior personnel of APLA. We salute them and extend our deepest gratitude to them as true and dedicated soldiers for the liberty of man from tyranny and oppression. I will not forget that we still have a long way to go! Unlike the settler community and its elite reactionaries drawn from the rank of the oppressed, we want to tell the world in very clear terms that APLA is not a terrorist army. We want to tell the world that Comrade Sabelo was not a terrorist. We want to tell the world that Comrade Phama, even in death, remains a true hero of our struggle. He gave his life for the liberation of his people! We want to tell the world that APLA is the army of the oppressed African masses and every single one of them with us here today and those still in the bush are our heroes, and we also want to say this to the oppressors: APLA shall come back in victory and no force on earth shall stop our march to victory. We are determined to conquer shaka [referring to the regime]! Those who are searching for terrorists must take a closer look at the murderers who are employed by the regime. The true and only terrorists are in the CCB (Civil Cooperation Bureau], in the hit squads of the SAP [South African Police], and the foreign mercenaries of Koevoet [crowbar; police counterinsurgency unit], and 32 Battalion. Those are the terrorists. Just three days before my last conversation with Comrade Sabelo, the PAC announced a unilateral suspension of hostilities against the regime. Comrade Sabelo and the entire top structure of APLA unanimously endorsed the decision because we wanted to show the world that we do not engage in violence for the sake of violence. We wanted to isolate the true agents of violence, who are the regime and its assorted gangs of murderers. We were not forced by the regime or by anyone else to suspend the arms struggle. We did not sign any minutes and we did not compromise any of our ideals and principles. We resisted all attempts by the regime, both inside and outside the country ... [break in transmission] ... to negotiate the future of the arms struggle of the African people. The terrain of our struggle has now shifted and we claim one major victory. We forced the regime to give in on the question of an elected constituent assembly and a new task has now begun. In April we will fight the elections for a constituent assembly based on the universal principle of one person one vote. It is the constituent assembly where the African people themselves will write a constitution acceptable to them, a constitution for true liberation and freedom. Not half liberation! Our people inside and outside the country have endorsed unreservedly our decision to fight the elections to enable us to win a mandate from you to write a constitution which will set you free in the land of your forefathers. We in the PAC believe there are only two choices facing you at the elections. You either elect parties which will form a new government, which includes your oppressors and a new elite drawn from the ranks of oppressed, or you elect the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania. The first choice shall never give you freedom but will only perpetuate your subjugation while entrenching the privileges which the minority enjoy at your expense. The second choice, an overwhelming vote for the PAC, shall set you free. The PAC is the only party in this country which has never compromised or sold out on the sacred duty which the African people entrusted to us. That sacred duty is the task of leading our people to freedom. Last weekend in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, we unveiled our election manifesto. Since then, and not surprisingly, there has been numerous attempts by the regime and its (?affiliates) to discredit our principles. They have tried everything to discredit us! The reason why we are being attacked is not hard to understand. The regime and its surrogates are running scared. They are running scared because they realize that the moment of truth has finally arrived. They are running scared because they realize the PAC has finally arrived. We have never made any secret of our intention to reclaim our land from those who stole it, but just in case the regime and its apologists did not hear us clearly last weekend, let us repeat ourselves today. We are going to get our land from you and we shall then hand it back to its rightful and historical owners, the African people. [applause] We will take back this land give it to its owners, the Africans! During their election campaign our ideological and political opponents have made promises to pay the settlers for any land taken back. We in the PAC make no such promises. The PAC shall not pay anyone for our land and we make no apologies for that. [applause] An overwhelming majority for the PAC at elections will give you a constitution which shall enshrine the land as your inalienable property because the land belongs to you. We shall reclaim the land by constitutional means and Africans who were forcibly removed from their land by apartheid and racism will have the right to claim their land back. In addition to land we promise you a caring economy, an economy which will benefit every citizen of our country. Up to now the minority has accumulated great wealth on the sweat of our people, and under a PAC government that will stop. We shall not nationalize institutions because it is not our policy to create fat cats by transferring wealth from one class of elites to new ones. Instead we shall democratize and socialize the economy to benefit everyone, particularly the African masses who are the major victims of poverty. In short our economic policy will declare war on poverty, hunger, disease, unemployment, and homelessness. Under a PAC government our children shall go back to school and we shall bring back the culture of learning. The intimidation which has destroyed the careers of hundreds of thousands of our children will stop. For far too long the class boycotts have been spearheaded by hypocrites whose own children have never been cannon fodder for the guns of the racist police and we say that will now stop, and we promise you an end to the violence wrecking our country. A government of the PAC will not sit back and fold its arms and watch passively while Africans' blood is spilt in violence, which serves the purposes of the oppressors. Too much precious African blood has been shed already and one more drop is one drop too many. Comrade Sabelo would not have wanted us to achieve less for you. His life was dedicated to improving the quality of life for the African people in a liberated country. Our people inside and outside the country, in APLA and all other structures of the PAC, demand that we go out and win the elections in April so that the African people can determine their own destiny. In a final farewell to our fallen hero I have a message for our young people. You all loved Comrade Sabelo in life and you all drew inspiration from the noble and exemplary manner in which he selflessly answered the call of duty. Take a leaf from the life of a great man and true patriot. Whatever you do in life, whatever your task in the name of our struggle for liberation, do it diligently. Do it with honor and dignity. Do it in the loving memory of your hero. To our beloved sister and his widow, Comrade Dudu, and to her young sons Andile and Sandile, we give a message of courage and strength. You are not alone in your grief in these trying times of personal anguish. The whole nation of Africans is right beside you and right behind you. Do not despair for the dawn of liberation is near and when that day dawns we shall proudly and jubilantly raise the flag of liberty on Comrade Sabelo's grave. To his parents we give gratitude for having given him to the noble task of liberating Africans. Few sons of the soil have exerted themselves with such distinction. Sabelo's contribution to the struggle for emancipation can never be measured or fully explained in words. Indeed, when the true history of the African people is written, the name of Sabelo Phama will be etched in gold. To the African nation we say: Go out and win elections convincingly. Go out and win it for Sabelo Phama and ideas for which he lived and died. Go out and win in memory of our fallen hero so that he may take the good news of our victory to Sobukwe, Phokela, and Mothopeng. And to all of our heroes! Go out and win in the name of freedom and liberty. As for all of us gathered here today over the noble bones of our hero we rededicate ourselves even more diligently to the attainment of the ideals for which Sabelo Phama lived and died. We make this final pledge to our departed hero. We shall get our land back and the African people shall be free.
