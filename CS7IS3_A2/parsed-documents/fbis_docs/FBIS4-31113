The maps, offered on the basis of drawings by a group of experts in Washington, are the maps for war, not for peace, Aleksa Buha, foreign minister for the Srpska republic, told journalists from TANJUG and Serb Sarajevo Radio-Television. The maps give 51 percent of Bosnian territory to the Muslims and Croats, and 49 percent to the Serbs, as proposed in the declaration adopted in Geneva on 13 May. But according to Buha, the talks should start with the percentage agreed upon within the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, which is 30 percent for the Muslims, 16.5 for the Croats, and 53.5 for the Serbs. The maps currently on offer have turned the Srpska republic into separate unconnected areas, which suggests the Muslim concept of a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is absolutely unacceptable for the Serb side, Buha said. Talking about the end of the first round of talks, Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic said that during the exchange of opinions, it became obvious that the Contact Group favored the Muslim side. The talks on the cessation of hostilities have not yet started in the Palais des Nations in Geneva. A Srpska republic delegation has arrived in the Palais and is waiting for the arrival of the Muslim and Croat delegations who have been invited to the meeting by UN Special Envoy Yasushi Akashi after the news that the Serbs had withdrawn from the 3-km zone around Gorazde.
