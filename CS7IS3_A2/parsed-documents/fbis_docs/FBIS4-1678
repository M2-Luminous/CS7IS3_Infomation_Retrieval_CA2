Li Zhong, an employee in a local import and export company, recently bought an air conditioner with his master card in a department store near his home. He has become used to doing daily shopping and treating his clients with a credit card. "We had to carry large amounts of cash in the past," he said. "Now credit cards make our lives much easier." Credit cards only came into common citizens' lives in the past couple of years. Last May, Li's company provided all its employees with credit cards. Two-thirds of each employee's monthly salary is deposited into the card's account. At present, credit cards in use in Shanghai include "Great Wall" of the Bank of China, "Peony" of the Bank of Industry and Commerce, "Pacific Ocean" of the Bank of Communications, "Master" and "VISA" cards of the Bank of Construction, and "Jinshui" (Golden Wheat Ears) and "Baiyulan" (White Magnolia) of the Bank of Agriculture. At least 200,000 Shanghai residents hold credit cards and use them in some 2,000 hotels and department stores. In 1993, consumables bought with credit cards in the city reached more than 1.4 billion yuan in value. To unite the different credit card systems and facilitate card holders, Shanghai started the "Golden Card Project" last winter and established the Shanghai Credit Card Network Co., Ltd., which mainly administers a credit card network information system covering the whole city.
