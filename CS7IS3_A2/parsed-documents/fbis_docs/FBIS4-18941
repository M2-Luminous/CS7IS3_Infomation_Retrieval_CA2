The Northern Leaguer who is most favored for the seat of interior minister is the target of threats. The last threat dates back to a few days ago; it was signed by Walter Alasia, the name of the notorious branch of the Red Brigades and said: "We already consider you a dead man." Roberto Maroni, the great mediator, lets the news slip through in a soft voice while [Northern League Secretary] Bossi is speaking on the stage at Pontida. However he does not lose his composure even though his expression is not as calm as usual. "The police authorities offered an escort, but I do not want it because if they want to kill me they will succeed anyway. Moreover, I do not want to create any alarm, there are already too many problems." [Cusmai] But are you not afraid? [Maroni] Yes, but escorts do not do a great deal. I would abolish almost all of them; they cost heaps of money and are often given to people that do not need them. [Cusmai] To politicians that are no longer part of the game and who feel threatened? [Maroni] Precisely. Those people have to look after themselves. Those who were formerly powerful are at a high risk just because they are no longer capable of satisfying the interests of their old clients. This is their business and does not concern the state and the people. [Cusmai] You want to do away with escorts then? [Maroni] I would allow them in dribs and drabs. Today there are only about 10 people in Italy whose lives are very much at risk. Only they deserve a special treatment because they are all the people who are working on the front line and fighting against organized crime, both Mafia and ordinary crime. [Cusmai] Today here at Pontida, Marco Formentini [League Mayor of Milan officially designated you minister of internal affairs. What would be your first measure? [Maroni] I would transfer the Viminale [seat of the Interior Ministry] to Palermo or Naples. I realize that this is not any easy thing to do. It takes time. Therefore, I would begin by immediately decentralizing certain functions and sections. For example, I would transfer the anti-Mafia commission to Palermo. And I would see Mario Borghezio from Turin, who is highly competent and already a member of the anti-Mafia commission, as its president. [Cusmai] Why do you want to transfer pieces of the Viminale palace? [Maroni] Because the operational and strategic structures of the Viminale must be present in the hot areas of the country. The people must feel the presence of the state and its protection. [Cusmai] Do you not see Milan as being a dangerous city? [Maroni] Of course, it is full of thousands of companies that are not controlled. Unfortunately, there is no limit to financial crime, but it can also be fought with federalism. Only this can weaken the Mafia because a large part of its revenues does not come from prostitution or drugs but from public tenders. In any case, I would transfer the Industry Ministry and the CONSOB [National Commission for the Supervision of Companies and the Stock Exchange] to Milan. [Cusmai] Let us get back to public order. What do you think about the police forces? [Maroni] There is currently no coordination between the police, military police, and fiscal police. We have three operational centers where antagonism rather than collaboration reigns. Well, the battle against crime must begin with the total streamlining of these structures. [Cusmai] What do you say about the prefects? [Maroni] They are all public officials who are at the end of their careers and their structures are almost useless. The most important thing is that they manage civil defense and this should be coordinated by the municipalities. [Cusmai] What major damage did the DC [Christian Democratic Party] cause during the 40 years in which it managed the Interior Ministry? [Maroni] I am trying to think of the good that it did but nothing comes to mind. It permitted relations between politics and the Mafia, it destroyed local autonomy, it used the secret service for political battles. [Cusmai] And what would you do to the secret service? [Maroni] A great uplifting is needed immediately. First, by replacing all the executives and top men at once. In addition, the new people must be hired through public exams. [Cusmai] Secrecy is not needed then? [Maroni] The structure of the secret service must not be secret. I would change its name. I would call it a confidential service or a service for democracy. [Cusmai] The Interior Ministry also has jurisdiction over local bodies. How should one intervene in this sector? [Maroni] The municipalities should be reorganized, city managers introduced, the careers of municipal secretaries revised. In practice, the latter should no longer be responsible for municipal management, but should become the controllers of the legitimacy of acts. The management instead should be entrusted to a managerial staff selected by the mayor. This is the primary emergency. Only in this way will the municipalities be able to govern.
