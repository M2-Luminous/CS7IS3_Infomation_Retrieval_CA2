Many of them are expecting that sales will show little dynamism and that employment and investment will decline. However, a majority hope that inflation will continue to decline, or will at least stabilize. These expectations were revealed in the results of a survey of the private businessmen in various zones of the country published in the local journal EKOS. In addition, the report notes that these are indications that the economic program of the government has reached a key point--one from which it could either advance or retreat. The chart shows some of the indicators of the expectations of the businessmen as determined by the survey published in the journal in question. The atmosphere of pessimism among the nation's private businessmen with regard to the economic prospects of Ecuador for this year, which might mean that the nation has reached a key point in its stabilization process, was revealed by the results of the survey of 80 executives in the industrial, trade, and banking sectors throughout our national territory. While inflation was regarded as the most serious national problem until six months ago, economic growth and employment are beginning to emerge as the main concerns today. That is what was shown by the survey carried out by the journal EKOS, which published its first issue a few days ago in Quito under editor Pablo Lucio Paredes. He had served previously as the secretary of the CONADE [National Council for Development] under the current government. None of the businessmen indicated a level of optimism of more than 50 points, while more than 70 percent of them gave their optimism a rating of between 0 and 35 percent. From the survey, one can conclude that 82 percent of the businesses plan investment at levels that will increase their assets by as much as 10 percent. This figure will merely serve to maintain the current level of installed capacity if technological and physical depreciation are taken into account. In this connection, the survey shows, 1993 was a better year than 1994 will be, although the difference between the two years is not a major one, meaning that investments seem "not to have awakened from their prolonged lethargy." According to the results of the survey, the textile sector represents an exception. After having seen major growth in sales in 1993, this sector is planning a recovery in 1994, although the year will be characterized by an acceleration in the process of reducing personnel and incremental price reductions. A similar exception is made where automotive enterprises are concerned, as they take an optimistic view of their future. On the other hand, the survey notes, the metal-mechanical sector reveals negative growth, a decline in employment, and a small increase in prices as a result of competition. Unemployment Persists In the job sector, the survey warns that 45 percent of those questioned plan personnel reductions, and only 16 percent have planned to increase the number of employees by more than 5 percent. In conclusion, stabilization continues to be accompanied by dwindling employment, the survey notes. Where the foreign-exchange market is concerned, the survey indicates that 25 percent of those surveyed expect the rate to rise to more than 2,500 sucres; about 50 percent believe that it will reach that level; 30 percent maintain that the dollar will not exceed 2,400 sucres; and another third believe it will not exceed 2,300 sucres. As to the active interest rates, 72 percent of those surveyed believe that they will not exceed 40 percent. The weighted average of this indicator in 1993 was 41 percent, while that anticipated for 1994 is 36 percent. This means that there is a clear expectation of a decline in financial costs, according to the analysis. The report comments that the movement from stabilization toward growth is necessary from the point of view of social balance, but it cautions that the tremendous fragility involved in the early stages of a process of this nature must be borne in mind. More profound modernization and structural reforms are recommended.
