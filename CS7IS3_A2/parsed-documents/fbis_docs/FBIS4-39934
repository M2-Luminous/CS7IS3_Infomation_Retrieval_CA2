Little wonder, really, since there is no unity at the top in attitudes to the provinces. An increasing number of analysts note that the role of a man capable of defining a common denominator could be played by Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. This week he held a major conference with leaders of representative bodies of authority from numerous regions of Russia. [Shumeyko] There are classic features of a federation. First, it is a state made up of independent regions. Second, each independent part of a federal state has its own legislation. Finally, following the adoption on 12 December 1993 of the Constitution, we have the last classic feature: A federal state has a bicameral parliament, with one chamber directly protecting the interests of the regions. Therefore, what I have read in the papers of late, claims that Shumeyko is preoccupied with something, with some sort of presidential elections, and so he has become involved and has organized a party of the regions--this is all completely groundless. [Voskoboynikov] If we were to single out the most serious problem in relations between the center and the regions, what would you say it was? [Shumeyko] The most important one is probably the budget. A budget is necessarily political. It manifests the policy of the state. This is the purpose of a budget. It is not a sum of arithmetical operations. The arguments we often hear about the budget nowadays concentrate on figures. But the important thing is not the figures. For instance, everyone says that the Federation Council and Shumeyko want to ingratiate themselves with the military, and that is why they insist on these figures. But that is not the point. The point is that for 33 regions, the defense sector forms the basis of their industry. The same defense industry into which all the potential of the former Soviet Union used to be directed. Whatever we say, the State Duma reflects the political structure of the state. Half of its deputies were elected on party tickets. They adopted the budget on the basis of consensus. The faction leaders got together and reached political consensus. But thank God, or maybe unfortunately, parties nowadays in no way reflect the interests of the population of Russia. We have a population of 150 millions, while the largest party, the Communist Party, has about 300,000 members. Regions, on the other hand, reflect the real state of affairs in Russia.
