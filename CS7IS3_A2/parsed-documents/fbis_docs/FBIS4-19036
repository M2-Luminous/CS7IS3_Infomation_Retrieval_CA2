[passage omitted] The Belgian defence Ministry, for its part, announced that nearly 400 evacuees, mainly Belgians, had arrived at Brussels airport Tuesday from Nairobi. They were flown in on two planes, one carrying 195 people -- 186 Belgians and nine people of other nationalities, and another carrying 204 people, 158 of them Belgian. The defense ministry said a total of 446 Belgians had fled Rwanda, a former Belgian colony, and about 1,000 others remained behind. It was impossible to know how many of those wanted to be evacuated, the ministry said. It added that the Belgian evacuation operation, being conducted by Belgian troops, should be completed within three or four days. Belgians made up the largest group of foreign nationals in Rwanda, with more than 1,500 living there. Another flight from Nairobi, carrying 400 people, was expected in Brussels early Tuesday afternoon. In Paris, meanwhile, the foreign ministry said two flights from Bangui were expected later Tuesday carrying about 55 French nationals and 30 people of other nationalities.
