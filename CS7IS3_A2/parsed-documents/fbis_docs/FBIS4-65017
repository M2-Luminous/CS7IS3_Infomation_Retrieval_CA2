The same sources clarified that "while the Albanian people depend on Greece for financial help, Berisha and his environment depend politically and economically on foreign centers that do not want Greek-Albanian relations to improve. On the contrary, these centers would benefit if relations deteriorated." It is especially significant to look at the interpretation of Berisha's policy toward Greece. "What the Albanian president is really afraid of is not the Greek minority in Albania, but that the vast majority in southern Albania--Greeks, Albanians, Orthodox people, and Muslims--has its eyes turned toward Greece, is learning the Greek language, is trading in drachmas, and is living peacefully." This is what concerns the Albanian Government, a government that during its two years in power has nothing to show for it other than dictatorship, terrorism, political persecution, censorship, offensive talk against opponents, and financial corruption. For such a government to survive, it needs to exaggerate foreign danger--Greek danger--to revitalize its national conscience and avoid the opposition. Albanian Government officials already believe that under this possible scenario that has been implemented with foreign guidance, Berisha foresees--if his policy of slanting "the foreign danger of Byzantine Greece" succeeds--that the opposition will join with the government and form a "government of national unity that will deal with the foreign threat." [passage omitted] Albanian opposition and Greek minority officials believe that it is urgent to strengthen relations between them because both groups are being tried by the Albanian Government's dictatorship and their human rights are being violated. If the Human Rights Party does not realize its real role of defending the human rights of the minority and the Albanian people, then it is in danger of being isolated and falling into the trap set by the Albanian Government. [passage omitted] The Greek minority party Omonoia will give a news conference in Tirana to say that "the Albanian people and the Albanian political parties must be informed of the organization's real positions so that they do not become an object of exploitation by third parties that do not want Greek-Albanian relations to improve."
