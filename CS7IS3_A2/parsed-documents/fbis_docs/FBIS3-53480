The dialogue will take place on the basis of legality and will reject dialogue with illegal parties, a condition placed by the National Democratic Party for any such dialogue. The Muslim Brotherhood violently attacked its former ally the Labor Party, accusing it of ingratitude. It reminded the Labor Party that thanks to the Muslim Brotherhood, several Labor Party members were elected members of the People's Assembly and other local councils. A message written by the Muslim Brotherhood's Guidance Office and addressed to Labor Party deputy leader 'Adil Husayn says the slogan "Islam is the solution" is a Muslim Brotherhood slogan and that it is under this slogan that the Labor Party has made headway here and there.
