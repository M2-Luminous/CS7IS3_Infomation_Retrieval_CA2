Reports of sporadic incidents of shooting and arson have been received from various areas of Karachi East and the central district. The troublemakers set at least six vehicles on fire, damaging them. According to PPI, a press note issued in Karachi says eight people sustained bullet wounds; two of them subsequently died. Many business centers and industrial establishments were closed. Traffic was light, particularly in the central and eastern districts. The press note says the situation was brought under control with the help of the rangers and the police. Some arrests have been made, and the police have registered cases and started investigations. The district magistrate of Karachi South has enforced Section 144 [banning assembly of more than five persons] throughout the district. There have also been some incidents of violence and disruption of law and order in Hyderabad. In Karachi, a spokesman of the Pakistan People's Party [PPP] appealed to the civilian population of the Sindh to resolve the situation and support the provincial government in its attempts to eliminate terrorism, so that peace is restored to the Sindh and hatred eliminated. He said the negative politics of the Muhajir Qaumi Movement [MQM] has created enmity between itself and other communities, causing serious damage to the Muhajirs, besides creating serious economic difficulties for the residents of Karachi and Hyderabad. The people want to eliminate these problems. The spokesman said the Army operation was started not by the PPP but by the previous government. He said the terrorism to which MQM leader Altaf Hussain is referring is of his own creation and he should clear the charges against him in court. The spokesman added that the Nawaz Sharif government and not the PPP government is responsible for the excesses mentioned by Altaf Hussain.
