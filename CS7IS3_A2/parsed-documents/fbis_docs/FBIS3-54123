Besides, he said, we will be able to manufacture the ultramodern Light Combat Aircraft [LCA] within the next two years. He also said the Defense Research Division is eager to undertake research on modern technical know-how and surpass the obstacles erected by Western countries. Dr. Abdul Kalam, known as the father of Indian missile technology, is a great expert. A conference of dignitaries from various Defense Ministry research divisions was held in New Delhi. Several personalities participated, including Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul. Dr. Abdul Kalam disclosed some facts to the scientists that participated in the conference. He said: The Western countries have declined to provide India with the latest technical know-how required by the military, especially by the Air Force. Under these circumstances, the government has decided to undertake new ventures based on our indigenous technical know-how. Accordingly, a committee of scientists from various important defense units, including the Defense Ministry and Air Force Research Wing, has been established. We need ultramodern technical know-how for our defense sector, because we know the position of the erstwhile Soviet Union since its fragmentation. Therefore, we cannot afford to be at anyone's mercy. The LCA light fighter aircraft will be manufactured by June 1996. The LCA is the smallest fighter plane used in the various parts of the world. It can be operated by one person. This type of aircraft is the lightest one; it is used for various purposes on the battle front. This aircraft, which can fly very fast and change altitudes very quickly, will be manufactured within the next two years.
