Before the signing ceremony, Chen Xitong and other leaders met with the noted Hong Kong enterpreneurs, including Li Jiacheng, Dong Jianhua and Li Hanzhao. Chen Xitong extended welcome to the friends from Hong Kong who came to conduct cooperation. He said: Viewed on a long-term basis, Beijing will become a more open, modern city. I think many people will notice this. At present, Beijing has approved of the establishment of over 7,000 of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises. We welcome more people to come and stage their performances in the "arena" of Beijing and to conduct emulations. We will support those who run fast in the race. The second-phase Dongfang Square construction project jointly built by Dongcheng District and Hong Kong Huixian Investment Company. Ltd. is a huge project. It is hoped that both sides will conduct more consultations, maintain close cooperation and do a good job in designing this project. The Beijing construction team is capable of undertaking formidable tasks. We will spare no effort to support this team in starting construction and finishing it early. Chen Xitong said: China is thriving and marching towards the goal of becoming better-off with great confidence. Beijing is a developing city. Over the past few years, it has completed a construction area of more than 10 million square meters every year, of which, 5 million square meters are residental homes. However, the most arduous task in attaining the goal of becoming well-off is the housing problem. Your willingness to actively participate in the capital's housing construction projects in addition to your investments and cooperation in some large items are greatly welcomed.
