He talked about China's preparations for scientific and technological development for the 1990's, the reform of the science and technology structure, and the integration of science and technology. Minister Song Jian is warm and friendly. He is wise and firm in his conversational style, analyzing problems brilliantly and thoroughly. He has good poise as a leader and demonstrates the qualities of a scholar. This reporter had read a brief biography of Song Jian and knew that he was not only an outstanding leader in political circles but also a scientist with great attainments. As a member of the institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, he is noted in scientific circles for his systematic cybernetics. In designing and leading the development of China's surface-to-air missile control system, antiballistic-missile weapons, nuclear submarine-launched missiles, and telecommunications satellites, Mr. Song has made great efforts and numerous achievements. The celebrated scientist Qian Xuesen once praised Song Jian as a "Chinese authority on cybernetics." Seize the Opportunity To Quicken Development Minister Song told this reporter that the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, which ended not long ago, made an important policy decision about further reforming the science and technology structure and clearly stated that the goal of science and technology structural reform is to establish a new structure which suits the development of the socialist market economy, conforms to the laws of the development of science and technology themselves, promotes scientific and technological progress, and scales new scientific and technological heights, to achieve the comprehensive and coordinated development of the economy, science, technology, and society. He said it is a heartening and achievable goal. He said that Deng Xiaoping recently pointed out: "In history, China has not had many opportunities for vigorous development." Looking back at history, for various reasons, the Chinese had missed several good opportunities for vigorous development and this is deeply regretted. China is now faced with an opportunity which is very rare in the history of development. We must cherish this opportunity and seize it to quicken reform and opening up and the pace of development, enhance the country's strength, and improve the people's living standards. Song Jian said, with deep feeling, that people will use this to assess the achievements and inadequacies in the future. Strategic Task For the 1990's This reporter asked him how he interpreted the principle of "stabilizing one end and opening up the other end," as stated in the "Decision," for scientific and technological development and what was the significance of it. Song Jian said: That is an important guiding principle for science and technology structural reform. Stabilizing one end demands that we make great efforts to ensure the sustained and steady development of key basic research projects and high-tech research, tackling key scientific and technological problems which have a bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood; support and save the stamina for the long-term development of science and technology; and continuously bring new ideas for technological innovations. Opening up the other end means that we need to spur the commercialization, industrialization, and internationalization of scientific and technological fruits, making a greater contribution to the establishment of a socialist market economic system. "Stabilizing one end" and "opening up the other end" are interdependent. Neither of the two is indispensable. This is a crucial step toward settling the question of integrating science and technology and the economy. Minister Song Jian stressed: A central question which has puzzled us for a long time is the separation between science and technology and economic development. Since reform and opening up, we have taken a very important step on this question and have obtained notable achievements. However, for the complete settlement of this question we still need the concerted efforts and struggle of the scientific and technological circles and the economic and financial circles. He pointed out that establishing a science and technology structure which suits the socialist market economy and forming an economic structure which is conducive to technological progress are important strategic tasks for the 1990's. What aspects should be particularly emphasized in China's current scientific and technological development? In reply, Song Jian said: --Step up agricultural science and technology. In the mid-21st century, China will probably have a population of 1.6 billion people. Only by maintaining an independent, steady, and sufficient supply of farm products can we guarantee the survival and development of the Chinese nation and this is determined by China's specific national conditions. China needs to increase its grain output by 50 percent by that time. In the face of the huge population pressure and unpredictable natural disasters, the levels of agricultural science and technology must be improved very considerably. Therefore, it is an immediate task to develop high-yield, quality, and high-efficiency agriculture. --Quicken the development rate of high and new technology. During the 1990's, we will continue to organize and guide a large number of scientific research organizations and scientific and technical personnel into the market to develop high- and new-tech industries. By the end of this century, high added-value exports will rise from the current 5 percent to 10 or 20 percent. We must develop our own high- and new-tech industries. We must have great courage, take the offensive, open up markets, enhance our strength, participate in competition, build up a number of large modern corporations, and form an energetic force to compete with the developed nations. At that time, our science and technology will occupy a place in the world. --Step up basic research. Basic research is the fountain of the scientific and technological productive forces, the vanguard of new technologies and new inventions, and the backing for science and technology as a whole. Once we make great breakthroughs in it, it will inevitably mean great progress in production technology, in the economy, and in society. Therefore, China will maintain a sophisticated, high-efficiency, and high-level basic research system as a backing for the long-term development of science and technology and will increase inputs in it so that we can catch up with the world and make new breakthroughs in some of the most important basic research disciplines, new research disciplines, and interdisciplinary sciences. An Earnest Hope "The country's future lies in science and technology." This is a line from one of Song Jian's poems. He said: The scientific and technological circles all over the country are shouldering the heavy task of invigorating the motherland with science and technology. In order to achieve this historic task, it is necessary to mobilize all positive factors, unite friends at home and abroad, and struggle devotedly. During the conversation, he leafed through the 1994 editions of CHING CHI TAO PAO and showed contentment with its development and progress. Moreover, he earnestly hoped that CHING CHI TAO PAO will contribute more to promoting scientific, technological, and economic exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao.
