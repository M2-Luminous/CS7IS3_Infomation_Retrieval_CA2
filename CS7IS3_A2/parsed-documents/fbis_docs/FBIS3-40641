Prime Minister Narasimha Rao said this in an interview, and it is true in our present situation. It is important to discuss how much burden will be put on the farmer and how it will crumble our economy if the multinational companies put the stamp of their patent on every grain we grow. Why are our politicians and the government quiet about this issue and merely trying to comfort us? Genetic engineering has reached every grain of wheat and paddy now. It means that various seeds can be created by cross-breeding special types of seeds. S. Barlow had crated a Mexican seed by crossing a Mexican high yield variety with a dwarf plant, which made the plant shorter (to withstand rain, winds, and hurricanes) and still produce a high yield. This helped bring the Green Revolution to India. We do not know how many fruits, flowers, grains, and plants are being experimented on, and how many new varieties have been created. This is being done in our country too, however, only at the laboratory research level on some special kind of pulses and some varieties of corn in Shimla. It is not being done at national level. Why are these foreigners taking so much interest in our natural resources? Why are they inviting our senior scientists working in this field to accept high positions there and having them say their say? Why are they collecting seeds of our fruits, flowers, and grains? For example, of the hundreds of varieties of mango, only about 50 are left now, and from among these only five or six varieties are recommended for growing. A time will come when we will have only five or six kinds of mangoes in our groves, and the remaining will disappear as we are not saving these trees or their seeds. In this situation, we will have to beg these multinational companies, and pay them their asking price to use their patented hybrid variety. They are asking for ownership of patents in the Dunkel proposal. The same is true about their grain seeds that have already reached our farmers. It is an excessive burden on the farmers to ask them to protect the seeds until sowing time so that they are not changed. It is important to mention here that the scientific expertise required for producing hybrid varieties is beyond the farmers. It is the government's responsibility to produce such seeds in "seed institutions" and make those available to the farmers through seeds distribution centers. The seeds stored with the farmers will not be protected even under ideal conditions, and these will not produce a good harvest. The farmers will be attracted to those hybrid varieties that give higher yield. It does not matter to them whether these are produced by Pioneer Seed company or one of the dozen foreign companies that have established themselves in India during the last five or six years. There is a biotechnical department at the ICAR in India. In addition, the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources has been established. Seeds of all varieties of traditional indigenous plants are stored here and will be kept for 30-40 years. However, only two or three kilograms of these seeds are stored. If we need to produce new seeds from them, it would take 10 years to produce them in large quantities for the farmers. Commerce Minister Prabanab Mukherji's statement that a law to keep seeds until the next harvest will be passed to remove the doubts about the Dunkel Draft is nothing more than hog wash. Scientists select the best available seeds when they want to produce high yield seeds of any kind. From patent seeds they get one male and one female seed and cross them to experiment with different possible combinations. It takes a scientist about five or six years to finish this process. These seeds are not stored in large quantities in major storages. This will force us to depend on foreign exotic seeds again and their patent laws will prove a major hinderance to us. Because of the lack of a proper long-range agricultural policy, we will become slaves in our own country. The package deal included in the Dunkel draft has this provision in it. Now, they do not have to send an army to defeat a nation, our stomachs will be controlled using this strategy. The patent laws in India were for the process and not for the product, however, now under Dunkel the patent law will effect every technological product. For example, if a company gets the patent right over any lifeform, everything related will belong to it. In this way, developed countries will slowly entrap the developing and backward countries so well that we cannot even think about it. The Dunkel draft also proposes patenting not only all varieties of trees and plants but also micro organisms. Now we know why the foreign researchers have been collecting plants and herbs from our jungles and conducting research on them for many years. This was a well planned strategy which has emerged in the form of the Dunkel draft. Great Britain says that the Gatt agreement will result in trade worth 230 million, which seems to be true. Gatt, with its 107 member countries, will help open new channels of trade in India. It will help exchange of technology, increase employment opportunities, and provide rules and regulations for mutual trade. However, other nations are playing the game of giving with one hand and cutting our other hand by offering this package deal under Dunkel, and our scientists, politicians, and the government is quiet about it. The Dunkel draft will be signed as an agreement in Brussels on 15 December. It is important that we make necessary changes in the patent laws so these work for us and present the draft to the people. The developed countries have used up most of their natural resources, and their eyes are on our virgin land now.
