FR940325-2-00201 FR940325-2-00093 4. The Directors/Trustees of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder servicing plan expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only distribution or servicing expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of one class of shares will be used to support the rule 12b&hyph;1 fee or servicing fee charged to shareholders of such class of shares. Expenditures not related to the sales or servicing of a specific class of shares will not be presented to the Directors/Trustees to support rule 12b&hyph;1 fees or service fees charged to shareholders of such class of shares. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent Directors/Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 5. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that costs and distributions fees associated with any 12b&hyph;1 Plan or shareholder servicing plan relating to a particular class will be borne exclusively by such class and except that any incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to such class which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order will be borne exclusively by such class. 6. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of certain classes and the proper allocation of income and expenses between those classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert''). The Expert has rendered a report to applicants (which has been provided to the staff of the SEC) stating that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``Special Purpose'' report on the ``Design of a System'' as defined and described in SAS No. 44 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), and the ongoing reports will be ``Reports on Policies and Procedures Placed in Operation and Tests of Operating Effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 7. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of income and expenses among such classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in Condition 6 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in Condition 6 above. Applicants agree to take immediate corrective action if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing reports. 8. The prospectuses of the Funds will contain a statement to the effect that a financial consultant and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to one particular sales arrangement for a class of shares over another arrangement for a class of shares in the Fund.
