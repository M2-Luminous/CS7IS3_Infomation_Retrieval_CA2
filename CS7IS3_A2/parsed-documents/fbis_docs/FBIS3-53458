He told MENA that this obstruction was very clear in the Israeli statements before and during the meeting. He believes that this might have been due to the fact that the Israelis are waiting for the outcome of the al-Asad-Clinton summit meeting, or probably because the Palestinians refused to accept the Cairo document as a pure agreement, as the Israelis wanted it to be. The Palestinian official noted that the Labor Party is pursuing the same policy and approach that Likud formerly used. I believe that we can overcome all the difficulties if all the parties show good will, he said, adding: We are willing to do that. Sha'th said that 'Arafat dreams of a free and independent Palestine, just like everyone else. We know that this is not the right time. We agreed to and committed ourselves to negotiations to find a solution for a transitional period. This means that we know that the time is not ripe yet for an independent state, he said. The Palestinian official pointed out that the establishment of an independent state requires, first of all, an agreement on self-government in Gaza and Jericho, then in the entire West Bank. After that there can be negotiations concerning the independent state, he said. Dr. Sha'th accused the Israeli negotiating delegation of demonstrating hypersensitivity concerning what they view as a symbol of sovereignty. He affirmed that the Palestinian side does not seek to establish an independent Palestinian state at present but that the Israeli side sometimes takes an exaggerated view of the symbols of sovereignty and even the symbols of the Palestinian national identity, which the Palestinian people insist on establishing. As an example, he recalled that Palestinians used to be jailed for hoisting the Palestinian flag. In his remarks, Sha'th pointed out that the Israelis do not want the Palestinian authority to have its own postal stamps because they take this as a symbol of sovereignty. Postal stamps might represent some form of identity, but it is not an instrument of sovereignty, he said. He added that Israel does not want the Palestinian authority to have its own telephone area code or to join the International Auto Club, which Palestine was a member of until 1960. As for the Palestinian currency, Sha'th explained that this issue was discussed by the Palestinian-Israeli committee in Paris. He noted that Scotland has its own currency even though it is not independent of the United Kingdom. Sha'th emphasized that the Palestinian people deserve to have a national identity and to look forward to obtaining their right to freedom, independence, and equality. Sha'th spoke about the first week of the current round of negotiations in Taba, which is scheduled to resume on Monday. He said: There were two battles during the first week of negotiations. The first was over whether or not there was a Cairo agreement and who had backed down from it. The second was over what the Israeli side had leaked regarding reaching an agreement with us on Jericho. It was a pure fabrication and they had to deny the same reports that they themselves had leaked. He added: We succeeded in making them announce that there was no document called the Cairo agreement, but rather a Cairo understanding. He added: The fact is that six different versions were written outlining what conclusions the Cairo talks had reached. One version contained seven reservations expressed by president 'Arafat and another included the reservations of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Turning to next week's negotiations, the head of the Palestinian negotiating delegation noted that he had agreed with his Israeli counterpart Major General Amnon Shahaq to start the negotiations on Monday with a discussion of the structure of the final agreement as the first item on the agenda. He added: We will meet in three committees. The civilian committee, which envisages concluding its work next week; the general drafting committee; and the security committee. He noted that the only items on the agenda of the civilian committee are archaeology, water, urban planning, and land registration, both the state land and the land of absentees [al-gha'ibin]. He noted that a problem arose within the civilian committee when Jamil al-Tarifi, head of the Palestinian delegation to the committee, objected to ending the discussion of civil registration in Gaza without discussing Jericho, which is part of the West Bank. It was agreed in this respect that when the negotiations on the West Bank start in the second stage, these three items [not further specified] will be added and an agreement will be signed, he added, noting that the Israelis wanted to separate the records of the Jericho area from those of the West Bank. Sha'th pointed out that concerning the general agreement, there are two versions: One Israeli and one Palestinian. He added: We have to look at them once again to come up with a joint document. Sha'th added that the coordination measures had also been agreed upon. He noted that the Israeli side proposed a draft structure for coordination called the Higher Coordination Body, which appeared to parallel the Palestinian National Authority and which was to be divided into two subcommittees, one for Gaza and the other for Jericho. He added: The Palestinians managed to abrogate this body and only keep a liaison committee affiliated to the Palestinian National Authority -- similar to the liaison officers present at embassies for instance -- to resolve the problems that may arise between Palestinians and Israelis. Asked what progress the security committee has made, Dr. Sha'th replied that difficulties persist. We have not made any progress because of the Israeli concept of security, he said. He remarked that the current negotiations represent a conflict between more Palestinian independence, freedom, and dignity on the one hand and Israel's eternal struggle for security. Dr. Sha'th noted some progress concerning Gaza's security. The Israeli side presented to us a new map under which they give us back 8 square kilometers of land belonging to the Palestinians, in addition to 2.5 sq km of the Palestinian lands they had seized to build settlements and 3 sq km of Gush Qatif in southern Gaza, he said. He added that a further 4 sq km on the border with Egypt are expected to be returned as well. We have not obtained the latest map yet, he remarked. Dr. Sha'th talked about the linking roads that will cross Gaza to connect the settlements to the main road to Israel. He noted that the two sides had agreed to set up joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols along these roads. He explained that Israel wanted to establish five military bases along this main road, in addition to seven fixed checkpoints to protect it. In general, Dr. Sha'th stated that progress has been made concerning Gaza. He explained that the major points of disagreement right now are concentrated in the area of Jericho. All we have gotten in the whole area so far are 57 square kilometers, he said. The Palestinian official noted that Jericho is regarded as part of the Old Israeli Alon plan, which the Israelis have not relinquished. He explained that the plan covered the city of Jerusalem and the surrounding settlements. It involved the establishment of settlements along the borders with Jordan, in what the Israelis call the defense line of their security zone on the East Bank to defend against Jordan and Iraq. He remarked that Jericho is included in that zone. He added that the Israelis ultimately want to keep Jerusalem, the Red Sea coast, and the Jordan River. Sha'th said that the demands presented by president 'Arafat involved the Lido coastal area on the Dead Sea, the al-Maghtas area on the Jordan River, al-Qantal mountain, and al-Nabi Musa. He added: We have secured a passage linking Jericho, al-'Awjah, 'Aqabat Jabr Camp, 'Ayn al-Sultan Camp, al-Duyuk village, al-Qarantal hill, and Musa al-'Alami farm. He emphasized that the Palestinian negotiator will attempt to achieve three objectives that Egypt tried to achieve during the Camp David negotiations. He said that during those negotiations Egypt did not agree to leave one inch of its territory under Israeli occupation, did not agree for a single Israeli settler to remain after the Israeli withdrawal, and did not accept Israeli economic hegemony in the name of normalization. We, as Palestinian negotiators, must adhere to these three objectives, he said.
