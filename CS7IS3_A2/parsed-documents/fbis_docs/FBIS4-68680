Lately KOMMERSANT experts have been predicting a sharp increase in the activeness of local authorities in seeking various options for getting out of the economic crisis. In this connection, the question of the powers of local political elites will be raised anew. This past weekend Chuvashia, where the local press published the theses of a "Program of Popular Reform," made itself known. Interest in the program has to do with the identity of the consultants who took part in drafting it. In addition to the president's economic advisers, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov and Sergey Glazyev, head of the parliamentary Committee on Economic Policy, as well as Viktor Kisin, the former minister of industry in Ivan Silayev's government (and now Chuvashia's representative to Russia's highest bodies of state administration), the program was prepared by specialists from the Russian government's Center for Informational and Social Technologies (its director Yevgeniy Saburov became the "main reformer" in Crimea's government), and the Export-Import Bank, which is the Chuvash government's financial agent. Noting the complexity of the republic's socioeconomic situation, Nikolay Fedorov (former minister of justice in the governments of Ivan Silayev and Yegor Gaydar) wrote an item in the press on behalf of the authors and attributed this complexity not only to reasons that are typical of Russia--inflation, the decline in production, the shortage of working capital--but also to distinctive features of Chuvashia that have deepened its economic crisis. Among these he included the lack of a clearly defined economic specialization, a sizeable proportion of production facilities that are subject to defense-industry conversion, a labor surplus, agrarian overpopulation, the high unit-cost of production, and the underdevelopment of the market infrastructure. Fedorov defined his objective somewhat uniquely: "The coming years will be years of gathering money in order that afterwards there will really be something to give out." Many people believe that hidden behind these words lies an announcement of the introduction of a regime of strict economy in the republic. The financial creed of the Chuvash government has been announced more candidly: "Not to give in to pressure from the people that is irresponsible in terms of the future." As for relations with Moscow, Fedorov did not show any particular originality in noting the need to renovate them, which was supposed to have been provided for in the treaty with Russia on the delimitation of powers and subjects of jurisdiction. Implementation of the program will be carried out on the basis of individual subprograms. In particular, there is a proposal for joint actions among Russia's republics and the CIS countries to establish an international bank and clearing system, as well as several joint concerns in the form of financial and industrial groups. In addition, it is planned to establish, on the basis of Chuvashia's enterprises, five or six model concerns that will be assigned the role of being the locomotive of a fundamentally new economic system in the republic--"an industrial-agrarian type in combination with small and medium-sized private enterprises." The partners of participants in this program will be determined through international, federal and republic investment competitions. An incentive for successful implementation of the idea will be the condition that after two or three years of effective work a firm's original property and newly created property, including land, will be transferred to collective or private ownership. Touching on issues of privatization, Fedorov expressed a rather populistic support for making active adjustments in it: "We cannot be pleased by a practice of privatization as the result of which we get, in place of monopolistic prices, supermonopolistic prices; instead of an increase in the efficiency of production, a decline or total collapse of production; and instead of an increase in budget revenues, a drastic decrease in revenues." As a matter of fact, the "privatization" part of the program is limited to that. It is interesting that, against a backdrop of rather liberal statements, the program declares that, under the conditions of a republic that is small in terms of land, private farming is not promising: reliance is being placed on well-organized collective farms. Thus, through the example of Chuvashia, we can see the vanity of any attempts to smash the colossus of the agrarian lobby, which opposes the least disturbance of the status quo in land relations.
