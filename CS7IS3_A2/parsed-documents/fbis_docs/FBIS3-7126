But they want to be represented at the talks by their leader Aung San Suu Kyi who has been under house arrest since shortly after her National League for Democracy's land-slide election victory in 1989. But A Burmese student source said the statement was issued following the F88's brainstorm meeting from March 18 to 21 at a border area opposite Mae Hong Son province. However, leaders of dissident ethnic minority groups, including Gen Bo Mya of the Karen National Union, did not take part in the meeting. But The F88 comprises the All Burmese Students Democratic Front, the Government in Exile and monks taking refuge in Karen National Union's zones. But The statement said the group wants to hold talks with the military government on political issues brought up previously by Suu Kyi and they want her to lead opposition groups in the talks.

[sentence as published] But The group said ethnic minorities were forced into ceasefire negotiations by Burma's neighbours add Asean. But They also accused China of helping the junta maintain its grip on powers by providing the junta with political, economic and military support. But The statement also blasted the military junta's failure to tackle the country's economic woes and accused the junta of working solely for vested interest groups and its own survival in power. But "After all, the country is still plagued with economic recession, inflation and high prices," it said. But The F88 statement came a day after the National Convention to draft a new constitution was convened in Rangoon. The convention was initiated a year ago. The military junta says the promulgation of a new constitution is conditional to its handing over to a civilian government. But The opening day of the plenary session on Wednesday was confined to papers put up by the minorities' representative syndicate, a group which represents the country's ethnic groups. But Among 14 representatives of minority groups to speak during the session, a representative from Chin State, U Kan Yin, demanded Burma be declared a federal state. But He said state power should come from the people and ethnic minorities should receive equal treatment to the Burmans, the country's majority. But Gyaw Pan Tha of Arakan state demanded self administration for those ethnic minorities who have no states or divisions of their own. These included the Naga, Pa-O, Palaung, Kokan, Alkar, Kayar and Wa minorities. But The Kokangs, Was, and Pa-Os, who live in Shan State bordering China, and the Nagas in the Sagaing Division bordering India, were among the groups which claimed they met criteria for self administration. But The convention is intended to spark "national reconciliation" among Burma's various races and create a power-sharing role for the military which has been in power for the last five years. But The convention has already adopted 104 "fundamental principles," including provisions entitling ethnic minorities to their own language, literature and culture and to "self-administered areas, zones and divisions", if their numbers are judged to be adequate.
