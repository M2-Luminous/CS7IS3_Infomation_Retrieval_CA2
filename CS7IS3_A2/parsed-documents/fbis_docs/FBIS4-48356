In the announcement in Lilongwe, the committee said 22 of the cases were reported to police for prosecution. It said the police, on their own, also prosecuted cases of a similar nature. The announcement said the cases involved, among other things, the disruption of campaign meetings, assault, intimidation, incitement, and use of abusive and inflammatory language. The committee said two offenders have already paid fines, one was still at large, and another one was fined and could have served a three-month prison term. The announcement said the rest of the cases are either in court or investigations are still under way. The electoral commission has since engaged private lawyers who are following some of the cases involving violence and intimidation and vote registration irregularities.
