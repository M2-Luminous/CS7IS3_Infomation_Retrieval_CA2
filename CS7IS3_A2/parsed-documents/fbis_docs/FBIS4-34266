Menem also indicated that he "absolutely" was not bothered by the demonstration, called the Federal March to Plaza de Mayo, announced by state unions in the interior of the country, as long as they do not "create any kind of disturbances." The president made these remarks upon arriving at the Metropolitan Airport from Colombia just before 0800.
