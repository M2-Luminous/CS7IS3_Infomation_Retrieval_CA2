FBIS3-24636 "cr00000006194001" 3 February 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-02FEB94-Ukraine Democrats Seek Unity for Election, With Limited Success SUMMARY Ukrainian democrats have been making great efforts in recent months to unite for the 27 March legislative elections, trying to avoid the fate suffered by disorganized and mutually antagonistic Russian reformers in December. As the nomination of candidates ends, however, they remain divided by personal rivalries and policy differences and have succeeded in uniting behind common candidates in only a limited number of districts. Despite all the publicity for the parties, nonparty candidates nominated by the official establishment and industrial and agricultural organizations may win the most seats, aided by the winner-take- all election system mandated by the Ukraine's election law END SUMMARY Ukrainian political parties have had ample time to organize and form alliances for the elections compared to their Russian counterparts, who had only two and a half months. On 24 September 1993 President Leonid Kravchuk signed a law passed by the Supreme Soviet setting parliamentary elections for 27 March 1994 (Holos Ukrainy, 28 September 1993) and giving candidates until late January to collect the 300 signatures necessary to register (Vidomosti Verkhovnoi Rady Ukrainy, 30 November 1993). Russian parties were required to collect and submit 100,000 signatures for registration within a little over a month after the announcement that the election would be held, and many failed to meet the 6 November deadline and were kept off the ballot. In another significant divergence, the Russian election law was designed to strengthen parties by allocating one half of the State Duma's seats on the basis of party lists, while Ukraine adopted a pure majority system and other measures apparently intended to weaken parties. The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet (in its "first reading" of the bill) on 10 November rejected proportional representation and retained the traditional system of district elections where candidates compete in a winner-take-all contest (Uryadovyy Kuryer, 13 November 1993). Moreover, the Supreme Soviet compounded the blow against parties by adding, on the second and final reading of the bill on 18 November, a provision allowing labor collectives and trade unions, as well as parties, to nominate candidates (Kyivska Pravda, 19 November 1993; Ukraina Moloda, 28 December 1993). Some trade unions decided to nominate their own candidates instead of cooperating with parties. This hurt Rukh, for example, which had counted on an alliance with some trade unions to help it win seats in Donetsk (Ukraina Moloda, 28 December 1993). Reflecting the law's devaluation of parties, when registration ended in late January, 1,768 candidates had been nominated by labor collectives versus only 707 by parties (UNIAN, 2 February). (Apparently some party affiliated candidates have been nominated by "labor collectives" or "groups of electors," meaning that there really are more than 707 party candidates. A 28 January Kyivska Pravda article on candidate registration in Kiev Oblast said that parties nominated 12 of their members locally but that in all, 46 party-affiliated candidates were running.) In another contrast to the Russian election law, the Ukrainian law requires candidates to win a majority of votes cast (Vidomosti Verkhovnoi Rady Ukrainy, 30 November 1993). Russian law requires only a plurality. With 6,565 candidates running for 450 seats (UNIAN, 2 February), many races will require runoffs, as in the 1990 parliamentary election. The Ukrainian law orders runoffs held within two weeks after the first round, giving parties a short time to work out alliances for the runoff round. Democrats Sign an Agreement To avoid fragmenting their vote and thus risking elimination of their candidates on the first round, democratic parties have been striving to form blocs and set up structures to facilitate cooperation. The Supreme Soviet's rejection of proportional representation spurred this movement further, since small parties have little chance of winning any seats under the majority, winner-take-all system. Democratic parties took an important step toward unity in mid-October when 18 parties and organizations issued a declaration calling for cooperation in the election. Although recognizing that "creation of a single electoral bloc of democratic parties and organizations to nominate a single bloc candidate in each electoral district is in practice impossible today," the parties agreed to "coordinate actions" by seeking to adopt a new election law providing for proportional representation or a mixed proportional representation-majority system, to agree on single candidates whenever possible, to attack only communists and not other democratic candidates, and to unite behind one democratic candidate if there are runoffs (Vecherniy Kiev, 20 October 1993). A surprisingly wide array of democratic parties, including some that are usually mutually hostile, signed the declaration. Signers included Vyacheslav Chornovil's anti-Kravchuk Rukh; the pro-Kravchuk, anti-Chornovil Democratic Party of Ukraine (DemPU) and Ukrainian Republican Party (URP); and the less nationalistic, pro-reform, anti-Kravchuk New Ukraine and Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine (PDVU); and even one of the rightwing parties on the fringe of the democratic classification--the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists (KUN). Of the democratic parties, only the anti-Chornovil National Rukh of Ukraine (VNRU), whose leader, Larysa Skoryk, opposed coordination and insisted that there be a choice of democratic candidates (Post-Postup, 30 December-5 January), Anatoliy Matviyenko's centrist Labor Congress of Ukraine (TKU), Ihor Markulov's Donetsk-based pro-business Liberal Party of Ukraine, and Vladimir Zolotarev's pro-economic reform Constitutional Democrats did not sign. Not surprisingly, most ultranationalists (the Ukrainian National Assembly, National Conservative Party, and Stepan Khmara's Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party), and, of course, the Communist Party of Ukraine (KPU) and parties close to it--the Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU), Party of Labor, United Social Democratic Party, Peasant Party of Ukraine (SelPU), Peasant Union of Ukraine, and the Civil Congress--did not join. Weak Coordinating Structures The agreement's signers set up a coordinating structure but the structures were too weak to prevent parties from going their own ways. The signatories--joined by the centrist Labor Congress (TKU)--on 11 November met to discuss creating a coordinating committee for the election but all they could agree on was to establish a procedure for party leaders to consult with each other on a weekly basis--a "Permanent Conference of Democratic Parties and Organizations of Ukraine" (UNIAN, 12 November 1993; Kievskiye Vedomosti, 16 November 1993). Later they agreed to create a "Center for Promoting Ukraine's Democracy and Statehood," with former Rukh Chairman Ivan Drach, former URP Chairman Levko Lukyanenko, and Chornovil supporter Serhiy Odarych as co-chairmen (Holos Ukrainy, 11 December 1993). Eventually 40 organizations joined, including various groups of businessmen and entrepreneurs such as economic reformer Volodymyr Lanvoyy and the All-Ukrainian Association of Private Owners, which he recently founded, according to Lukyanenko (Molod Ukrainy, 11 January). In the meantime, the PDVU and Party of Greens reportedly backed out, apparently feeling that the URP was using the center for its own benefit (UNIAN weekly "Views, Commentaries, Forecasts," 30 December 1993). The organization, by then referred to as the All-Ukrainian Electoral Committee of the Democratic Association bloc, met in early January to coordinate lists of candidates from member-parties (UNIAR, 4 January). Democratic Blocs The parties that signed the mid-October declaration were unable to form a single, unified democratic bloc. Instead, three main election blocs emerged, based on existing movements--Rukh, the Congress of National Democratic Forces (KNDS), and New Ukraine. Weakness and divisions within New Ukraine prompted its leaders to form additional blocs, some with overlapping membership, to replace or supplement New Ukraine. --Election 94 On 24 October Rukh passed a resolution calling for "centrist democratic" parties to unite against the communists, the "party of power" (i.e., Kravchuk and other government officials), and "right radicals" by creating an election bloc called the "Association of Democratic Forces 'Election 94'" with oblast and election district branches (Vecherniy Kiev, 27 October 1993). Rukh, led by Chornovil, is largely based in the west Ukraine. It is nationalistic but stresses political and economic reform more than many other nationalist organizations, and it opposes Kravchuk. --Congress of National Democratic Forces (KNDS) Formed as a coalition in August 1992 by the anti-Chornovil national democrats (mainly the URP and DemPU), KNDS backs Kravchuk and puts protection of Ukrainian independence above political and economic reform. KNDS parties met on 3 November and scheduled a 19 December congress, which converted the coalition into an election bloc and adopted an election platform (UNIAN, 4 November 1993; UNIAR, 19 December 1993). --New Ukraine The parties belonging to New Ukraine--an alliance of economic reformers based mostly in the russified east Ukraine and cool both to Ukrainian nationalism and Kravchuk--also set out to form an election bloc, but New Ukraine has been badly divided and weakened. The Social Democratic Party of Ukraine quit New Ukraine in September (Holos Ukrainy, 21 September 1993), and the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine (PDVU), one of the biggest parties in New Ukraine and, according to PDVU leader Taras Stetskiv, "the glue that keeps New Ukraine together" (Post- Postup, 16-22 December 1993), began debating whether to remain in the bloc (Ukraina Moloda, 22 October 1993; Post-Postup, 16-22 December 1993). At New Ukraine's December congress, bloc leader Volodymyr Hrynyov pointed to the defeat of Arkadiy Volskiy's Civic Union in the Russian parliamentary election and warned that New Ukraine could realistically expect to win only 20 seats in new parliament (Demokratychna Ukraina, 25 December 1993). As a result, New Ukraine leaders began forming new blocs to use in the election instead of or in addition to New Ukraine. New Ukraine's Affiliates In an attempt to broaden and strengthen New Ukraine's base, Hrynyov, PDVU Chairman Volodymyr Filenko, and others decided to set up a new bloc for the election, the "Democratic Center" (Post-Postup, 16-22 December 1993). Filenko explained that "when it became obvious that New Ukraine was unprepared for the elections, we decided to establish the Democratic Center, which should become a new bloc of New Ukraine and PDVU" (Post-Postup, 16-22 December 1993). The announcement of the creation of the Democratic Center on 9 November was signed by 60 people from various parties, including Filenko, Supreme Soviet member Taras Stetskiv, Minister for Nationalities and Migration 0leksandr Yemets, and sociologist Volodymyr Khmelko from the PDVU, DemPU Chairman Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, and Labor Congress of Ukraine head Anatoliy Matviyenko. Reflecting the eastern and New Ukraine origins of the Democratic Center, the signers included several non-nationalistic Kharkivites (Hrynyov, Filenko, and Kharkiv Mayor Yevhen Kushnaryov). But the new organization also brought in Lviv activists such as former Deputy Premier and Economy Minister Viktor Pynzenyk, PDVU leader Stetskiv, and Supreme Soviet member Ihor Hryniv (Holos Ukrainy, 29 December 1993). Proclaiming a "centrist position," the Democratic Center platform stressed economic reform and largely ignored nationalist themes. Diverging from national democrats' stress on Ukrainian statehood and independence, the platform, while condemning any "renewal of the USSR," declared that "calls for immediate withdrawal from the CIS do not consider harsh economic realities" (Holos Ukrainy, 29 December 1993). The organizers did not invite Chornovil to join (Khreshchatyk, 3 December 1993), and neither Rukh or URP joined (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 20 November 1993). Chornovil for his part said the new conference of democratic parties created in November had no intention of merging with the Democratic Center (UNIAN, 12 November 1993). Members of the Democratic Center group from Lviv--Stetskiv, Pynzenyk, and Hryniv--joined with other Lviv politicians such as former First Deputy Premier Ihor Yukhnovskyy, Supreme Soviet member Mykhaylo Kosiv, and some other members of Rukh and the URP to form a similar election coalition in their locality called "New Wave" (Nova Khvylya) (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 20 November 1993; UNIAN, 30 November 1993; Ukraina Moloda, 30 November 1993; Kiev Radio, 23 December 1993). New Wave became a major factor in Lviv, nominating some of the most prominent Lviv figures on its ticket--Yukhnovskyy, Pynzenyk, and Hryniv (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 12 January). Rukh in effect also supported these three by not running candidates against them (Vysokyy Zamok, 4 January). In addition to creating the Democratic Center, in early December New Ukraine Chairman Hrynyov joined with former Premier Leonid Kuchma to form an "Interregional Bloc for Reforms" (MBR). (Hrynyov's forming of a bloc with Kuchma brought criticism from Filenko and Stetskiv (Khreshchatyk, 18 January) and questions about how he can simultaneously lead three blocs, but Hrynyov pledged to press ahead with all three (Post-Postup, 16-22 December 1993).) Presenting themselves as an alternative to Kravchuk and the nationalists, Hrynyov and Kuchma declared that they had quit their posts of Supreme Soviet deputy chairman and premier because the government and Supreme Soviet were blocking reasonable economic policies (Nezavisimost, 10 December 1993). They proclaimed support for reform, regional rights, and closer partnership between Russia and Ukraine (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 8 December 1993; Izvestiya, 17 December 1993). This alliance of two of Ukraine's most prominent politicians, both popular in the heavily populated east Ukraine, raised a potentially powerful new force in the parliamentary elections and a significant threat to Kravchuk in the coming presidential elections, where either Hrynyov or Kuchma may run. Hrynyov and Kuchma predicted their bloc could win 30-35 percent of the votes (Izvestiya, 17 December 1993). Kuchma has strong support among industrialists and was elected president of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (Ukrainskyy Soyuz Promyslovtsiv i Pidpryyemtsiv--USPP) at its December congress (Demokratychna Ukraina, 11 December 1993). Hrynyov was already choosing candidates for the Supreme Soviet in his native Kharkiv and neighboring Dnipropetrovsk and has strong support in business and industry in the south as well as the east, according to a 16- 22 December Post-Postup article. The Labor Congress of Ukraine (TKU) in December set up another bloc, "Solidarity for Wellbeing and Progress," which is apparently favorable to Kuchma, as is the TKU itself, whose Dnipropetrovsk branch has nominated Kuchma for parliament (Kiev radio, 14 January). This bloc is also aimed at business and non- nationalistic centrists with the objective of proposing "new approaches to social policy" and their own approach to market reform (Ukraina Moloda, 1 January). The organizations joining the Solidarity bloc--the Union of Leasers and Small Enterprises, All-Ukrainian Association of Entrepreneurs, trade unions for air line workers and geologists, and several other small organizations--appeared similar to the ones that formed the TKU itself in April 1993, suggesting that the bloc is simply a new form of the TKU. Like the TKU, the new bloc is centrist and stresses private ownership and cooperation with Russia (Kiev radio, 14 January). Competition for Hrynyov and Kuchma A group of businessmen and managers, the same constituency looked to by Kuchma and Hrynyov, spurred the creation of a potential rival bloc, "Hromada," at about the same time as Kuchma and Hrynyov formed their bloc. In contrast to the Kuchma-Hrynyov bloc, Hromada appears more favorable to Kravchuk. A founding congress of the "All-Ukrainian Association 'Society'" (Hromada or VOH) was held on 8 December, attended by a number of bankers and entrepreneurs (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 8 December; Segodnya, 15 December 1993) and uniting, in the words of delegates, "former middle level Soviet economic nomenklatura" who have invested their capital in industry, "have something to lose," and want a party to represent their interests (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 11 December 1993). According to the 11 December Nezavisimaya Gazeta, the bloc was organized by Oleksandr Turchynov and Serhiy Lylyk, former Kuchma advisers. They were named councillors to Premier Kuchma in June (Uryadovyy Kuryer, 8 June, 24 June 1993) but left the government in December (Uryadovyy Kuryer, 23 December 1993), following Kuchma's September resignation. Lylyk also was vice president of the Confederation of Enterprise Organizations "Ukraine-West" and one of New Ukraine's leaders (Holos Ukrainy, 30 June 1992). According to Turchynov, however, Hromada has "nothing in common" with the Kuchma-Hrynyov bloc (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 11 December 1993). Although Turchynov, according to the 11 December Nezavisimaya Gazeta, stressed that Hromada is in opposition to the government, the 8 December Demokratychna Ukraina reported that he said the bloc would support Kravchuk. Further suggesting ties between Hromada and the government, the 15 December Segodnya reported that the government had paid the rent for the hall where the bloc met. Leftists Attempt to Unite Communist and socialist oriented parties have attempted to form a united bloc for the elections but have succeeded in coordinating their activities only in some regions. Communist Party (KPU) First Secretary Petro Symonenko at a 12 October press conference said his party may establish an election bloc with the Socialists (SPU), Peasant Party of Ukraine (SelPU), and Party of Social Justice and perhaps in the future with the Party of Labor (Post- Postup, 13 October 1993). At the December SPU congress, the SPU, KPU, and SelPU signed a statement of intent to cooperate (Khreshchatyk, 28 December 1993), but the SPU and KPU clashed over nominations and the SPU decided to avoid any national coalition (Khreshchatyk, 11 January 1994). The two parties have been able to unite only in some regions (Segodnya, 15 December 1993). In Odessa, 14 communist and allied leftist organizations formed a coordinating council, but the council split over some candidates (UNIAN, 10 January). KPU Deputy Chairman Yevhen Marmazov declared that his party will not form a bloc with anyone, "but all of us--the Socialist, Communist, and Peasant Parties--will assist each other" (Post-Postup, 30 December-5 January). Little Cooperation Among Ultranationalists Ultranationalists have not appeared to make great attempts to form blocs with like-minded extremists, even in the nationalist center of Lviv. Stepan Khmara's Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party (UKRP) nominated 9 candidates in Lviv's 23 districts. UKRP backed some candidates of the ultranationalist Ukrainian National Assembly (including UNA Chairman Yuriy Shukhevych), one Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists (KUN) candidate, Irina Kalinets, and one Rukh candidate, Dmitriy Chobit, for other Lviv seats (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 5 January; Vysokyy Zamok, 6 January). Pravda Ukrainy on 6 January reported that KUN had declared its intention of running candidates for all seats, backing away from forming joint lists with Rukh and other democratic parties. (KUN, unlike other ultranationalist parties, had signed the October agreement to coordinate with democratic parties.) KUN announced candidates for 15 of Lviv's 23 districts, although it did back 3 candidates of other parties, including Rukh (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 January). Efforts to Coordinate Nominations As nominations of candidates began in early January, (According to the election law, nominations begin 90 days before the election (i.e., in late December) and end 60 days before the election (26 January) and candidates need to gather 300 signatures (Vidomosti, 30 November 1993).) democratic parties' efforts to coordinate, beset by much friction, appeared to succeed in at least some cases, even though parties announced their slates of candidates for most seats. No national alliances have been formed and various parties and blocs have united behind some candidates in various districts, producing a variety of combinations and suggesting that the result will be a kaleidoscope of multiple party labels. Rukh, as the largest democratic party, appears torn between trying to field its own candidates in all districts and trying to cooperate with its rivals in the URP and DemPU. At an early January session of the democratic parties' committee to coordinate lists of candidates, chaired by Chornovil rival Lukyanenko, Rukh was accused of violating agreements to coordinate by running its own slates in some areas, especially Kharkiv. Rukh's Ivan Zayets justified Rukh's actions on grounds that other parties were too slow in deciding where to nominate candidates (UNIAR, 4 January). According to another account, Lukyanenko complained that in Kherson 23 democratic organizations had united in a bloc but Rukh stayed out and he accused Rukh of intending to nominate candidates in all 450 Ukrainian districts. Rukh representatives responded that in Kherson the democratic organizations had united in support of Kravchuk and the local state administration--a position Rukh could not accept (Molod Ukrainy, 11 January). Nevertheless, Rukh has apparently taken a number of steps to coordinate, agreeing to support a candidate from another party in some districts. Rukh leader Les Tanyuk dropped out of a race in a Kiev district to give a clear field to a URP candidate and was nominated by Rukh for a Lviv seat, even though he is from Kiev (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 January). Lviv Rukh Chairman Yuriy Klyuchkovskiy said at the Lviv Rukh conference that Rukh had made concessions to other parties, especially the URP, by not running candidates in 5 districts, citing as an example Rukh's not fielding a candidate against Lviv URP Chairman Oleh Pavlyshyn. But, he complained, URP had not responded in kind and had gone ahead and run a candidate against Lviv Rukh Chairman Klyuchkovskyy in his district (Vysokyy Zamok, 4 January). The Rukh conference had had to fight to block one of its members, a member of the present Supreme Soviet, from running againt Pavlyshyn (Vysokyy Zamok, Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 January). Rukh also ran no candidates against New Wave's Pynzenyk and Ihor Hryniv, nominated New Wave's Yukhnovskyy on the Rukh ticket (Vysokyy Zamok, 11 January), and ran no one against URP Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn (Vysokyy Zamok, 4, 13 January). At the same time, however, Rukh ran candidates for Lviv's other 18 districts (Vysokyy Zamok, 4 January). Regional Variances The success of coordination varies widely across Ukraine. Democrats are having some success in uniting in Lviv, but their foes seem more successful in forming blocs in Kharkiv, while Donetsk appears to be a general free-for-all. --Lviv The national democratic parties are having some success in coordinating in Lviv, although they are likely to win all seats in this nationalistic center anyway, as they did in the 1990 parliamentary election. Rukh, URP, New Wave, and possibly some ultranationalist candidates appear likely to split up the Lviv seats, in part by cooperating and in part by open competition. After "tough negotiations" among democratic parties in Lviv's "political consultative council," according to the 28 December Vysokyy Zamok, agreement was reached on common candidates in several districts, mainly between Rukh and URP--for example, for wellknown candidates Yukhnovskyy, Pynzenyk, URP Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn, and Lviv Oblast Soviet Chairman Mykola Horyn. New Wave's Yukhnovskyy has the backing of Rukh and the Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party, as well as his own party, and URP Chairman Horyn has the backing of the Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party and no opposition from Rukh. Serhiy Plachynda's Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party announced 6 candidates in Lviv but also announced it would back New Wave's Yukhnovskyy, URP's Horyn, Rukh's Yaroslav Kendzior and Mykhaylo Kosiv, and UKRP's Stepan Khmara (Vysokyy Zamok, 18 January). Although the Lviv Rukh and URP conferences chose slates of candidates covering most districts, their leaders indicated that the two parties may later alter these slates to further reduce mutual competition (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 4 January). --Kharkiv Parties have formed several blocs in Kharkiv, according to a 2-8 December 1993 Post-Postup analysis. The Communists (KPU) and Socialists (SPU) have formed an election bloc. The Civil Congress and Party of Labor have formed a rival bloc, which professes to be anti-communist and pro-market, but all four parties have roughly similar views on other issues, are financed by the official trade unions and Kharkiv Scientific- Industrial Union, and occasionally cooperate. Thus, the SPU, KPU, and Party of Labor combined to back at least one candidate, Viktor Chub, socialist head of the Kharkiv Union of Trade Unions. The Social Democratic Party (SDPU), Liberal Democratic Party, Christian Democrats, DemPU, and URP have formed a "Justice" bloc, but this is quite weak, according to Post-Postup. (Later, the Liberal Democratic Party withdrew from the Justice bloc because a plank on federalism was dropped from the bloc's platform, according to UNIAR on 14 January). New Ukraine should be an important bloc in Kharkiv but has been weakened since the Social Democratic Party and most of the Liberal Democratic Party quit, leaving only the PDVU and part of the LDP in New Ukraine. Rukh has not joined any bloc in Kharkiv and has been debating whether to join with New Ukraine or with the URP and DemPU. Rukh's opportunities to form a bloc have been hurt by personal antagonism between the local URP-DemPU leaders and Rukh and by the local New Ukraine's coolness toward joining with Rukh. Another important party in Kharkiv, the Liberal Party, apparently is going it alone. --Donetsk In Donetsk, where non-nationalistic, eastern parties like the Liberal Party, KPU, and SPU are strong, there is apparently little cooperation among parties. The Party of Labor and Party of Justice were organizing a joint election bloc, as were the Civil Congress and Party of Slavic Unity, but the Liberal Party intended to run candidates in all 47 districts and the KPU also was aiming to do so (Pravda Ukrainy, 18 January). Rukh had hoped to ally with labor unions in Donetsk to help it win in local districts, but the democratic trade unions created their own bloc--the Free Trade Unions of Ukraine--to run candidates, leaving Rukh out in the cold (Ukraina Moloda, 28 December 1993).

Koval at a December congress (Holos Ukrainy, 10 December 1993). Implications By preserving key features of the pre-reform electoral system- -majority voting and nominations from unions, farms, and factories--Kravchuk and other non-party-affiliated officials, including most members of the Supreme Soviet, have significantly raised the election odds in favor of the establishment, the amorphous "party of power" that still runs most areas of Ukraine. Locally well-known, but non-party, candidates backed by the government, industrial and agricultural establishments and President Kravchuk, Supreme Soviet Chairman Ivan Plyushch, and acting Premier Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, having arranged nominations from farms or factories, will probably win more seats than party candidates, especially in rural areas where parties are little developed. The majoritarian system will-also favor large parties in areas where they are most dominant, but it will likely significantly penalize the democrats, who are more divided than the leftists. Rukh and the KNDS should run well in the west and Kiev city, and the Communists, Socialists, and the Party of Labor in the east, south, and rural areas. Competing for the same moderately pro- reform constituency in the east, the Labor Congress of Ukraine, Liberal Party, New Ukraine, the Kuchma-Hrynyov bloc, and the Democratic Center could knock each other out in the first round if they are not able to increase their cooperation. If they fail to achieve greater cooperation before the first round, democratic groups may get a second chance to cooperate between the first round and the runoffs, which will probably be necessary in many districts, but the democratic vote could be so fractionalized in some districts that no democrat survives for the runoff.
