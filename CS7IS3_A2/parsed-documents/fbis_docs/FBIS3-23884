As a people's deputy of the Russian Federation, he represented Novosibirsk Oblast in the deputy contingent which... We will not go on; one election has already passed since that time and the second one is at hand, as they say. Several journalists from Novosibirsk newspapers immediately announced their intention to run for the oblast soviet, and among them was Boris Konovalov. He tells the VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK columnist the reasons for this decision. [Kuzmenkin] Many people have called Boris Konovalov a potential candidate for deputy to the State Duma, and, incidentally, considered his chances quite good. [Konovalov] Yes, I did intend to. I had a sense of work left undone. Right now the economic projects I was working on are beginning to be realized. For example, a large Russian-German agricultural community is being built near Novosibirsk. Money was gotten out of Goskomnats [State Committee for Nationalities Policy] and in Germany for this idea. Russian refugees from Central Asia will be able to settle here, by the way. [Kuzmenkin] Is all this just plans or is it already actual work? [Konovalov] The work is already underway and the community of Goluboy Zaliv not far from Akademgorodok will be turned over by the builders this summer. What will it do for us? Jobs under conditions of rising unemployment plus the potential to supply Novosibirsk with wood products. In 1-2 years there will be a return from the project to which I devoted considerable time and effort. [Kuzmenkin] It is probably useful to recall what Deputy Konovalov did in parliament. [Konovalov] I worked on the mass information media committee, where I was involved in issues of the SMI [mass information media] economy. We tried to follow our own line, but we were pressured both from the radical democrats and from the communists and patriots who believed that the system for aiding SMI should be political in nature. Unfortunately, many projects which we prepared, the creation of tax benefits for SMI, for example, encountered a great deal of opposition--both in parliament and in the government. I do not think I have to explain why. However, to the extent we could, we tried to protect the independence of the press. In addition we worked on those legislative bills which went through the Supreme Soviet, plus routine work in the district. I held about 50 receptions and there were 50-60 people at each one. Inasmuch as a deputy cannot distribute cars or apartments, I took it as my job to restore justice, that is to say, I handled particular situations. Incidentally, in the elections to the Duma I selected "my own" district. [Kuzmenkin] But the well-known events which resulted in the division of MOLODEZHKI into two publications occurred. [Konovalov] There are various processes underway in any collective. New leaders rise and want to make themselves known and believe that they can be on top. Those people who arrived without me have now left and are quietly producing a new newspaper. The same people who know me or who worked with me continue to produce the newspaper MOLODOST SIBIRI. [Kuzmenkin] Does that mean the crisis has passed? [Konovalov] Undoubtedly. Our newspaper is already 70 years old, and it has seen everything in its life. I can say that because I have been working here for 13 years myself. The newspaper will live--there is no doubt of that. [Kuzmenkin] How was the return trip, from parliament to journalism? [Konovalov] I believe that journalism is a very complex thing. Although I have lived through two putsches, and the second one in direct proximity to the battle sites (a shell fell in the office next to mine in the White House--luckily I was not in my office), I still believe that the profession of journalist on energy costs is a lofty one and requires stricter organization of labor. [Kuzmenkin] Let us return to where we started: Today the name Konovalov is again listed among the other names which are candidates for deputies to the oblast soviet. The question is therefore a simple one. Why is all this necessary? [Konovalov] I again chose part of my former district, since I believe that it shows a lack of seriousness and respectability to run around to different districts in search of particular options. If you work with people, you are responsible to them. I must try to resolve the problems of those people whom I worked with as a people's deputy of the Russian Federation. Unfortunately, there are no fewer problems today. [Kuzmenkin] So the oblast soviet will be able to deal with these problems. Did I understand correctly? [Konovalov] It seems to me that the political struggle will be reduced to a minimum in the new deputy contingent; and it will regulate the socioeconomic interests of various strata of society. Of course there will also be groups of lobbyists who will begin to stand up for their professional and territorial interests. Therefore, in order to deal with the situation and make a competent decision, the oblast soviet needs independent deputies who have experience, both life experience and political experience. As for me personally, the work in the Supreme Soviet provided invaluable experience. Of course, I could have remained in Moscow and taken a high official post--I had such offers, but I believe that one has to live and work at home. I also have economic experience, so to speak. I was closely involved in the economic [nongovernmental] press on the republic scale and therefore studied banking too. And I have the experience of participating in resolving social problems: By virtue of my deputy activity, I worked on it on business trips to different oblasts of Russia and also visited a hotspot, Northern Ossetia. [Kuzmenkin] So in general, the editor in chief of MOLODOST SIBIRI is of the opinion that something can be done, right? [Konovalov] I believe that one of the basic jobs of the oblast soviet will be monitoring the administration's actions. Administrators are now running for election to the oblast soviet--they have been assigned an appropriate task. A not quite correct situation comes about, in my opinion, as in the saying about the mice the cat was guarding. Subordinates will analyze the work of their boss--it is amusing at least. Of course they will say, "We know how things stand," but that is what they are administrators for, through their activity to ensure normal life in the rayons. Deputies should not view all issues from the standpoint of the population of their districts. And it seems to me that the most important thing is organizing normal self-government. For something significant can be done only by relying on people's opinion. Yes, people now have retired into their shells. They are told that the time has come for competition and they must elbow their way through; but one cannot do that in life--mutual assistance is simply essential. So people must be helped to become aware of their interests and learn how to stand up for them.
