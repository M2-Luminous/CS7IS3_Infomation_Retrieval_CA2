FR940711-2-00037 FR940711-2-00023 Proposed Decision and Order of the Department of Energy Implementation of Special Refund Procedures Names of Firms: Western Asphalt Service, Inc., Gray Trucking Company, William Valentine & Sons, Inc. Dates of Filing: July 17, 1992; December 7, 1993; April 13, 1994. Case Numbers: LEF&hyph;0047, LEF&hyph;0120, LEF&hyph;0123. In accordance with the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the DOE filed three Petitions for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) on July 17, 1992, December 7, 1993 and April 13, 1994, respectively. The Petitions request that OHA formulate and implement procedures for the distribution of funds received pursuant to settlement agreements entered into by the DOE and Western Asphalt Service, Inc. (Western), Gray Trucking Company (Gray) and William Valentine & Sons, Inc. (Valentine). I. Background During the period of Federal petroleum price controls, Western was engaged in crude oil refining and reselling. 1 The firm was therefore subject to regulations governing the pricing of crude oil set forth at 10 C.F.R. Parts 205, 210, 211, and 212 of the Mandatory Petroleum Price and Allocation Regulations. As a result of an ERA audit of its operations, a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) was issued to Western on April 4, 1984 pursuant to 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart O (ERA Docket No. 940X00182). The PRO alleged violations of the pricing and certification rules that applied to crude oil resellers. Essentially, the firm was charged with selling price-controlled crude oil as uncontrolled stripper well crude oil at unlawfully high prices in violation of the provisions of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subpart L and 10 C.F.R. §212.131. In another enforcement proceeding, on May 7, 1981, a Notice of Probable Violation was issued to Western which alleged that the firm unlawfully received Small Refiner Bias Entitlements (ERA Docket No. N00S90197) in April and May 1977. These alleged violations of DOE crude oil regulations by Western were settled by a Consent Order between the firm and DOE on May 30, 1984. The PRO was therefore withdrawn and the NOPV was rescinded. Western agreed to remit $300,000, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in an interest-bearing escrow account. Western has complied with this obligation, remitting a total of $390,059.12 to the DOE. In return, the DOE has released Western from any liability regarding its failure to comply with the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations during the period August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981, with the sole exception of any potential violations of the Entitlements Program after September 30, 1980. 1 Western Asphalt Service, Inc., W.F. Moore and Son, Inc., and Gibson Oil and Refining Company, were all controlled by Wilfred Paige van Loben Sels during the price controls period. Textual references to ``Western'' in this Decision include all parties to the consent order. Gray was also a crude oil reseller during the period of price controls. On March 29, 1982, Gray and the DOE entered into a Consent Order whereby Gray would remit $31,500, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in an interest-bearing escrow account. The DOE agreed not to pursue its claim that, during the period March 1977 through January 1980, Gray overcharged its customers by charging unlawfully high prices for crude oil in violation of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subparts F and L. Despite its agreement with the terms of the Consent Order, Gray failed to comply fully with its financial obligations to the DOE, and remitted only $4,738.86 to the DOE. On October 15, 1985, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Amarillo Division, granted the DOE an Amended Judgment against Gray for an additional $34,625. However, the Amended Judgment has not resulted in any additional payments to DOE by Gray. ERA has petitioned that the $4,738.86, plus accrued interest, obtained from Gray be distributed by OHA in accordance with the Subpart V regulations. Valentine was engaged in crude oil reclamation during the period May 1979 through December 1980. 2 Through an unincorporated subsidiary, Big Muddy Oil Processors Inc. (Big Muddy), Valentine obtained waste crude oil from oil spills, pipeline ruptures, waste oil pits and oil tank bottoms. After numerous separation and filtering processes, the waste oil was mixed with various blending agents (naphthas, natural gasoline, natural gas by-products, etc.) and the resulting product was sold as pipeline-quality crude oil. Big Muddy, and by extension Valentine, was therefore a reseller of crude oil, subject to the provisions of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subpart L, which governed the resales of crude oil. 2 William Valentine and Sons, Inc., Valentine Construction, Inc., Dale L. Valentine, Verna Valentine, and James L. Marchant are collectively referred to as ``Valentine'' in the text. All are parties to the Settlement Agreement which resolved DOE claims against them. An ERA audit uncovered evidence that Valentine sold crude oil at unlawfully high prices during the period May 1979 through December 1980. On December 2, 1987, OHA issued a Remedial Order to Valentine directing the firm to refund $1,454,876 in overcharges, plus interest. See William Valentine and Sons, Inc., 16 DOE ¶83,025 (1987). Valentine appealed OHA's determination to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). On March 23, 1989, FERC rejected Valentine's Appeal of the Remedial Order and upheld OHA's findings. See William Valentine and Sons, Inc., 46 FERC ¶61,252 (1989). Valentine appealed that decision and, on January 24, 1990, the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming ruled that Valentine's challenge to DOE's Remedial Order and to FERC's ruling was without merit. At the same time, the Court also approved a Settlement Agreement in which Valentine agreed to remit to DOE no less than $108,739 plus interest. In return, DOE agreed to deem Valentine in full compliance with the price control program and to release all administrative and civil claims against the firm. Valentine has paid $126,402.66 into an interest-bearing DOE escrow account in compliance with the Settlement Agreement. II. Jurisdiction and Authority On July 28, 1986, the DOE issued a Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 Fed. Reg. 27899 (August 4, 1986) (The MSRP). The MSRP, issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement Agreement (the Stripper Well Agreement) in In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, M.D.L. No. 378 (D.Kan. 1986), provides that crude oil overcharge funds will be divided among the states, the federal government, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Under the MSRP, up to twenty percent of these crude oil overcharge funds will be reserved to satisfy valid claims by injured purchasers of petroleum products. Eighty percent of the funds, and any monies remaining after all valid claims are paid, are to be disbursed equally to the states and federal government for indirect restitution. Shortly after the issuance of the MSRP, the OHA issued an Order that announced its intention to apply the MSRP in all Subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations. Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 Fed. Reg. 29689 (August 20, 1986). In that Order, the OHA solicited comments concerning the appropriate procedures to follow in processing refund applications in crude oil refund proceedings. On April 6, 1987, the OHA issued a Notice analyzing the numerous comments and setting forth generalized procedures to assist claimants that file refund applications for crude oil monies under the Subpart V regulations. 52 Fed. Reg. 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April Notice).
