In his speech, Motpan said that "in the near future the Chisinau Parliament will examine the draft law on official language with a series of modifications introduced by the responsible parliamentary commission." The current law on official language was approved by Moldova's Parliament on 31 August 1989. It does not contain the term "attestation." This term was later added by the Language Department and now is perceived by non-Romanian ethnics as a scarecrow, said Dumitru Motpan. Asked about what kind of modifications were made, Motpan told BASAPRESS that first "the period for studying Romanian will be prolonged through 1996 to enable people to perform their duties." The requirement to know the language of the population in localities where officials perform their duty is valid for all leaders regardless of their nationality, stated Dumitru Motpan. The Gagauz-eri-Gagaouzia draft law stipulates that the local administration will use Gagaouzian and Russian in its office work. Correspondence with the Moldovan leadership and economic units will be made in the official language and Russian.
