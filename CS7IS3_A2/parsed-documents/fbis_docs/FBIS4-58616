After studying the notes for the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] national budget for five days, yesterday morning the Majles approved 85 budget notes. Likewise, yesterday afternoon the Majles studied the notes appended by the Majles commissions, which are presented below for our esteemed readers. Majles Speaker's Remarks 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, speaker of the Majles, gave a short speech yesterday concerning International Jerusalem Day. He said: This year we are staging the Jerusalem Day demonstration at a time when right in the blessed month of Ramazan the children of Jerusalem and our dear Muslims were slaughtered by the Zionists right beside the chaste grave of the hero of unity, Ibrahim Khalil (peace be upon him), as they were doing their prayers and prostrations. The speaker said the Jerusalem issue is not only for the nation of Palestine or the Muslim Arabs. Jerusalem belongs to all the Muslims of the world. The aggression and occupation of Jerusalem was aggression against the Muslim world. Therefore, the Muslim world must rise up to liberate sacred Jerusalem and liberate the foremost Muslim shrine from the usurper occupiers. Of course, in the beginning world imperialism, criminal America, and the Zionists tried to view this issue as pertaining only to the Arabs and the Arab-Israeli war and to set up peace between the Arabs and Israel in order to continue the occupation and stabilize the Zionist government. Then they gradually lowered the issue from an Arab-Israeli issue to one involving only the Palestinians and Israelis. Recently they have limited it even more and have confined it to the al-Fatah organization and Israel, and finally, with the signing of the peace agreement with 'Arafat, they summarized it as the solution to the issue of the occupied territories. In the same regard the Majles speaker said: I have often told these dear and great religious crusaders from the intifadah and the Islamic Jihad when they came to the Majles and we met that if, God forbid, they abandon the Palestine and Jerusalem issue one day, they must definitely know that we will not abandon it. For us the Jerusalem issue is one of aspirations and belief. Nateq-Nuri explained that to liberate sacred Jerusalem all Muslims must arise. Continuing, he said: This year especially it should have become clear to the Muslims and the governments of the other Islamic nations that the nature of the ones seeking dominion is that if you take one step back, they will take a step forward and boldly continue with their crimes. Continuing, the Majles speaker discussed the shameful Gaza-Jericho Treaty, the fact that Israel has not retreated a single step and the silence of the United Nations, the Security Council, and the supporters of human rights towards the slaughter of the Muslims of al-Khalil. He said: The Islamic and Muslim nations must adopt this as a basic thesis, acquire solidarity, and declare their anger at these terrifying crimes by attending the Jerusalem Day demonstration.

Proposal To Eliminate Note 55 Some of the deputies proposed eliminating Note 55. Speaking in opposition, Mr. Nowbakht said: Last year during consideration of the budget, I had the honor of a visit with the exalted leader. He gave special emphasis to the fact that in the 1372 budget we have an outstanding place for fighting the cultural invasion. He added: This guidance caused the above note to be presented by the deputies. The blessings of this guidance were that in our responsible cultural organizations such as the Voice and Vision organization we have seen the start of the third channel, Payam radio, the province network and other things. In the Ministry of Education and Training we have 50 cultural societies, various video clubs, and special youth programs. If we want to strengthen these organizations to fight the cultural invasion, if this note is eliminated, how can these credits be increased? Continuing, Mr. Rahmani, speaking in support of the proposal to eliminate, said: The comments from the leader of the revolution were made under conditions when the budget was almost closed and was before the Majles. Really, when this year the government had the opportunity to include this note in the form of rows, why was it presented to the Majles as an item outside the program? On the other hand, should everything be spent in connection with cultural problems? The expert from the joint commission then announced his opposition to this proposal. He said: Last year when 54 notes were approved in open sessions, a proposal was made by a group of deputies to the effect that Note 55 is for the purpose of fighting the cultural invasion. The Plan and Budget Commission expected that this year when the government presented the budget it would not bring Note 55, but instead would provide the credits for this sector. We also believe that this budget writing is against the interest of our country. It is not appropriate for us to approve all the notes and then at the end to say that you should give 1 percent of the money for some other purpose. The government representative also discussed the elimination of Note 55. He said: It is not sufficient reason that if we had a real budget-writing system we would be able to solve all the problems and this would also be solved. Last year, for the purpose of defending the issue of opposing the cultural invasion and following the exalted leader, the Majles made a symbolic move, and it allocated a figure from all the budgets for this purpose. He added: If we eliminate this note this year what will happen? Some projects that are half-complete will remain in that state. You who are speaking of elimination, what will the replacement be? After the completion of the remarks in favor and in opposition and the comments from the representatives of the commission and the government, the proposal to eliminate Note 55, which was set in the budget to fight the cultural invasion, did not receive a passing vote. Note 55 To fight the cultural invasion and alleviate deprivation, to make efforts towards the nation's self-sufficiency, the Credit Allocation Committee is required at the time of allocating credits to deduct 1 percent of all the country's general revenues for 1373 (with the exception of sums whose disposition has already been determined by the time of this note, credits for education and training, higher education and research, health care and treatment, food and defense) and add them to the following rows: 1 - Sixty percent of the aforementioned amount will be given to the office of the president of the republic to be spent under the supervision of a council chaired by the president of the republic and with the minister of education and training, the minister of culture and Islamic guidance, the minister of culture and higher education, the minister of health care, treatment and medical education, and the chiefs of the Plan and Budget Organization, the Physical Training Organization and the Islamic Propaganda Organization as its members, specifically for the implementation of suitable projects to fight the cultural invasion, and a report on its performance will be sent to the Islamic Council once every three months. Note 56 The universities and institutions of higher learning and research affiliated with the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education are authorized to collect from applicants who are real persons and legal entities and deposit into the treasury as specialist revenue the revenues derived from the following activities: conducting night classes, conducting special classes, consulting, executive and expert services, treatment, veterinary, technical, laboratory and factory services, printing and reproduction, the sale of books, publications, the results of technical research and production information, the sale of agricultural crops, livestock and the like and the sale of educational, research, cultural, athletic and welfare services, in accordance with a tariff to be approved by the board of trustees. Note 57 To improve quality and support and to encourage exports of products from conversion industry agricultural factories, the Ministry of Economic and Financial Affairs is required to take 1 percent of the domestic sales of products from these types of factories for the year 1373 and to deposit it into the general revenues account. Note 58 The Law on Collecting Some Government Revenues and Spending it on Specific Items enacted in 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] and the orders pertaining to the collection of general revenues given in the Islamic Republic of Iran's First Five-Year Economic, Social and Cultural Development Plan Law will remain in force in the year 1373 until enactment and mandatory implementation of the Bill on Collecting Some Government Revenues and Spending It on Specific Items and the Second Five-Year Economic, Social and Cultural Development Plan Law, adhering to the regulations under this law.
