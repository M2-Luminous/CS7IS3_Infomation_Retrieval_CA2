Peterle is on a two-day official visit to the Czech Republic. It is unlikely that the UN Security Council would agree to lift the embargo for one country only, Zieleniec said. However, the question might eventually get onto the Council's agenda. "The fundamental thing is whether Slovenia will be able to control the movement of weapons over its territory," he said.
