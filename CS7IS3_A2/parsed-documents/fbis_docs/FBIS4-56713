This yields a total of 613,017 votes. A trend has prevailed since the tally began, and it has not changed. It signifies that we have won the 1994 elections. [crowd applauds, chants: "Toro!"] The TE's figures coincide very well with our party's own figures. A large number of votes have yet to be tallied in Panama Province, where the advantage in our favor is greater, so all the analysts -- both ours and independent ones -- accept this trend is irreversible and, consequently, the winner is yours truly. [applause] Thank you. I do not want to extend the wait any longer. I want to thank all the Panamanian people -- those who voted for me, of course, and those who opposed us, too -- for their civic-mindedness and for the behavior we observed throughout the campaign and today on election day. We now begin, as we have said, to build, united, without differences or political disputes, the nation's future, for the youth and the children. Thank you, Panamanian people, for extraordinary and exemplary civic behavior. [applause] I also want in particular to thank the whole United People campaign team for work and deeds that seemed like a dream five years ago. We are determined to recover our national dignity, and we are doing it -- with your support, in the first place, and the support of all the Panamanian people. We now begin a different phase. The elections are over today; electoral politics are over today. We now begin a phase that demands the best from all Panamanians to achieve what is still our goal: a free, independent, and sovereign country with equal opportunities for each and every one of us. Thank you, everyone, and we will continue to work, united, for the 21st century. Thank you. [crowd applauds, chants: "Toro!"] [Reporter] Any names for cabinet members? [Perez Balladares] No, not yet, [Reporter] How do you feel to be the first president elected in this country in free and honest elections in more than three decades? [Perez Balladares] Personally, I am extremely proud. I accept this victory with a great degree of humility because we have received a clear message from the Panamanian people, who want to leave the dark days behind, want to look forward with optimism, and want all Panamanians to join together to enter into what should be Panama's golden decade beginning with our government. [applause] [Reporter] Are you ready to [words indistinct]? [Perez Balladares] I do not have the slightest doubt: I am accompanied by very capable men and women. But we want to add more. We want this to be a truly representative government, a government based on an agreement among all Panamanians. Together we will be able to achieve this. [Reporter] Are you going to work with [words indistinct] parties? [Perez Balladares] We are now going to begin to form a government that we can feel proud of, one that will allow all Panamanians to feel that they are being worthily represented. [Reporter] Does this mean that you would form your government with parties that have opposed you? [Perez Balladares] Throughout my campaign I said that I was willing and hoping to form a government with the best men and women available, regardless of political persuasion, and I am now reiterating this following my victory. [Reporter] What about the names in today's extra edition of LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA -- can you confirm if any of them are going to be members of your cabinet? [Perez Balladares] Not yet, not yet. [Reporter] How can you guarantee that you will be able to rule if you will possibly be facing a Legislative Assembly and most of the media in the hands of the opposition? [Perez Balladares] I believe that the opposition they put up was during the electoral campaign. Now national goals should unite us. We now have other things, far more superior things, to bring us together. [Reporter] Is it true that you already have received telephone calls from the Christian Democratic Party candidate and the Solidarity Party candidate? [Perez Balladares] I hope that our opponents -- these two as well as the others -- will make their own statement. I would rather not say anything. I do want to take advantage of your question, however, to give thanks to those six candidates who accompanied us in this campaign because I believe that between all of us we have managed to, first, set the national goals, and then to carry out a campaign as we did -- with a few slip-ups, perhaps, but for the most part a high-level campaign. Thanks, then, to the presidential candidates. [Reporter] Does your victory also include a majority in the Legislative Assembly? [Perez Balladares] It is too early to comment on this. We are waiting for the results from the TE. [Reporter] Do you have any idea, though, since you were asking your supporters to vote for the entire slate? [Perez Balladares] I understand that our party received the most votes in the elections, but it is very difficult -- due to the system itself -- to know how many legislators won. [Reporter] President Endara invited you to work with him. He is going to give you a status report on the presidency. Are you going to accept this invitation? [Perez Balladares] Yes, of course. [Reporter] When do you plan to meet with him? [Perez Balladares] When he invites me to do so. [Reporter] You speak of a policy of a free and sovereign country. When one comes to Panama one finds a dollar economy. What are you going to change? [Perez Balladares] Sovereignty and the circulation of the U.S. dollar are not incompatible. Nowadays the majority of Latin American economies are dollarized economies. The only difference is that the dollar circulates in Panama as an international currency; it could be the dollar or any other international currency. Our complete and total sovereignty will be assured with the faithful fulfillment of the Torrijos-Carter treaties over the next five years. [Reporter] Is this your commitment with the Panamanian people? [Perez Balladares] Yes, sir. [Reporter] What are your plans for foreign policy and for relations with the United States? [Perez Balladares] I think that in the two cases there will be high-level policies, policies of respect in which each country will have to fight for its national interests and objectives. Sometimes they will be compatible, and sometimes they will differ, but there should be a lot of respect and lofty attitudes, as is called for in relations between grown-up countries and between peoples that share common interests. [Reporter] What type of relationship will you maintain with the international financial institutions [IFI's]? [Perez Balladares] The same relationship we have always had. I believe that these are necessary relations, and the IFI's help many countries to attain development goals that are necessary. It is a matter of being able to explain our national interests well and to obtain, via negotiations, agreements that are in keeping with our national interests. [Reporter] Your opponents still hope that the results of the elections might change. [Perez Balladares] I believe everyone will have hopes until all the votes are counted. That is why I said that these figures are not mine; they are TE figures. I also said that the analysts, not only our analysts but the independent analysts as well, say that due to the way the vote count is headed, because of the trend that it has shown from the very beginning, it is practically impossible for the final result to change. [Reporter] How do you think the United States is going to react now that many people who were ousted from power thanks to the invasion are going to return to power thanks to the votes? [Perez Balladares] Neither the United States nor I have said this. You are saying it. The party has returned to power. I was not in power during the invasion. Our party is a renovated party, as we have said on many occasions. In addition, we are a party that on several occasions, in practice, has given clear proof of internal democracy; a party that in any event represents the victory of democracy in Panama. I do not see how the United States can do anything other than applaud this democratic victory in Panama. [Reporter] Do you believe militarism is completely ruled out in Panama? [Perez Balladares] Yes, sir. There is no military here, nor any possibility of returning to any phase of the previous militarism. [Reporter] What would you tell General Torrijos at this time? [Perez Balladares] We have picked up your flag, kissed it, and continued onward. [cheers and applause]
