More than 8,000 barrels of crude oil spilled into Gamboa ravine that flows into the Zapatosa marsh. This rich agricultural and cattle region is now facing an environmental emergency as result of actions carried out by organized criminal groups. Over the past two weeks, several guerrilla attacks have taken place in this same area and have polluted rivers and streams throughout the region. This afternoon, ECOPETROL [Colombian Petroleum Enterprise] technicians began implementing emergency measures to prevent the oil spill from spreading, reaching the marsh, and causing irreparable environmental damage. In another attack, ELN guerrillas arrived at Villa del Rosario, Norte de Santander, some time after 0200 and proceeded to detonate explosive devices at the police department and the mayor's office. Several buildings near the police station, including the local comptroller's office, were also damaged by the blasts. Following the attack, the ELN column proceeded to ambush a police patrol in Villa del Rosario, Cucuta. Three police officers were killed and four others seriously wounded in the attack.
