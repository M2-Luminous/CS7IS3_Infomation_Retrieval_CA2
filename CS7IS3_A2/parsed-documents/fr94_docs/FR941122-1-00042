FR941122-1-00042 FR941122-1-00009 In order to obtain additional and more specific information on this sector of the aerospace rework industry, the EPA is requesting data and information on the following specific issues: 1. One commenter stated that to achieve the finish quality demanded by private and corporate aircraft purchasers, the aircraft manufacturers are using coatings that have a cross-linked polymer structure. According to the commenter, the structure of these coatings does not allow the non-HAP chemical strippers to penetrate the coating in order to break the bond between the coating and substrate. The EPA requests information on whether non-HAP chemical strippers have been shown to be effective on this type of coating. Commenters are requested to provide as many details as possible of non-HAP chemical depainting processes such as type and number of aircraft depainted, specific type of primer and topcoats removed, VOC content (as applied, less water and exempt solvents) of the primer and topcoat removed, and method of disposal of the waste stripper. Information on the cross-linked polymer coatings (e.g., VOC content, manufacturer) and its finish characteristics are also requested. In addition, the EPA requests comments on whether coatings other than cross-linked polymers can be used on private and corporate aircraft. Information requested includes: whether substitute coatings can be used to achieve similar finishes; whether these other coatings are easier to strip; VOC content (as applies, less water and exempt solvents) of these other coatings; application methods; whether changing coatings or not painting aircraft would affect aircraft safety; and the economic impacts of changing coatings or not painting aircraft. 2. Another commenter focused on the thin exterior skin panels of private, corporate, and small commuter aircraft. The commenter said that since weight is a critical parameter for these aircraft, very thin exterior skin panels, that are very susceptible to damage from blast depainting methods, are typically used. The commenter states that as a consequence, no rework facilities are currently using blast depainting methods on these aircraft.
