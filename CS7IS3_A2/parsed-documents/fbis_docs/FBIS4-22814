Kirov, Yekaterinburg; UDC546.34+541.44] [Abstract] Luminescent lithium (deuterium) hydride could possibly be used as a neutron scintillation detector, since it is assumed to be highly efficient in detecting neuron scintillation and in being highly sensitive to _g_-radiation. Also, the simplicity of the lithium hydride structure facilitates its fundamental study. LiH luminescence was first detected in samples activated with magnesium. Later, studies were made with lithium hydride activated with mercury-like ions, although the nature of the mercury-like coloration sites in LiH(LiD) has not yet been established. Luminescence of palladium-group ions in lithium (deuterium) hydride has not yet been observed. In the present work single crystals of LiH(D):Ru were grown and their luminescence spectra studied for the first time. The spectra displayed features related to the structure (progression along a valent local fluctuation of hydride ions in the doped center) and fluctuations of the base lattice. A qualitative simulation of the luminescence site is presented. Figures 2; references 10: 7 Russian, 3 Western.
