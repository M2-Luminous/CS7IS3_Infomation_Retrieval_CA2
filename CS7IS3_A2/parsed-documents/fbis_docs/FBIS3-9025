The latest round of negotiations brought to an end two years of talks on the agreement governing return of illegal immigrants. If parliament now approves the document, Interior Minister Jan Ruml will sign it with his German counterpart, Fendrych said. Both sides hope the agreement can be signed by June this year. The agreement provides for the establishment of an expert committee to oversee the proper implementation of the agreement, propose recommendations for the resolving of problems and suggest any necessary changes or additions to the original document. The delegates agreed on a period of twelve months in which an immigrant can be returned to the country from which he (she) illegally crossed the Czech-German border into the destination country. It was also agreed that the German authorities have six months to find a refugee. "Informal" readmission can be undertaken within three days of the illegal immigrant crossing the border.
