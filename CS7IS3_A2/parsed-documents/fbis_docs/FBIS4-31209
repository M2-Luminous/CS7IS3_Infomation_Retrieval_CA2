According to Prime Minister Klaus, it "used this debate to assess recent economic trends." From the point of view of the state budget, altogether positive figures are involved, which, according to Klaus, "is very different from the state budgets of neighboring countries." The state budget's balance is, said the prime minister, in the black up to 31 May and amounts to 4.2 billion korunas. Klaus "makes no secret of the fact that the worsening clearing balance with Slovakia has contributed significantly to this." If this clearing is unfavorable, the state budget must grant it credit, and thus the development of the clearing balance "plays considerably into the hands of the Czech state budget and begins to make the life of the Slovak state budget complicated." Despite the fact that the report is not, according to Klaus, "exaggeratedly optimistic," "distinct shoots that provide a reason for calm and hopeful forecasts for the future" are outlined here, the prime minister summed up.
