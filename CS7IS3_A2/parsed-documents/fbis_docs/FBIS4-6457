Noting that the United States is the very one responsible for the division of the Korean nation and is still blocking its independent and peaceful reunification, the statement says: "We cannot overlook the fact that the U.S. defense secretary, William Perry, threatened the lives of our 70 million fellow countrymen with the bellicose remarks that the U.S. would not rule out a war on the Korean peninsula. "We are convinced that the South Korean trip of Perry who is the most stubborn hard-liner in executing the U.S. policy of increasing the tensions on the Korean peninsula and perpetuating national division will not be helpful at all to peace on the Korean peninsula and its independent and peaceful reunification, the cherished desire of our fellow countrymen. On the contrary, it will heighten tensions and further wreck reconciliation and unity of our nation. "Therefore, we resolutely oppose Perry's jackboots treading on this land where our fellow countrymen desirous of independent and peaceful reunification live. "We denounce the threat of war provocation by outside forces and declare to the world that we will fight against it."
