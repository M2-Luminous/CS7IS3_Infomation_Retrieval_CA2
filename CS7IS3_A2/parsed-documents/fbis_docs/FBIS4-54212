They also decided to open a working-level meeting headed by division director-level officials from Korea's Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry and Japan's International Trade and Industry Ministry. Through the meeting, the two governments aim to spur standardization, joint research, technology cooperation and personnel education in the multi-media sector. The move indicates that technology cooperation between Seoul and Tokyo has shifted from traditional to more sophisticated industries. Moreover, the two ministers agreed that the Seoul Government will choose model small- and medium-sized firms in such areas as home electronic appliances, general machinery and automobile parts manufacturing, and then the Japanese Government will send experts to these Korean companies to provide support. Korea will dispatch 200 additional trainees from small- and medium-sized companies to Japan in 1995-98 and Tokyo will send 20 experts this year and 30 experts from 1995 annually to Seoul. The Japanese Government also plans to send an economic delegation to Seoul in late October to study investment conditions. Meanwhile, a 100-member Korean delegation headed by the chairman of the Korea-Japan Economic Association, Pak Yong-hak, is visiting Tokyo, Osaka and Kita Kyushu from May 25-31 to attract Japanese investment.
