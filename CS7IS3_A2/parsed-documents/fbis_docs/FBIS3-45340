Gu Jinchi said in his speech that the more we carry out the reform and opening up policies and develop the market economy, the more we should strengthen the construction of the spiritual civilization and pay attention to safeguarding the stability of society. He said: The year 1994 is of extreme importance to speeding up the setup of the socialist market economic system. Many major reform measures will start to be carried out one after another. Various kinds of social contradictions and conflicts increase, which will add pressure on social stability. The party committees and governments at various levels, particularly leading cadres, should approach from the high plane of consolidating the political power and safeguarding the long-term peace and stability of the country to comprehensively and accurately analyze the new situation and the new problems, constantly remain clear-headed, and try every possible means to safeguard political and social stability. The top party and government leaders at various levels should take on the political responsibility for ensuring safety, personally engage in safeguarding sociality, and really embody and implement the principle of taking a two-hand approach and being tough with two hands. Gu Jinchi pointed out: Under the current situation where the hot-debated problems are comparatively concentrated, the party committees and governments at various levels should realistically organize the departments at various levels to eliminate difficulties for the people, to do more good and real deeds for the people, to pay attention to the interests of the people, to ceaselessly improve the people's livelihood, and to continuously upgrade their enthusiasm so as to ceaselessly deepen the progress of reform. He finally stressed: To safeguard political and social stability, we should further strengthen and improve the party's leadership over the judicial, procuratorial, and court work so as to ensure that the judicial, procuratorial, and court front should comprehensively implement the party's line, principles, and policies. Governor Yue Qifeng pointed out in his speech: Safeguarding stability is the common task of the whole party and the whole society, as well as the important duty of the governments at various levels. Therefore, the principal leading comrades at various levels and the principal administrative leading comrades of various responsible departments, enterprises, and institutions should have the political and legal responsibility for safeguarding the stability of social order. He said: On the one hand, the judicial, procuratorial, and court organs should resolutely safeguard the long-term stability of social order; on the other land, they should ensure and promote the normal and sound operation of the market economy according to laws. Thus, the judicial, procuratorial, and court departments are required to further emancipate the mind, change their ideas, firmly foster the idea of considering economic construction as a key link, firmly foster the idea that the market economy is the legal economy, and use the arms of laws to better serve the economic construction and the progress of reform and opening up.
