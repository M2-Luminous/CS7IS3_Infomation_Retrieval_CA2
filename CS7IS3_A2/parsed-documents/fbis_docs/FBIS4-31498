[Moravcik] Well, I have some very good ideas, just as the other side has, too. As we have already declared on previous occasions, we should attain something that we call historic reconciliation. We, these two nations, at one time lived in one state and we had, we have, our own experiences of this coexistence, good and less good alike. We should now be able to find within ourselves sufficient courage and strength to forget everything that we did not consider really good, and be able to look to shaping our future relations, because on the basis of the orientation of policies, and of foreign policy, this future in fact should, I think, be a common future in both countries. All this in a wider community, where in fact the intensity of mutual relations is far greater than the intensity of the relations of two sovereign states. This means coexistence within the European Union. We have to concentrate on this, and we have to settle our relations in accordance with the interests of both states. [end recording]
