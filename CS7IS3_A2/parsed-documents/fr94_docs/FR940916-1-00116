FR940916-1-00116 FR940916-1-00016 Section 232.605. This section provides the instances when unscheduled freight or passenger single car tests, periodic freight brake tests, or single passenger train set tests would be required. FRA proposes to require the performance of an unscheduled single car test or periodic freight brake test based upon the type of wheel defect involved or the piece of braking equipment that is removed, repaired, or replaced. FRA has included certain wheel defects as a basis for performing a single car test because FRA feels that these wheel defects are indicative of some type of braking equipment problem. FRA's rationale for changing the current standard, requiring a single car test whenever a car is sent to the ``repair track'' for a brake problem, is that many railroads are avoiding single car tests by calling repair tracks something other than repair tracks. Consequently, FRA is attempting to close this loophole by basing the requirement to perform the single car test on the type of defect involved rather than where the defect is repaired. FRA feels that these proposed requirements will have little or no impact on railroad operations. Although these proposed requirements may increase the number of single car tests being performed, FRA believes that such an increase will be due to the elimination of the loophole used by railroads to avoid the performance of single car tests which should be performed even under the current requirements. Section 232.607. This section contains the requirements for the performance of scheduled periodic freight brake tests and single car tests. Under the current scheme for doing repair track or single car tests on freight cars, an individual car can conceivably go indefinitely without receiving either test. In order to increase the quality of equipment by ensuring that cars are not used for extended periods without receiving the benefits of these tests, FRA proposes to require ``periodic freight brake tests'' on a timely basis. For freight equipment, this periodic basis will be once every two years for conventional equipment and once every year for high utilization equipment. The performance of an ``unscheduled single car test'' will set the clock back to zero for that piece of equipment. Thus, if a car receives a freight single car test due to having part of its brake equipment removed, repaired, or replaced, that car will not be due for ``periodic freight brake test'' for two years from that date. The AAR and several of its member railroads estimated that a freight car currently receives a repair track air brake test or single car test on the average of 1.7 times a year. The proposed change to require periodically scheduled freight brake tests will not change this average, it will only ensure that some small number of cars do not continue in service for extended periods of time without receiving a test. Consequently, FRA predicts that the impact on freight railroad operation will be minimal. FRA also proposes to require a single car test on equipment used in conventional passenger and commuter trains at least once every six months. The required interval is reduced to once every four months for equipment used in intermediate speed trains and to once every three months for equipment used in high speed trains. The interval is reduced as train speed increases because of the heavier wear and duty cycle imposed on the brake system as train speed increases. FRA intends for the periodic single car test to replace various COT&S requirements that currently exist for passenger and commuter equipment. Several passenger and commuter railroads recommended some type of periodic testing in lieu of the current periodic COT&S, suggesting, in particular, periodic single car tests every 120 days. FRA believes that the proposed requirement for frequent, comprehensive single car tests will detect and cause to be corrected the same type of brake system problems that the current COT&S program is designed to prevent. However, due to the very long COT&S cycles, the periodic single car tests should detect the problems earlier than the current COT&S program. Replacing COT&S with periodic single car tests has the potential of saving passenger and commuter railroads a significant amount in operating expenses. Furthermore, the proposed required single car test intervals are not radically different from what is now the voluntary policy of many passenger and commuter railroads. Section 232.609. This section outlines the requirements regarding the phase-in period for performing ``periodic freight brake tests'' and single car tests. FRA intends to allow a phase-in period for the requirement to perform periodic repair track air brake tests. The proposed phase-in periods are two years for non-high utilization freight equipment and one year for high utilization freight and for passenger and commuter equipment. The phase-in period should allow railroads time to establish an effective and efficient program and to conduct the first required test on each piece of equipment in their inventory. Section 232.611. This section contains the general requirements for changing the required intervals for performing periodic freight brake tests and single car tests. FRA proposes a statistical process which will allow railroads or other interested parties a means to justify a change in the period of time between required periodic freight brake tests or single car tests. FRA intends to provide an incentive for railroads to develop a test, inspection, and maintenance program for brake systems that keeps failure rates of the periodic freight brake test or single car test below a target value. The incentive provides a method for increasing the allowable time between required periodic freight brake tests or single car tests based on a statistical analysis that shows the measured test failure rate for scheduled tests is below the target value. FRA intends for this statistical analysis to be a two-way process. This means that if the analysis shows that the target failure rate is being exceeded, the railroad will be required to reduce the time between periodic freight brake tests or single car tests by the increment of change. Railroads may start to use this statistical process one year after the phase-in period for required periodic repair track air brake test is completed. Railroads may apply this process to only their own equipment, or groups of railroads may team and apply the methodology to a larger population. Appendix B of this proposed rule and the discussion relevant to that appendix provide a more detailed analysis of the statistical analysis and provide examples of how the method will be applied. Section 232.613. This section contains the qualification requirements for inspectors performing periodic freight brake tests, single car tests, or single passenger train brake tests. The periodic freight brake test and single car test will become the main quality control tool to indicate whether brake system repairs to a single car have been made correctly. In addition, these tests are designed to keep the power brake defect ratio of equipment acceptably low. Consequently, FRA feels that since these tests are safety-critical they should be performed only by qualified train brake system inspectors and should be spot checked by qualified train brake system supervisors. Section 232.615. This section contains the recordkeeping and stencilling requirements related to periodic freight brake tests and single car tests. FRA proposes to require that railroads keep minimum records to document that their periodic freight brake and single car test programs meet the requirements stated in this subpart. FRA believes that this documentation should include (i) a certification that the periodic freight brake and single car tests were done by a qualified inspector, (ii) a certified description of the repairs made to get the car to pass the test, and (iii) a certification that all the required steps of the appropriate test were completed and that the equipment performed correctly during each step of the test. Railroads opting to use the statistical process described in ยง232.611 will need to keep adequate records of their testing programs in order to obtain the information necessary for completion of the statistical analysis of the failure rates.
