According to the authors of the appeal, the reason for this lies in the complicated settlements and unjustified customs restrictions between Russia and Ukraine, which lead to stopping, completely or partially, work at the plants and factories producing consumer goods and the essential types of industrial products. The industrialists and entrepreneurs urged the leaders of their countries to create appropriate conditions for economic integration between Russia and Ukraine and dismantle all the barriers artificially put on the road of cooperation. In their view the first steps in this direction could be to open affiliations of Ukrainian banks in Russia and Russian in Ukraine, establish preferential regime in bilateral trade, lift the demand for advance payments and set up joint industrial and financial groups. The appeal was signed by the leaders of the Russian and Ukrainian Unions of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Arkady Volsky and Leonid Kuchma. Kuchma is a candidate for presidential elections in Ukraine planned for 26 June.
