The planned social investment in fixed assets is to be 27.5 billion yuan, up by 14 percent. [passage omitted] The most conspicuous problem in building key projects remains the shortage of funds. It is imperative to try our best to collect construction funds through many channels. In collecting construction funds, it is necessary to make all sorts of funds available to localities to found the Shaanxi fund for developing capital industry and infrastructure. At the same time, it is necessary to face society and other provinces and encourage everyone to make joint investment to conduct infrastructure construction. It is especially necessary to utilize the share-holding system to collect funds, and to actively import foreign funds. On the one hand, foreign businessmen should be guided to directly invest in infrastructure and the building of capital industry; on the other hand, some stock ownership of some capital industry could be transferred to foreign businessmen, with the funds thus obtained put into capital construction. In this way, we can keep the funds rolling, accelerate the pace in building key projects, and augment our strength.
