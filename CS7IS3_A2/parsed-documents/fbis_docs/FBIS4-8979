FBIS4-8979 "dreeu076_p_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 POLAND Daily on Possibility of `State of Emergency' Daily on Possibility of `State of Emergency' WS1904113094 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 19 Apr 94 p 2 WS1904113094 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA Polish BFN [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski, Zbigniew Lentowicz, and Jerzy Pilczynski: "The Belweder Putsch"] [Text] Let us make the assumption that everything is for real--that the coalition does not want to blackmail the president but wants to really restrict his powers, that the president not only wanted to frighten the coalition but will really dissolve the Sejm. In other words, let us assume that it is not merely a game but that the coalition and the president will really do what they said they would do. Right now, the president does not have any possibility of dissolving the Sejm in line with the law. Now, if he does dissolve the Sejm, it will be illegal (this will be discussed below). There will be no one who would be able to bring the president before the State Tribunal for dissolving the Sejm illegally. This can be done only by the National Assembly, which will no longer exist (unless the coalition amends this article of the Small Constitution). It may also happen that the Sejm speaker will not act on the president's decision and will convene the National Assembly anyway. The situation that will develop then will somewhat resemble a coup d'etat. It seems that the president will not be able to dissolve the Sejm efficiently (that is, not only make the decision, but execute it)... Without the Aid of the Army and the Police Will he really be able to count on these services to support him? In line with the estimates of observers, during the last election, a substantial part of the cadres supported the Democratic Left Alliance. ``Nevertheless, among the officers. there would certainly be people who would definitely support the president's decision to dissolve the parliament. Most of them, however, would consider such a measure to be an illegal attempt on democracy, says a high-ranking officer. ``The president is enjoying considerable respect among the military people for what he is doing for the defense system,'' he says, confirming our information. He immediately adds, however, that, in other areas, the Belweder is evaluated very critically by the cadres. The Army hopes that, just as in previous disputes, this one will also be resolved where it emerged--at the political platform--and that the Army will be able to keep away from the commotion. "It Would Be A Misfortune ...for all of us, particularly for the Army, if even in the most acute political conflict, one of the parties asked the Army for support," claims Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki, spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense [MON]. Theoretically, in the present composition of the National Defense Committee [KOK], which is empowered to, among other things, forward a motion to the president requesting the imposition of the state of emergency, the people linked to the Belweder are in a majority. Apart from the KOK chairman--the president himself--the core of the committee "proper for dealing with the issues of defense and security of the state" is made up of the heads of the so-called presidential ministries: the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and MON (the defense minister is, by his office, the deputy of the KOK chairman), and the head of the General Staff, appointed by the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, as well as the KOK secretary, who also steers the National Security Council. This group also includes a member of the President's Office, appointed by the president. The minority "progovernmental" option within KOK, in a hypothetical conflict, includes first of all the prime minister (whom the KOK chairman has appointed as his first deputy), the speakers of both chambers of parliament, and the head of the Finance Ministry. The decisions of a collective body such as KOK are made by a majority of votes. Thus, the propresidential section of KOK has a theoretical chance to win the ballot on forwarding a motion to the president, requesting the imposition of a state of emergency. We asked Lech Falandysz, secretary of state in the President's Office, whether he believes that the president will dissolve the Sejm, even if he were to violate the law. ``If the coalition implemented its initiative--that is, if we really witnessed a change in the political system--one would have to think about what to do. As a rule, it so happens in democratic countries that a change in the political system is accompanied by new elections. I do not think that the president will decide to violate the law. Therefore, The Sejm Will Not Be Dissolved ...if the law does not allow him to do so. He may take advantage of the formula of `bowing to higher priorities.' However, I do not think so because it is a general and bad formula. Well, the option of a `lesser evil' might be chosen, but we have already had that.'' "The president will not yield to blackmail; however, I believe that he will not violate the law, either," we were told by Lech Falandysz. The interviews we have conducted with the representatives of several groupings--Henryk Wujec of the Democratic Union, Jerzy Eysymontt of the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms, Krzysztof Krol of the Confederation for an Independent Poland, and Piotr Zak of "Solidarity"--suggest that none of them... Would Approve of a Violation of the Law ...by the president. The provisions of the Small Constitution are in this case not very favorable to the president, and, in addition, they are rather clear. If Walesa wanted to choose Yeltsin's option, the senate is an obstacle. Article 19 of the Small Constitution does empower the president and the Sejm to order a referendum; however, first the senate must give its consent. The constitutional law entitles the president to impose a state of emergency on part or on the whole of the state's territory. There are two reasons to do this: first, a natural calamity, and, second, a threat to the internal security of the state. Even though it seems that it is quite a broad concept, it can be extended only to certain limits. When a state of emergency is in effect, the Sejm cannot be dissolved, and the electoral laws as well as the Constitution cannot be changed. As far as the specific conditions of the functioning of a state of emergency are concerned, the Constitution makes a reference to a specific law. It was passed in 1983 and was amended when constitutional amendments were being passed in 1989. A state of emergency would merely freeze the situation and not resolve the problem. In addition, it can be prolonged only once every three months, after the Sejm gives its consent. Thus, after three months, it would be necessary to submit a report on the illegal introduction of the state of emergency to the same parliament. One might think about another possibility, a different sequence of events: The president first dissolves the Sejm, then imposes the state of emergency. However, the Small Constitution envisions four cases in which the president can dissolve the Sejm; three of them contain clear limitations. None of them are possible right now. One might speculate even further and include the presidential powers in the extraordinary activities defined in Article 28 of the Constitution; it says that the president sees to it that the Constitution is observed and defends the sovereignty and security of the state. However, it is difficult to imagine that such activities might go against any clear provisions of the Constitution.
