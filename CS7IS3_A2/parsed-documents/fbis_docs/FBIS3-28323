Ishihara told a news conference that the push is being made to allow the Finance Ministry to compile the draft of the fiscal 1994 state budget before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa flies to the United States on Thursday. "We have no more time to waste. The situation is fairly severe," Ishihara said. Hosokawa is scheduled to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday to assess progress in trade talks being held under a bilateral trade framework accord concluded last July. The premier will return home Saturday. Coalition parties remained divided over Hosokawa's proposal for a 6 trillion yen tax reduction retroactive to January 1 this year and a 7 percent tax on goods and services from April 1997. The Social Democratic Party, the largest contingent in the seven-party coalition, has threatened to quit the coalition over the plan for a "national welfare tax," calling it a thinly disguised increase in the consumption tax rate, currently 3 percent. Washington has voiced hopes for additional pump-priming measures by Japan, including a sizable income tax cut, because it believes this will help stimulate domestic consumer spending, increase imports and slash Japan's bulging trade surplus.
