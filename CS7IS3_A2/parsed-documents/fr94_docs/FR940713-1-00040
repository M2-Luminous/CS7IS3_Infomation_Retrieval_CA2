FR940713-1-00040 FR940713-1-00006 40 CFR Part 180 [PP 8F3658/P584; FRL&hyph;4871&hyph;2] RIN 2070&hyph;AC18 Pesticide Tolerances for Triasulfuron AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA proposes to extend the tolerances for residues of the herbicide triasulfuron [3-(6-methoxy-4-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-1-(2-chloroethoxy)phenylsulfonyl)urea] in or on barley and wheat grain at 0.02 part per million (ppm); barley and wheat straw at 2.0 ppm; barley and wheat forage at 5.0 ppm; meat, fat and meat by products (excluding kidney) of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep; kidney of cattle, goats, horses, and sheep at 0.2 ppm; and milk at 0.02 ppm. The Agency has not completed the regulatory assessment of our science findings; therefore, the Agency is proposing to extend these tolerances for 1 year. DATES: Comments, identified by the document control number [PP 8F3658/P584], must be received on or for August 12, 1994. These tolerances will expire on March 13, 1996. ADDRESSES: By mail, submit written comments to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., Washington, DC 20460. In person, bring comments to Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202. Information submitted as a comment concerning this document may be claimed confidential by making any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information'' (CBI). Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain CBI must be submitted for inclusion in public record. Information not marked confifidential may be disclosed pubicly by EPA without prior notice. All written comments will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1132 at address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail, Robert J. Taylor, Product Manager (PM) 25, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 241, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-6800. SUPPLEMENTARY INFROMATION: In the Federal Register of March 13, 1992 (57 FR 8844), EPA issued a final rule which established tolerances for residues of the herbicide triasulfuron [3-(6-methoxy-4-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-1-(2-chloroethoxy)phenylsulfonyl)urea] in or on barley and wheat grain at 0.02 ppm; barley or wheat forage at 5.0 ppm; barley and wheat straw at 20 ppm; meat, fat, and meat byproducts (excluding kidney) of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.1 ppm; and milk at 0.02 ppm, with an expiration date of March 13, 1995. These tolerances with an expiration date were required by EPA to allow the petitioner, Ciba-Geigy Corp. to submit additional data required in the area of environmental fate and groundwater, and to allow the Agency to complete the regulatory assessment of its scientific findings. The petitioner has submitted all the required data. Because the Agency has not completed the requlatory assessment of its scientific findings, EPA is amending 40 CFR 180.459 to extend the expiration date for these tolerances until March 13, 1996. Based on the information cited above and in the document establishing the time-limiting tolerance for triasulfuron (57 FR 8844, March 13, 1992), the Agency has determined that when used in accordance with good agricultural practice, this ingredient is useful and the tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, EPA is proposing to extend the tolerances as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number [PP 8F3658/P584]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or food additive regulations or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 Enviromental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: June 27, 1994. Stephen L. Johnson, Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs. Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR part 180 be amended as follows: PART 180_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a and 371. 2. By revising §180.459, to read as follows: §180.459 Trisulfuron; tolerances for residues. Tolerances, to expire on March 13, 1996, are established for residues of the herbicide triasulfuron [3-(6-methoxy-4-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-1-(2-(2-chloroethoxy)phenylsulfonyl)urea] in or on the following raw agricultural commodities: ␣ 1Commodity 1Parts per million Barley, forage 5.0 Barley, grain 0.02 Barley, straw 2.0 Cattle, fat 0.1 Cattle, kidney 0.2 Cattle, mbyp (except kidney) 0.1 Cattle, meat 0.1 Goats, fat 0.1 Goats, kidney 0.2 Goats, mbyp (except kidney) 0.1 Goats, meat 0.1 Hogs, fat 0.1 Hogs, kidney 0.2 Hogs, mbyp (except kidney) 0.1 Hogs, meat 0.1 Horses, fat 0.1 Horses, kidney 0.2 Horses, mbyp (except kidney) 0.1 Horses, meat 0.1 Milk 0.02 Sheep, fat 0.1 Sheep, kidney 0.2 Sheep, mbyp (except kidney) 0.1 Sheep, meat 0.1 Wheat, forage 5.0 Wheat, grain 0.02 Wheat, straw 2.0 [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16860 Filed 7&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
