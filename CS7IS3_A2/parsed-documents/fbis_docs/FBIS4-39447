"Arms exports are always beneficial, particularly given the current state of Russia's arms complex and shortages of hard currency," he said. He also noted that the Russian-Malaysian contract was the first step towards the introduction of Russian weapons and other goods in this region. He denied reports that the MiG fighters had been sold at dumping prices. "Simply, part of the MiG fighters' cost will be paid by supplies of Malaysian goods, including palm oil," he said. He said that before the Rosvooruzheniye concern established its absolute control on the arms market, other agencies had wanted to sign this contract. So all these accusations came from the people who failed to get the deal, he said. The latest contract could be followed by other ones with Southeast Asian and other countries, said Shaposhnikov. According to unofficial sources, the contract is estimated at 600 million dollars. Only 20 to 25 percent of the contract will be paid in palm oil supplies.
