A cooperation agreement is to be signed as a result of the talks. Soskovets is also scheduled to meet with Syrian President Hafez al-Asad later in the day. Everything seems to indicate that Soskovets will leave for Moscow by air on Wednesday afternoon. When addressing members of the Syrian business community on Tuesday, Soskovets pointed out that the Russian delegation "is authorised to restore the partially lost economic and political contacts". The two sides admitted that the current state of trade-and-economic cooperation does not meet the interests of the two states. Oleg Davydov, Russian minister for foreign economic relations, believes that in order to straighten out the historically established relations between Russia and Syria, it is essential to sign two agreements soon, namely, on the protection of investments and on the prevention of double taxation. Besides, Davydov suggested founding several jointly-run Russo-Syrian banks. As far as the rather delicate Syrian debt issue is concerned, the two sides consider that a political decision on it should be made. For its part, Syria reaffirmed its readiness to repay the current debt to Russia. The work on agreements, which are being prepared for signature, is proceding with difficulty, Yuriy Mikhaylov, adviser to the first vice-premier, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. He said the Russian side had expressed readiness to offset more than 80 percent of the Syrian debt which is known to have amounted to about 10,000 million U.S. dollars. The Russian side suggested the following formula as regards the remaining 20 percent of the debt: 60 percent of this amount is to be repaid by Damascus in freely convertible currency and the other 40 percent are to be redeemed with consumer goods on a ten-year instalment plan. However, the formula proved unacceptable to Syria. For its part, Damascus would like Russia to offset 92 percent of the debt, Mikhaylov said. At the close of the second round of the talks, the two sides agreed to continue work on a debt agreement at expert groups' level and voiced hope that it would be signed before the Russian vice-premier meets President Al-Asad.
