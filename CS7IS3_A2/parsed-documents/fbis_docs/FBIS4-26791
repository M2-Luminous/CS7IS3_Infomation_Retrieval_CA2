The group also reached another accord with the Chinese firm to set up an agro-chemicals plant, with a total investment of 60 million U.S. dollars. David Barnes, chief executive of Zeneca, which was listed in 1993, said in an interview with XINHUA that the establishment of the pharmaceutical consulting company was Zeneca's first step to expand its China business. Zeneca expected to invest more than 100 million U.S. dollars in various projects in China in the next five years, he said. "Through the company, Zeneca will introduce its advanced technology and products to China, and help the pharmaceutical circles of China to increase exchanges and contacts with the outside world," Barnes added. Zeneca's turnover in China in 1993 reached 44 million dollars, of which medicines and specially-made chemicals each supplied a quarter, and agro-chemicals products 50 percent. Barnes also said that the agrochemicals joint-venture, which would go into operation in 1996, was the third largest investment in China by an external agrochemicals producer for the manufacture of an active ingredient of herbicide. "The progress being made on these two projects demonstrates our commitment to developing our business in China," Barnes said. "We are confident that our business here can grow and make an increasing contribution to the burgeoning economic prosperity of the country."
