The diplomat regretted that the agreements reached by bilateral negotiation on various levels were being "implemented worse than was expected." In particular, he said the treaties signed during Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to Vilnius had not been enforced yet. The agreements on trade and economic agreements are not fulfilled either, because they "got stuck in corridors of the Russian power due to unknown reasons," as Bulovas put it. The working group head dismissed the allegations by some opposition leaders that the current Lithuanian authorities were secretly negotiating Russian military transit to the Kaliningrad region and had allegedly signed "some secret protocols." Bulovas said that the Russian side had submitted no proposals regarding military transit to the Kaliningrad region pointing out that "neither open, nor secret negotiations were held on the issue."
