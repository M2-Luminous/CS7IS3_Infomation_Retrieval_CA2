The state will allocate 7 billion yuan to help those workers employed by the enterprises that go bankrupt. The central authorities hold that allowing state-owned enterprises which cannot halt business losses to go bankrupt is the key to the establishment of a modern enterprise system. The source said: A central leader recently talked about this issue and said that a major task laid down by the central leading body for this year is to promote a modern enterprise system, while the key to the establishment of a modern enterprise system lay in the establishment of a perfect enterprise bankruptcy mechanism. Enterprises which can no longer stop business losses and repay their debts should go bankrupt, and enterprise mergers can be regarded as a solution within the category of bankruptcy. At present, the difficulty about exercising bankruptcy lies in placing workers. Thus, the state will allocate 7 billion yuan to make proper arrangements for the placement of workers and to set up special funds for writing off bad debts owed by bankrupt enterprises to the banks. Reportedly, according to conditions in difficult localities, each worker will receive about 20,000 yuan of compensation if the enterprise goes bankrupt and will then be separated from the enterprise for ever. At present, such dying enterprises still have to rely on bank loans to pay workers' wages. The source said: The central authorities are firmly determined to let loss-incurring enterprises go bankrupt, because the Bankruptcy Law, which was formulated on the basis of consideration over a long time, will officially take effect in July. Since the law has been enacted, practice should be brought into line with the requirements of the law. Moreover, the central authorities held that there would be an opportunity next year to solve the problems in large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. If experience can be acquired on such key issues as handling enterprise bankruptcy this year, this will be conducive to the thorough settlement of problems in large state-owned enterprises next year.
