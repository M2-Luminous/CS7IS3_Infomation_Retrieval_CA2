The draft of the programme was prepared by the Committee for Property. "The programme stipulates that approximately 8,000 objects of trade, public utilities, enterprises and non-completed constructions will be privatized," specialist of the State Committee for Property, Mamedrasul Bilalov, told TURAN's correspondent. During privatisation the preference will be given to employees of this or that enterprise. Only if the employees refuse to purchase their enterprise, the latter can be sold through the auctions. "Each Azeri citizen irrespective of age will have special account in bank totalling 5,000 manats. These means can be used only during privatisation and for purchasing of shares. Index system will be used to protect these means from inflation," said Bagirov.
