The fascist clique detained him for the reason that he was involved in the Seoul sponsorship of the pan-national rally at Hanyang University in August last year and the first meeting of co-chairmen of the National Alliance of youth and students for the country's reunification over the international telephone. His righteous behaviour to contribute even a little to ending the tragedy of national division spanning nearly half a century and attaining national unity and the reunification of the country cannot be a crime.
