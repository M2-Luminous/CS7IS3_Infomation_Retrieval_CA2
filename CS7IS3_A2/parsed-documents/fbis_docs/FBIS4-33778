The 34 delegates to the 24th OAS General Assembly -- the main forum of dialogue and agreement within the Americas and which will close on 10 June -- have addressed the possibility of readmitting Cuba into the OAS with a businesslike approach, although without much enthusiasm. The 24th OAS General Assembly, which is hosted by the city of Belem, Para State, is chaired by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. It is in its final stage and is now being attended by second level delegates because most of the respective foreign ministers have already returned home. Considering Cuba is the only Latin American country excluded from the OAS, Amorim viewed as significant the fact that the Cuban issue is no longer viewed as taboo and that it may be included in the agenda of the OAS. A senior Foreign Ministry official of one Andean country rhetorically asked: "Why is it that the Cold War has ended and yet Cuba continues to be excluded from the Inter-American political system, which is regarded as universal and pluralistic"? [passage omitted] OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, whose 10-year tenure will conclude on 20 June when he will be replaced by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, told reporters that a slight majority of OAS member states favor a debate on the "Cuban issue." Brazilian President Itamar Franco immediately endorsed the initiative. The foreign ministers and delegates of Venezuela, Costa Rica, Canada, and Bolivia, among others, followed suit. [passage omitted] Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo went as far as to announce at a plenary session that he is willing to negotiate among the United States, some Latin American countries, the Havana Government, and the Cuban opposition in exile, seeking to promote the democratization of Cuba. One South American diplomat said the situation is complicated because of the extreme polarization of positions and of the radical stance of the United States, which does not conceal its interest in having President Castro step down. Three positions can be identified among Latin American countries: First, a pro-U.S. position, which is endorsed by Argentina, El Salvador, and other Central American countries; second, a current -- which includes the Caribbean Community (Caricom) -- that promotes peaceful coexistence with Cuba and its readmission into the OAS; and third, a current that respects Cuban self-determination, as advocated by the Group of Three (Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela). The Brazilian position, which is close to that of the Group of Three, watches with satisfaction Cuban economic reform, the opening toward the Catholic Church, the renovation of the Communist Party of Cuba's cadres that has been implemented in recent months by Fidel Castro, and the talks held in April by Castro's government with opposition groups in exile. Amorim said that these moves may promote democratization, which could be jeopardized if Cuba remains isolated. He added: "Perhaps Cuba should make more significant gestures. It is more significant to stretch out one's hand than to slam the door in someone's face."
