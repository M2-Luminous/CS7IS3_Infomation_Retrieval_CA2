Of course, on the scale of the television company, a gigantic, almost uncontrollable business, it is not easy to find a gold mine. Filling many hours of air time is still too costly a luxury. A more rewarding occupation for those who have decided to get in on the ground floor of the television business is to create a television agency. In essence world information journalism has been supported by such agencies for many years now. The largest television agency, Reuters, for example, serves more than 600 television companies of the world. But for our country such a practice is a rare exception to the general rule. Journalists Mikhail Beglov and Andrey Korotkov, who previously worked at the Main Editorial Office for Audiovisual Information of TASS, two years ago left state service and organized their own agency. At first, of course, things were tight--they borrowed money from acquaintances, friends of acquaintances, acquaintances of friends of acquaintances, and they took out unsecured credit in order to buy their first video camera. But now RTA, the only private independent television agency in Russia, is flourishing: It has complete independence with no sponsors, it has its own equipment, and two clipping rooms. It has a total of 20 staff correspondents and five film crews. RTA actively recruits stringers to cooperate, but it has no editors or correspondents in the usual sense. It has producers who can combine jobs and work as sound operators, lighting men, and even drivers, in spite of their ambitions. So as distinct from a film crew of state television, which consists, as a rule, of three or four people, the private agency can allow itself the luxury of maintaining two workers for one camera--otherwise, it would be threatened with ruin. RTA is experiencing no shortage of clients who are thirsty for information and the "footage" that goes with it. More frequently they have to make a choice of whom to give preference to: a German company or an American one. No television company, even the wealthiest Western ones which have four to five film crews in Russia, can cover all the events in our turbulent country. All the conditions are stipulated ahead of time--each television company has its own style for presenting video materials. RTA works not only on order, but also on its own initiative. Early in the morning in the RTA office there are reports from large information agencies (like INTERFAX and RIA). It also has its own personal sources of information--wherever they are possible and necessary. The producers determine where to send film crews and why. On busy days they can shoot up to 20 hours of video film. This was the case, for example, during the elections and the putsches. But it sometimes happens that they all sit in the office for a whole day smoking and looking at one another because nothing is happening and there is no news. As distinct from state structures, nobody forces anybody to work just to keep busy: There is no plan for the quantity of material produced during a day or quarter. On the other hand, there is no such concept as a regular day off either. If it is necessary to film on Sunday night then they do it, in spite of the fact that the day before they had returned from a week-long trip and had not slept for two days in a row. RTA never refuses its clients, even if the orders seem crazy at first glance. Once in the Crimea against the background of Lastochkinoye Gnezdo an RTA crew filmed a meeting between Yeltsin and Kravchuk. The operator told the correspondent where to stand, but he suddenly disappeared from the frame. It turned out that he took a step backwards and fell, fortunately, not into an abyss but down a steep slope. But according to responses from German television viewers, who had seen the clip later, it was very emotional and brought some people to tears. It was apparent how excited the correspondent was about the negotiations between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine. The work of RTA workers is dangerous--not only in zones of combat activities when you fly in a helicopter and where you can be fired at by a Stinger at any moment or when you are filming material at the Semipalatinsk test site where the Geiger counter is registering off the dial, or where you go to film the headquarters of a fascist organization where they might simply punch you in the face and break the camera at the same time. Therefore all agency workers are insured for large amounts. It cannot be ruled out that the producer will offer video materials to clients and all of them will refuse it. Some have shot their own film on a particular subject and some are not interested. The French, for example, prefer to use their own film. But such cases, even though they obviously cause losses, do not hit the overall pocketbook especially hard. They are individual cases. And then RTA has a group of permanent clients. Foreign television companies pay two to three times more for video news than ours do. This certainly does not mean that RTA does not want to deal with Russian television companies whose finances are constantly on the downturn. On the contrary, RTA is prepared to offer its video materials and services even free of charge. But our companies have still retained a certain inertia of thinking--both Ostankino and the Russian channel have become accustomed to relying on their own forces. And it is not even that they do not trust others. It is simply necessary to give their own staff correspondents something to do. Although materials with the RTA mark will show up on "Vesti" once in a while. A daily morning program on the Russian channel "Formula 730" is also being created on the basis of the RTA agency. But this is episodic so far. "Journal of Main Events of the Day" is enjoying minimum success. The most costly materials and the ones most interesting to the clients are exclusives. Such as interviews with wives of members of government (how they met their husbands, how they fell in love, where they lived and on what) with the title "Kremlin Wives." This "commodity" immediately found consumers. The RTA producers are trying to film outside Moscow as much as possible--any information from outside the capital sells like hotcakes. For example, a piece on a nuclear missile silo or a report on diamond mining in Yakutia. It is not easy to get permission to film such things. Agency workers--who are in principle against bribes which open all doors--have been trained not to give them. Therefore the main asset of any producer is not a personal bank account but the connections he has developed. The reaction to video topics is unpredictable. Once a piece was filmed for ZDF on refugees from Kazakhstan. In the words of the bureau chief, the German public was struck most by a restless cat which the owner had abandoned in an empty apartment. They were immediately flooded with offers from people who wanted to bring the cat to Germany. The foreigners did not feel as sorry for the Russians who were forced to flee their homes as they did for the unfortunate animal. Or there was the piece about Moscow Siamese twins Masha and Dasha that affected everyone in Germany so much that the German television company, under pressure from phone calls from television viewers, brought the sisters to Berlin for treatment at its own expense. The political independence and the reliability of RTA have led to a situation where its news is a marketable commodity. Mikhail Beglov and Andrey Korotkov, the founders of RTA, working with the producers, think that their brainchild has found its niche in the video news market and they feel comfortable there. So much so that the agency is expanding the sphere of its activity: from assisting television companies in creating studios to buying interesting programs from foreign production firms.
