On 21 April, Bonn security circles reported that corresponding clues are being investigated. [passage omitted] On Tuesday the Arab daily AL HAYAH, which is published in London, carried a statement of the Hamadi clan, which is very influential in Lebanon. The statement says that reports "according to which 'Abbas Hamadi is currently in Germany and is secretly preparing his brother's escape from prison" are "completely wrong." 'Abbas Hamadi is still in Lebanon and receives medical treatment because of "the suffering he was subjected to in German prisons."
