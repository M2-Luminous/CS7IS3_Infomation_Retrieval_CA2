The patriarch's grip on affairs of state is weakening by the day. Sources close to his family said that while the patriarch suffers from no life-threatening diseases his prostate cancer was brought under control a few years ago -- what they referred to as his "old man's ailment" had deteriorated. They said on the "better days", Mr Deng was fit enough to hear briefings for periods of 30 minutes or so. These days of lucidity, however, have become rarer. The helmsman of 1.15 billion people can no longer attend to the details of governance. His energy level only allows him to be apprised of the most essential matters such as the inflation rate and China's Most Favoured Nation status in America. His "briefers" are daughter Deng Rong and members of the Deng Office, including its director, General Wang Ruilin. However, since Mr Deng mumbles so badly he can hardly make himself understood, not even the "imperial lip readers" can be really sure of his reactions to whatever information he has taken in. To dispel speculation about Mr Deng's impending rendezvous with Karl Marx, the Politburo decided last year that his offspring and relatives should keep to their regular overseas travels. Diplomats said the protestation by the Foreign Ministry spokesman last Thursday that Mr Deng was "in very good health" was an indirect confirmation of the severity of his physical condition. The same spokesman's claims in April 1993 that Premier Li Peng "only had flu" was newspeak for him having suffered a major heart attack. Insiders said a ferocious power struggle could break out along the following lines. Holders of vested interests -- mainly the Deng family and Mr Deng's anointed successors such as President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji -- would take advantage of their position as palace guards to maintain the status quo. Ms Deng, who is believed to have formed a power pact with Mr Jiang, has repeatedly stressed that her father favours "stability" and that he has full confidence in the President as the "core of the third-generation leadership. Mr Jiang, whose ability to jockey for position is as brilliant as his track record for market reform is lacklustre, has stepped up his campaign to woo two principal power blocs: the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the so-called Shanghai Faction. Since becoming Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) in late 1989, Mr Jiang has visited more than 100 army units in all the seven military regions. Since late last year, the President is believed to have cemented his ties with key PLA players including CMC Vice-Chairman Zhang Zhen, Defence Minister Chi Haotian, and General Wang. Sources said Mr Jiang had recently given the generals carte blanche in areas including arms purchase and the expansion of the military business empire. The President, a former party boss of Shanghai, has elevated a large number of the affiliates of the Shanghai Faction to crucial positions in the party apparatus since 1992. Last month, Mr Jiang paid a visit to Shanghai in an apparent effort to consolidate his power base before the showdown. Upon Mr Deng's total departure, Mr Jiang will likely follow in the footsteps of former party chairman Hua Guofeng and brandish the New Helmsman's will, which is expected to be along the lines of "With you (Jiang) in charge, my heart is at ease". It will not, however, be plain-sailing. Forces at both ends of the political spectrum -- the dissidents and the remnant Maoists - have mapped out plans to challenge the succession. Both the rightists and leftists will try to win popular support by exposing Mr Deng's responsibility for the massacre -- and Mr Jiang's complicity as one of the patriarch's advisers in the military crackdown. Even assuming that Mr Jiang and such members of the Mainstream Faction as Vice-Premier Zhu could ride out the storm that ensues upon Mr Deng's death -- which will include vicious street demonstrations -- their strengths may be sapped. Should the heirs apparent falter, the men to watch will be leaders of the party's "non-mainstream" faction: former president and retired general Yang Shangkun; former National People's Congress (NPC) chairman Wan Li; Mr Wan's successor as parliament chief, Qiao Shi and Mr Qiao's deputy, Tian Jiyun. Relatively speaking, all four are liberals. Since the Tiananmen Square bloodbath, they have at one time or another been shoved aside by Mr Deng for reasons such as failure to back the armed suppression and readiness to overturn the verdict on the anti-party "turmoil". Last winter, Mr Deng made possibly his last major political decision by appointing Mr Wan a senior spokesman of the council of elders. Analysts said while Mr Wan had accepted the slot, it was doubtful whether he would repay Mr Deng by funnelling support to Mr Jiang. Since falling out with Mr Deng in late 1992, Mr Yang has been plotting a comeback. Early this year, the head of the disgraced Yang Clan toured Guangdong, one of his power bases, with the apparent aim of securing the backing of the nation's most forward-looking province. Since becoming respectively NPC Chairman and Vice-Chairman in April 1993, Mr Qiao and Mr Tian have buttressed their positions by forging links with regional congresses and promoting the heretical idea of the "supervision of the party and government by the legislature". Observers say much depends on whether Messrs Yang, Wan, Qiao and Tian can pool their resources and win the blessings of such "progressive forces" as the party's old liberal wing, the regional "warlords" and the entrepreneurs. A number of luminaries among the party's "bourgeois-liberals", including ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang and former propaganda chief Zhu Houze, have displayed signs of restiveness. In the past year, Mr Zhao and Mr Zhu have toured several provinces -- and been received like heroes by local chieftains. Then there is the attitude of the top brass. On the surface Mr Jiang should feel confident because as CMC Chairman, he had a hand in the appointment of several hundred mid-to top-echelon officers in the past 18 months. The 21st century, however is not on the side of the president. Mr Jiang is a product of the ancient regime rather than a prophet of the emerging economic superpower. The PLA -- and the party -- is increasingly being run by cadres who are hooked to those types of satellite-television programmes that Mr Jiang helped to ban. In the world without a helmsman, the army, like other sectors of society, will cast their vote for whoever could nudge them closer to the Asia-Pacific century.
