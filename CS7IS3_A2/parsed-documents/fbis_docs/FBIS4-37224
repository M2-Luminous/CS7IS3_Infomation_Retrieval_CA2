The presence of Blaise Compaore, Mahamane Ousmane, and I around our brother host Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi this evening is not a mere coincidence. It is in the name of common history and our preoccupations now and in the future, a future we want to build together. We all reject the current misfortune of our continent. We all refuse to believe that our continent is a continent of hatred and violence. What is happening in Rwanda and elsewhere does not reflect the reality of our continent. This misery and hatred are not a fatality, and we have the means to end them. Our presence here also expresses this loud and clear. Dear friend al-Qadhdhafi, we have come here to express our solidarity to you and to your people. [applause] The journey here will never be too long or too uncomfortable. What we are doing this evening has already been done by the 53 African states in Tunis. This was already done by the Nonaligned Movement, by the Arab League, and by the Islamic Conference last year and this year. We hope that our voice will be heard. We will do everything so the message gets through in every scene tomorrow. We have the obligation to do so. The future of the Libyan people concerns us. It is important that conditions be created today to continue the march. It is important that justice should be done today. We stand by your side in this struggle, dear brother. You are aware of our problems and the difficulties we are going through at the moment. We will have to do everything in our power to prevent our countries from sliding toward ethnic, racial, regional, and religious conflicts. We cannot fight the battle for democracy and nationalism on ethnic, racial, regional, and religious basis. Our continent needs social justice and solidarity today. It is with solidarity, hard work, and commitment that we will be able to face this challenge. We need solidarity, and we should move rapidly towards strong integration of our countries. Regional integration should not be an empty word or a mere slogan, otherwise, we condemn our continent to bankruptcy by the end of the century. Regional integration is a must. We believe in it, and we will work for it. If we fail to do so, we and our children will be doomed. [passage omitted] [end recording]
