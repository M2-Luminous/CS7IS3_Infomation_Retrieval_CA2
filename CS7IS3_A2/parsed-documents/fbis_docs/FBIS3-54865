Despite the fact that statements about the "permanent cooperation of democratic forces in the face of a communist threat" are predominant in the majority of national democrats' speeches, optimistic voices are increasingly fading. All the democrats declare their commitment to the idea of a single bloc, yet every one of them acknowledges that such a bloc is far from likely. "The issue of forming blocs," says Ukrainian Republican Party Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn, "is a very subtle one. Talks on it are in progress. I guess that there will be several meetings, at which we will try to come together. The main reservations with regard to the formation of such a bloc are from the left-centrist forces: the Labor Congress and the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine [PDRU]. However, I think that the last word has not been said, and we are still hoping to achieve some type of accord. Especially as PDRU leaders are continuing their consultations with us; I hope we will reach an agreement. If this, to our regret, does not happen, then we will have several blocs: left-centrist, right-centrist, centrist, and, as usual, a socialist and communist bloc. If the extreme rightists will form a bloc, I cannot say, but they are also preparing for the elections." The behavior of democratic forces during the parliamentary elections is a point of great importance, because the electoral campaign will reveal the actual state of matters in the camp of Ukrainian democrats and become a "dress rehearsal" of the fight for the highest state post. Several months ago it seemed that an accord, at least among certain national and democratic groupings, would be achieved. Testifying to this belief was the joint declaration of 18 political parties and trade unions to create an electoral bloc. However, several weeks passed, and some centrifugal trends have become evident within the newly created democratic coalition. At first, the leaders of free trade unions stated that their representatives had not participated in the conference and, therefore, they are not obliged to fulfill the conference's resolutions. Soon afterward, democratic trade unions created a new organization -- the Free Trade Unions of Ukraine -- which is going to participate in the elections on an independent basis. "I can say," says Serhiy Klimov, deputy head of the Independent Trade Union of Miners of Ukraine and head of the trade union at the production amalgamation Donetskivuhilla, who can influence the distribution of 30 deputy seats, "that our trade union, according to the resolution of member organizations, will directly participate in elections. It has been resolved, for the time being, to not attach ourselves to some bloc or political party. We will support independent candidates or put forth our own representatives. I am convinced that 90 percent of those supported by us will win deputy seats. In the future parliament, our lobby will influence the course of legislative change in a direction more preferable to trade unions." This separate position astonished leaders of those organizations which formerly tried to cooperate with trade unions. The creation of the temporary Rukh and trade unions staff on the eve of the adoption of a new electoral law boded well for the permanence of such cooperation. "I do not understand why trade union leaders have not decided to form a single coalition bloc with us," says deputy head of Rukh Oleksandr Lavrynovich. "Everywhere in the world, politics is handled by parties, while trade unions are concerned with the social protection of their members." It is no secret that Rukh leaders cherished great hopes for the bloc with trade unions; they expected to drive with trade unions some portion of the Rukh candidates in eastern and central regions. However, the Supreme Council has adopted a majority-type electoral law entitling trade unions to field their own candidates on a par with parties. It is clear that this circumstance has turned them off from further cooperation with Rukh. Still it seems that Rukh has not lost hope for an agreement with trade unions. The draft electoral program, which was submitted for approval by the Rukh Congress on 10-12 December, devoted an entire chapter to trade union issues. "Trade unions," reads the text, which was clearly intended to catch the fancy of trade unionists, "should become the main guarantors of obeying the law on hired labor, independently of the branch of production or form of property." Thus, while analyzing the formation of preelection blocs, one discerns without difficulty the lack of unity among the democratic parties. At the same time, their political opponents prefer more practical actions. The symptoms of that can be traced in the selection of central and district electoral commission members, as well as in the distribution of electoral districts between the members of the Kravchuk-Plyushch team, which is intended to remove unnatural competition between representatives of this team. For instance, with the exception of Ivan Plyushch, no one from the nomenklatura, which is generally pacified both by its nonparty alignment and "scuffles" between democrats and communists, is going to run in the elections in Barishevski rayon of Kiev Oblast.
