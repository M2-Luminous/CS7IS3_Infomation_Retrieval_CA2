The provincial economic and political situation is fairly good this year. Now, we are actually confronted with a favorable opportunity of reform, opening up, quickening of development. The economic construction continuously develops at a faster speed on the basis of the fast development in 1992. The production and investment growth rates in 1993 surpass the growth rates in the Seventh Five-Year Plan period and the first two years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period. New headway has been made in the enterprise reform dominated by the establishment of the socialist market economic system and some other auxiliary reforms. This year, the province has made the biggest strides for opening itself to both domestic areas and foreign countries. The province registers big increases in the number of newly signed, newly started, and newly completed projects relating to the three types of foreign-funded enterprises as well as in the amounts of foreign exchange earnings through exports by the three types of foreign-funded enterprises. The province's situation characterized by political and social stability has been consolidated and developed. Prominent contradictions, problems, and difficulties are as follows: When compared with the secondary industry which is under rapid development, the primary and tertiary industries are developing at a relatively slower rate. The readjustment of the product mix of the trades with competitiveness fails to keep abreast of the development of the market economy in the course of developing the industrial economy. The pace of opening to the outside world is not fast enough. The security situation is still grim. The thinking and work style of the cadres contingents cannot suit the setup of the grass-roots organizations. These problems should conscientiously be solved in the course of reform and development. The next seven years is a key period for realizing the province's second-step development target. According to the guidelines of the 14th party congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee, and the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fourth Provincial Party Committee as well as the requirements as set forth in the "Hebei Economic Rejuvenation Program," the province set forth three specific targets for reform and development by the end of this century: First, the province should ensure a 500-percent increase in its GNP and strive to register a 700-percent increase, and ensure that the people will become fairly well-off. Second, the province should raise its ranking in the whole country in terms of the main national economic targets and stand among the rank of economically powerful provinces. Third, a new socialist market economic system should take preliminary shape. Viewing the practice in the first three years of the 1990's, we know that the province will not only be able to completely register a 500-percent increase in the GNP but also have prospects for making a 700-percent increase so long as in the next seven years, the increases in the GNP and the input to fixed assets are continuously maintained at 1993's levels. To win a tough battle in reform and development in the next seven years, we should double our efforts and conscientiously achieve 1994 work. The year 1994 is a key year for our country to promote the package economic reform and make breakthroughs in key areas as well as a decisive year for our province to implement the "program for rejuvenating the economy" and realizing the second doubling target. The provincial party committee's general requirements for the 1994 work are: Resolutely implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and the national economic work conference; work closely in line with the main subjects of intensifying reform, expanding the scale of opening up, quickening development, and building Hebei into an economically powerful province; emancipate the mind; seek truth from facts; work hard; and create new special features, make new strides, and create new levels for the building of the two civilizations. The key to realizing these requirements is to further emancipate the mind, renew our ideas, and carry forward the spirit of having the dare to think and do pioneering work. We must not miss the favorable opportunities by hesitating or by adopting a wait-and-see attitude, slow down our development by grumbling and fearing difficulties, widen our differences by making vertical comparison and being self-satisfied, or obliterate our pioneering spirit with internal conflict. In grasping the emancipation of minds at present, we should not hold general and abstract discussions and should excel at seizing practical problems that are affecting reform and development. Through the upgrading of theoretical levels and the renewal of concepts, we should enable the emancipation of minds to be truly implemented in a down-to-earth manner and regard fast or slow progress in dealing with these problems as a yardstick in measuring the extent of emancipating minds. 2. We should earnestly implement central arrangements, reinforce the strength of reforms, accelerate the pace of reforms, and quicken the establishment of socialist market economic systems. In line with implementing the decision on several questions of establishing the socialist market economy systems, which was adopted at the third plenary session, and according to the task of accelerating the establishment of socialist market economic systems, the central authorities will issue a series of important measures for reforms. Conducting reforms in line with these measures will exert important influence on promoting the organic integration between the socialist basic system and the market economy, on promoting enterprises to advance toward markets and to join in market competitions under fair or just conditions, and on emancipating or developing productive forces. This represents a crucial step taken in building the basic frame of socialist market economic systems. Along with implementing these measures, reforms will be shifted from dealing with shallow-rooted problems to deep-rooted ones and will directly deal with the deep-rooted economic relations and contradictions. Reforms conducted by state-owned enterprises will be aimed at shifting from conceding profits to deeply straightening out property rights. Reforms conducted in developing markets will be deepened from chiefly conducting opening up among commodity markets to establishing the markets of essential factors of production. Reforms conducted in macroeconomic management will be carried out by chiefly doing away with the mandatory plan and delegation of power to lower levels by building systems of managerial measures and operational mechanisms. Reforms conducted in tax systems, in financial affairs, and in systems of investing and raising money will be favorable for separating the ownership and business right of enterprises from the official departments and for creating an equal environment for market competition. Therefore, the significance of various reforms we face is very great and important. Party committees and governments at all levels must fully discern the important significance and pay attention to the following several tasks while conducting organizational guidance over reforms: First, we should enhance study and training and organize cadres at all levels, particularly leading cadres at or above the county-section level, to earnestly study the "decision" adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Second, we should enhance propaganda through media and do a good job in propaganda and explaining various reform measures by adopting a lively style loved by the masses. Third, we should foster the idea of "taking the whole country into account" and consciously achieve subordinating lower units to their higher authorities and having the partial observe the whole. Fourth, we should correctly deal with the relation between reform and development and integrate the enforcement of various reforms with the economic development of our own localities and departments to truly reach the goal of emancipating productive forces. Fifth, we should correctly deal with the relation between reform and stability; uphold the mass line; and deeply and successfully conduct the work concerning the masses so as to ensure stability in politics and society. While doing a good job in grasping in an overall way every reform set in the central arrangements, we should concentrate our efforts on grasping reform in the following five aspects next year: 1) By emphasizing the work of boosting large- and medium-sized enterprises, we should shift the operational mechanism of enterprises and establish modern enterprise systems. We should organize 100 large- and medium-sized enterprises in the province to take up the pilot work of enforcing the shareholding system and establish modern enterprise systems with the main contents of enterprise legal person systems, limited responsibility systems, and scientifically organized systems. Small- and medium-sized enterprises that earn little profits or lose money should adopt various measures to turn themselves into enterprises run by the people, while remaining state-owned or public-owned or to lease and sell themselves out. We should actively promote the transformation of the property right system and establish a property right supervision mechanism to make sure that state-owned assets maintain and increase their value, and we should also conscientiously explore specific measures to eliminate enterprises' historical burden and social burden. We should enliven the use of the assets in stock and facilitate the restructuring of the organization of enterprises to promote the fluidity and reshuffling of the property right of enterprises. 2) We should deepen the rural reform, with the focus on developing high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient large-scale agriculture and adjusting the production setup of agriculture. In particular, the following three tasks should be taken: We should stabilize and improve the responsibility system with household-based contracts as the major form and the dual operating system combining unified operation with independent operation and strengthen the unified service function of township and village collective economic organizations. We should establish and improve the socialized service system, greatly develop the integrated management of farming, breeding, and processing; of marketing, supply, and production; and of trade, industry, and agriculture; lead the decentralized household operation to link to the integrated large market, and promote the establishment and development of various rural specialized commodity bases and regional pillar industries. We should greatly develop the rural cooperative shareholding system to enable town and township collective enterprises to change their operating mechanism and establish a new enterprise system more rapidly. We should continue to implement the various policies favorable to agriculture and make unremitting efforts to reduce the burdens on peasants. 3) We should further cultivate and develop urban and rural market system and facilitate the shaping of a integrated, open, competitive, and orderly large market. The general demand is to greatly cultivate and develop the market for essential elements of production, improve the commodity market, and standardize market activities according to law. 4) Party and government organs at all levels should actively facilitate institutional reform and establish the state public service system. They should complete this task in a well-guided and orderly manner in three years beginning next year and see to it that their functions are changed, relations are brought into better balance, organizations are streamlined, and efficiency is improved. 5) We should actively establish the provincial-level macroeconomic regulation and control system in the process to promote the reform of state financial and tax, monetary, investment, and planning systems. 3. We should regard opening to the outside world and developing the export-oriented economy as a strategic task to promote the entire economic development. Opening to the outside world means to open our doors to conduct extensive economic, political, scientific and educational, and cultural exchanges and cooperation with the countries and regions outside the country and outside the border. Not only should we fully assimilate and use all the advanced technology and experiences of the world that are useful to us, but also, guided by the world market, we should actively develop the export-oriented economy and participate in international division of work, international exchanges, and competition of the international market. Through bilateral exchanges and cooperation, we should realize the rational distribution of funds, personnel, technology, and other essential elements of production. Opening to the outside world and developing the export-oriented economy enable us to effectively use the numerous favorable development opportunities provided to us by the international economic environment, to rapidly promote the adjustment and improvement of our industrial composition and product mix, and to raise the starting point and quality of our economic strategies, link with the international market more rapidly, and promote the entire economic development and social progress through the breakthrough in the export-oriented economy. To build an economically strong province, we should first build ourselves into a strong province in opening up. All trades and professions and all localities should open to the outside world more rapidly, use foreign trade to lead the domestic trade, use domestic trade to promote foreign trade, and strive for a faster and greater development in the export-oriented economy. First, we should persistently pay attention to and develop foreign capital utilization, foreign trade, and foreign economic relations simultaneously. We should adopt various channels and various measures to introduce foreign capital to enterprises of various ownerships and enterprises in various fields. Focusing on using foreign capital to transplant and technically transform large- and medium-sized enterprises, we should accelerate enterprises' technical transformation projects and strive to complete a number of such projects next year. All levels, all departments, and all economic and noneconomic departments should develop their respective advantages to strengthen ties with international consortia, large enterprises, monetary organizations, and noted figures and to build the bridge for bringing in foreign capital and loans from abroad so as to strive to make next year's amount of foreign capital we use double that of this year. We should truly implement the idea of developing large-scale foreign trade with everyone's efforts; pool the efforts of all fields; export through numerous ports; increase the growth rates of export volume, foreign exchange earning; and foreign exchange received to the same level as the growth rate of Hebei's gross national product, and make the growth rate of local ordinary trade and exports of the "three types of foreign-funded enterprises" equal to or surpass the national average. We should actively develop the tourist business involving foreigners. We should greatly intensify labor service export and contracts for projects abroad, provide great support for the localities and enterprises with favorable conditions to export technology, equipment, and funds, and develop overseas enterprises to change the backward outlook of such work. Second, we should make continuous efforts to develop the coastal areas of Bohai Sea and the areas around Beijing and Tianjin, achieve breakthroughs in key fields more rapidly, and promote this work in an orderly manner. Leaders of the four cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, Cangzhou, and Shijiazhuang, which are on the forefront of the opening up of the coastal areas of Bohai Sea, should try every means to achieve some significant breakthroughs in opening to the outside world and speed up the change of the focus from domestic-oriented economy to export-oriented economy. Relying chiefly on Beijing and Tianjin, we should promote multidirectional opening to the localities of the country and, in the meantime, promote introduction of investment from abroad through the lateral cooperation at home in order to lead a great development in opening to the outside world. Third, the province, as well as all cities and prefectures, should define their work priorities and act in coordination and pool efforts in opening to the outside world. From now on, cities, prefectures, and enterprises should gradually become the major participators in establishing foreign economic ties and introducing foreign capital from abroad. Beginning next year, the province should devote major efforts to the priorities of work, namely establishing ties with major customers, bringing in large projects from abroad, and winning the support of the various large central ministries and commissions taking charge of the work involving foreign countries, in addition to holding one or two large investment-inviting activities every year so that the scale and level of opening to the outside world can be improved continuously. 4. Every means should be adopted to make the 1994 economic construction at the same development level of 1993 or surpass it. The major targets of Hebei's 1994 economic development has been defined, but, in carrying out actual work, we should strive to reach or surpass the 14-percent gross national product increase registered in 1993. First, we should aim at achieving a fairly comfortable standard of living when drawing up overall plans for rural work. Efforts should be devoted chiefly to the following three tasks. 1) We should speed up the development of high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture. In grain production next year, we should ensure steady growth, and, in cotton production, we should be determined to change the large-scale decline of output due to failure to fulfill planting acreage plans. After this, we should adjust and optimize agricultural structure more rapidly in line with market demand in order to improve efficiency and increase the income of peasants. 2) In line with the principle of attaching equal importance to development and improvement, we should continue to speed up township enterprise development. By carrying out technical transformation and bringing in funds from abroad, we should support and build a number of export-oriented township enterprises that adopt new technology, produce good products, and create high efficiency, expand their scale, and develop enterprise groups. We should draw up overall plans to coordinate township enterprise development with the construction of small industrial zones and small cities, and promote the concentration of township enterprises in geographical arrangements to improve the intensive management level. We should establish a strict mechanism of incentives and link the interests of township and village cadres with the development of local rural economy, especially the development of township enterprises. 3) We should achieve success in family planning to improve per capita production and per capita income. We should conscientiously implement the system of responsibility for population targets and make family planning a decisive criterion for appraisal of work. Second, by regarding as an emphasis the readjustment of structure and the increase of economic results, we should accelerate the development of industrial enterprises. We should guide enterprises to study, calculate, and open markets; to establish a mechanism with rapid and flexible market reaction; to enhance their sale strategy; and to improve their production in a timely manner according to development and changes in the market. We should reinforce the strength in structure readjustment and guide enterprises to improve their products along the direction of high- and-new technologies, fine quality, famous trade mark, standardized operation, and international market standards. Efforts should be made to continuously enforce the "dragon-tiger plan" and the "plan for establishing a large number of enterprises in six fields," to achieve in imposing clear duties on these enterprises and having them be closely coordinated, to promote progress in enforcing the two plans each year, and to carry forward the plans through to the end. We should organize 100 senior specialists to spend one year on investigation and study so as to enable them to put forward suggestions and plans for our province to readjust product mix during the "Ninth Five-Year Plan" period. We should have the out-dated enterprises enhance their technical renovations. From 1994 to the beginning of 1997, our province will have its industrial enterprises covered by the budget conduct technical renovations in line with the demands of products' renewal so as to upgrade the industrial quality as a whole. Third, we should adopt every possible way and means to overcome funding difficulties and accelerate the construction of infrastructure and key projects. We should strive for investments with fundamental and competitive characters which conform with the state industrial policies, as well as for the credit funds provided by the state-owned police-lending banks and the monetary institutions. Meanwhile, by having our feet firmly planted in the province, we should extensively open the channels for raising funds. Efforts should be made to vigorously enforce the shareholding system and to establish shareholding companies especially in charge of raising shares for construction projects. We should formulate as soon as possible the "provisional regulations on management over raising social funds," standardize the act of raising funds, and guide the enforcement of special policies on raising funds for key construction projects. Fourth, we should continuously encourage and support the development of individually run and privately owned enterprises in both urban and rural areas. The united front work departments, the federations of industry and commerce, and the industrial and commercial bureaus at all levels should be closely coordinated and do a good job in line with their work division in rendering services and creating a fine environment and condition for the rapid development of individually run and privately owned enterprises. Fifth, we should accelerate urban construction with the main tasks of building residential houses for urban people and promote progress in modernizing urban areas. In line with enforcing the state "1994-1996 project of having the people live in peace," a good job should be done in dealing with the housing problems encountered by the households that don't have homes, whose per capita housing acreage is under four square meters, and that are cramped with adult children. We should regard teachers of middle and primary schools, medical and cultural workers, and the staff members and workers of small industrial and commercial enterprises as special targets for assistance. We should work out measures to help them deal with their housing problems. Efforts should be made to actively promote reform in the housing system of urban areas and to enforce the rational division among the state, collectives, and individuals of the burden of housing construction. By meeting the needs of opening up, we should enhance the construction of infrastructures and reinforce the bearing capacity and attraction of urban areas in opening themselves to the outside world. Sixth, we should accelerate the development of tertiary industry. By proceeding from their reality, localities and departments should formulate rational plans for developing the industry; define their work emphasis; actively conduct guidance; and accelerate the development of this industry. We should concentrate our efforts on firmly grasping the development of industries and trades that are extremely short and that should be developed urgently. Efforts should be made to have the state-owned, collectively run, individually run, privately owned, and foreign-funded enterprises develop the tertiary industry simultaneously and to adopt multiple and flexible styles to make a greater breakthrough in developing this industry. Seventh, we should accelerate the pace of integrating science, technology, and education with the economy and improve as soon as possible the province's backward outlook in science, technology, and education. Through efforts made in 1994 and 1995, we will enable a large number of large and medium-sized enterprises to establish their scientific research units that are actually able to develop new technologies and products. Efforts should be made to stabilize and reinforce the contingents of agricultural scientific and technological personnel, and to set up or improve the network of popularizing the agricultural technologies. In particular, we should organize or establish a large number of service organizations for science, agriculture, and trade so as to form a "unified" system. Through the elimination caused by the competition we should support, by aiming at the survived key projects, the development and construction conducted by the high- and-new tech industrial parks and improve or develop a large number of technical markets. We should greatly encourage the establishment of a number of non-governmental scientific research institutes, non-governmental scientific and technological enterprises, scientific and technological enterprises owned by the state but run by the people, and "three types of foreign-funded enterprises" engaged mainly in scientific and technological development. Meanwhile, we should pay attention to education next year. The focus is that colleges and universities should deepen the educational reform and succeed in the adjustment of their layout and curricula; vocational and technical education should be consolidated, improved, and upgraded from the current level, and 100 vocational education centers newly established; urban adult education should continue to be made successful, and the transfer of rural redundant labor forces should be resolved through rural adult education; great attention should be given to elementary education to prevent it from declining or being affected; and the "teachers' law" should be conscientiously enforced, and mistakes in wage payments to teachers should no longer occur beginning next year. 5. We should adhere to the strategic principle of attending to two tasks simultaneously and being competent in both and should clarify the tasks, systematize the work, and specify the responsibility for building the socialist spiritual civilization and improving democracy and the legal system. In line with this demand, we should focus on the following work next year: First, we should continue deepening the anticorruption struggle. The general requirements on next year's work of building a clean government and opposing corruption are to prevent recurrence of the problems that have already been corrected, step up efforts to address the problems that have not been thoroughly solved, and take remedial measures to make up for perfunctory work; and do a better job in addressing other problems that the masses are most dissatisfied with. New requirements should be put forward based on new conditions on leading cadres' honesty and self-restraint; measures should be intensified to step up the investigation and handling of major and serious cases; the work to ban unwarranted pooling of funds, wanton requisition of donations, and exaction of fees should be carried out through to the end until actual results are achieved; and conscientious efforts should be made to straighten out and thoroughly correct the problems of some leading cadres at and above the county level who vied with each other to buy deluxe cars, used public cars for private purposes in violation of regulations, wasted public funds in lavish wining and dining and buying gifts, and abused power to occupy excessively large houses, build private houses, or decorate private houses with public funds. Second, we should make great efforts to check four unhealthy trends. We should strictly investigate and resolutely put an end to the four unhealthy trends of abusing power for extortion, swindling, cheating customers, and telling lies, making false records and accounts, and selling fake and inferior commodities, which have seriously affected Hebei's reform and opening up and its image in foreign countries; local and trade protectionism; as well as partiality in law enforcement for the benefits of friends and relatives. Third, we should be more resolute in eliminating pornography, the abduction of women and children, and the "six vices." We should adopt the legal means to sternly crack down on all ugly phenomena, such as production and sales of pornographic products, prostitution and visits to prostitutes, abduction and trafficking of women and children, gambling, and sex business. Fourth, we should continue the struggle of "dealing strict blows." We should make unremitting efforts to sternly crack down on serious criminal and economic offenses and organize special struggles in a timely manner to correct the practice of replacing punishment according to criminal law with fines and excessive leniency in punishment. Public security departments, procuratorates, courts, and judicial departments should strengthen coordination and cooperation to successfully perform their function of dictatorship. Fifth, we should achieve success in comprehensively improving public security. Through the comprehensive improvement activities, we should reduce incidence of crimes, juvenile delinquency, and serious mishaps and prevent the ugly phenomena from spreading in society. Responsibility for the targets of the comprehensive improvement activities should be resolutely assigned to units and individuals. Sixth, we should intensify the maintenance of stability among the grass roots. In regard to the instable factors, the grass-roots party and government organizations should realistically assume responsibility in order to nip problems in the bud so as to avoid their expansion and a worsened situation. All localities should strengthen the work of handling visitors and incoming letters from the masses; strengthen calculation and prevention; and resolutely end and reduce the rising tendencies of collective visits, particularly collective visits to the province and Beijing. It is necessary to set up and perfect the setup of the grass-roots security and civil mediation organizations so as to strengthen the improvement of social order by the masses. Seventh, we should pay attention to the work toward nationalities and religions. We should pay attention to implementing policies for nationalities and religions. It is necessary to vigorously promote and support the development of the regional economy in the areas inhabited by the minority nationalities. The proper religious activities should be respected and protected. The unlawful activities of using underground religious forces to disturb and damage social stability should strictly be watched and legally be eliminated and attacked. Eighth, we should make big progress in setting up the legal system. In line with the requirements of the new situation and according to the order of importance and urgency, the provincial people's congress and the provincial government should work out plans to quicken the pace of economic legislation. Simultaneously, we should conscientiously achieve propaganda and education on the legal system and examine and supervise the enforcement of laws. Ninth, we should improve and strengthen media and propaganda. We should pay full attention to and bring into play the propaganda departments and the mass media's functions for encouraging, inspiring, and guiding the masses; and strengthen the propaganda and education on patriotism, collectivism, socialism, Comrade Jiang Z emin's pioneering spirit, and revolutionary traditions. We should intensify the propaganda on opening to the outside world and expand the influence over the outside world. We should continue to regulate and control the guidance of mass media and do a good job in running the press, broadcasting stations, and television stations. Tenth, we should vigorously carry out the mass cultural and sports activities. We should build and rebuild some basic cultural and sports facilities and pay attention to building cultural facilities in enterprises, neighborhood committees, and campuses. We should organize more high-quality and high-level performance and competition activities and conduct various kinds of mass cultural and sports activities that various kinds of people are able to participate in. Eleventh, we should further conduct the activities of creating civilized units and civilized villages. In conducting the army- civilian joint civility campaign, the policemen-civilian joint civility campaign, and the campaign of striving to be "double-support models," we should closely proceed from reality and pay attention to real efficiency. We should vigorously disseminate and popularize Jidong cement plant's experience in creating a civilized unit and cultivating civilized staff members and workers. We should vigorously advocate and organize such autonomous organizations as mass "wedding and funeral councils," "moral assessment societies," and "antigambling women's societies;" and carry forward good folk customs. Twelve, the mass organizations should bring into play their functions for building the socialist spiritual civilization. Under the leadership of the party committees, mass organizations should positively engage themselves in the construction of spiritual civilization, bring their roles into play, and organize the activities with their own characteristics. We should go to the grass roots to understand the people's thinking, expectations, opinions, and requirements and conduct the ideological and political work among the masses. All departments concerned under the provincial party committee and the provincial government should define targets for the fulfillment of the aforementioned 12 tasks, define responsibility to each unit and person, and also set up a strict, scientific, and simple examination and assessment method. 6. The emphasis of party building should be placed on successfully conducting various basic work and upgrading the basic quality of the politics and careers of cadres. We should have the party manage its affairs and the first leading personnel of party committees should attach importance on grasping party building. We should make all out efforts to enhance the construction of leading bodies and of cadres' contingent as a whole by regarding as a target the work of upgrading the leadership level of leading bodies and the basic quality of cadres' contingent and by proceeding from first dealing with existing problems. First, we should regard the study of Volume 3 of Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the fundamental task in building party organizations and in having the cadres' contingent carry out ideological and work style construction. We should realistically do a good job in firmly grasping the study. We should stress the study carried out with a systematic manner; accurately understand and master its fundamental ideology and viewpoints; pay attention to integrating the theoretical study with experience summation; and integrate the study with that of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's scientific attitude, pioneering spirit, and revolutionary morale, with that of the decision adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and with the promotion of programs in reform, opening up, and economic construction. Localities, departments, and individuals should strive to successfully deal with their prominent problems in line with the integration between theories and practice. Through steady study, we should vigorously upgrade the level of cadres at all levels. Second, we should realistically enhance the construction of leading bodies at all levels. 1) We should adopt multiple styles and measures to enhance the education conducted among cadres at all levels and particularly among the leading cadres at or above the county level or of large and medium-sized enterprises with regard to the basic knowledge of socialist market economic systems. 2) We should strictly enforce the democratic centralism and uphold or perfect the specific systems under democratic centralism so as to ensure the smooth circulation of orders issued by the central authorities and the provincial party committee and in order to maintain the unity fostered by leading bodies. 3) On the premise of maintaining the basic stability of leading bodies and in line with the needs of building leading bodies and developing their work, we should conduct consolidation in a planned, step by step manner among a number of them and carry out personnel exchanges of cadres. We should relentlessly and resolutely consolidate the leading bodies that have indulged in disunity, still have not mended their mistakes through education, adversely affected the work, long lagged behind in work, and have committed some serious problems. 4) A good job should be done in vigorously training reserve cadres and upgrading their quality. We should dispatch a large number of reserve cadres to enterprises or rural villages to have them be trained there and upgrade or increase their working capability in practice. We should increase the proportion of reserve cadres at the provincial, city-prefectural, and county levels, who come from the large and medium-sized enterprises, the scientific research units, and the higher educational institutions. 5) We should explore and formulate a set of appropriate policies and methods to foster a grand and outstanding contingent of entrepreneurs, appropriate for market competition. We should attach importance on building the contingent of entrepreneurs as we did for the contingents of local party and government leading cadres. We should not rigidly adhere to a form in selecting or introducing outstanding talented personnel and adopt effective measures of encouragement to stabilize the contingent of entrepreneurs, to create a fine environment for the contingent's healthy growth, and to enable a large number of outstanding talented personnel to show their talent. Third, we should enhance the managerial systems of cadres and establish an effective mechanism that can appraise the cadres' achievements in a scientific way and employ cadres in line with their achievements. The provincial party committee has decided that effective from 1994 the province will conduct a comprehensive appraisal at the end of every year according to the "work outline" of the provincial party committee and the demand set by the provincial people's government with regard to the attainment of certain objectives over the work done by various departments and commissions under the provincial party committee, by various departments and bureaus under the provincial people's government, and by various cities and prefectures; as well as over the work done by leading bodies and cadres. Meanwhile, appraised results will be regarded as the main basis for replenishing and reinforcing leading bodies and for carrying out rational readjustment among cadres. Those with outstanding results should be commended; those with necessary conditions should be promoted, put in important positions, and awarded; those who are sluggish in making progress, stagnant for many years, or even drop in ranking should be given a yellow plate as warning and should change their outlook within a fixed time; and those who make no improvement in work, are seriously disunited, have unhealthy trends and many problems, practice fraud, incite great dissatisfaction among the masses, and cause serious problems that have adverse effect on the country should be resolutely reshuffled. In short, those with achievements will have official posts, and those without will not. Only when we promote the cadres who truly have political integrity and ability and have scored achievements and demote those who have not, will we have hope for building an economically strong province. For this reason, organization departments should first straighten out their work styles, appoint personnel on their merits, and never appoint personnel by favoritism or appoint personnel to pursue benefits, not to speak of appointing personnel according to their factions. Organization departments at all levels should further emancipate the mind, update their concepts, proceed from the "three advantages" in doing everything, and evaluate and organize leading bodies and select and use cadres to meet the needs of reform, opening up, and economic development so as to serve as good advisers and assistants to party committees. Fourth, we should attach great importance to improving grass-roots organizations and exert great efforts to strengthen basic work. In the work to improve the party's grass-roots organizations, rural areas are the weak link, and attention should be concentrated on it next year. 1) We should solve the problems of party branches whose work has paralyzed or half paralyzed, which account for 3 percent of Hebei's total rural party branches. Regarding the five types of villages pointed out in the provincial party committee's "work outlines," we should successfully rectify and transform them according to set targets a group at a time. 2) We should attach importance to improving party organizations of township enterprises. Township enterprises without party organizations should step up efforts to establish them; and those with party organizations should improve their systems and start their activities as soon as possible and enable them to play a good role as a political guarantee. 3) We should adopt various measures to train all rural grass-roots cadres through various forms in two to three years. 4) We should study and formulate a package of systematic methods for management for the cultivation, promotion, appraisal, appointment and removal, training, reward and punishment, and post retirement benefits of rural cadres. 5) We should greatly encourage cadres at various levels, including grass-roots cadres, to develop the work styles of doing practical work and telling the truth and to refrain from switching their behavior according to the intention of higher levels and the expression of leaders, boasting by exaggerating about their experiences and achievements, and telling lies and making false records and accounts to harm the party, the state, and themselves. "Fake and inferior" activities in leadership work are even more harmful than the "fake and inferior" products of enterprises, and they should be resolutely eliminated. Cadres at all levels should greatly develop the spirit of trying to distinguish themselves and be the best and develop the work style of seeking truth.
