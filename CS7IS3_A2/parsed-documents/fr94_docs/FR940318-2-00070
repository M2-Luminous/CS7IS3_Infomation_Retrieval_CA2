FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary M. McLaughlin, Federal Reserve Board Clearance Officer (202-452-3829), Division of Research and Statistics, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551. Gary Waxman, OMB Desk Officer (202-395-7340), Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, New Executive Office Building, room 3208, Washington, DC 20503 Final approval under OMB delegated authority of the extension with revisions (or the implementation) of the following reports: 1. Report title: Weekly Report of Eurodollar Liabilities Held by Selected U.S. Addressees at Foreign Offices of U.S. Banks Agency form number: FR 2050 OMB Docket number: 7100-0068 Frequency: Weekly Reporters: Large foreign branches and banking subsidiaries of U.S. banks Annual reporting hours: 11,284 Estimated average hours per response: 3.5 Number of respondents: 62 branches, 0 banking subsidiaries Small businesses are not affected. General description of report: This information collection is voluntary [12 U.S.C. 248(a)(2), 353 et seq. , 461, 602, and 625] and is given confidential treatment [5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)]. This report collects data on overnight and term Eurodollars held by certain U.S. residents in selected foreign branches of U.S. commercial banks and Edge and agreement corporations. The data are used for the construction of the Eurodollar components of the monetary aggregates and for analysis of banks' liability management practices. The report has been renamed and now includes data formerly collected on the Weekly Report of Foreign Branch Liabilities to, and Custody Holdings for, U.S. Addressees (FR 2077; OMB No. 7100-0176), which has been discontinued. The reporting panel has been broadened to include foreign banking subsidiaries, although currently none meets the cutoff. The panel will be composed of those institutions with a weekly average of $200 million in total Eurodollar liabilities to U.S. addressees other than depository institutions and all money market mutual funds. Other changes include the following: (1) The overnight Eurodollar item collected on the FR 2050 and the two term Eurodollar items collected on the FR 2077 are now collected in the body of the new combined report, with the following redefinitions: (a) The item on negotiable term Eurodollar holdings held in custody has been redefined to exclude those held for depository institutions, consistent with the exclusion of depository institution holdings from the other two items; and (b) All three items have been redefined to also exclude Eurodollar liabilities to all money market mutual funds, which had been included. (2) A memorandum item has been added to the report to segregate overnight Eurodollars held by institution-only money market mutual funds. (3) The two term Eurodollar data items have been expanded from single-day (Wednesday) coverage to daily data reported weekly, consistent with the coverage of the overnight Eurodollar item. Daily data also are collected for the new memorandum item. The combined report will be implemented as of the reporting week beginning Tuesday, March 29, 1994. 2. Report title: Quarterly Report of Assets and Liabilities of Large Foreign Offices of U.S. Banks Agency form number: FR 2502q OMB Docket number: 7100-0079 Frequency: Quarterly Reporters: Large foreign branches and banking subsidiaries of U.S. banks Annual reporting hours: 9,045 Estimated average hours per response: 3.75 Number of respondents: 588 branches, 15 banking subsidiaries Small businesses are not affected. General description of report: This information collection is required [12 U.S.C. 248(a)(2), 353 et seq. , 461, 602, and 625] and is given confidential treatment [5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)]. This report collects asset and liability information from foreign branches and subsidiaries of U.S. commercial banks and Edge and agreement corporations. The data are used in the construction of the monetary aggregates and to monitor flows of funds between banks and their branches. The report also provides information on foreign branch claims to individual countries, which aids in monitoring the total exposure of U.S. banks to individual countries. Also, data from this report are combined with data from the Department of the Treasury to form the basis of information that is compiled by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) from all G-10 countries on international banking market developments. The report has been renamed and now includes some of the data formerly collected on the Monthly Report on Foreign Branch Asset and Liabilities (FR 2502; OMB No. 7100-0078), which has been discontinued. The reporting panel has been broadened to include large foreign banking subsidiaries. The FR 2502 items on customer detail on transactions with U.S. residents and claims and liabilities vis-a-vis other non-U.S. offices of the parent have been reformatted and are collected in the memoranda section. Data on Eurodollar liabilities, both overnight and term, payable to certain U.S. addressees, which excluded liabilities held by depository institutions, have been redefined to also exclude liabilities held by all money market mutual funds. An item has been added to collect liabilities held by institution-only money market mutual funds. The report's overnight and term Eurodollar items have been expanded from single-day coverage to five days of data. The remaining items from the former FR 2502 report have been dropped, resulting in a 66 percent net decrease in reporting burden. 3.

The Application for Employment with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System collects information needed to determine the qualifications, suitability, and availability of applications for employment with the Board and of current Board employees for reassignment, reinstatement, transfer, or promotion. The completed form may also be used to examine, rate, or assess the applicant's qualifications and to determine if the applicant is entitled to rights or benefits under certain laws and regulations.

The Federal Reserve Board utilizes these two procurement forms in obtaining competitive proposals and contracts. Depending upon the product or services for which the Federal Reserve Board is seeking competitive bids, the vendor or supplier is requested to provide either basic price information for providing the goods or services (Request for Price Quotation) or a document covering not only price information, but the means of performing a particular service and a description of the qualification of the contractor's staff who will perform the service (Request for Proposal). 2.
