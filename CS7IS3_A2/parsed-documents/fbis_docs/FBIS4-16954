He stressed in his report that Russia intended to further maintain the Black Sea Fleet in a proper condition as one of the most efficient armed units for the defence of its southers borders. We shall do our utmost for turning Sevastopol into the main base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Grachev said. The Russian defence minister confered on the officers, who showed especially good performance, the military ranks, that were due to them, earlier than planned before. These included the commander of the Cheleken, the hydrographic vessel that transported hydrographic equipment from Odessa. Grachev had to cool the temper of some angry officers at the meeting. For instance, Colonel Lobov from the Air Force of the Black Sea Fleet said that pilots intended to leave no planes to the Ukrainian side, to take off without permission and fly to Russia.
