Seven dissidents involved in the Tiananmen Square massacre signed a petition submitted to the government by Wang Dan, the former student leader of China's 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations. [passage omitted] Commenting on the petition at his weekly press briefing Thursday, foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said the "best judgement of an event... is history itself. For the past five years China has been enjoying political stability, economic development, and the living standards of its people have been improving constantly." China and its people wanted this to continue in the interest of peace and stability in the region, he added. The pro-democracy movement began April 15 and mobilised millions of Chinese before being crushed by the People's Liberation Army in central Beijing on June 4 1989. According to an official version of events, 300 people died. Dissidents and independent observers said several thousands were killed in Beijing and the provinces. Wang's petition said: "This movement was a popular, patriotic and democratic movement, based around students. We were reasonable and non-violent throughout." As proof of just how worried the authorities are as the Tiananmen anniversary draws closer, Beijing police have been placed on permanent alert and have beefed up patrols, especially around the main campuses and the huge square itself, which was occupied by students in 1989. University professors have received orders to be especially vigilant in the run-up to the annniversary. In order to prevent public commemorations, the authorities have detained a number of people in the past weeks, especially members of the Chinese Association of Human Rights in Shanghai. The most famous dissident, Wei Jingsheng, has been detained by police at a government residence in a Beijing suburb. [passage omitted]
