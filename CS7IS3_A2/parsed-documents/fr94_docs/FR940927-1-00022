FR940927-1-00022 FR940927-1-00008 II. Proposed Amendment By letter dated September 14, 1994, Oklahoma submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative record No. OK&hyph;964). Oklahoma submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The SOAP provisions of the Oklahoma Coal Rules and Regulations that Oklahoma proposes to revise are: Section 795.6, eligibility for assistance; Part 795.9, program services and data requirements; and §795.12, applicant liability. Specifically, Oklahoma proposes to revise its rules pertaining to an applicant's eligibility for SOAP assistance at §795.6(a)(2) by requiring the applicant to establish that the probably total actual and attributed production from all locations during any consecutive 12-month period either during the term of the permit or during the first 5 years after issuance of the permit, whichever period is shorter, will not exceed 300,000 tons and at §795.6(a)(2)(iv) to require that attributed production will include all coal produced by operations owned by members of the applicant's family and the applicant's relatives, unless it is established that there is no direct or indirect business relationship between or among them. Oklahoma proposes to revise its rules pertaining to the kinds of data collected and the results furnished to the SOAP program administrator at (1) Section 795.9(b)(2) to include the geologic drilling and the statement of the results of test borings or core samplings for the proposed permit area; (2) Section 795.9(b)(3) to include the collection of archeological information required by section 779.12(b) and any other archeological and historical information required by the regulatory authority, and the preparation of plans necessitated thereby; (3) Section 795.9(b)(4) to include the collection of site-specific resource information and production of protection and enhancement plans for fish and wildlife habitats and other environmental values required by the regulatory authority under §780.16 and any other applicable regulations; (4) Section 795.9(3)(5) to include pre-blast surveys if requested under §816.62(b); and (5) Section 795.9(3)(6) to include the development of cross-section maps and plans required under §779.25. Oklahoma proposes to revise its rules pertaining to the applicant's liability at §§795.12(a) (2) and (3) to provide that the applicant shall reimburse the Department of Mines (Department) for the cost of SOAP laboratory services performed pursuant to Part 795 if the program administrator finds that the applicant's actual and attributed annual production of coal for all locations exceeds 300,000 tons during any consecutive 12-month period either during the term of the permit for which assistance is provided or during the first 5 years after issuance of the permit, whichever period is shorter, or if the permit is sold, transferred, or assigned to another person and the transferee's total annual and attributed production exceeds the 300,000-ton annual production limit during any consecutive 12-month period of the remaining term of the permit.
