In an interview with reporter Jack Katzenell, Beilin said the Palestinian administration is still in diapers, but it must disarm the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorists. Today's terrorists' attacks were both sad and serious, Beilin said. [Begin Beilin recording] It is sad because of the people who were killed and injured, and it is serious also because of the fact that the Palestinians did not react properly to this event. What they have to do is to claim responsibility to assure that they are doing their utmost in order to disarm those people, and to pursue them, and to find them. The difficulties are there, we know that, we don't dismiss it, but it is now the duty of the Palestinian police to deal with the matter, to find the people, and to do whatever possible in order to prevent a recurrence of those events in the future.
