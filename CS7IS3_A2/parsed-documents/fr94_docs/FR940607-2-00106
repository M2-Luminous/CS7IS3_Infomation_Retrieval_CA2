FR940607-2-00106 FR940607-2-00067 Applicants' Representations 1. Each of the Funds is a Maryland corporation that is registered under the Act as an open-end, management investment company. Two of the Funds (the ``Money Market Funds'') are offered to the public at net asset value with no sales charge. The other Funds (the ``Load Funds'') are offered to the public at net asset value plus a sales charge. Each Load Fund has adopted a distribution plan (the ``Distribution Plan'') under rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act, which permits each Load Fund to pay the Distributor up to 0.25% of that Fund's average daily net assist value on an annual basis. 2. The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and serves as the investment adviser of each of the Funds. The Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Distributor. The Distributor is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Principal Mutual Life Insurance Company. The Distributor, a registered broker-dealer, serves as the principal underwriter for each of the Funds. 3. Applicants seek to implement multi-class distribution arrangements (the ``Multi-Class System'') for each of the Funds. Under the Multi-Class System, each Fund will issue two classes of shares. All shares outstanding as of the time of implemention of the Multi-Class System will be designated as ``Class A'' shares. The offering price of Class A shares of a Load Fund purchased in amounts of less than $1 million will be net asset value plus a front-end sales charge. Class A shares of the Load Funds will be subject to the Distribution Plan currently in effect, as modified to accommodate the mutli-class structure. Class A shares of the Money Market Funds will be sold at net asset value, and will not be subject to a Distribution Plan. 4. Under the Multi-Class System, each Fund will create an additional class of shares designated as ``Class B'' shares. Class B shares will be subject to a Distribution Plan fee of 1% of average daily net assets on an annual basis, of which up to 0.25% will be paid to dealers' registered representatives as a service fee. The remainder of the Distribution Plan fee on Class B shares will be used primarily to reimburse the Distributor for commissions paid to dealers and registered representatives in connection with sales of Class B shares. Class B shares of the Money Market Funds can be acquired only through exchanges for Class B shares of other Funds. 5. Class B shares also will be subject to a CDSC of up to 4% for a period of six years. The amount of any CDSC imposed upon a redemption of Class B shares will be computed as a percentage of the lesser of the value of the redeemed shares at the time of purchase or their value at redemption. The holding period and amount of the CDSC, and the magnitude of the purchases to which it applies are each subject to change. No CDSC will be imposed on Class B shares: (a) Purchased with reinvested income dividends or capital gains distributions, (b) purchased more than six years prior to the date of the redemption, or (c) acquired through an exchange for other Class B shares, if the exchanged Class B shares would not have been assessed a CDSC upon redemption. 6. Applicants proposed to waive any CDSC that otherwise would be applicable to a redemption of Class B shares in connection with shares redeemed: (a) Due to the death or disability, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code (the ``Code''), of a shareholder; (b) from retirement plans to satisfy minimum distribution rules under the Code; (c) to pay surrender charges; (d) to pay retirement plan fees; (e) involuntarily from small balance accounts (values of less than $300); (f) through a systematic withdrawal plan that permits 10% of the value of a shareholder's Class B shares of a particular Fund on January 1 of each year to be withdrawn automatically in equal monthly installments throughout the year without payment of the otherwise applicable CDSC; or (g) from a retirement plan to assure the plan complies with section 401(k) and 401(m) of the Code. 7. Class A shares of the Load Funds will be sold with no sales charge to persons who reinvest, within 60 days, the proceeds of redemptions of Class B shares of the Load Funds on which the CDSC was waived because of the death or disability of the original shareholder. 8. Any Class B shares purchased will convert automatically to Class A shares seven years after the end of the month of the date of their purchase. At the same time, a pro rata portion of all shares purchased through reinvestment of dividends and distributions will convert into Class A shares, with that portion determined by the ratio that the shareholder's Class B shares converting into Class A shares bears to the shareholder's total Class B shares not acquired through dividends and distributions. The conversion of Class B shares into Class A shares will be subject to the availability of an opinion of counsel or Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling to the effect that the conversion does not constitute a taxable event. 9. Exchanges for shares of another Fund generally will be permitted only for shares of the same class. However, to facilitate automatic exchanges used by some investors to effect a dollar-cost averaging strategy, Class B shares of the Load Funds may be acquired in exchange for Class A shares of Princor Cash Management Fund, Inc. that were purchased without payment of a sales load. All exchanges will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act.
