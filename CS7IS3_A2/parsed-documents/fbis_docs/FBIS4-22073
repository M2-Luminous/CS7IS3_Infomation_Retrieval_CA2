The agreement has been blessed by the leaders of the two movements. On this agreement and its repercussions, Sa'id Mu'addi spoke with Rashid Abu-Shibak, a Fatah leader in the Gaza Strip. [begin recording] Mu'addi: Mr. Rashid Abu-Shibak, a leader of Fatah in the Gaza Strip, what does the Hamas-Fatah agreement stipulate? Abu-Shibak: The agreement is between the Fatah Hawks and the 'Izzl-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions. It has six major points. The first talks about an immediate halt to defamation campaigns between the two factions, while ensuring everybody's right to free expression, as well as holding further brotherly dialogue between the two factions in the interests of the Palestinian masses. The second point speaks about renouncing differences and bloody conflicts and steering clear of the use of violence as a means to resolve differences. This point also emphasizes constructive dialogue between the sons of our people. The third point is that as of the date of this agreement, the pursued and armed men on both sides shall be forbidden to interfere and resolve organizational and family problems. This task will be assumed by national and Islamic reconciliation committees. The fourth point states that in view of the deteriorating economic conditions, it has been decided that a strike in the event of the martyrdom of any citizen shall last only one day in his vicinity. The rest of the areas will declare mourning but will not be on strike. Fifth, male and female students are asked to attend classes on strike days, because we do not want our students to miss classes. Finally, Fatah and Hamas have decided to stop the killing of agents as of the date of this agreement for one month and to declare this one-month period as a repentance period. These are the points of the agreement. Mu'addi: Mr. Abu-Shibak, how did the idea of holding dialogue and reaching such an agreement crystallize between the two movements? Abu-Shibak: First of all, the idea of holding dialogue has always been one of our traditions in Fatah and also on the part of Hamas. Our dialogue with Hamas has never stopped for one minute. However, praise be to God, our dialogue has this time been crowned by an agreement that will contribute to stopping the suffering of our people as much as possible. Mu'addi: Mr. Abu-Shibak, Israeli quarters have voiced concern over such agreements and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has said such agreement could affect the Israeli-Palestinian agreement. Abu-Shibak: I do not think the topic addressed by Rabin has anything to do with the agreement we are talking about. Our agreement with Hamas addresses daily problems and concerns that face Palestinian citizens in the Gaza Strip. It has nothing to do with a specific political agreement. Mu'addi: Can we take the agreement between the Fatah Hawks and the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam cells to be a forerunner of possibly another agreement between the leaders of the two movements, Fatah and Hamas, during the self-rule period? Abu-Shibak: We hope this will be the case. We will seek a broader and more inclusive agreement between Fatah and Hamas. There is a good chance for such an agreement, particularly since we, along with the brothers in the Hamas movement, very much want everybody to take part in the forthcoming self-rule authority, since this will be for the good of all the Palestinian masses in the future. Mu'addi: Was the agreement blessed by the leaders of Fatah and Hamas in the Gaza Strip? Abu-Shibak: Yes, completely. We stress this agreement and consider it an important and positive step toward improving our relationship with the brothers in Hamas. Mu'addi: Mr. Rashid Abu-Shibak, thank you very much. Abu-Shibak: You are welcome. [end recording]
