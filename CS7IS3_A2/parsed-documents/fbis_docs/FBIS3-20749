The question is this: How many sales representatives work for Staropramen, the largest brewery in Prague? Those who give an answer in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 make an intelligent guess, as that is about how many front-line salespeople work for similar-sized breweries in Amsterdam, Munich, Bristol, St. Louis and Perth. Those who answer with a number in the 90 to 120 range also have a logical basis for their conclusion. Commonly, the formerly state-run factories of Eastern and Central Europe employ two or three times the number of workers as do their Western counterparts. But the truly shrewd observer of affairs in this part of the world recognizes the hazards of automatically linking Western operating practices to the situation here. This is particularly so when it comes to the subject of marketing, which of course is barely a four-year-old concept for Czechs. Thus, the foreigner familiar with the way things are done here would not be surprised at the number of sales reps at Staropramen. That number is zero, zip, nada, none. Not a single full-time employee at the brewery has the sole function of making regular calls to either distributors or retailers. How can this be? Staropramen is a professionally run, century-old brewery with an excellent product. Its production processes are modern and cost-efficient. Senior management is motivated and the work force is diligent. So how can they not have even one front-line sales specialist? At first, those of us who are from the West might be tempted to chuckle. After all, "everyone" understands that sales--and salespeople--are the absolute lifeblood of any business. "Everyone" knows that basic operating decisions are dictated by the demands of the market, which must be monitored constantly through face-to-face contact with customers. "Everyone" knows this, provided of course that "everyone" has grown up in places where consumers are pampered by endless supplies of goods and services. The West is where the butcher works incredibly hard to provide the best meat, the baker the best bread, and the candlestick maker the best candle. For those who grew up where there were more plumbers than leaky faucets, more mechanics than broken cars, more phones than callers, these are simple truths. In the West, it is an unchallenged dictum that the customer is king and that the road to wealth is open only to those who strive for entrepreneurial excellence and aim to leave the customer fully satisfied. But "everyone" didn't grow up in that kind of environment. For more than four decades, the Central and Eastern European supplier was not just king but kingmaker. With goods always in short supply, the customer was either ignored or looked down upon. The masters were those who held the keys to the inventory; the subject were the masses, who were always stuck on the outside looking in. This goes a long way toward explaining why people waiting in line to pay for their groceries at the neighborhood potraviny (grocery store) are so well-behaved or why the waiter is so surly and shop hours so short. The imprint of 40 years of demand exceeding supply is deep, and lasting. The men and women inside Staropramen were not inoculated against this. It should be no wonder that, more often than not, their customers are viewed as a nuisance. Or that sales tactics commonly used by Anheuser-Busch and McDonald's are perceived as frivolous and wasteful. What value can a salesperson's call report have in a society indoctrinated to place such little value on the customer? Soon, of course, the rigors of capitalism will force themselves on Prague's business managers. When this happens, as it must, they will discover that the customer is fickle, demanding and unbelievably smart. Then wise managers will listen carefully to the message brought to them by their front-line sales force. The point of all this, it seems to me, is that the task for us resident foreigners is never to forget that, for Staropramen and other Czech enterprises, the cake has been turned upside down. Putting the customer at the head of the parade is not easily done, as proven before by the sharp guys in Detroit who once ignored this basic requirement. Seen in this light, what is astonishing is that change has been so rapid. The progress so far is a near miracle. Perhaps what is most in order is applause, not snickers. * * * The writer has 30 years' experience in the import-export business.
