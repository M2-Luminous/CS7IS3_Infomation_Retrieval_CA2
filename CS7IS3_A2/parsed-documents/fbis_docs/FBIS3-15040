Ilyushenko actively worked for the Interdepartmental Commission on Combating Crime and Corruption which was gathering damning evidence against some prominent figures of the Russian opposition, in particular against Aleksandr Rutskoy. A check on the information gathered by the Interdepartmental Commission was entrusted to the Moscow Prosecutor's Office. Some time later, it concluded that the charges of financial machinations against the former Russian vice president were unsupportable. Following this, a decision was made to institute a criminal libel suit. Theoretically, those to be tried were former members of the above Interdepartmental Commission, including Mr. Ilyushenko. One high-ranking Moscow Prosecutor's Office staffer has promised to speak to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on this score in greater detail.
