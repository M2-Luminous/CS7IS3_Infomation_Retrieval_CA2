FR941017-0-00027 FR941017-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY 31 CFR Part 103 Amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act Regulations Relating to Identification Required To Purchase Bank Checks and Drafts, Cashier's Checks, Money Orders, and Traveler's Checks AGENCY: Departmental Offices, Treasury. ACTION: Final Rule. SUMMARY: The Bank Secrecy Act prohibits financial institutions from issuing or selling bank checks or drafts, cashier's checks, money orders or traveler's checks for $3,000 or more in currency unless the financial institution verifies and records the identity of the purchaser. On May 15, 1990, Treasury published in the Federal Register, a Final Rule requiring financial institutions to verify and record such identifying information, to record certain information regarding the instruments purchased, such as the amount of the instruments, and to maintain a centralized chronological log of the sales. Today's Final Rule rescinds the requirement to maintain a chronological log and reduces substantially the amount of information required to be recorded. EFFECTIVE DATE: This Final Rule is effective on October 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Peter G. Djinis, Director, Office of Financial Enforcement, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), Department of the Treasury, Room 3210 Annex, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington DC 20220. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: A. Carlos Correa, Chief, Regulations and Rulings, Office of Financial Enforcement, (202) 622&hyph;0400. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Bank Secrecy Act (codified at 12 U.S.C. 1829b, 12 U.S.C. 1951&hyph;1959, and 31 U.S.C. 5311&hyph;5328) requires the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations requiring financial institutions to verify and record the identity of purchasers of bank checks, cashier's checks, traveler's checks and money orders for currency in amounts of $3,000 or more. 31 U.S.C. 5325. The purpose of Section 5325 is to deter and detect persons seeking to evade Bank Secrecy Act reporting requirements through purchases in currency of multiple monetary instruments in amounts under $10,000. On May 15, 1990, Treasury published in the Federal Register , 55 FR 20139&hyph;20144, a Final Rule implementing these new recordkeeping requirements by amending the Bank Secrecy Act regulations at 31 CFR 103.29 (Section 103.29). Section 103.29, which was effective August 13, 1990, established recordkeeping requirements for purchases of bank checks and drafts, cashier's checks, money orders and traveler's checks with currency in amounts of $3,000 to $10,000, inclusive. This section required that the recorded data be kept on a centralized chronological log(s) and maintained for five years. The specific data to be recorded depended upon whether the purchaser had a deposit account at the institution issuing or selling the monetary instrument(s). For a deposit accountholder, a financial institution was required to obtain and record: the purchaser's name and account number; the date of purchase; the branch where the purchase occurred; the types(s) and serial number(s) of each of the instrument(s) purchased; and the dollar amount(s) of each of the instrument(s) purchased in currency. Further, the financial institution was required to verify that the individual purchaser was a deposit accountholder, or to verify the individual's identity. If the individual's identity had not been verified previously and recorded, the financial institution was required to do so by examination of a document containing the name and address of the purchaser. Such information was required to be recorded on a centralized chronological log kept at the financial institution. If a purchaser did not have a deposit account, Section 103.29 required financial institutions to obtain and log the purchaser's name, date of birth, address, and social security or alien identification number. If the individual was purchasing the instrument(s) on behalf of another person, the name and account number of that person or, if there were no account number, the name, address and social security number, as well as the taxpayer identification number, or alien identification number, of such person also had to be recorded. Further, the financial institution was required to log: the date of purchase; the branch where the purchase occurred; the type(s), serial number(s), and dollar amount(s) of each of the instrument(s) purchased; the payee(s) on each purchased cashier's check(s), bank check(s) and draft(s); and the amount of the purchase in currency. Finally, the financial institution had to verify the purchaser's name and address by examination of a document containing that information. The specific identifying information was required to be recorded on the log ( e.g ., state of issuance and number of driver's license). Financial institutions were required by Section 103.29 to treat contemporaneous purchases of the same or different types of instruments totaling $3,000 or more as one purchase. Multiple purchases during one business day totaling $3,000 or more had to be treated as one purchase if the financial institution had knowledge that these purchases had occurred. Multiple sales had to be noted as such on the log(s). Finally, the financial institution was required to maintain chronological log(s) in a centralized location, retain them for at least five years, and make them available to the Secretary upon request. Reviewing Section 103.29 Requirements Treasury established a Money Laundering Task Force (Task Force) to consider ways to reduce the regulatory burden of complying with the BSA while enhancing the utility of information received from financial institutions. The Task Force considered the costs to financial institutions of obtaining and recording specific financial data concerning cash purchases of monetary instruments and the value of this information to law enforcement.
