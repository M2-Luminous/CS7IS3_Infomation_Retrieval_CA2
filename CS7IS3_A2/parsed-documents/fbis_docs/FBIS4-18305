[Berlusconi] No, no. We have a whole series of discussions and meetings planned. I am confident, as always, but there is a whole series of different issues that need to be discussed. [Latella] Newspaper editorial offices are busy guessing about the composition of the government, rumors are circulating... According to the latest one, Ambassador Sergio Romano is to become foreign minister. [Berlusconi] Well, I can tell you this: There has been no discussion about ministers with anyone. All the rumors that are circulating are without foundation. Nothing of what I have read corresponds in the slightest to the possible ministers suggested by the three leaders or, rather, by the three, four, or five leaders of the alliance. [Latella] Is it possible to make a suggestion of how many ministries will go to the League? [Berlusconi] The League will have its ministers, the National Alliance will have its ministers, and we will have our ministers, but they will all be people who do not feature among the names that have appeared in the newspapers. You see, we have not yet talked about individuals, because we are talking about substantive matters. I think this is the right time to discuss matters of substance; the names will come later. [Latella] What will be the differences between the government that you intend to form and its predecessors? Is it true that you will reduce the number of ministries? [Berlusconi] I have a very clear idea, and if I am to be prime minister, because there could be an "if," the differences will be many and profound. I have a clear program, but it is still to early to talk about that. [passage omitted]
