The team consists of experts from the United States, France, Britain, Spain, and Belgium, as well as IAEA officials. During their stay in Beijing, the team members will listen to the State Nuclear Safety Bureau's briefings on nuclear safety supervision and control system, organizations and functions, the formulation of nuclear safety law and its evaluation and enforcement, as well as nuclear contingency plans in China. They will also hold special talks with the state bureau on the aforesaid topics. In addition, the team members will visit Shenzhen to hold talks with Guangdong's Dayawan Nuclear Plant and the state bureau's Guangdong Supervision Station to familiarize themselves with the Chinese state bureau's nuclear safety supervision and control over the operating units. International evaluation of nuclear safety control is a form of international cooperation activity, through which IAEA organizes international nuclear safety experts to evaluate the effectiveness of nuclear safety supervision and control carried by the nuclear safety agency of a certain member state. The purpose of the evaluation is to obtain firsthand information about the member state's nuclear safety supervision and control, to summarize successful experiences, to make suggestions for improvement, and to exchange experiences in order to raise all member states' level in nuclear safety supervision and control. According to a state bureau official, international evaluation of nuclear safety control is to be requested by member states on a voluntary basis and to be organized and carried out by the IAEA. Since the inauguration of the State Nuclear Safety Bureau in 1984, China has adopted relatively comprehensive nuclear safety regulations and supervision system. The international evaluation, the first to be conducted on China's nuclear safety supervision and control in 10 years, will help improve China's nuclear safety work, enhance its influence on the world, and promote its international cooperation in nuclear safety. The IAEA team, which arrived in Beijing 24 April, will complete the evaluation on 9 May.
