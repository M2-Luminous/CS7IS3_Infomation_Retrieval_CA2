A ship carrying several thousand gallons of gasoline and oil -- not limited to humanitarian purposes this time --will arrive in Port-au-Prince on 2 March to supply the local market. This tanker, carrying more fuel than the two humanitarian fuel ships that were unloaded in the capital, left The Netherlands bound for Haiti and has put in at Aruba, according to the source, who adds that a gallon of gasoline will cost $5 in the gas stations in Port-au-Prince.
