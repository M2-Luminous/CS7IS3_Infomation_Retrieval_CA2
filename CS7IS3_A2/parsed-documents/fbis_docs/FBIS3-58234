As for President Mitterrand, he called on the Atlantic alliance to give concrete expression to pledges to Bosnia through actions, in particular UN resolutions on the protection of UN soldiers. Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said that, if a solution is to be found, it can only be a political one. He spoke to our correspondent in Brussels, Quentin Dickinson: [Begin recording] [Dehaene] It is clear that a solution in Yugoslavia will either be a political one, or there will be no solution at all. There is no such thing as a purely military solution because if a durable solution is to be found, there must be an agreement between the various parties. However, when no rule is being respected, when no agreement is being respected, I believe that it is necessary to step up pressure, probably by increasing sanctions and by using relevant means in order to have the UN resolutions enforced on the ground, possibly by demanding an air force, as was planned at some stage. In any case, if we demand the enforcement of the resolutions, it is also necessary to draw conclusions. [Dickinson] Air strikes? [Dehaene] I think it is a means we should be able to use. If we say that we want all UN resolutions to be enforced, it is one of the consequences. Or else it is better not to say that. [end recording]
