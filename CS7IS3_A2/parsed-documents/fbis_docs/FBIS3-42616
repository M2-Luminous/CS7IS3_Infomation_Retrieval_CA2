Belyayev, head of the Federal Administration for Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Cases, by NOVOYE VREMYA commentator Galina Kovalskaya, under the "Special to NOVOYE VREMYA" rubric; place and date not given: "If You Are Afraid of Bankruptcy, Do Not Venture Into a Market Economy"] [Text] That the planned economy is bankrupt is clear by now to more than just the specialists. "Giants of socialist industry" have the hardest time fitting into the new environment of market relations. How are they to survive and, on top of that, operate to benefit our society and the people? How to avoid bankruptcy? These are issues not only for "giants," but also for every labor collective. The state tries to regulate these processes. Sergey Belyayev, general director of an administration, has answered questions put by NOVOYE VREMYA commentator Galina Kovalskaya. Sergey Belyayev is well known in St. Petersburg as a deputy of the Leningrad Soviet, chairman of the Krasnogvardeyskiy Rayon Soviet, and subsequently deputy mayor of the city. He was in charge of issues of property management and privatization. He has things to boast of: approximately 70 percent of all enterprises in the city have been privatized. Soon the entire country will start talking about this man. After all, he heads the recently created Federal Administration for Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Cases. The administration has ministerial status; the subject matter it will handle is about the most vital and painful that there is. Why is state regulation needed for what would appear to be a purely market-based institution, for bankruptcy? What does the bankruptcy of an enterprise mean under current conditions, when everyone owes money to everyone else, and no one pays anything to anyone? Will bankruptcy bring about the complete stoppage of production? Will half the population be left without jobs? [Kovalskaya] What has the administration been established for? What tasks do you intend to accomplish in the immediate future? [Belyayev] Our main goal is to prevent the complete liquidation of insolvent enterprises. Under legislation currently in effect, bankruptcy does not necessarily presuppose liquidation. It presupposes first of all a recovery (restructuring) of such production. Its complete closure is an extreme measure which is, of course, the most painful both for the owner and the labor collective. By now, a large proportion of enterprises in Russia are either covered by bans on privatization or have not yet been converted to joint-stock operations. Their share comes to about 70 percent. The notion "bankruptcy" is hardly appropriate in the case of the state sector. It would be strange if the owner-state were to appeal to some other echelons for an improvement in its own economic unit. What use would it have for a court of arbitration that would defend its rights as an owner against its own self, for its own credit? The state has enough instruments and opportunities available to it to rescue its plants, banks, and mines. Privatization is one of the main instruments. For an enterprise, it may become a way to attract capital and to motivate, or if need be replace, the manager in the absence of all pressure from the courts. Besides, the state has an opportunity to support through grants and subsidies those of its enterprises which, as it believes, are necessary to keep and in the absence of which it will not survive. There is the mechanism of state credit. Finally, there are state requisitions, which perhaps should be distributed primarily among state enterprises so that the state will act as a guarantor of social protection for its hired employees. [Kovalskaya] It looks as if the state is doomed to "nourishing" state enterprises in one way or another, be it through easy credit, grants, or requisitions. Will the budget endure this? [Belyayev] As far as I am concerned, I started with privatization. Let us draw a distinction. If an enterprise in its entirety fills state requisitions and receives 100 percent grants from the state, this is no longer an enterprise, but rather a state office, even if it produces goods or technologies in all of this. There are few of those in our country. If everyone is interested in these offices, and the budget has money to maintain them, insolvency is out of the question. Besides, as a rule, it is forbidden to privatize such enterprises. However, a much greater number of enterprises are not covered by bans on privatization but are in no hurry to do this, because they hope for various types of support in the form of grants or easy credit. Well, there is not going to be easy credit any more. Besides, let us grasp this: as we extend credit to enterprises through commercial banks, we thus provide credit to the banks, too. Meanwhile, virtually all of them are no longer state-owned, because their founders, as a rule, have become joint-stock companies in which the share of state property is declining rapidly. It turns out that the state extends easy credit to commercial banks without rhyme or reason. Therefore, the state should raise the issue of the need to privatize as soon as possible before an unprofitable enterprise. We are talking here about special privatization procedures: through an investment competition. Our administration is now working on a relevant statute. Here it is for you, restructuring before court proceedings. The enterprise will be helped with funds, but those of private investors rather than the state. The interests of the labor collective should be taken into account in the process. That is to say, the new owner will have to ensure all social guarantees that were given by the previous owner, i.e., the state. Perhaps in most cases it is necessary to ensure, for a period of time, the preservation of jobs and the labor collective itself in order to prevent a social explosion, not only at enterprises, but in the territories. Of course, it may be resolved to entirely liquidate an unprofitable state enterprise. However, we would like this to occur only with the consent of a collective if it is meant to happen. [Kovalskaya] All of this is about state enterprises. What about those converted to joint-stock operations? [Belyayev] In cases in which the state retains the controlling share or holds the golden share, it may, just as it has previously initiated the privatization of this enterprise, force through structural changes at the enterprise now through the procedure of declaring it bankrupt--of course, in the event that a continuing drop in production, indebtedness, and so on are evident. Who will initiate bankruptcy in this case? Shareholders are still frequently unable to understand in a timely manner that they have encountered genuine insolvency. In this instance, our administration may display initiative by filing documents with a court of arbitration. Declaring an enterprise bankrupt does not at all mean that jobs will be liquidated. Apparently, it will just have to change either the manager or the output mix, or both, and in addition find an investor. In this situation, our initiative constitutes sufficient grounds for the consideration of the case by a court. [Kovalskaya] What about enterprises that are privately owned in their entirety? [Belyayev] In this instance, we are a powerful supervisory organ. That is to say, we verify to what degree the bankruptcy procedure conforms to legislation, how precise the decisions made are, and to what degree they are in line with the documentation filed. We may act as experts, we may become guarantors for documentation submitted to courts. However, perhaps the foremost task of our administration is that we must write a number of regulatory acts for enterprises of all forms of ownership from which courts and creditors will proceed. As of now, there is no proven bankruptcy procedure; there are not even any criteria by which it would be possible to judge whether a particular enterprise needs state support by reason of its having statewide significance, or whether restructuring is necessary. We would like to help private enterprises to learn to figure out for themselves by what criteria they can make a judgment as to their solvency or insolvency. We count on developing some sort of test questionnaire and obligating enterprise managers, at state and private enterprises alike, to fill it out periodically, so that the sore spots and dynamics of development will be obvious to managers themselves or shareholders. This may prepare them for the decision about the need to voluntarily declare themselves bankrupt or take other measures urgently. Bankruptcy does not mean punitive actions with regard to the production potential of the country, but rather steps in the direction of its recovery. Structural changes in the economy may and should occur through the institution of bankruptcy. [Kovalskaya] Still, while regulatory documents are lacking, can you say even a few words about the criteria from which you will proceed in developing them? [Belyayev] I do not want to waste your time. Each sector will have its own criteria; virtually each sector has its peculiarities. Nonpayments are the common, traditional criterion. However, under our conditions we will have to consider each specific case: By and large, an enterprise is a debtor, while other enterprises owe still greater sums to it. Or else, this example: virtually everyone owes to the energy industries. Perhaps this has to do with the power industry personnel, who build literally all outlays into the producer cost of power, including social security until the year 2050. In addition to our administration, a few more ministries are working on the criteria at present, including the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of Finance. [Kovalskaya] You have mentioned the possible "voluntary" bankruptcy and even "voluntary liquidation" of an enterprise. Do you indeed believe that this is realistic? [Belyayev] If this is a state enterprise, the task comes down to the owner (the state) persuading the labor collective not to oppose such a decision. It is just that it should be explained to the people that it is better for them to agree to liquidation themselves, and in this case the state will be obliged to guarantee certain social welfare to the employees. Otherwise, the enterprise may die its own death, that is, this time around without any guarantees: it is just that machine tools will stop because there will be no raw materials, and wages will no longer be paid.... If the collective is not at all prepared to go for liquidation, it might want to try rescuing the enterprise on its own, given that the state has acknowledged its impotence in the matter. In this case, the collective may lease its enterprise, but under a different law. I think that this particular scenario will be frequently followed at small enterprises. It may so happen that a creditor will show initiative, and an enterprise, without taking things all the way to court, will agree to a voluntary bankruptcy. Our administration acts as the owner on behalf of the state and must find an outside manager for the enterprise. [Kovalskaya] That is, a new director? [Belyayev] That is not important. The outside manager may replace the director or keep the old one, but under his control. It is important that crucial decisions will now be up to the manager: for example, changes in the output mix of the enterprise, the sale of some assets, and so on. We are planning to hold a series of "exhibition bankruptcies" in order to make the experience gained the foundation for regulatory documents. We are now receiving information from various regions concerning the state of affairs locally. We will soon complete the collection of information, select a few unpromising enterprises, and take them step by step through all the necessary stages, up to the court ruling. [Kovalskaya] Why "exhibition"? For the edification of the obstinate, so to say? [Belyayev] So that they will not be afraid. Our most important goal may be to prepare society psychologically. The people should understand that bankruptcy is an ordinary economic procedure; they should get used to the word. After all, bankruptcy does not mean either that the lives of enterprise employees are shattered or that the career of the entrepreneur is finished. The insolvency of an enterprise does not necessarily indicate the resourcelessness of the owner or manager. It may be a consequence of absolutely outside, random things: for example, a coup d'etat has occurred in the country that was the principal importer of the products of the enterprise. The same entrepreneur may be commercially successful another time, in another place. Of course, the procedure presupposes that each hired employee who is affected by bankruptcy will enjoy social protection. [Kovalskaya] Nonetheless, all kinds of terrifying statistics of the projected growth of unemployment are being given. How can one not be scared? [Belyayev] Actually, unemployment has already become a reality: while not technically laying off employees, many enterprises operate two to three days per week, or altogether suggest that employees take forced leaves. This hidden unemployment is particularly dangerous because it is precisely the one to criminalize our society to the greatest degree, to bring about the outflow of the most flexible and capable people from enterprises, and to hamper structural changes. So, what else is there to fear? The bankruptcy procedure as such will not boost the number of the unemployed. Things should not be painted in such a way that, supposedly, enterprises sustaining cities will be closed by court rulings tomorrow, and millions of people will be left with no food or a roof over their heads. No one intends to throw anyone out onto the street: nobody is suicidal, either in the government or among the economists. Be so kind as to tell me: Can you imagine not even a few thousand, but a few dozen people being just thrown out onto the pavement in our country? It is not just our society, it is our entire nation that has social orientation. Besides, we do want, after all, to adhere to an international convention on the protection of the rights of the working people, under which each country must guarantee a certain social status to each employee affected by a bankruptcy. However, if we are in no hurry to have bankruptcies and to allow insolvent enterprises to die a natural death little by little, the explosive growth of unemployment is unavoidable, and a social explosion is quite likely. [Kovalskaya] This is hard to understand: If bankruptcies presuppose, among other things, liquidations of insolvent enterprises, how can the state offer guarantees against unemployment? Where are the people to go? [Belyayev] Social guarantees may also take the form of instruction and new skill acquisition free of charge. We lag badly in the area of cadre retraining. The country is experiencing an acute shortage of employees in the service sector: it employs between 20 and 30 percent of the population in developed countries, but barely 5 percent here. Meanwhile, we are afraid of unemployment! Labor released in production shall be siphoned off into the service sector, into small businesses, instead of frightening the people with talk that they will end up unemployed and impoverished tomorrow. When we talk about guarantees, we are not preparing sops for the population. Our task is to help the people in psychologically accepting the change in their status and technically mastering a new business. The experience of Scandinavian countries and Germany, in which the retraining system is highly developed, indicates that retraining may be established even at operating enterprises. Among other things, our administration must work in this area together with trade unions, regional employment centers, and the Ministry of Social Protection. [Kovalskaya] You will not touch enterprises sustaining cities for now, will you? [Belyayev] We definitely will. [Kovalskaya] Are you not afraid? [Belyayev] We are afraid of not touching them and leaving them to die. [Kovalskaya] What are you going to do with them? [Belyayev] We will decide this in each specific case. The output mix may be changed in some cases, but, for example, the unprofitable mines of Vorkuta--there is no way to change their output mix. Obviously, the people will have to be moved from there. [Kovalskaya] Incidentally, about mines. This is an industry, one of the few, in which a genuine influential workers' movement exists. It is precisely this movement that comes out against unprofitable mines being converted to joint-stock operations. Leaders of the Independent Trade Union of Miners are saying: The industry should be brought to a certain level of profitability first, and privatization should be carried out next. [Belyayev] Actually, it is the other way around: the path to profitability leads through privatization. The state will not be able to cope with the industry without bringing in investment. However, a number of mines will, of course, have to be closed. [Kovalskaya] In which industries do you plan to begin testing the bankruptcy procedure? [Belyayev] Our position in principle--in various industries, perhaps, at first in those best prepared, in those where we find understanding at the level of ministries and enterprise managers. [Kovalskaya] Does this happen? [Belyayev] Naturally. We have established a good, businesslike relationship with the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Machine Building. In the immediate future, we will certainly establish such relationships with others. It is completely wrong to believe that some kind of anti-reformist reactionaries have ensconced themselves there. Do you recall that initially the community of directors and ministerial functionaries received privatization poorly? By now, many have become its supporters, and even champions. The same will happen with bankruptcy as soon as it becomes obvious that it furthers the recovery of the industry and the entire economic mechanism.
