The statement said that Russian parliamentarians "demand immediate convocation of the U.N. Security Council to discuss the situation, following NATO's military interference in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and adoption of measures to prevent escalation of this explosive situation." Deputies called on all warring sides to immediately end the bloodshed and start negotiations on a comprehensive ceasefire agreement. The statement stressed the need for urgent deployment of U.N. forces in the Gorazde area and adoption of measures to prevent provocations on any side. Duma deputies urged the Russian Foreign Ministry to "work out an active position to set up an effective mechanism of implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions in order to ward off the use of force in the future bypassing Russia." Deputies rejected amendments to the statement proposed by several factions, including recommendations to the Russian Government, urging it to submit proposals to the Security Council to lift economic sanctions on Yugoslavia or to refrain from signing the Partnership for Peace programme.
