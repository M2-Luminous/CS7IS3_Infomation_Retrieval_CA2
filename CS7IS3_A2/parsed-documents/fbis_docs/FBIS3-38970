At a news conference in Bonn on Thursday [10 February], however, he stressed that the final decision about potential air strikes remains with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. According to the most recent information he has obtained, Butrus-Ghali did not state -- in contrast to press reports -- that decisions have to be delegated to the UN Security Council, Kinkel said. In the view of UN experts, there they would probably be blocked by a Russian veto. Kinkel explained the two stages of decisionmaking as follows: 1. If Sarajevo is attacked again before the deadline expires, British General Michael Rose, the local UN general, would order countermeasures in coordination with NATO. It is not certain whether General Rose has to consult with Butrus-Ghali in this case. 2. If the heavy Serbian weapons are not withdrawn by 20 February, as demanded by the ultimatum, NATO will launch air strikes as threatened, if such strikes have expressly been demanded by the UN secretary general. Kinkel placed great hopes on the possibility that the three parties to the conflict, who met for a new round of negotiations in Geneva on Thursday, will give in. Without the Serbs, the Croats, and the Bosnian Muslims a political solution is impossible. At the same time, the foreign minister announced new contacts with the Americans, who, with the European Union, are examining approaches for political solutions and want to include the Russians, who strongly oppose military strikes, in this. An 18 February meeting in Athens between Moscow's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and a delegation of European Union ministers is still being examined. The so-called troika consists of the foreign minister of the country that holds the Presidency, that is, Greece, his predecessor, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, as well as his successor, Klaus Kinkel, On 1 July, Germany will take over the Presidency. Diplomats indicated that a meeting with Kozyrev will probably not be possible two days before the expiration of the NATO ultimatum. Kinkel said a repetition of the massacre of Sarajevo will "not be tolerated." As soon as the deadline expires on 20 February, "unauthorized weapons systems will become the target of air strikes." German participation, which goes beyond the current help in air and sea monitoring as well as in humanitarian supplies, is impossible because of the legal situation and because of German history. Kinkel pointed to military information, according to which NATO's AWACS reconnaissance planes, which also carry some German crew members, do not have anything to do with leading potential air strikes. So far, by paying 612 million German marks, Germany has provided more help than any other nation, with the exception of the United States. The FRG has accepted more than 400,000 refugees, Kinkel stated.
