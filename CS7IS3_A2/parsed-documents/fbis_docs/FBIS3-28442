Nearly 20 robbery cases were registered in South Korea in January, which were shuddering robberies involving the use of weapons and looting. The Kim Yong-sam group is staging what it calls "180-day operation for wiping off crimes" while advertizing "public peace for the people". But the spearhead of the repressive forces is always directed against the patriotic forces which call for independence, democracy and reunification, the analyst notes, and goes on: It is not without reason that South Korean public criticizes Kim Yong-sam, asking why the traitor who has been merciless in suppressing the patriotic forces, is so incompetent in nabbing robbers. The gang robberies in South Korea are immediate consequences of the misdeeds of the traitor Kim Yong-sam and other elements of the ruling quarters who stand in the foreground in fraud, swindle and corruption, fostering crimes and vices in society. The social evils spreading in South Korea these days are signs of the end of the "civilian" regime. It is not long before the traitor Kim Yong-sam and his "civilian" regime meet their disgraceful doom.
