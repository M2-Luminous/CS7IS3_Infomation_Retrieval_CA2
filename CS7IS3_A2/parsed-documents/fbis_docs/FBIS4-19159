In other words, Berisha's reaction is not defensive but clearly aggressive. It's aim is to rally and incite the fanaticism of the Muslims in his country and in the other Balkan areas where his fellow nationals live as a minority. The Albanian leader has not concealed his intentions to link what he calls the "Albanian issue" to the problem of the former Yugoslavia. It is for this reason that he looks forward to (instead of wishing against it, as the whole world does) the expansion of obscurity and unrest in Kosovo, Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], and other areas where there are Muslims and Albanian-speaking minorities. For many months now the Berisha regime, without even the pretext of last Sunday's incident, has insisted on portraying the country as directly threatened by Serbia and Greece. The goal of Tirana's tactics was to ensure the strongest possible support from the United States and West European countries by being in the position of a weak and threatened state. At the same time, the Berisha regime apparently believed that it was securing an alibi for its future moves and "reactions" in pursuing a solution to the "Albanian issue." So, last Sunday's incident was so opportune and helpful to the Albanian plans as to be suspicious, possibly incriminating those who hasten to exploit it in a relentless and extremist manner. Our country has maintained a stance toward Albanian and Berisha's provocations that exceeds the limits of tolerance and has already entered the field of an unjustified and obviously unequal retreat. In addition to the moral, material, and economic assistance we have granted the Berisha regime, the Greek people are currently hosting almost all the unemployed Albanians who entered the country illegally. The Greek people are also being hit by an unprecedented crime wave that also comes from our neighboring statelet... All these things are being pointed out not to highlight our country's strength or to threaten reprisals against the Berisha regime, they are merely designed to make Tirana see reason and, of course, warn that the Hellenism of North Epirus is not being offered as a victim of pressure and blackmail. Its rights are safeguarded internationally and the guarantor for these rights is, naturally and primarily, the national metropolis of the Greek minority...
