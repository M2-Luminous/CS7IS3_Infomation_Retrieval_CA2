ACTION: Reallocation. SUMMARY: NMFS is reallocating the projected unused amount of Pacific cod from vessels using trawl gear to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to allow the 1994 total allowable catch of Pacific cod to be harvested. DATES: August 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the U.S. BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that vessels using trawl gear will not be able to harvest 8,000 metric tons of Pacific cod allocated to those vessels under ยง675.20(a)(2)(iv)(A). Therefore, in accordance with ยง675.20(a)(2)(iv)(B) NMFS is reallocating the projected unused amount to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.20, and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: August 16, 1994. Richard H.
