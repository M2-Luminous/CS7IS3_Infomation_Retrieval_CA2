"All those who spoke unanimously agreed to amend various articles of these two laws in such a way as to suit the actual situation at present." They added: Major revisions of these two laws will be considered when conditions permit. As for the amendment of Article 16 of the Law on Cooperations and Article 10 of the Law on Private Busines, many deputies favored the idea of allowing people whose applications for the establishment of corporations have been turned down to appeal to the prime minister, if they see find the refusal unacceptable. "Given that the State Economic Arbitrator will cease its activities beginning 1 July 1994, the drafting committee for these draft laws has suggested that the powers to license various coporations be transferred from the economic arbitrator of provinces and cities under central authority, or from corresponding administrative units, to the planning committees of provinces and cities under central authority. It has also been suggested that the powers to license private firms be transferred from the economic arbitrator who is equal in status to the people's committee granting licenses, to the planning organs which are equivalent in status to the people's committee granting licenses." Some deputies also asked what they should do if somes districts and town have no planning organs? "All the deputies unanimously agreed with the draft law's suggestion that the declaration of bankruptcy by a corporation or a private firm must be carried out in accordance with the law on the bankruptcy of enterprises. "Tomorrow, the National Assembly will hold group discussions on the situation regarding the implementation of the National Assembly resolution on socioeconomic tasks for the first six months of 1994."
