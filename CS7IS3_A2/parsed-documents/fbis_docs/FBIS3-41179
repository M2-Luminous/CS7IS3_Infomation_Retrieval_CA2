Our readers have read about them here, and we have been informing them about the activities of these enemies of humanity. We have been receiving letters from inside and outside the country complaining that we were not writing enough against these elements. One of these letters is from Mr. Manzoor who has written us from Norway. While governments and officials now and then proclaim their strength, the fact remains that these elements [drug dealers] have set up shadow governments in almost every part of the world, and it is quite easy for them to wipe out humanity from the face of the earth. Even today, there are individuals including members of legislative bodies who are engaged in drug dealing, but the government is powerless to bring them to justice. A former minister and major drug dealer, Amanullah Kandi, was convicted in a Karachi court, but to this day it is not clear how he was transferred from Karachi jail to the central jail of Dera Ismail Khan, his native town, and who had a hand in helping him escape from that prison. Recently, a journalist went to interview him, but the journalist's camera and the tape of the interview were confiscated by government officials. In spite of strong reassurances by the government, Kandi has eluded capture. Meanwhile, Peshawar high court's full bench has thrown out the appeal entered against the disqualification of Rahnuma Nadir Khan Zaka Kheel running against National Assembly Speaker Gauhar Ayub Khan from Haripur precinct NA13, and the disqualification of Mehmand Agency's Haji Qadar Gul Mehmand (former MNA) accused of drug dealing, and of Khyber Agency's Haji Ibrahim Khan. These individuals had been barred from participating in the elections by the returning officials and later by the election appellate tribunal. Haji Qadar Gul Mehmand and Haji Ibrahim Khan were arrested by the local police on charge of selling drugs and these two individuals are still in jail. The full bench consisted of justice Abdul Karim Kandi; justice Sayed Ibni Ali; justice Abdul Rahman Khan; justice Khiar Khan and justice Mian Mohammad Ajmal. The candidacy papers filed by petitioner Sayed Sultan Shah were rejected because he did not pay the money owed. The [candidacy] papers of Nadir Khan Zakha Kheel who was a candidate for the national assembly from Khyber Agency were rejected on grounds that he had fought against government officials during construction of Qamar road in Tirah and had harmed national security; he was barred from running in the elections. National Assembly hopeful from Mehmand Agency, Haji Qadar Gul Mehmand and Khyber Agency's Haji Ibrahim Khan, who were charged with drug dealing, had their papers rejected and were barred from participation in the elections. The two men were arrested by the local police, and they are still in jail. Following the rejection of their election petitions, these two individuals appealed to the election tribunal, but their appeal was also rejected. They entered four separate writs in the Peshawar high court against the tribunal's decision barring them from election participation. On Thursday, the high court's full bench rejected their writs. These candidates cannot take part in the elections. The attorney general of Pakistan, who prosecuted the case for the government, took the position that elections did not merely imply voting on a certain date but were a gradual process in which it was necessary to file candidacy papers, assign election symbols, qualify or disqualified candidates to run. The attorney general said that the election tribunal had decided as to whether these individuals were qualified or not. After elections took place under article 225 of the constitution, these individuals could challenge their disqualification in the next election tribunal. Consequently, it was not within the jurisdiction of the court to hear the petitions of these individuals. Referring to the 1989 Javid Hashemi case in the Pakistan Supreme Court, the attorney general said that the Supreme Court had rejected Javed Hashemi's appeal and instructed him to take his case to the election tribunal after elections were over. Lawyers for petitioners Haji Ibrahim Khan and Nadir Khan Zakha Kheel raised the point that at that time Supreme Court Justice Naseem Hasan Shah's decision was contrary to the decisions of the rest of the justices. At this juncture, the chief justice said that the majority of the Supreme Court justices had rejected Javed Hashemi's appeal. Justice Nasim Hasan Shah said if the majority agreed on a decision, he would go along with it. The attorney general pointed out that the Sindh High Court had made a similar decision in the Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi case and ruled that the high court did not have the jurisdiction to hear Jatoi's appeal and that the decision could be challenged in the election tribunal to be set up after the elections. Haji Qadar Gul's lawyer said that his client's langi had been revoked. Langi is an honor awarded to certain prominent individuals in the agencies and is usually given to those favored by the government.
