Industry, apart from the power industry, had a growth index of 205 per cent in the January-to-May period. The figures for May, for the first time in three months, show a certain drop in the industrial production growth -- 6.8 per cent below the figure for April -- but still a rise of 3.9 per cent. Central Bank Governor Dragoslav Avramovic, architect of the economic recovery and monetary reconstruction programme, describes the results as a remarkable success. "We may be proud, all the more so because this comes after last year's total monetary collapse and in conditions of sanctions," says Avramovic. The U.N. Security Council clamped strict economic sanctions on Yugoslavia on May 30, 1992. The industrial output dropped by 20 per cent in 1992 as against 1991 and by a further 37.3 per cent in 1993. "Credit for the revival of production goes primarily to the banks, which have been operating and giving loans in the worst of economic conditions," says Avramovic. As a result, most banks are grappling with the problem of insolvency, and the federal government and the Cental Bank will soon be taking steps to consolidate the banks' position, he explains.
