It was learned that China ultimately concluded that North Korea had not yet reached the level of developing nuclear warheads. A high-ranking diplomatic source in Beijing said: "After a long investigation into various aspects of the North Korean nuclear issue, China judges that North Korea's current nuclear technology is only at the level of reprocessing plutonium and that it has yet to reach the level of nuclear enrichment."
