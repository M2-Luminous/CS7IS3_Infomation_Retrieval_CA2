FR941202-2-00202 FR941202-2-00098 (a) These standards shall be analyzed at a frequency of 5% or every 8 hours whichever is more frequent and may be standards used in the original calibration curve or standards from another source. (b) The concentration of these standards shall be determined by the anticipated or known concentration of the samples. To the extent possible, the samples in each interval (i.e. every 20 samples or every 8 hours) should be bracketed with standard concentrations closely representing the lower and upper range of reported sample concentrations. If this is not possible, the standard calibration checks should vary in concentration throughout the range of the data being acquired. When not specified by the analytical method, these calibration verification standards shall be within 15% of the true value. 5.8␣Physical Facilities 5.8.1␣Environment The laboratory facilities shall be maintained to permit the production of analytical data of needed quality. In addition to adequate housekeeping that must be performed to assure that contamination is unlikely, the following elements shall be controlled: _Temperature; _Humidity; _Electrical power; _Vibration; _Electromagnetic fields; _Dust; _Direct sunlight; _Ventilation (exhaust hoods, air exchangers, etc.); and _Lighting. 5.8.2␣Work Area Adequate work spaces to ensure an unencumbered work area must be available. These include: _Controlled access to the laboratory; _Separation of incompatible analyses; _Sample receipt area; _Sample storage area; _Chemical and waste storage area(s); and _Data handling and storage area(s).
