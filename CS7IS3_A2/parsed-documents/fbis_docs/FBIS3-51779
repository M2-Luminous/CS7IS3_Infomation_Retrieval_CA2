At the same time, the main PA leaders accused their former Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] allies of being "traitors and Judases" for abandoning the official coalition. The 354 convention delegates voted in favor of the slate headed by Mrs. Gruber. The slate also includes veteran politician Arnulfo Escalona of the Liberal Authentic Party (PLA) as the first vice-presidential candidate, and the second vice-presidential candidate is National Liberal Party (PLN) member Jose Teran Sitton. Sources close to the convention organizing committee indicated that they had rented about 1,500 buses capable of transporting 60 people each. This totals nearly 90,000 participants and another 30,000 who arrived on their own. The PA candidate stated that "once more on 8 May we will prove that the party founded by Arnulfo Arias has never lost an election." In referring to Molirena, she said, "I am quite sure that those, who for merely selfish and unworthy reasons are not with us today, will be lamenting their decision by tomorrow." Once the convention ended at approximately 1500, the government party presidential ticket headed to a dais located in front of Santa Ana Park where they addressed their supporters. Mrs. Gruber took the opportunity to present her government program which includes, among other things, a "well-prepared" plan to confront poverty, create at least 100,000 jobs, and a frontal attack against drug trafficking. According to the PA candidate, the state will continue to promote public projects by resorting to private sector resources as much as possible. The PA government will continue to work closely with workers organizations and encourage them to contribute to resolving the nation's economic problems. According to Mrs. Gruber, the Arnulfist government will continue honoring commitments, such as the foreign debt payment, to enable the country to remain in good credit standing. In addition, she added, "We will follow a rational public spending policy, we will respect the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, and we will hold a referendum on the presence of U.S. military bases beyond the year 2000." Escalona, meanwhile, said the PA presidential ticket represents the country's lower classes, while Teran said, "We have to guarantee that those who sowed death and fear in the country will never return to power." Before the officials on the slate spoke, leader Jose Aleman said during the convention that the "bad liberals" (members of Molirena), who have betrayed Endara are currently holding a sad Judas convention (at the Atlapa Convention Center). Aleman said: "We are going to eat those bad liberals in a double rooster soup [the rooster is Molirena's party symbol]. Tomorrow we are going to chop off their heads, and then we will eat them. Those bad liberals should be taken out of the government." In turn, this those attending the event shouted: "Take them out, take them out." Meanwhile the PLA held its convention in Chitre, where it ratified its support for Gruber. Before the convention was held, Legislator German Gnaeggi said a group of convention participants, most of them from Cocle Province, would support the candidacy of former Comptroller Ruben Dario Carles instead of Mireya de Gruber, but the motion was not presented during the convention.
