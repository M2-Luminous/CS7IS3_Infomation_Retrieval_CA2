Russian Deputy Culture Minister Mikhail Shvydkoy told TASS on Wednesday that Russian experts "have completed intense work to compile a true list of our losses" which concern, in particular, the Catherine Palace in Pushkino, a palace in Pavlovsk and a museum in Orel. Shvydkoy, who is heading the Russian delegation at the current restitution talks in Germany, admitted that contradictions do exist. Russia opposes the German idea that the restitution problem is to be solved by political means and insists on a legal settlement. Additionally, "there are many war veterans in Russia to whom it will be hard to explain why we have to hand over some valuables and get nothing in return. This is the root cause of our differences with the German side. We are strongly against granting equal rights to the countries one of which is the aggressor and other the victim of aggression," Shvydkoy said. He stressed that Germany's valuables brought to the Soviet Union by decision of state organisations are Russia's property. However, things smuggled out of Germany by private persons must be returned. The valuables that belonged to German religious and charity organisations were not allowed to be taken out of the country, he said. Another problem is the articles that belonged to individuals or third countries. For example, if Germany had brought something from France and later it was brought to Russia, these things cannot be treated as German property. "We are seeking to make the process of restitution legal without damaging Russia's interests," Shvydkoy said. "We cannot agree with the German side that this process will not be compensatory. It must be a road with two-way traffic. The return of valuables from Russia must be linked to the return of valuables from Germany," he continued. Additionally, if Germany cannot trace a particular thing and is ready to give up the search, it must pay compensation which will be used to support Russian culture. "We are strongly against using this money in other spheres, that is trading a painting for a kilo of sausage or equipment for a brewery. Our commission considers it barbaric," Shvydkoy said.
