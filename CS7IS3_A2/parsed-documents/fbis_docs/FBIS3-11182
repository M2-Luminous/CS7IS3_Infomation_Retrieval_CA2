Ricardo Barco and Benito Miron Lince said: "It should be clear that we listen to the opinion of civilian society. We are not seeking to make CONAC grow as an organization. Our representatives have made it very clear that the EZLN is one part of the organization and civilian society is another." As for the possibility that the coordinating board will harbor other organizations, they pointed out: "Our goal is not to make CONAC grow, but we are not opposed to other organizations either. We are not aiming to become a political organization. We want to listen to civilian society, and those who understand this are welcome." Barco and Miron insisted: "We are definitely not the political arm of the EZLN, because it is clear that the power that we were given is the power of juridical or legal representation to appear before international forums, authorities, and organizations -- a representation that has a legitimate nature granted by the armed group. "It must also be clear that as members of CONAC's legal commission, we are not EZLN members. We are accepting work as agents in the terms agreed upon with the EZLN. Our capacity as legal representatives will last as long as our client [otorgante] deems it advisable. There are authorities, however, who are demanding representation before a notary public, but that is not possible. There must be no confusion between our mandate and possible sympathies for the EZLN struggle," they pointed out. Born in the wake of the armed incidents of 1 January 1994 and established on 10 February, CONAC-LN was ratified yesterday as the EZLN legal representative through a letter addressed to the general public and signed by Subcommander Marcos. The EZLN approved the CONAC-LN's legal commission as the legal representative for the Zapatists. Their first work consisted of a juridical study of proposals made by Commissioner Camacho Solis. Another assignment is the installation of civilian society tables in various states, such as the one installed in Mexico City on 14 March. Finally, those who are responsible for the CONAC-LN legal commission stated: "One of the EZLN aims is to demonstrate the willingness of the Zapatist movement -- the will to achieve a dignified peace."
