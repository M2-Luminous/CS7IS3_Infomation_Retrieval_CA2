Guy Spitaels, former Francophone Socialist Party president and president of the French-speaking regional government, and Guy Mathot, another member of that government, announced their decision to the press just two hours after the Royal Palace announced Coeme's resignation. The three leaders had been accused of taking bribes and channelling funds to the Socialist Party in connection with the 1988 purchase of 46 Italian Agusta helicopters for the Belgian Army. Coeme, 48, was defence minister at the time of the 225 million dollar purchase. [passage omitted]
