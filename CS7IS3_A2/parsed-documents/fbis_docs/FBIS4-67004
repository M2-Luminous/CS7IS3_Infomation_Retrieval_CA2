Thus, a decision was made to take steps to eliminate drug smuggling and the lists prepared during the caretaker government were also acquired. This system of drug smuggling in Pakistan has been going on for many years. In addition to affecting our nation's economy and prosperity, it hinders implementation of law and order. It can also prove destructive to the new generation. About 12 or 15 years ago, the drug abuse was limited to hashish and opium, however, after the Soviet interference in Afghanistan, heroin also joined this list. Its trade spread because its price has the secret of changing people from rags to riches. Therefore, people who hanker for money and disregard fear of God use various tricks to make money. As the result of it, the drug trade has also reached educational institutions and even female students, in addition to male students. Although all the Pakistani governments during the last few years have taken some steps to end drug smuggling, there have been difficulties in totally controlling narcotics trade because of involvement of some influential persons in drugs, especially hashish and heroin, smuggling. Heroin worth millions of rupees is seized every year, however, the persons involved in this trade are so influential and they have so many contacts that they manage to escape the law. It is hoped that the present government which has the mandate from the majority of our people will pay attention to this evil without any leniency or favoritism, and will leave no stone unturned in totally eliminating this evil. Peace-loving citizens and patriots will fully cooperate with the government to eradicate this curse.
