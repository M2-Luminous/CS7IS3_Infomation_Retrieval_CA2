FR940111-0-00035 FR940111-0-00008 One commenter suggested that an alien physician should not be required to obtain a medical license if the alien is not coming to the United States to perform patient care. As written, the interim rule requires that licensure must be obtained only in those situations where the alien beneficiary will be performing clinical care. An alien physician coming to fill a position which does not normally require licensure, e.g., medical research, would not be required to obtain a license. Thus, this suggestion need not be adopted. Approval and Validity of Petitions_§214.2(h)(9)(iii)(B) The initial approval of an H&hyph;1B petition is currently limited to three years. One commenter suggested that H&hyph;1B petitions should be approved for the validity period of the supporting labor condition application, not to exceed six years. The Service does not deem it appropriate to consider extending the initial validity period of H&hyph;1B petitions without first soliciting public comment on the issue. This issue will be addressed in a future proposed rule. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that this rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule merely clarifies provisions of the MTINA which establish certain new petitioning procedures for H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants and new eligibility criteria for foreign physicians seeking employment in the medical profession in this country, and therefore has a de minimus economic impact on small entities. This rule is not considered to be significant within section 3(f) of E.O. 12866, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612. List of Subjects in 8 CFR Part 214 Administrative practice and procedures, Aliens, Employment, Organization and functions (Government agencies).
