Agreements have been dissolved also with Lithuania and Estonia. For the purpose of signing new agreements, a 14-member Russian delegation is scheduled to arrive in Latvia. At the same time, the president of the state joint stock company "Latvenergo" Gunars Koemecs stated that the Riga municipal authorities have settled only 54 percent of their accounts for the consumed heat. His enterprise has not received payment for heating of apartments and for hot water amounting to 6 million lats. Due to the cold weather in February, the sum of the debts may increase by one third, Koemecs said. G. Stelbovics also said that the main reason for the "Gazprom" action is the fact that LG owes 23 million USD to the Russian enterprise. The problem will be resolved during the next few days, because the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers has accepted the payment of this sum to LG, from the credit of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Although the decision of the Cabinet states that the money is slated for necessary gas supplies in the summer, G. Stelbovics has told DIENA that the money will go toward covering the debt. The large debts of LG result from the fact that the debtors do not pay for the consumed gas -- the total sum of debts on 1 February amounted to 49 million lats. At least 80,000 USD will be necessary for purchasing gas in the summer. To receive such a sum, there are talks being conducted by different foreign commercial banks and other financial structures, DIENA was told by G. Stelbovics. It seems alarming that such a numerous delegation is coming to Latvia, said the state minister of energetics, Andris Kreslins. The reasons might become known after the visit of the representatives of the state gas enterprises of the three Baltic countries to Moscow in the next few days. It is also not known what the conditions and prices proposed by Russian representatives will be, and what effect they will have on Latvia's economy and people.
