FR940803-1-00062 FR940803-1-00013 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION 49 CFR Chapter X [Ex Parte No. 274 (Sub&hyph;No. 13)] Rail Abandonments_Use of Rights-of-Way as Trails_Supplemental Trails Act Procedures AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission. ACTION: Denial of petition for rulemaking. SUMMARY: By petition filed March 29, 1994, the National Association of Reversionary Property Owners (NARPO) sought a rulemaking in order to amend the Commission's procedural rules concerning the Rails-to-Trails Program, 16 U.S.C. 1247(d). The Commission, however, has previously addressed similar arguments raised by NARPO. In a decision served February 21, 1990, the Commission, upon reconsideration of a decision served May 26, 1989, 54 FR 22970 (1989), declined to amend the rules implementing the National Trails System Act and found that the requirements sought by NARPO would be time-consuming, expensive, and burdensome and were not warranted given the Commission's limited involvement in trail use proposals and the purpose of the Trails Act, which is to encourage and facilitate interim trail use. 1 The law applicable to our previous decisions has not changed. Therefore, NARPO's petition for rulemaking is denied. 5 Rail Abandonments_Use of Rights-Of-Way as Trails_Supplemental Trails Act Procedures, Ex Parte No. 274 (Sub&hyph;No. 13) (ICC served Feb. 21, 1990) at 1&hyph;2.
