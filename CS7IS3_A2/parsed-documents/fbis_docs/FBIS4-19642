[TAGESZEITUNG] Mr. Reich, you have also characterized your candidacy as a reaction to the disinterest in parties and politics. After the election in Lower Saxony, the diagnosis of the mood in the society is that the disinterest in politics is waning. Do you think that this diagnosis is wrong? [Reich] I have always thought that the forecasts for a meager participation in the so-called superelection year were premature. The people also want to have some influence, even if it is ultimately only an interest in the result, the sporting side, as in a horse race. But I would be very careful about interpreting this is a newly awakened enthusiasm for politics. It is gratifying if the election turnout is being normalized but one cannot conclude from this that the population's ill humor with politics is already over. [TAGESZEITUNG] The result was interpreted above all by the two people's parties in accordance with the motto: there is increasing acceptance for that which is well-proved and the situation is becoming stable. [Reich] It may be that the intensity of the indifference with politics and the restlessness in the population have diminshed somewhat and it may be there has been somewhat of a decline in attacks by radical rightists. But that is scarcely a reason for the parties to give the all-clear signal. [TAGESZEITUNG] But the chance for your candidacy lies precisely in the great insecurity about the future capability of established politics. Are the reactions to your candidacy also changing? [Reich] In the political class or in the populace? [TAGESZEITUNG] How do the reactions differ? [Reich] They differ clearly. For the population, my candidacy appears to be downright provocative. It fills the halls and evokes approval and opposition. That is no different in the new laender than it is in Munich. Two years ago, I would not have expected that one could find a lot of interest in such themes as the constitution and plebiscites. [TAGESZEITUNG] That would more likely confirm the thesis of the end of indifference with politics or at least suggest a clear differentiation between the parties and indifference with politics. [Reich] I believe that, if anything, the situation has improved for such debates. There is a willingness to sacrifice freedom for public discourse. There is political movement. That does not mean the end of indifference with politics but here one can see a way out of this indifference. The people want to have a say and to participate in decisions. For 40 years the people in the west have shown that they can live in the democratically constituted society and in the east they showed in October 1989 that they can end a dictatorship and build democracy in a sensible way. The people are ready to be allowed to present initiatives and to be involved more directly in the political process. [TAGESZEITUNG] How is the political class reacting to your candidacy? [Reich] I get neither criticism nor approval. There is no longer a cartel of silence as there was at the beginning. There is much civility and sobriety. Everyone has his candidate and yet they are quite satisfied that there is also someone there from the east so that it will not look quite so shabby. My candidacy has at least shown that one can introduce into the conversation someone who is not drawing from 20 years of experience in Bonn and it has certainly contributed to the politicizing of the candidacy for the highest public office. For the first time, there has been a serious public discussion about the candidates. The parties did not want to have this taken away from them but it really has become a social policy event. [TAGESZEITUNG] Nevertheless some people will ask: Why is Jens Reich still a candidate, although it is already apparent that his prospects for being elected federal president are no longer especially good? [Reich] Because of the candidacy and the associated opportunity even more than in the past to bring up themes that are controversial in the long term. After all, there is the widespread attitude that in an election year one should not talk about the future and the gradually developing crises. That is so for ecology just as it is for the future of the social welfare state or the generation pact as it exists today. The parties are trying to carry on the election campaign without risk. The motto is "low profile." But it is precisely the risky themes and the controversial proposals that must be injected into the election campaign. Instead we are experiencing trivial discussions about personnel; people are stirring up the past; and the question of whether Egon Bahr, Mr. Jenninger, or Mr. Strauss once made deals with Mr. Axen is taken more seriously than the question of the future of our tax system. [TAGESZEITUNG] Do you think that the political system of the FRG with a legislative period of four years and the modalities that that involves is in any sort of a position to overcome such fundamental crises? [Reich] I believe that our four-year cycle has now become an obsession that prevents attempts at fundamental solutions. Instead crisis management dominates. We live in intervals of four years and no one dares to tackle a project of the century in this short interval. That has to do with the remarkable position that under no circumstances should one risk an election defeat. The correct attitude ought to be: we now have four years and in this time we will do what we consider essential. [TAGESZEITUNG] But precisely the problems that you have mentioned can hardly be tackled in such a way that decisive success can be demonstrated after one legislative period. The ozone hole cannot be handled in one legislative period. [Reich] But vigorous measures are conceivable. No policy that undertakes something in these areas can be finished after four years, and one can also admit this from the outset. [TAGESZEITUNG] But the parties are hesitant, because the actions that take effect in the long term immediately involve considerable burdens--from the speed limit to the increase in the mineral oil tax. [Reich] The cowardice of not saying anything at all and of dealing with the major critical themes only with general phrases produces the loss of confidence that continually narrows the latitude for political action. [TAGESZEITUNG] Do you have the impression that the society is ready to give up anything in the interest of unity? [Reich] I sense that opposition will come quickly when a specific sacrifice is called for. On the other hand, Helmut Kohl is being reproached for not having made any blood-sweat-and-tears speeches in 1990 to prepare the citizens for the demands on them. How is it that everyone would have been ready to sacrifice then and why is there massive opposition today when one takes them at their word about being willing to sacrifice? [TAGESZEITUNG] How can material cuts be accomplished politically? Is that a question of political conviction or can that ultimately be done only by decree? [Reich] Anyone who wants to become federal chancellor must say what unavoidable burdens are coming for society, and he must also promise that these burdens will be spread evenly throughout the entire population. In regard to the question of financing as well, the large parties must enter the election campaign with controversial proposals. Then both of them will risk losing the election but at the same time there is a greater chance that in the end there will be a concept with which one can govern. [TAGESZEITUNG] Does that mean that a really good policy is always the one that makes one unpopular? And conversely, a policy that is oriented primarily toward immediate approval will not be convincing in the long term? [Reich] A good policy would be one that produces tension, that presents truly clear alternatives, and that risks missing the majority in the election but provides the necessary latitude for action in the event of success, because it has clearly presented its proposed solutions even during the election campaign. That cannot be done with a "low profile." Take Brandt's ostpolitik. That was a clearly formulated and highly controversial project that was put to a vote and was confirmed by a large majority. That is an example of how one must enter an election with a controversial concept. [TAGESZEITUNG] Is that equally valid for the east and west? Is there a convergence between the two societies or, just as in 1990, are there largely different publics? [Reich] I do not know to what extent the consciousness in the east has changed. Are the people, who are in a relatively difficult material situation, nevertheless able to undertake an ecological reorganization of the economy and industry? The fact that we come from a considerably lower level of consumption could facilitate a fundamental change. [TAGESZEITUNG] Do you see signs of a willingness to make material sacrifices? [Reich] Yes, there are signs. Welcome money and bananas are no longer the central objective in the east as well. The desire from 1989 to enter into full consumption quickly and at the same time to attempt a kind of settlement of the entire past culture has failed. There is a growing awareness that the race to catch up with what was missed in the 1950's and 1960's can no longer be the supreme goal. [TAGESZEITUNG] But the failure of the high expectations with respect to consumption does not necessarily lead to a willingness for sacrifice and reform. There is a growing nostalgia for the GDR and rising popularity for the PDS. [Reich] The decisive thing for the success of the PDS seems to me to be the fact that it is the only party in the new laender that has been able to create an atmosphere. It attends to the club facilities and house communities--people who were once in the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] and who now support each other. It advises people on rent and pensions. The other parties do not engage in this kind of support in the local environment. [TAGESZEITUNG] Is that the reason for the Kutzmutz effect? [Reich] One must realize that there are 20 or 30 percent of the people who are marked as representatives of the old regime and also perceive themselves as such. They are often people who were involved in the FDJ [Free German Youth] since their early childhood, who took that as a matter of course, and who were quite shocked by the events of 1989 and are now seeking emotional support. That is not some ultraleftist radicalinsky theory. It is their milieu. This is why proposals for banning the PDS are absurd. Only someone who is very far away can call for this. [TAGESZEITUNG] Do you see the necessity of reorienting the debate about the past? [Reich] The past of the SED should have been dealt with in the enthusiasm of the revolution in 1989 and should have been an internal affair of the GDR. The historical process proceeded differently. This treatment of the past, above all juridically, was postponed, and unification took place before the GDR was terminated. Here lies the dilemma that has led to the truly absurd construct under which today political offenses from the time of the SED are dealt with in the formal framework of criminal procedures of the FRG, but materially in accordance with GDR law. [TAGESZEITUNG] Mr. Reich, for many years you have had contacts in the East European states, and since the revolution in 1989 you have repeatedly called for a political, economic, and cultural opening of Germany and West Europe to the East. How do you assess the debate about the expansion of NATO and the rift between the former Soviet satellite states and Russia? [Reich] I am very much a pacifist by nature. On 8 April 1945, my mother and I were fired upon by the guns of a low-altitude aircraft. I experienced the bombing raids and my father was held prisoner. I belong to the generation that said "never again," and for this reason I would love to leave military matters far behind. I think that the East European countries must be integrated into a security system without thereby excluding certain countries. That is certainly very difficult in the case of Russia, but I consider it a task that we must face just as an expansion of the EU [European Union] to the East even if that delays the integration in the West. [TAGESZEITUNG] Your friends from the former civic movement in Prague or Warsaw are counting on an integration into NATO that excludes Russia. [Reich] I think that we must slow down the very enthusiastic supporters of NATO among those in the civic movement. I would consider it to be a great historic mistake to exclude the former Soviet Union and to establish a source of unrest on the other side of the Limes. That would mean considerable polarization. The question is this: How must the existing alliance be restructured to make an offer to all of these countries that will make it impossible to wage war? [TAGESZEITUNG] The counterargument that is often made is that integration must proceed very quickly to do something to counteract the virulent nationalism, above all in Russia. [Reich] I do not have so much fear of Eastern nationalism. I see it as a mental straw in the shock situation of the upheaval. Yugoslavia is an extreme example that was wrongly influenced from outside and driven to escalation through extreme unreasonableness internally. I believe that the fear of a new Russian hegemony is unrealistic if we are really serious about a new security strategy and economic integration.
