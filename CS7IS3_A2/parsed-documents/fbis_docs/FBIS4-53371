At the one extreme critics say that he is quite capable of making reasonable choices thanks to his more than 20 years of experience in public life whereas the opposite opinion says that he is emotionally unstable and haphazard, acts on the spur of the moment, and is unreasonable in character. In reality, it is difficult to say which of these is accurate because of the paucity of information, a common difficulty encountered in research on North Korea. Therefore, any attempt to evaluate Kim Chong-il is full of pitfalls. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that Kim Chong-il is quite capable of making choices in the "North Korean style" on the strength of his long practical experience and with the assistance of his staff, limited as it is. Of course, this is not to say that I take at face value the overestimation of the existing arrangement for the succession on the one hand and his ability on the other. 1. Overly Packaged Kim Chong-il's Birth In the past North Korea overly embellished Kim Chong-il's image and publicized his blown up image instead of letting people know about him as he is. The key point in the succession in North Korea is whether the successor will secure his authority as the leader. For this reason, North Korea has been doing everything possible to groom Kim Chong-il. In this effort North Korea used books and NODONG SINMUN and other news media as major tools. As mentioned earlier, in my opinion Kim Chong-il will be able to rule North Korea for a certain period on the strength of his experience and ability alone. Yet North Korea continues to overexaggerate his image, and this might rather cause his early fall. That is why we need to analyze and evaluate North Korea's appraisal of Kim Chong-il accurately and objectively. If we were to accept the North Korean appraisal without ascertaining facts, we would be faced with difficulties in dealing with the future Kim Chong-il regime. For this reason, I will analyze the substance of "Kim Chong- il, the Leader," Vol. I and Vol. II, (hereunder referred to as "Leader- 1" and "Leader-2," respectively), Tongbangsa, 1984, co-authored by Tak Chin, Kim Kang-il, and Pak Hong-che, by way of critiquing the process of blowing up Kim Chong-il's image. The most distorted part of Kim Chong-il's biography concerns his birthplace. According to "Leader-1," "Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il was born ... at a secret camp in Mt. Paektu on 16 February 1942." In fact, Mt. Paektu, known as a sacred mountain of our nation, has been the spiritual prop of the Korean race. For this reason Kim Il-song has exaggerated the anti-Japanese armed struggle in the area around Mt. Paektu (the Changbaek Mountains), using it as the basis of his legitimacy. Accordingly, North Korea might have had no other choice but to fabricate the story of Kim Chong-il's birth in a secret camp in that mountain while Kim Il-song was waging the anti-Japanese struggle in 1942 (some say 1941). Otherwise the myth about the Kim Il- song-led anti-Japanese armed struggle in and around Mt. Paektu would crumble, weakening the logical basis of the succession doctrine as well. The general view on Kim Chong-il's birthplace is that he was born in the South Camp in a village near Vladivostok, Russia. 2. Unstable Character Among Kim Chong-il watchers, there is a controversy over the question of his personality. On the whole Kim Chong-il's character is far from a composed and stable type. "Leader-2" on page 167, says: "He is always pondering some problem. Even when he sits, he constantly moves; and when he crosses the room he does not walk slowly, but moves with agility." But when we interpret this remark--originally intended as a compliment--in a critical light, we would say Kim Chong-il is unstable. Kim Chong-il could be a militant. "Leader-2" on page 123 says: "The piebald horse he wanted was still an untamed ferocious wild horse unfit for riding. The workers were reluctant, but he insisted on bringing the horse to him." The book continues: "Aggressiveness, speed, and incisiveness--this temperament clearly manifested itself in accomplishing everything at a stroke. Thrust forward quickly, break through barriers and dash forth ceaselessly by leaps--this is his unique work ethos. This passionate temperament found its expression in the Speed Battle." In this way the book pays tribute to Kim Chong-il's intrepidity. But conversely, this is indicative of being foolhardy and adventurous. The question of modesty arises in discussing Kim Chong-il's personality. Says "Leader-1" on page 92: "He is erudite, free and easy in disposition, and does not get bogged down in anything. Naturally, in response to unanimous requests by classmates, he got himself involved in many activities on the university campus and stood at the center of the youth movement." "Leader-1" on pages 255-256 says: "His fine virtue of dealing with others with modesty and frankness always warmed people's hearts, inspiring a boundless sense of intimacy, and wrapped people around him wrapped in a family atmosphere... Wherever he went, he soon mingled with people." "Leader-2" on page 378 says: "When he mounts the platform, or leaves the hall after a meeting, he always tries to let former anti-Japanese fighters precede him. This sometimes causes a temporary halt in the flow of dignitaries mounting or leaving the platform." In this way the books try to publicize his image as a humble man. Kim Chong-il is even said to be arrogant to people of his father's generation because he grew up as the oldest son of Kim Il-song, and identifies himself with his father's status. Reportedly, he holds his hands behind his back even in front of Kim Il-song; and that is why the "followers of Kim Il-song" complain about this attitude. Accordingly, the claim that he is humble could be fiction. 3. `Daring,' Wide-Angle Politician There are also arguments about Kim Chong-il's ruling style. North Korean propaganda claims that Kim Chong-il engaged in politics early on as a university student. Says "Leader-1" on page 122: "Early on in his university days, Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il emerged as a politician who contributed directly to the formulation and implementation of party policies, not as a politician who merely took part in politics to simply help implement party policies... Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il was a university student and a politician at the same time." The book claims that he was a student politician who personally contributed to the formulation and implementation of party policies during his university days, going beyond simply assisting in the implementation of party policies. From all this, it may be surmised that he was interested in politics already in his youth. Regarding his work style, North Korea is publicizing that he is a "daring" wide-angle politician. Says "Leader-1" on page 277: "It is customary for him to tackle any task daringly and boldly. But the latest large, long-distance belt-conveyer transport project was a particularly fantastic and grandiose transformation plan... In fact, after this project, numerous structures were built under a long-range plan under his guidance. The large long-distance belt-conveyor transport construction project at Unyul Mine marked the beginning of the series of impressive monumental structures erected under plans for the ages." Of course, that was true because the succeeding years saw the erection of numerous gigantic strictures, such as Changgwang Street (in 1980), the Great Study Hall of the People (in 1981), the Arch of Triumph and the Chuche Tower (in 1982) in North Korea. The problem, however, is that Kim Chong-il, who entered politics with no political philosophy, thinks anything huge is valuable without regard to efficiency and economic benefits. This is to say that contrary to North Korea' boast, what they call wide-angle politics is a reflection of the haphazard, extemporaneous, and uneconomical aspects of his personality, and it could cause him difficulties in securing his authority as the successor. 4. Kim Chong-il's Ruling Style In addition to all those problems, the side effects of personalty cult- centered mode of rule are very serious as apparent from this passage on page 136 of "Leader-2": "He immediately sent a high-performance pump by helicopter. No sooner had he received a report that a certain mine had no means to haul dirt than he dispatched large trucks. They were able to instantly overcome whatever obstacles and temporary slack times by following his bold and resourceful countermeasures." In the last analysis, this mode of personal rule has become one of the fundamental causes leading to the derangement of North Korea's economic structure, a planned economy. This is to say that his mode of operation is a factor causing the incapacitation of the planned economy. A more serious problem is that Kim, failing to realize the seriousness of this, is absorbed in "gift-oiled politics" and "invitation-driven politics," the acme of personal rule. Another problem involving his ruling style concerns his working hours. "Leader-2" on page 166 says: "Dear Comrade Kim Chong- il's daily schedule begins at 0000 hours and ends at 0000 hours on the following day... Some of his aides say his schedule flows like a duet or a trio, and others say his schedule runs on a two-dimensional or three-dimensional scale." This kind of operating style has led to grumbling by functionaries. Those concerned have to stand by just in case he summons them, and this reduces efficiency due to the difficulty in adapting oneself to the different working hours. Therefore, this operating style should be viewed as a factor undermining his authority rather than an asset. 5. Kim Chong-il's Complex Another question raised by Kim watchers is, why does he seldom appear in public? There may be roughly two reasons. First, it may be because of his scheming temperament. In this connection, "Leader-1" on page 364 explains: "While moved as they were by the marvelous changes, the general public in many cases knew very little about his hard work hidden in those marvels because he worked silently by mixing with the masses. Moreover, he tried hard to shun publicity on his achievements. That is why in most cases his heroic efforts in certain tasks came to light belatedly. This to say that what he accomplished was in the limelight, but he hid himself behind his accomplishments." Nevertheless, it may not be out of modesty but because of his scheming personality and his tendency to shun the masses that Kim Chong-il avoids public appearances as much as possible. Some critics attribute it to his "inferiority complex about being short." Secondly, his poor conversational skills may be another reason. Of course, "Leader-2" on page 12 praises his speaking capability in these words: "He delivers powerful speeches in plain words, but he leads the audience to the high ground of his unique thought through his well-organized logic." However, none of his speeches has ever been broadcast in his own voice. This sheds light on the question of his public speaking capability. That he is an illogical and unsystematic orator was proven by the testimonies of Choe Un-hui and Sin Sang-ok. In this connection, it may be said that Kim Chong-il has a "stutterer complex." 6. Childhood Glorified Another problem is that "Leader-1" and "Leader-2" exaggerate Kim Chong-il's wizardry. North Korea traces back Kim's childhood to age three in order to highlight his love of the country. "Leader-1" on page 8 describes his return to Korea as follows: "One day shortly after liberation Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il was en route to Pyongyang on board a boxcar with his mother, Mme Kim Chong-suk, and other female anti-Japanese fighters. The train traveled along the scenic east coast in the liberated homeland before heading west. As he watched a hamlet of thatched houses at the foot of the mountain from the whistling train, his face beamed with joy. Everything seemed to welcome him and his party with an extended hand. Young as he was, he felt deep in his heart the preciousness of the fatherland." According to this book, he must have been 3 years old when he returned to Korea, for he was born in 1942. A 3-year-old prodigy could have an exceptional ability to speak and comprehend, as well as exceptional mathematical reasoning power. But according to experts, even such a whiz kid is not emotionally mature enough to express his inner feelings about his country. Therefore, the claim that he felt deep in his heart the preciousness of the fatherland at that young age is an exaggeration of his personality. This is to say that North Korea is exaggerating Kim's childhood in an attempt to deify him and elevate him to the level of Jesus Christ. "Leader-1" on pages 14-15 tells anecdotes about him as a preschooler. An old man was telling the story of a woman named Kye Wol-hyang, who during Hideyoshi's invasion of Korea in 1592, spied on the enemy and passed the secrets to our forces, resulting in the death of an enemy general and the recapture of Pyongyang. The old man was embarrassed because he could not recall the name of the Japanese general. At that moment Kim Chong-il, who sat near the old man, gave him the name and left quietly. The audience called the young child a whiz kid. That is the gist of the story. The book also carries the following anecdote about Kim's exceptional wisdom: "From childhood Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il surprised those around him by his wide-ranging knowledge and high level of intelligence that were beyond imagination for his age. First of all, his knowledge and intelligence are gifts of nature." "Leader-1" on page 25 says: "The intensity of the fire of his effort and enthusiasm can be surmised by the single fact that the books he read from childhood through secondary school numbered in the thousands." Regarding Kim's academic ability, "Leader-1" on page 91 says: "Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il's writings are really many- sided. The forms and methods he uses in writing scientific theses are very diverse and the scale of his works is huge indeed. The substance covers a wide range of politics, economics, education, science, literature, and art." Even if these anecdotes are true, they are not particularly unusual. Kim Chong-il might have had an extra lesson in Hideyoshi's invasion of Korea from his tutor, and thus the young Kim, dubiously known as a prodigy, might have been able to recall the name of the Japanese general. But no doubt they went too far when they turned him into a prodigy. The claim that he is a bookworm may be accepted at face value to some extent, but the claim that he is an expert in all fields, not just one particular field, is hardly acceptable. 7. Kim Chong-il's Doubtful Record Whether Kim Chong-il studied abroad or not is also an open question. "Leader-1" on page 57 says: "Quite a few people predicted that Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il would study abroad when he graduated from a higher middle school. People thought so partly because it was a popular notion in those days that anyone desiring to be successful in life should go abroad to study, and partly because he traveled abroad in his higher middle school days before going on to university. His decision to study at Kim Il-song University, however, was a demonstration of his thoroughgoing chuche awareness to pursue studies based on reality in his own country where the great chuche ideology and party policy, its embodiment, are in bloom." Generally speaking, quite a few youths belonging to the generation that experienced colonial rule in the early 1900's went abroad to study, and North Koreans were no exception. As the author of "Leader" admits, the general atmosphere in those days was such that study abroad was essential for the ruling elite. However, suppose that Kim Il-song, who adopted self-reliance and chuche as the dominant ideology, had sent Kim Chong-il abroad to study for whatever reasons, it might have raised a serious question about the "holiness" and "the chuche stand and attitude" of the Kim Il-song regime. That is why North Korea is stressing that Kim Chong-il did not go abroad to study. However, the problem is that there is a 2-year blank in Kim Chong-il's schooling. He entered Namsan Higher Middle School in Pyongyang in September 1957. But it is not clear where he was in from August 1958 when he was enrolled at his higher middle school, to September 1960 when he entered Kim Il-song University. Some critics say he was studying at the East German Air Force Academy. They try to substantiate this speculation by the fact that when he writes the Arabic numeral 7, he crosses it with a bar, just as Europeans do--a practice not found among Orientals. One may refute this by saying that he might have taken on that habit while he was playing with the children of Russian advisers. On the other hand, there is another somewhat different question concerning the North Korean claim that Kim Chong-il uncovered the thesis "On Combating Dogmatism and Formalism in Ideological Work and Establishing Chuche," known as the theoretical foundation of the chuche ideology in North Korea. Says "Leader-1" on page 167: "In March 1968 Kim Chong-il "spotted the leader's following handwritten manuscripts among his notes: `On Combating Dogmatism and Formalism in Ideological Work and Establishing Chuche,' a masterpiece dated 28 December 1955; and `On Communist Indoctrination,' a speech delivered in November 1958; in addition to the April 1965 Theses." The claim that he uncovered the manuscript of "On Combating Dogmatism..." in 1968 is of very great significance. As is widely known, this document, supposedly published by Kim Il-song in 1955, is a very important document in the study of North Korea's chuche ideology. But the problem is that none of the official papers, including NODONG SINMUN, ever published it that year. Accordingly, most probably this document was fabricated by necessity in 1968. 1968 was when the campaign to idolize Kim Il-song reached its peak, and they might have found it necessary to fabricate Kim Il-song's image as a "great chuche ideologist." To this end, North Korea published numerous educational books, including "A Sketch of Comrade Kim Il- song's Revolutionary Activity" and "Picture Book on the History of the Leader's Revolutionary Activity," in order to publicize Kim Il-song's revolutionary thought and the sagacity of his leadership. Quite possibly, it may be said that North Korea fabricated the document, "On Combating Dogmatism..." as part of this propaganda campaign. In conclusion, the overblown image of Kim Chong-il in "Leader-1" and "Leader-2" is a natural outcome of the personality cult that has become a religion in North Korea. To define a proper relationship between Kim Il-song "the God" and Kim Chong-il the son of "the God," they have no choice but to deify Kim Chong-il. Accordingly, in an attempt to exaggerate Kim Chong-il's legitimacy and infallibility, they fabricated the myth that he was born on Mt. Paektu, and made false claims about his wizardry, benevolence, prowess, and ideological quality, etc. It is a fact that this kind of hoodwinking works on the North Korean people, who remain in social- political infancy. But sooner or later the lies will come to light; and when the "icon in the cave" breaks, North Korea will be thrown into terrible turmoil.
