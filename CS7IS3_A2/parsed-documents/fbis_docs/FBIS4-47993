Dr. Chris Stals said in Cape Town that South Africa must keep inflation as low as possible, especially to protect more disadvantaged people. He commented that political and economic stability is necessary to persuade foreign investors that their investments are secure. [Begin Stals recording] Yes, I think that for the construction of a factory, for example, one that has to produce locally for a long time, one would need much more security concerning the economic policy and political stability, and I think that that sort of investment will only come later, once we have confirmed our own credibility and credit worthiness.
