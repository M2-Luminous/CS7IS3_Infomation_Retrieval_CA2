Some 7,500 foreign-funded enterprises of three types were approved and more than $10 billion were brought in. In 1993, $2.85 billion foreign capital were really used, accounting for 31 percent of the total planned figure. Of the "three-typed" projects approved in 1993, the number of large-sized projects each involving moreo than $10 million doubled or redoubled and reached 200. Due to the stimulus by large projects, the scale of these projects averaged at $2,770,000 and each project used $167.4 million foreign capital on average, respectively increasing by 120 percent and 150 percent over the previous year. More than 20 trans-national companies made investment and ran plants in Beijing, and there were more than 60 international famous companies in Beijing. Development zones and small industrial zones developed healthily and became new economic growth points. As of the end of 1993, the municipality had 33 development zones, small industrial zones, and science and technology park zones of various categories which were established with the approvals of the State Council and the municipal government. Some 277.35 square kilometers of land were covered in the plan for clarifying the categories of land which should be used to build the zones of these three types. So far, 26 development zones and small industrial zones have entered the stages of building infrastructural facilities. A total of 1,374 projects entered these zones (excluding the new-tech industrial development experimental zone). Investment in these projects totaled 18.15 billion yuan; registered capital totaled 9.94 billion yuan, of which 5.43 billion yuan was invested by the foreign side; and contracted amount of foreign funds was $1.25 billion, of which 40 percent, or $500 million, was brought in. Some enterprises and products of the zones entered the world market and played a fairly good exemplary and leading role. Enterprises completed and commissioned in the development zone and small industrial zones created 950 million yuan in output value in 1993, created 1.52 billion yuan in sales income, earned a profit of 80 million yuan, and paid 50 million yuan of taxes. The three development zones subordinate to the municipality--the Beijing Economic and Technological Development Zone, the Beijing Xisanqi New Building Material Industrial Development Zone, and the Wangfujing Commercial Zone--provided projects for investment. These projects brought in 10.2 billion yuan of investment, their registered capital totaled 4.85 billion yuan, and the contracted amount of foreign capital was $670 million. Development in bringing in foreign investment remained vigorous. The Beijing Municipal New-Tech Industrial Development Experimental Zone continued the high-speed development. By the end of 1993, 3,768 technological enterprises had registered with the zone, of which 700 were foreign-funded enterprises of the three types. These enterprises employed 75,000 people, of whom more than two-thirds had a college education level or higher. They developed over 4,500 new technology and new products in the year, and over 1,600 of them were put into mass production. A number of high- and new-tech achievements leading in the world were directly transformed into productive forces to produce good social and economic benefits. In 1993, the experimental zone's income from technological and industrial production and foreign trade exceeded 10 billion yuan, and its profit totaled 800 million yuan, both ranking first in China's new-tech industrial experimental zones. 7. Living Standard, Prices Living standard was further improved. The annual total wage of incumbent staff members and workers was 20.25 billion yuan, up 27.8 percent from the preceding year. Workers' average wage increased by 28.3 percent over the preceding year, or 7.8 percent when allowing for price rises. Peasants' per capita net income showed an increase of 18.2 percent over the preceding year, or 5.1 percent when allowing for price rises. Urban and rural people's large durable consumer goods continued to increase. Every 100 urban families had 107.2 color television sets, 45.6 video recorders, and 82.4 cameras, up 5.7, 9.4, and 6.7 percent, respectively, from the preceding year; and every 100 rural families had 56 color television sets, 47 refrigerators, and 76 washing machines, up 21.7, 17.5, and 4.1 percent, respectively. Price reform was accelerated. To meet the needs in developing the socialist market economy, Beijing further accelerated the price reform in 1993. It lifted the price control on grain, edible oil, and their products in the year and basically decontrolled the prices of all major consumer goods, except for fuels, thus playing a positive role in balancing the price relations and enlivening commodity distribution. Thanks to larger demands and increased production cost, workers's cost of living price index rose by 19 percent in the year, and the retail price index rose by 16.9 percent. The price index registered an increase of 20.7, 9.2, and 16.6 percent, respectively, in food, clothes, and articles for daily use; a decline of 0.3 percent in cultural and recreational commodities; and an increase of 15.1, 10.7, and 57.3 percent, respectively, in medicine and medical goods, building materials, and fuels. The price index of services rose by 33.8 percent. Savings deposits of urban and rural residents continued to increase substantially. By the end of 1993, saving deposits of urban and rural residents amounted to 56.07 billion yuan, an increase of 44.2 percent over the figure at the beginning of that year. Of this figure, savings deposits of urban residents amounted to 48.25 billion yuan, up 46.6 percent, and those of peasants amounted to 7.82 billion yuan, up by 31.2 percent. New headway was made in residential construction. In 1993, construction of 18.083 million square meters of residences were started or restored, an increase of 4.9 percent over the previous year, and construction of 61.41 million square meters were completed. In 1993, 135 small residential districts were under construction in the municipality, with the areas whose construction was started or restored reaching 12.634 million square meters. Of them, 10 small residential districts newly started construction in 1993, with a total floor space of 994,000 square meters. In 1993, construction of three small residential districts was completed, with a total construction area of 500,000 square meters. By the end of 1993, 15 small dangerous residential districts were under rebuilding, with a total construction area of 3.555 million square meters, of which, 790,000 square meters were completed, newly settling 9,500 households, and resettling 3,600 households. In line with the "Beijing programs for well-off-type residences projects," the municipality built 100,000 square meters of well-off-type residences, 8,000 square meters were made available, enabling some specially difficult households to moved to new residences. The people's housing conditions improved further. The per capita share of housing acreage of urban residents was 12.5 square meters, and that of peasants was 23.7 square meters. 8. Population Population growth continued to be put under control. According to the statistics by the household registration departments, by the end of 1993, the municipality's population with household registration came to 10.512 million, 63,000 more than the figure at the beginning of 1993. Of them, non-agricultural population numbered 6.687 million, 124,000 more than the figure at the beginning of 1993. According to the sample survey of the changes in population, the birth rate of permanent population was 9.35 per thousand, up by 0.13 permillage points over the previous year, and the death rate was 6.16 per thousand, 0.05 permillage points higher than the previous year, resulting in a natural population growth rate of 3.19 per thousand, 0.08 permillage points higher than the previous year. Along with the all-around development of the work, the municipality also met some difficulties and problems in 1993. Relatively conspicuous ones included: Construction funds remained insufficient, construction of basic facilities still lagged behind the demand of accelerating the development of the capital, economic efficiency of some state-owned enterprises declined, increase margin of commodity prices was on the high side, and some low-income households still had difficulties with daily life.
