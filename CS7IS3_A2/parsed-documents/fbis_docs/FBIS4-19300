Convoys from the Croatian capital Zagreb to Serb-controlled Banja Luka in Bosnia-Hercegovina and out of Belgrade in Serbia were stopped Monday, as Serb authorities reacted angrily to NATO airstrikes Sunday and Monday on Serb positions around the besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde. But UNHCR officials remain in contact with Bosnian Serb authorities in Pale, and have asked to restart aid convoys through Serb-controlled territory next week, UNHCR spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said. Meanwhile, the number of casualities in Gorazde in eastern Bosnia since the Serb onslaught began on March 28 rose to 191 dead and 797 wounded on Thursday, the UN added. The spokeswoman said that according to reports of UNHCR staff in Gorazde: "People are just incredibly panicked and terrified of what is going to happen to them."
