The funds seek to invest in securities. Their concept is based on offering the fund's capital to the public for general subscription, the fund's capital being divided into equal portions, each of which is called a certificate of investment. From the amount collected from subscriptions to the investment certificates the fund engages in trading--buying and selling--securities (bonds and stocks). From this operation are realized the fund's profits, which are distributed equally to the investment certificates. However, not all operations are necessarily profitable: sometimes the fund may lose, but the diversity of the securities and the experience of the fund managers work to offset the loss through other operations. In this way, investment funds are an appropriate, safe alternative to investment companies. Investors who do not want to deal with banks can invest their money in investment funds, which therefore are a strong competitor to the other savings vehicles in the banks. As Dr. Mahmud Subh of the 'Ayn Shams business faculty says that the size of a fund's profits or losses depends on the quality of the securities it holds. Dealing with the funds thus is subject to profit and loss. There is no guarantee of a definite rate of profit as with bank deposits. However, with the increased risk attendant on the acceptance of the principle of profit and loss comes the opportunity to realize high rates of gain on a certificate's holding--returns much higher than those of banks--if good securities are chosen that yield high rates of return through capital gains or stock dividends. Now that the funds exist, there is no longer any reason for the small investor who knows nothing about how to deal with securities to hold back. Specialized management companies will study the market for him, determine the condition of companies, acquire the securities of good companies, and unload the securities of companies that may be face difficulties for long periods. Bank Securities A major problem that will face the funds is the shortage of good securities in the market. Currently existing brokerage companies and financial portfolio formation companies complain of this problem. How much more of a problem there will be with the entry of the greater demand that the funds cause! It may cause an excessive rise in the price of some securities. Husayn Shukri, a financial expert, says that one should take into account some securities already on the market, in addition to securities that will be opened to public subscription in privatization operations. The cement companies and the al-Dakhilah Paints and Iron Company, among others, will be offered in coming months. Shares to increase the capital of the International Commercial Bank will be delivered to their owners soon. All this will increase the supply of securities. The market is expanding with an increased volume of supply and an increased amount of demand at the same time. Another factor making for an increased supply [of securities] is that some banks are offering part of their portfolios of sluggish securities for circulation. The bank's affiliated fund will have priority in taking advantage of some of these securities. Farid Ibrahim, vice president of al-Ahli Investment Funds Company, notes that over 30 percent of banks' assets--those invested in securities--are stagnant. These are good securities, but the banks are satisfied with the dividends they collect on them. The securities could yield more if the banks sold some of them, bought others, and made their portfolio circulate, instead of the current tendency to target and hoard stocks with current dividends. Some banks have begun to believe in circulating their portfolios, instead of hoarding. Al-Ahli Bank's portfolio will have a share in the fund's portfolio. However, the quality of the security is the first and last criterion. Dr. Ahmad Sa'd 'Abd-al-Latif, at Cairo University's school of business, points to another aspect: legally approved securities that have not yet gone on the market. We now have many securities according to the laws; yet they are not on the market. Law 146 granted joint-stock companies that are not subject to the law the right to issue financing instruments. The law also allowed the issuance of preferred stocks; the market, however, has not seen them. Although one faltering joint commercial bank has turned to them to encourage interest in subscribing to increase its capital, other companies are in need of the same procedure. There Is a Difference Farid Ibrahim, vice president of al-Ahli Investment Funds Company, noted the difference between the funds and investment companies, despite the similarity in goals and aims. It is a difference in the methods followed. The most prominent of these is the principle of asset distribution. When a fund's resources are short term, their investment must be short term and highly liquid, so that they can be converted into cash quickly, thus enabling the investor to withdraw his money at any time. Conversely, the investments of investment companies have been directed toward such long-term areas as agricultural and manufacturing projects and real estate. Certificate Price and the Small Investor The first fund to offer its certificates will offer them at a price of 500 pounds per certificate, with a minimum purchase of 1,000 pounds. This raises the problem of whether the certificate's price suits the abilities of the small investors whom the fund intends to encourage to deal in securities. Some think this price is too high and will prevent the involvement of ordinary people--especially young people and government employees--who would have been brought in by a lower certificate price. Dr. Nadiyah Abu-Fakhrah, of the business administration department of 'Ayn Shams University's business school, thinks that during the initial phase the ordinary person will not be interested in buying investment certificates. Such people turn to the postal savings fund. As awareness about investing in securities increases, some of these people may turn gradually to buying investment certificates. In the first phase, one can therefore expect the purchases of investment certificates to be concentrated on those who have an awareness about securities investments, particularly companies and banks. Dr. Khayri al-Jaziri, a finance teacher at Cairo University's business school, says that the Egyptian market still lacks studies to determine the characteristics of the Egyptian small investor and ascertain his financial abilities and what kind of investment suits him in terms of liquidity, yield, and degree of risk. This is where we should begin. After such studies exist, they can be translated into setting the value, type, and characteristics of the securities offered, so that they will suit the small investor. Dr. Ahmad Sa'd 'Abd-al-Latif thinks that the certificate's price is reasonable because one can assume that anyone who invests in securities does not need the invested amount for a period of time. Thus, if the amount undergoes some losses, they will not affect his standard of living, because the money is surplus that is not needed for daily expenditures. Thus the sum is appropriate. In case the holder of the certificate needs to reclaim its value, the value of its yield must exceed the costs of his going to the bank and must be suitable for the time in which he can reclaim it. The relative greatness of the value will also make management operations within the fund easier. Dr. Mahmud Subh of the business administration department of 'Ayn Shams business school thinks that, if it is merely a matter of shifting some of the money of bank depositors, who will shift some of their money deposited in the banks to the purchase of certificates, we shall not thereby add much to the market. We ought to be attracting new money that is outside current bank deposits with their accumulated liquidity, so as to expand the circle of investment. Many experts think that the time is not right for the emergence of the funds. It would be better for the constituent factors for their success to be present first, as any failure in the first phase will affect the entire experiment. Others think we must begin, because we are already late: the picture will become clearer with experience; encouraging factors will appear that can be used to advantage; and we shall become aware of impeding factors, so that they can be remedied. Dr. Ahmad Sa'd 'Abd-al-Latif says that we have a limited number of financial analysts--people to provide information about stocks for making decisions to buy or sell securities at appropriate times. A stock has a cycle of rise and fall, and only a financial analyst can know where a stock currently stands in this cycle. Only he can predict the directions of stock prices. As everyone knows, we do not have studies to predict the condition of Egyptian companies. Although accountants currently perform the task of financial analysis, they concentrate on past information, while analysis requires past, present, and future information. Although we have past information, we have a shortage of present information and very little future-oriented information. Husayn Shukri says that we have financial analysts. Although they are accountants by origin, they are being enlisted to serve in securities analysis. As for an absence of studies to predict securities prices, the funds will attend to this. Companies will emerge in the coming period to do research based on their successive visits to the companies whose condition they are analyzing. In most countries of the world, brokerage firms have research departments. With time, this will happen in Egypt. Dr. Khayri al-Jaziri commented that the profession of financial analyst does not necessarily require that the analyst have a background in accounting, management, or economics. It is a profession in which anyone who has the tools can succeed. We have a sufficient number of financial analysts in Egypt at the present time. The problem lies in the shortage of people who can read financial analysis and benefit from its conclusions, so as to translate the results of financial analysis into financial decisions.
