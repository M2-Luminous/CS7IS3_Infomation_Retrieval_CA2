He said Natal was a "difficult province" but "in the weeks to come we will deal with the volatile and explosive situation". "We will definitely talk about making wider use of the SADF," Mr de Klerk said. Mr de Klerk said he on Thursday morning received morning updated intelligence reports and contingency plans for Natal, and would be given a full run-down on Thursday afternoon. "The government is willing and able to ensure that law and order is effectively maintained." He said the solution lay in continued successful negotiations. On the controversy surrounding his laying of the foundation stone at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Phoenix earlier in the day, Mr de Klerk reiterated he had acted as the head of state. He chastised the Democratic Party Natal Chairman Mike Ellis for suggesting his visit was an electioneering strategy. He said he was performing a "pleasant" duty as the leader of the government. "I don't need them to teach me good manners," said Mr de Klerk. He also criticised the Transitional Executive Council for "poking their nose" into his public duties. He said they should rather concentrate their efforts on stopping intimidation. "This is beyond my understanding," Mr de Klerk commented.
