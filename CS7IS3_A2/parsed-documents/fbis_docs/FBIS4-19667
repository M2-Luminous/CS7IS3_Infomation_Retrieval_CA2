He added that the position of the Greek Cypriot side is that it accepts the document as is, while Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas is raising many points other than the issue of access to Famagusta. The spokesman stressed that Kliridhis is ready to meet either with Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, or Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, to reiterate that he has accepted the document as is and expects the Turkish side to do the same. Kasoulidhis concluded that the president is ready to say that he will accept neither new documents nor a modification of the current document.
