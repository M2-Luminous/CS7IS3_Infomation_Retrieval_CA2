One of the prominent accomplishments is the reduced number of drug addicts, a news release from the Public Security Ministry said yesterday. Yunnan, which borders the notorious drug-trafficking "golden triangle" and has been used as a passageway by drug traffickers, previously had a large drug-addict population. However, due to the province's expanded rehabilitation efforts, the number of addicts was reduced to 40,000 by the end of last year -- a drop of 30 percent from 1990. And the ranks of new addicts have been kept to 2,000 during each of the past three years. But before 1990, about five times as many new addicts became hooked each year. Yunnan's drug addicts account for 16 percent of the total addict population in China. Presently, more than 700 counties in 17 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have a problem with drug addiction. Growing numbers of addicts are particularly noted in Sichuan, Guizhou, Gansu, Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, statistics from the Public Health Ministry show. To curb this increasing crime, China reorganized its high-level National Narcotics Control Commission last July to guide the overall effort. The news release attributed Yunnan's achievements to the province's increased investment in its battle against drug offences and in law enforcement. The province began to tighten its narcotics control in 1990. In the past two years, the State government and Yunnan provincial government have poured 16 million yuan (1.8 million) into renovating and setting up 28 rehabilitation centres. More than 20,000 drug users receive treatment at these correction centres each year. The approach consists of medical treatment combined with tough social supervision. As a result, 10 percent of treated addicts have completely overcome their addiction.
