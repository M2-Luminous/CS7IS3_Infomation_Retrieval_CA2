To what degree does the decision of the Russian pricing department affect the railroads and clients of the maritime region? Viktor Yefimovich Lyannykh, deputy chief of the freight and commercial operations section of the Vladivostok Division of the Far Eastern Railroad, provides commentary. "Following the directive of the Committee on Pricing Policy came the order of the Ministry of Railways with a specific deciphering of the financial aspects with our business partners. In particular, it was prescribed that the tariffs for intrastate transportation would be applied to export-freight shipments through Russian border and port stations. "Additional charges will be applied over and above the tariffs and fees (with the exception of export-freight shipments, including to the Baltic countries), consisting of a tax of 20 percent and special 3 percent tax (for financial support to the most important sectors of the national economy). The application of a maximum index of 1.20 to existing payment rates for other operations and services is authorized. But in order to preclude monopolistic pressure from being applied to clients, the ministry has established an upper limit of profitability for operation and services in the amount of 35 percent. "The measures being undertaken by the ministry are not for the sake of enjoyment. The ministry itself is operating at a loss. The Far Eastern Railroad, for example, has entered `minus 6 billion rubles' in the `Profits' column. Losses from transportation operations include rising costs of fuel and electric power, spare parts--now in short supply--for diesel locomotives and freight cars, outlays for worn-out track, cross ties, and switching-signal sections. "And prospects for the future are cloudy. The transportation business is in decline. The enterprises--our clients--are shutting down production output. Our partners of yesterday are turning their attention with ever increasing frequency to motor vehicle transport. Short-run motor vehicle transport has been more convenient, more advantageous, and quicker. Thus, the railroads are facing a struggle for clients who want efficient execution of orders and high-quality service. "In the meantime, a natural process of reduction of our worker contingent has begun. We are not taking action to effect this, but neither are we accepting people for work. "And then we have that same old situation today concerning debts receivable. They are colossal! The list of enterprises in debt to us for transport spans 10 pages--they owe us R12.5 billion. "We are trying to restrict our acceptance of freight for transport from those dispatching enterprises that are most steeped in debt. But this is a two-edged sword: When enterprises do not ship production output, they do not get paid for it. And they do not settle accounts with us either. While the state treasury tells us to hand over the required amount, think about paying wages later. "The only aspect, undoubtedly, that does not distress everyone is the following point of the ministry order: `The boosted index for tariffs in effect is not applied with respect to small, lightweight shipments of freight and citizens' household goods being transported by intra- and interstate transportation.'"
