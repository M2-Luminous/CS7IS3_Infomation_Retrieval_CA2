FR940304-0-00012 FR940304-0-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;86&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8844; AD 94&hyph;05&hyph;06] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes, that requires modification or replacement of designated passenger cabin floor panels. This amendment is prompted by a report that, during manufacture, the inserts that attach the floor panels to the seat tracks and floor beams were installed using sealant rather than required adhesive. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of the passenger cabin floor capability to support the airplane interior inertia loads under emergency landing conditions. DATES: Effective April 4, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of April 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, P.O. Box 1771, Long Beach, California 90801&hyph;1771, Attention: Business Unit Manager, Technical Administrative Support, Dept. L51, M.C. 2&hyph;98. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Wahib Mina, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANM&hyph;121L, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California 90806&hyph;2425; telephone (310) 988&hyph;5324; fax (310) 988&hyph;5210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on August 19, 1993 (58 FR 44150). That action proposed to require modification or replacement of designated passenger cabin floor panels. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. Two commenters support the proposed rule. The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of several of its members, requests that the FAA withdraw the proposed rule. The commenter states that all U.S. operators and all but one non-U.S. operator have accomplished the modification or replacement specified in McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Service Bulletin 53&hyph;31, which is cited in the proposed rule, thereby ensuring that 9g crash certification requirements are satisfied. The commenter adds that McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Service Bulletins 53&hyph;32 and 53&hyph;33, which are also cited in the proposal, were only included in the manufacturer's service program to ensure commonality between operators, but were not included in that program to return the aircraft to its original design intent. The commenter concludes that, since all U.S. operators have accomplished the actions described in McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Service Bulletin 53&hyph;31, there is no need for an AD. Further, the commenter believes that issuance of the AD would contradict the principles of Presidential Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), and would cause an unjustifiable expense to operators. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to withdraw the proposed rule. As explained in the preamble to the proposal, the FAA has determined that accomplishment of the modification or replacement described in McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Service Bulletin 53&hyph;31 is necessary to correct an unsafe condition described as loss of the passenger cabin floor capability to support the airplane interior inertia loads under emergency landing conditions. Under existing bilateral airworthiness agreements, the FAA is obligated, through the AD process, to advise foreign airworthiness authorities of unsafe conditions relating to products produced in the United States, and to provide instructions determined necessary to correct the unsafe condition addressed. The appropriate vehicle for mandating such action to correct an unsafe condition is the airworthiness directive. However, upon consideration of data submitted by the manufacturer since issuance of the proposal, the FAA has determined that accomplishment of the modification or replacement specified in McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Service Bulletin 53&hyph;31 adequately addresses the unsafe condition, and that the actions described in McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Service Bulletins 53&hyph;32 and 53&hyph;33 are not necessary to address that unsafe condition. The FAA's original concern was that interchanging the floor panels could result in an unsafe condition under emergency landing conditions. However, based on the data received from the manufacturer, the FAA finds that its concern regarding floor panel interchangeability is addressed by part number controls; original panels are not interchangeable with reworked panels or new panels. In light of this, the FAA has removed paragraphs (b) and (c) from the final rule. In addition, references to McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Service Bulletins 53&hyph;32 and 53&hyph;33 have been removed from the applicability of the AD. The FAA also has revised the economic impact paragraph, below, to reflect the fact that all U.S. airplanes have accomplished the requirements of this AD.
