Tu Chu-sheng, director of the ministry's North American Affairs Department, made the call during a public hearing on Taipei- Washington-Beijing ties sponsored by several private groups here. Tu said Taipei-Washington relations should be separated from American relations with Mainland China. "We have never intervened in Washington-Beijing relations," Tu said. "We hope both Beijing and Washington would never promote their bilateral ties at the expense of our national interests." Taiwan also hopes the US Government will pragmatically face the reality that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are now ruled by two different governments which exercise full jurisdiction over their own territories, Tu said. "We hope the US can handle its relations with Taipei and Beijing separately." He further said it has been Taiwan's goal to push the US Government to treat the two sides of the Taiwan Strait equally before China's reunification. US President Bill Clinton announced Thursday he will renew Mainland China's "most-favored-nation" (MFN) trade status and sever the link between trade and human rights. Tu said Clinton's decision marks a turning point in the improvement of Washington-Beijing relations. However, it remains unclear whether the Clinton administration will become more flexible in handling its ties with Taiwan, he noted. Recent public speeches by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher show no signs that the Clinton administration is ready to make any major change in the so-called "one China" policy which the US has upheld since it recognized Beijing in 1979, Tu said. He continued that Taipei-Washington relations have remained steady under the framework of the Taiwan Relations Act, a US law defining American ties with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic relations. However, Tu said, the current unofficial links cannot effectively reflect close substantive relations between the ROC and the US. America is Taiwan's top export market, while the ROC is America's sixth largest trade partner. The ROC Government has attached great importance to its relations with the US, Tu said, adding Taiwan will use its political and economic clout to further strengthen relations with America. Taipei hopes the US will continue to sell it defensive arms and support its bid to join the United Nations and other international organizations, Tu said. "We also hope the US will agree to change the title of our representative office in its territory to one that can better represent Taiwan," he added. Taiwan's representative office is now called the Coordination Council for North American Affairs.
