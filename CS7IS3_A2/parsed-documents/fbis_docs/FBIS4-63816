Interfax learned that this statement had been included in his draft statement at the NATO Council of Defense Ministers in Brussels on Tuesday. Grachev will speak on the Russian military doctrine before the participants in the council late on May 24. In accordance with the text of the statement, Russia regards no state as its enemy. "Russia has no enemies but it has its vital interests. We are ready to defend them and we are capable of doing this," the statement underlined. Grachev considered the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements between the states and the participation of Russia in joint security structures as priorities in the sphere of security for Russia. Grachev called stability in the regions close to its borders as a prior condition for Russia's military security. "In all that concerns the maintenance of international peace and security Russia sees all states, the policy of which does no damage to its interests, as its partners," the statement emphasized. Grachev stressed that development of cooperation with the CIS states with which it had signed the treaty on joint security also was among Russia's priorities. He added that at the regional level Russia was prepared to enhance cooperation with all CSCE states. Russia does not intend to limit itself to Europe, Grachev pointed out. "In order to ensure security for our vitally important interests we are obliged to take measures for the establishment of a joint security system, including the Asian-Pacific region." Grachev underlined that the Russian armed forces had also faced several untraditional tasks. They will: -- carry out peacekeeping operations in accordance with the decisions by the UN Security Council and other joint security; -- cooperate with the Russian Interior Ministry forces and law enforcement bodies in order to localize conflict zones and to prevent armed clashes. Commenting on the decision of the Russian leadership which had decided not to confirm the obligations assumed by the former USSR which said it would not be the first to use nuclear weapons, Grachev stated that this did not mean that Russia would subscribe to the concept of preventing nuclear strike. Russia wants to eliminate the danger of a nuclear war by halting aggression against Russia and its allies, Grachev stressed. CIS and Eastern Europe defense ministers will also participate in the meeting in Brussels.
