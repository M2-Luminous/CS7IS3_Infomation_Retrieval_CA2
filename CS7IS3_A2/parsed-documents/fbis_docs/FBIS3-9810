Among these "individuals" were the candidate members of the Political Executive Committee (PEC) [of the former Romanian Communist Party, PCR] who were sentenced to jail terms after the December 1989 events. The specification "candidate PEC members" was necessary to dispel the impression that the decree refers to all participants in the famous PEC meeting of 17 December 1989. The high presidential goodwill only touched a part of those who later had to pay for their presence at that meeting. The full PEC members were not pardoned, which has led to their complaining about it to the Council of Europe in a letter published on page 3 of this issue of our daily. The pardoning of part of those sentenced after December 1989 has caused great enthusiasm within the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM], the Greater Romania Party [PRM], the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR], and even the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. Recently, the left has insistently demanded the release of the former PEC members. The satisfaction with which the presidential decree was received resides in the belief that Ion Iliescu has had to give in. Is this belief justified? If we read only part of the decree, the answer is positive. However, if we read the full text, the satisfaction of the PRM, the PSM, the PUNR, and the conservative group within the PDSR is not all that justified, for the simple reason that, along with the former PEC candidate members, eight Hungarian ethnics involved in the murders committed at Zetea and Dealu in December 1989 were also pardoned. The latter were sentenced in 1990 and 1991 for first degree murder, after killing several Romanian militiamen on 22 December 1989. The nationalist-communist forces, represented by the PRM, the PSM, the PUNR, and part of the PDSR, received with great satisfaction the sentences pronounced against the Hungarian ethnics. The Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [UDMR] immediately protested and never ceased to do so since then on. It complained to various European bodies, including the Council of Europe. The PRM, the PSM, the PUNR, and part of the PDSR rose against the UDMR's action. In the press and Parliament, the nationalist-communist leaders termed the UDMR protest as a destabilizing action and asked the institutions of the power, headed by the presidency, not to give in to what they called Hungarian blackmail. The international pressure to pardon the eight Hungarians became increasingly greater with each passing day. It was mainly the Council of Europe that took up the issue of their pardoning. One of the points of the inspection by the two Council of Europe rapporteurs [Friedrich Koenig and Gunnar Jansson], due to start today, is whether Romania released the eight Hungarians. Ion Iliescu was thus confronted with a dilemma. By keeping the eight Council of Europe proteges in jail, he risked to incur great international wrath. By releasing them, he risked the fury of his left-wing allies. He solved this dilemma in the well-known Ion Iliescu style, namely through a politically well-thought maneuver. For the president, the main thing was to comply with the Council of Europe's requirement. However, this should be done in such a way as to not upset the nationalist-communist leaders too much. Therefore, he added the PEC candidate members to the list of the pardoned people. In that way, the president tried to reduce to the maximum the negative impact that the pardoning of the eight Hungarian ethnics was bound to produce among the left. One might say that his former party-state colleagues were pardoned thanks to the eight Hungarians. If it had not been for this complicated problem, it is more than certain that Ion Iliescu would not have even thought of freeing those who remained bosses, while he was demoted to a mere director of a publishing house. One cannot say that the president did not act cleverly. The PSM, the PRM, the PUNR, and part of the PDSR overlooked the pardoning of the eight Hungarian ethnics. Their entire attention concentrated on the release of the former PEC candidate members. It is easy to imagine what a hullabaloo would have been if the pardon had only envisaged the Hungarians. The president would have incurred the wrath of his allies. Consequently, the pardoning of the former PEC candidate members is not a sign of weakness from Ion Iliescu vis-a-vis the left of our political landscape. It should rather be considered as a subtle trap that the president has set for the PRM, the PSM, the PUNR, and part of the PDSR. Therefore, a more careful examination of the situation reveals that these political forces have no reason to be enthusiastic about the recent decree signed by Ion Iliescu.
