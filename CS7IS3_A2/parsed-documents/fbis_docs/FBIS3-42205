Rivoli Was the First Message. Full Details of the Story of the File that Killed al-Ma'ayitah"] [Excerpts] The assassination of the Jordanian diplomat in Beirut, Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, has opened the door wide for speculation. Our sources assert, however, that there is much more to it than meets the eye. Our information indicates that the martyr was not just an ordinary employee who had specific duties at our embassy in Beirut, and that he had worked there for only nine months, indeed a year, as was previously announced. He had performed similar duties at our embassy in Cairo. Observers in the know link the assassination to domestic and foreign developments that have to do with the peace process and Jordan's strained relations with several radical movements, specifically allied with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Interviewed by AL-BILAD, al-Ma'ayitah's relatives told the paper al-Ma'ayitah had a very sharp mind. He was a man who belonged to his homeland and nation, his brother Najib al-Ma'ayitah said. This gives an indication, one of the ministers told us, of the nature of the special national tasks performed by the martyr in the Lebanese arena. This is especially true since al-Ma'ayitah's killers stole a very important file the martyr was carrying with him, and not in his briefcase, immediately after the assassination. Our sources link this file to problems that arose recently between the government and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The sources recall His Majesty King Husayn's remarks a month ago about considering taking official measures regarding diplomatic relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The sources further say that a Jordanian decision was made last Thursday [27 January] according to which the Iranian side was told to reduce its diplomatic mission in Amman, which has 33 people. Our sources say that the security agencies believe most of them are Iranian security officers. Active Iranian sources in Amman told AL-BILAD the Jordanian ambassador in Tehran was the target of several attacks by Iranian groups last month. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry, however, chose not to go public about the attacks, although it addressed official memorandums to its Iranian counterpart in this regard. These sources say that Amman has recently witnessed more activities by extremist groups that previously operated in Syria and Lebanon and visited Iran. The sources assert that the Jordanian security agencies have arrested and interrogated many members of those groups, and that some of them are still detained, following the explosion that occurred at the Cinema Rivoli in downtown Amman. The security organs had received word about a small bomb that went off almost a month ago at the same theater. The explosion was followed by private calls explaining that it was a light-caliber message. Jordanian security services kept a tight lid on the second explosion last Wednesday, before locating the detonator. [passage omitted] Jordanian Foreign Ministry sources say the Ministry has sent a special fact-finding committee to Lebanon to investigate the sinful operation and find out who is behind it. Security reports began to link the assassination attempt to the group of Abu-Nidal, Sabri al-Banna. Lebanese sources told Jordanian security officers that they suspect al-Banna is involved in the operation. Consequently, our information says, the Jordanian security men left immediately for Lebanon. Lebanese security agencies currently regard the Abu-Nidal group as the second suspect in the operation, especially since it is rumored that five leaders of the group are jailed in Jordan. Our government denies the five are in Jordan, despite the fact that it has released some of the movement's cadres after being detained for two months. Our informed sources, however, confirm that the Jordanian agencies have recently received a thank-you note from Abu-Nidal after releasing the movement's sequestered property in Amman, which includes documents, offices, furniture, and other items. The note also demanded that the movement's five leaders be released. The Jordanian Government denies it is holding them. Security sources do not rule out a possible connection between Abu-Nidal and the operation. The sources, however, think most likely there is a joint operation in which the pro-Iran groups drew on Abu-Nidal's experience, since he has a rich record of involvement in liquidating Jordanian diplomats over the past 10 years. Abu-Nidal is trying to break the tight siege imposed by our security agencies on his activities in Jordan, since he has repeatedly tried to create a main theater of operations in Jordan by contacting figures that cooperated with him to use him as a pressure card against the Palestinian leadership when the negotiating process faces any impasse. Expressing his movement's domestic crisis in light of the negotiating process, Abu-Nidal issued a statement on 29 November in which he threatened to take action against the interests of Arab regimes. The statement emphasized Jordan, since it is the second party, after the Palestinians, that is directly concerned with the peace process. The Iranian side, which rejects the negotiating process, has incited its subsidiary Islamic and Palestinian movements, drawing their attention to the serious Jordanian role in this context. This is especially true since Jordan and the PLO have signed an agreement and the fact that the Iranians have lost the Syrian card, which was also lost by the anti-'Arafat Palestinian movements. Those movements are now looking for an objective and geographical alternative to Syria to express their rejection of the negotiations. [passage omitted]
