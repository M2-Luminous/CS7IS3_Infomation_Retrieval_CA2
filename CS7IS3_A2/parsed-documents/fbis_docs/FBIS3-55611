However, according to Zlenko, Russia for Ukraine is a special strategic partner, and therefore the result of bilateral talks "always determines the desire to find ways to settle differences that crop up." Anatoliy Zlenko also stated that he values highly the efficiency of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev while always openly criticizing him for inconsistency. Characterizing his relations with the current Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, Zlenko stated that they are businesslike because the deputies had passed a number of documents elaborated by the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in particular the guidelines of Ukraine's foreign policy. Zlenko expressed the wish that a future parliament of Ukraine would consist of professionals, honest people who would not so often revile Ukraine, a country which they intend to serve. The foreign minister listed among Ukraine's accomplishments last year the establishment of the first stage of foreign policy, the creation of the basis for expanding relations between states, the establishment of an embassy and consulate infrastructure abroad, and the acquiring by his agency of new premises and new diplomatic cadres. Anatoliy Zlenko pointed out as the main event of last year the fact that the Ukrainian people "showed patience, wisdom, and good sense, and we have come to the New Year in peace and accord."
