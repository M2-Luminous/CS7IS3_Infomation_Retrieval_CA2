FBIS4-8624 "dreeu073_d_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-073 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 SLOVAKIA Minister Cited on Privatization Timetable Minister Cited on Privatization Timetable AU1404134094 Bratislava SME in Slovak 8 Apr 94 pp 1, 2 AU1404134094 Bratislava SME Slovak BFN ["asa"-signed report: "Coupon Book Should Cost No More Than 1,000 Korunas"] [Text] Bratislava -- A group of experts appointed by the state secretary at the Ministry for the Administration and Privatization of National Property [MSPNM] is working on a document on the preparation of coupon privatization, which it will submit to the government, probably on 19 April. The document will contain the timetable of coupon privatization and of concomitant steps. This was stated by Privatization Minister Milan Janicina at a news conference yesterday. According to the minister, all efforts are aimed at having the registration for coupon privatization start by the end of August. G. Porvaznik, head of an MSPNM department, said that large enterprises, in particular, are to be included in coupon privatization, with the majority stake in these companies to be privatized by this method. Altogether, the MSPNM is preparing some 200 businesses with shares worth about 80 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] for privatization by the coupon method. Added to them will be some Sk20 billion worth of shares in companies that have been founded by the National Property Fund. The problem of privatizing -- including in coupon privatization -- some companies, in which the strategic participation by the state is foreseen, has not yet been resolved. This concerns, in particular, power and gas generating and distribution companies, arms factories, and chemical plants. An agreement with the founder will determine to which extent these companies will be privatized. Similarly, the inclusion of Slovak spas and of Benzinol [chain of gas stations] in coupon privatization will also depend on an agreement with the founding ministries. As for the price of the coupon book, it should not cost more than Sk1,000, according to Milan Janicina, and a lower price is even being considered. Milan Janicina agrees that although coupon privatization is the socially most equitable privatization method, it does not bring any capital. He added, however, that, besides coupon privatization, the use of standard privatization methods will continue; these can secure the inflow of capital. The minister's adviser Igor Uhrik said in this context that the greatest advantage of coupon privatization is that it eliminates the blocking of credit resources. Besides, coupon privatization helps establish the capital market, he added. Minister Milan Janicina provided information on activities by Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak National Party [SNS] deputies to the National Council of the Slovak Republic and other state administration officials in lobbying for specific privatization projects. According to his words, this activity was "reminiscent of methods used under real socialism when you needed the support of some party organization, at the local or district level, for some project to come through." He said that it was interesting that, in all cases, the deputies were lobbying for the project that turned out to be the "victorious" one. Asked about the further course of action in reexamining projects approved by Vladimir Meciar's government, Minister Janicina said that the situation is complicated by the fact that people are afraid of speaking or testifying in individual cases. He said that, in the case of the privatization of the Piestany spa, he had the opportunity to see an agreement on the quiet partnership of two government representatives and one deputy. The minister supposedly avails himself of indications that, in three privatization cases, the HZDS election campaign was to be financed from the approved projects. Evidence for this assertion is lacking, however.
