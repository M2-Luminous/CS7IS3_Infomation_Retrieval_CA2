Meciar did not give any details about the planned protective measures, saying only that he would discuss the matter with economics ministers on Saturday [5 February]. Meciar said that the Czech Government had lowered the value-added tax (VAT) on some goods in order to erase the difference between the values of the Czech and Slovak crowns, which was hurting Czech exports. On another topic, Meciar said that the holding of Slovak gold by the Czech Republic was a violation of international agreements. Slovakia is taking the necessary steps to protect its interests, he said. He also expressed the suspicion that the Czech Republic intends to return the ten tonnes of gold in the form of gold bars, and not, for instance, objects of art with a higher value. "Bars have one value and gold statuary has another," he stated. At the meeting, Meciar also said that the HZDS would submit to parliament a bill on taking away mandates from deputies who leave the party they were elected to represent while still serving their term. If parliament does not pass the bill, he said, the HZDS is determined to put it to referendum.
