Instead, the U.S. Administration has done its best to prevent the issuance of any deterrent international resolution which would end the crimes committed by Jews. While several Security Council members, including Britain, France, and Russia, believe in the need to pass a resolution that provides protection for the Palestinian people under Israeli occupation, for dispatching an international protection force to the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and for disarming the Jewish settlers, the U.S. Administration is trying to foil this approach and prevent the issuance of any resolution in this regard. Moreover, the U.S. Administration is working to contain the strained Arab-Israeli negotiations and deflate angry Palestinian, Arab, and international reactions by inviting a Palestinian delegation to Washington and trying to convince it of the need to unconditionally resume negotiations with Israel and to stop demanding the issuance of an international resolution against Israel. Negotiations between the U.S. Administration and the Palestinian side are still continuing without results. What draws attention is the fact that this U.S. role, which encourages Israel and its terrorist policy, has also encouraged Israeli authorities to continue their hideous crimes against Arab citizens. Several martyrs and a many wounded fall every day. Israeli authorities deliberately prevent Muslims from performing prayers at the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque and other places of worship, which paralyzes and obstructs the peace process. If the U.S. Administration insists on encouraging Israel to adhere to the arming of settlers and rejecting the dispatch of an international protection force to the occupied Palestinian territories, then it will have contributed to the obstruction of the peace process. It makes no sense to resume the Palestinian-Israeli and Arab-Israeli negotiations while the campaign of mass killings is escalating against the Palestinian people. It can be said that if the U.S. Administration actually wants to resume the peace process and achieve peace, it should stop encouraging Israel and end its full bias toward Israel. This administration should also participate in passing an international resolution to ensure protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories.
