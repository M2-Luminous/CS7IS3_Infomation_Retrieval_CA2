Azerbaijan General Prosecutor Ali Omarov has issued a sensational statement: "An attempt to execute an armed coup d'etat planned to take place in the republic on 5 March has been thwarted by investigative organs." According to him, the weapons and munitions seized in the PFA headquarters and in the apartments of certain rayon branch leaders had been assembled for the coup. The PFA described the Prosecutor's Office actions as a provocation. A statement issued by the PFA asserts that "the PFA has nothing to do with the weapons found." The version of events advanced in the document is that the arms cache was planted in the building by the police. Both the statement about an imminent coup and the PFA's attempt to dissociate itself from the arsenal in its own building are regarded with suspicion in Baku. The opposition has used this episode to attack the government. The PFA, the Musavat party, and the Azerbaijan Democratic and Independent Democratic Parties have adopted a joint statement in which they accuse the republic authorities of repressing opposition forces. In their opinion, the authorities are doing this to shift the blame for the relentless deterioration in the economic and military situation onto their opponents' shoulders. The PFA has been in existence six years. It has headed the democratic movement in the republic. It held power in Azerbaijan from June 1992 through July 1993. However, this period was marked by a host of mistakes in both foreign policy and the economy, caused the Front to disintegrate into various political parties, and hastened the resignation of ex-President Abulfaz Elchibey's team. When the PFA was in office it had more than 80,000 members; today its ranks have thinned considerably. But even bearing in mind the PFA's sapped authority, it is premature to write it off. Having adopted its principle of organizational building from the Communist Party, the PFA has a ramified network of organizations in all rayons and population centers of the republic. The unchanged chairman of the Front is ex-President Elchibey, who prefers to call it a movement. After his forced resignation he withdrew to his home village of Keleki, in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, and he continues to "lead the Front's activity" from there. The PFA was and remains a fervent opponent of Azerbaijan's joining the CIS, seeing the Commonwealth as harboring the threat of restoration. For that reason and also because it disagrees with President Geydar Aliyev's course, the Front, in coalition with certain political parties, stands implacably opposed to the current authorities. As far as weapons are concerned the Front, particularly in the last two years, has had an abundance of them, and it is unlikely they have all been voluntarily handed over to the law-enforcement agencies. However, this fact can scarcely serve to justify accusing the Front of preparing an armed coup.
