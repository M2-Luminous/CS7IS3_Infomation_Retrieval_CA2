He thus denied a report published today in a Buenos Aires daily which states that "Argentine citizens, who formally belonged to the People's Revolutionary Army, are in prominent EZLN posts." This information, the newspaper article states, "allegedly became available last week in Buenos Aires though secret reports prepared by the Mexican Government." According to the article, President Carlos Menem allegedly personally referred to the issue when he denounced the existence of "subversive mercenaries" in the revolt in the State of Chiapas. In statements to a radio station, Petrella said: "We have no information" about Argentine guerrillas in Chiapas. The deputy foreign minister said: "Our embassy keeps us permanently informed about these things," adding that the Mexican problem cannot be "extrapolated" to Argentina. He added that he knows nothing about a possible meeting at a continental level to discuss the Mexican problem. The OAS has not made any "collective suggestion" on the subject, he said .
