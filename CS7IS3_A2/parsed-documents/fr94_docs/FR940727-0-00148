FR940727-0-00148 FR940727-0-00028 The commenter also indicated the desire to establish an entitlement program for the Indians. This proposal has been considered but cannot be adopted without amendments to existing legislation. For these reasons there are no changes proposed in this section of the interim rule. Section 953.6␣Technical Assistance Comment: Four commenters requested that HUD give the field offices latitude in providing more technical assistance on responding to the NOFA and the submission requirements than presently permitted. Several felt that the tribes/villages are penalized for not having the sophistication needed to prepare successful applications. One commenter felt that the lack of technical assistance resulted in some tribes/villages not submitting applications for activities they felt were most appropriate to address their needs because of the uncertainty of their eligibility or rating. The majority of the commenters felt that expanded technical assistance was necessary for the tribes/villages to successfully compete in the program. Response: The technical assistance provisions of the Reform Act limit the direct assistance that may be provided by the Department. New regulations providing in-depth guidance have been issued by the Department and are expected to more clearly define the technical assistance role of the Field staff. Technical Assistance during the application process will be provided to the greatest extent allowed by the Reform Act. Section 953.100␣Grant Ceilings Comment: One commenter felt that the method of setting grant ceilings was not equitable because the established limits in their area would permit a tribe one fourth their size to apply for the same amount of grant funds as they could. The commenter proposed a revision to the method currently utilized by the field office that would increase the grant amounts they could apply for each funding cycle. Response: Paragraph (b)(1) of this section gives the Assistant Secretary final authority to determine grant ceilings for each field office. Field offices recommend the ceilings for their jurisdiction. The reason for this process is to ensure that grant ceilings are appropriate on a national level. The Department has determined that the present procedure for establishing grant ceilings is the most appropriate method of establishing these limits and proposes no changes to this section. Section 953.101␣Regional Allocation of Funds Comment: Paragraph (c) of this section states that population data will be used to allocate funds. Commenters asked which data sources HUD would use to count native populations. Response: HUD will use Census data. HUD recognizes that Census data on Indian and Alaskan native populations may be incomplete or inaccurate. However, these are the only data that are consistently available, and they are reasonably representative when aggregated by region. HUD encourages tribes and villages to use their own survey or other locally collected data in their project applications, after consulting with the ONAP on appropriate data collection methods, if they believe these to be more reliable. Section 953.102␣Recaptures Comment: One commenter suggested that in cases where recaptured funds became available and are offered to a standby applicant to fund a previously rated and ranked activity, the applicant should be funded on the new cost estimate and not the amount applied for initially. Response: In all cases where recaptured funds are reallocated to fund a standby application, the Department must insure the criteria contained in the governing NOFA are met. If the amounts available are not sufficient to fund the application as proposed, the next highest ranked application would be considered for funding. Section 953.300␣Application Requirements Comment: A comment was received that recommended that an applicant be allowed to submit its application with an unlimited number of projects but restrict the number approved to the grant limits established in the NOFA. Response: This recommendation was considered but not included in the revisions to the interim rule. The current application process is intended to promote a competition where all applicants have an equal chance for funding and not one that depends upon an applicant's ability to produce large numbers of projects that could be included in their application. The present application process leaves the decisions on the type of project to be submitted with the applicant and does not pass it on to HUD. Comment: One commenter also expressed a concern about what they perceived as a short amount of time to submit applications after publication of the NOFA. Response: The regulation gives applicants at least 30 days to submit their applications to the field office. This minimum level was established so that it is clear that under any circumstance an applicant would have at least this amount of time to prepare an application. The NOFA will establish the time in which the applicants have to prepare and submit their applications. The application submission deadline will continue to be established by Headquarters, since the NOFA is issued on a national basis. In an effort to streamline this regulation, portions of §953.300, Application requirements, will be moved to the NOFA. Since this information is directly related to the competitive process set out in the NOFA, it is felt that it will be more accessible to potential applicants in this location. Section 953.301␣Screening and Review of Applications Comment: One comment was received indicating that the 14-day cure period was inadequate and should be increased to 20 days from date of receipt of the field office request. Response: This process allows applicants to submit only that information requested by the field office to help clarify the application. HUD's regulations at 24 CFR 4.105(b)(3) allow authorized employees, during the selection process, to contact applicants to seek clarification of the terms of an applicant's submission. HUD policy requires each NOFA to include a cure period for technical deficiencies of at least 14 calendar days. Any deficiency that can be cured (e.g., the submission of a missing certification) cannot affect the rating of the application in either a positive or negative way and should by its nature be readily correctable within the present 14 day period. Portions of §953.301, Screening and review of applications, have been moved from this Interim Rule and will be placed in the NOFA. This change will provide for more flexibility in meeting the needs of the program as it continues to evolve and makes the requirements readily available to the applicant.
