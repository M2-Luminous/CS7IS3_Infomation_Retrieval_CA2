Even though parts are scarce, the truth is that the goal has been partially achieved. Already rolling down the Havana streets are 32 of the first order for 60 buses called train-buses, due to their high passenger capacity, with hitches to adapt platforms or semi-trailers with the appropriate body. Each vehicle requires about 3,000 parts, in addition to 1.5 tons of metal, and some materials obtained by convertible foreign exchange. But the main manufacturing work is the responsibility of a group of workers at an enterprise located on the outskirts of Havana. The train-buses, which have a capacity of 350 passengers, attract the attention of the Havana residents, who are tired of the severe scarcity of buses over the past four years, resulting from the termination of the parts supply contracts with Hungary. With parts sent from Hungary, Cuban workers assembled up to 800 vehicles a year, but following the collapse of the socialist bloc, the agreements ended abruptly. As a result of the known external factors, Cuba's purchasing power dropped from $8 billion in 1989 to $1.7 billion in 1993, an amount that is insufficient to purchase very expensive buses in the Western market. Although it is not the most maneuverable vehicle for urban transportation, the train-bus has been called on to play the role of a surface metro to alleviate the heavy demand by the people of Havana, although it will not be able to eliminate the current severe shortage of buses. We cannot forget that the service is also affected by spare parts shortages and fuel limitations. The authorities therefore call on Cubans to continue to use bicycles and animals in the country's interior. In the middle of the acute Cuban urban transportation limitations, the 200 train-buses that are to begin service in Havana, plus an equal number of donated buses, constitute a modest, albeit insufficient, injection into the service. But this does not mean that the efforts to build these types of vehicles in Cuba are any less valuable.
