Gaydar replies: "I spoke about this to the prime minister. I spoke about this to the president. The decision has been made on this. So, it is final. Unfortunately, I am forced to decline the offer put to me to join the reorganized Russian Government. "The essence of the reasons that led me to make that decision is very simple: When they begin to adopt on a broad scale decisions on most fundamental issues that I disagree with, it is difficult for me to continue to do any useful work. "For instance, I was categorically against the decision to build the new parliamentary center. That is no small question. As far as the budgetary applications -- which I know were presented to the Finance Ministry -- are concerned, we are talking about sums roughly equal to four times the amount spent on financing culture and art. I do not agree with this decision. I am against it categorically. Moreover, I do not understand how, in adopting such a decision, one can at the same time justify taking a tough economic line, for instance, on allocations for ecological needs. For instance, the sums that we need for resolving a most acute problem -- the dumping of liquid radioactive waste into the world ocean -- is 10 times less than those that it is proposed to allocate to these needs. If one has to understand and agree with such a policy or line, I do not understand that, nor do I agree with that. Then, at least, I cannot bear responsibility for it. I cannot implement it. "That also is true of other decisions by the government, including on the question of expanding the ruble zone. I consider this question to be of extreme importance. That gradual consolidation of control over the money in circulation within the framework of the ruble zone was one of the pivots of our policy. Namely progress in resolving this task guaranteed the relative stability of the ruble exchange rate, the convertibility of our national currency. I consider it wrong to introduce once again chaos into money in circulation, without clearly regulating all the most complex technical questions of the operation of a single monetary system, to put at risk the already not very high level of our people's well- being for the sake of current political affairs. These are the reasons why I made my decision."
