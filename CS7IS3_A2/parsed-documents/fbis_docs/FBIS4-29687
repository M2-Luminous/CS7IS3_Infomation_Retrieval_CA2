However, it seems that enforcement of nuclear inspections on facilities not declared by the DPRK, which are the key to dissolving suspicion, and other matters, depend on future vice ministerial talks between the United States and the DPRK. There will be twists and turns before the suspicion is completely dissolved. We believe international society will have no choice but to continue to send strong messages to the DPRK. President Clinton announced he will agree to the holding of U.S.-DPRK vice ministerial talks if North Korea freezes its nuclear arms development program. This is a result of his appraisal of President Kim Il-song's pledges made at a meeting with Former President Carter. Among other things, Kim Il-song promised he will allow International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspectors to remain in North Korea. However, international society needs to watch the development of U.S.-DPRK talks to make sure North Korea's recent attitude is not designed merely to gain some time. We cannot have an optimistic view of the future because it appears to us that North Korea's past actions have been nothing but an abuse of its nuclear cards. Last year, North Korea announced it would secede from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and is still mulling this decision. This time, immediately before the Carter-Kim talks, North Korea announced it would split from the IAEA. This is a North Korean tactic of making its compromises look big by raising hurdles before negotiations and lowering them afterward. We can say the United States and the rest of international society have been fooled by these tactics and forced to make compromises over the past several years. For example, when the suspected nuclear arms development was disclosed, the United States demanded North Korea accept not only IAEA inspections but also mutual inspections by North and South. Now, however, the United States is demanding North Korea accept "inspections by the IAEA at least." Initially, the United States said acceptance of special inspections of facilities which have not been declared is a prerequisite for resuming U.S.-DPRK talks. Now, the United States is calling for resumption of talks by actually withdrawing the prerequisite. International society is giving such considerations in order not to corner North Korea. If it is a member of international society, North Korea has a responsibility to sincerely respond to the call. We pointed out before that international society needs to take practical actions to settle the North Korean issue. We also said that, if circumstances require it would be unavoidable for international society to be prepared for the possibility of imposing sanctions, while aiming to settle the issue through dialogue. The United States already announced a draft proposal for sanctions which will be studied at the UNSC [United Nations Security Council]. The draft proposal calls for introduction of a 30-day grace period before sanctions and imposing them in two stages. It shows the United States' hope of avoiding an attempt to incite North Korea. President Kim Il-song's true intentions are still not clear. But, we would like to believe that what he told Mr. Carter -- if it was North Korea's willingness to settle the issue in a positive manner -- is the result of efforts by international society. We cannot coexist with a Korea peninsula armed with nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons on the peninsula will jeopardize stability in Northeast Asia and could create a dangerous situation in which Japan may start talking about owning nuclear weapons. We cannot allow North Korea to gain time. We strongly hope that North Korea will promise international society to freeze its nuclear arms development project without delay, and it will accept inspections of its nuclear facilities, including those which have not been declared.
