He said the municipality should make new progress in five fields of scientific and technological work. We must make great progress in industries using new and high technology, focusing on bioengineering and new pharmaceutical industries. We will strive to establish 200 new enterprises using new and high technology, increasing the output value of industries using such technology to more than 20 billion yuan this year, approximately 6 billion yuan more than last year's planned target. We must increase the number of private scientific and technological enterprises from more than 6,000 currently to more than 7,000. We must vigorously lead qualified enterprises to broaden their scale, raise their technological levels, industrialize new and high technology, form conglomerates, and internationalize new and high technology. We must achieve significant breakthroughs in technological exchanges and establish markets for specialized technologies, such as computer science, bioengineering, and new pharmaceuticals. In 1994, we will strive to achieve more than 2.2 billion yuan in trade volume in technological markets. We must make rapid progress in raising key basic research projects to world levels. Last year, more than 40 basic research projects reached advanced international levels. This year we will strive to make new progress on the basis of last year's achievements. We must bring about significant changes in reforming the scientific and technological structure and grant independent foreign trading rights to research institutions which have sound foundations and conditions. We should set up, on a trial basis, a group of research and development institutions jointly funded by Chinese and foreigners, and combine basic research with technological development. This year, Shanghai will create even better conditions under which scientists and technicians, the middle-aged and young ones in particular, will conduct scientific research. It will provide assistants for some 200 leading figures in various scientific fields; abundant scientific research funds for approximately 3,000 researchers of the basic sciences; and special allowances for around 150 key members in scientific and technological fields, who will receive an average annual allowance of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per person.
