Roy, special correspondent of the NATIONAL HERALD] [Text] The prime minister Mr. Narasimha Rao's week-long visit to the United States has turned out to be an unqualified diplomatic success and its impact on the economic front has been quite encouraging with no compromises made on India's consistent stand on (?contentious) issues like nuclear nonproliferation and human rights. The main objective of the visit was not to break new ground with regard to differences between the two countries on some issues, but to establish a relationship between Mr. Rao and President Bill Clinton, and that has been achieved in full measure. The two leaders after their summit meeting have struck a personal rapport and it would be now easier and more natural for them working together. As senior officials from both sides said in Washington, they listened to each other to understand the differences in perspective. They established a basis to communicate on a number of issues which are now ongoing agenda. This one-to-one bond has alleviated the Indo-U.S. relations to an appropriate level of maturity which can withstand differences of perception of national interests. A good measure of such maturity was in evidence when president Bill Clinton, responding to a query at the joint press conference, candidly said I would not say differences between ourselves narrowed down, but I think they should be seen in the context of whole relationship. Equally mature is the attitude of the Prime Minister Mr. Rao toward bilateral relations. He told newsmen in Washington, as mature democracies we might differ on this or that issue, but such differences are subsumed in the overall understanding that characterizes our relationship. Calling for new partnership in the joint communique of the summit, the two leaders decided to expand the scope and pace of high-level exchanges at the full range of political, commercial, technological, and social issues. Mr. Rao has started this by inviting President Clinton himself, which Mr. Clinton has accepted in principle. Visits at the level of vice presidents have also been planned. The first lady Mrs. Hillary Clinton is also likely to visit India. President Clinton himself has announced that the Commerce Secretary, Mr. Ronald Brown, will lead a presidential trade and investment mission to India in November and the Energy Secretary, Mrs. O'Leary, will visit in July this year. A significant gain from the summit meeting is the signing of six Memorandums of Understanding [MOU] between the two countries. The first decision is to revive the Indo-U.S. Joint Commission set up in 1974. To begin with, its subcommission on economic and commercial issues would meet before the end of the year. Secondly, it was decided to establish regular official consultations at various levels alternatively in India and the U.S. This is the pattern followed by India with Germany, Japan, Britain, France, and some others. The third and most significant of the decisions was to review and update the 1984 MOU on the transfer of high technology from the U.S. Since 1987, when the U.S. started imposing sanctions against the Indian Space Research Organization, the MOU has been virtually defunct. Fourth, it was agreed to enhance defense cooperation at the civilian and service-to-service level. The U.S. defense secretary, Mr. William Perry, and the new U.S. commander-in-chief of the Pacific region would visit India some time this year. Fifth, it was decided to examine the possibility of setting up an eminent persons group of nonofficials to provide intellectual stimulus to bilateral ties. Lastly, a business partnership initiative would be set up, particularly on the subject of infrastructure development in India. The high point of Mr. Rao's visit was his brilliant address to the joint session of the U.S. Congress wherein he displayed exemplary reasoning and fortitude in establishing the Indian viewpoint. In pursuing economic agenda during his visit, Mr. Rao had succeeded far beyond anything that had been anticipated. The captains of the U.S. multinationals during their interactions with Mr. Rao in New York, Houston, and Washington showed positive interest in specific areas. Above all, the two countries agreed on the goal of nuclear nonproliferation which has been hanging fire for quite some time now. Thus, now India and the U.S. have reached a stage where they could enter into constructive dialogue.
