FR940407-0-00086 FR940407-0-00014 The final rules retain the proposed allowance for long-term emissions averaging, as well as requirements that States make statistical showings that any such emissions averaging is consistent with applicable RACT, RFP, and short-term NAAQS. These statistical showings are necessary to show equivalency to, or noninterference with, each of these statutory requirements, although as a practical matter the same showing may suffice to assure consistency with more than one of the requirements. The statistical showings should take into account the extent to which emissions variations from an individual source or from all sources are random or systematic and, thus, the extent to which the variations can be considered to be independent. The showings must demonstrate that the pattern of emissions resulting from relaxed averaging periods would approximate the pattern of emissions that would occur without relaxed averaging periods to an extent sufficient to reasonably conclude that the relaxed averaging periods would not interfere with the statutory requirements. The final rules do not include any presumptive RACT discount factor, on the basis that no one factor can adequately account for the variations that may occur across different programs. However, the EPA remains open-minded to discount factors, especially for specific industries, that are substantiated by State analyses. The EPA will work with States that want to develop EIP's that incorporate long-term averaging requirements to ensure that such a program does not interfere with RFP and the attainment of short-term standards. The EPA anticipates that more general guidance will be developed in the course of working with States on statistical approaches for such equivalency demonstrations. In the case of EIP's implementing RACT requirements, the guidance referenced above in paragraph IV.B.1. addresses long-term averaging for NO X RACT.
