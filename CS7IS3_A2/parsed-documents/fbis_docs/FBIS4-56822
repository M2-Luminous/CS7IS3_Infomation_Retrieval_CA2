FBIS4-56822 "drlat090_i_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-090 Daily Report 1 May 1994 Nicaragua FSLN Deputy Cited on Party Congresses, Future FSLN Deputy Cited on Party Congresses, Future PA0705225694 Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO in Spanish 1 May 94 pp 1, 8 PA0705225694 Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO Spanish BFN [Report by Edgardo Barbena S.] [Text] Five percent of FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] militants nationwide have participated in prior "ad hoc" congressses or assemblies to discuss the documents of May's congress, thus reflecting the disenchantment of the card-carrying members, according to FSLN Deputy Sergio Ramirez. Speaking on the Radio Sandino talk show "Face to Face" ["Frente a Frente"], Ramirez discussed the hot topics of the Sandinist debate and cited specific examples of what happened during the last FSLN Congress. Approximately 3,000 FSLN members participated in the discussion of the documents at the 1991 Congress in Masaya, but at the most recent congress the number of participants did not even reach 400, a situation that was similar nationwide, "meaning the militants do not feel attracted to the party positions." "As long as those positions are not made accessible, all the people, mostly the young, and not just its militants will move away from Sandinism," the FSLN bloc chief told the radio station. He also cited the scarce participation of young people in party meetings. More than 300,000 young people will vote in the 1996 elections, so Ramirez used Radio Sandino's microphones to send a message of hope and dreams to adolescents who were born not knowing of the Somoza period and who will vote for the first time that year. Sergio supported consolidating the unity of the FSLN and said the existence of currents within the FSLN "are mere indications of trends of thought, AND WHENEVER SOMEONE TALKS OF DIVISION AMONG THE CURRENTS, THIS IS A TIMID ATTEMPT TO HIDE THE SUN WITH ONE'S FINGER." [upper case as published] The currents are not going to cause nor are they causing any division. "Division is caused by the unfit leadership of a party that has to win the elections," the Sandinist bloc chief said in fielding questions by station listeners, including by those who said they were "anti-Sandinists to the death." During his appearance, Sergio Ramirez made an extensive analysis of what the concept of "vanguard" (call it National Directorate) was during the past decades, chiefly during the Somozist dictatorship, when the militants were totally hemmed in. "But now we do not have an armed party but, rather, a political party that needs to open up to society to win over the support of the thousands of people who will have to vote." It is contradictory, therefore, that a party that wants to win should be closed, given that in order to win it has to do so in terms of the number of votes, not the quality of the votes, Ramirez said, explaining this entails an opening in the FSLN and the end of categories, "because nobody likes to be discriminated against, to be second- or third-rate militants, or to see some on the first or second floor while others are out on the street." The view that the FSLN should continue to be ruled by a historic National Directorate that used military means to fight the dictatorship is inappropriate, "and that is why we need to create a new party based on massive affiliation that needs to have a national council of directors and not a historic National Directorate, because that structure corresponds to a phase superseded within the FSLN." "Face to Face" host Orlando Gomez mentioned that 10 hours earlier Rene Vivas had said in the same radio station during the program "Eco News" that the proposal of a Sandinism ruled by the majority "is a trend that tends to make the FSLN shift to the right." Commenting on Vivas' remarks, Ramirez said "I do not believe this is an ideological problem but, rather, a political problem," and if one is proposing democracy within a party and the proposal is regarded as a shift to the right, it seems to me this creates unnecessary confusion." Talking about those who use insult and slander as weapons to disqualify others within the Sandinist debate, Ramirez said that was a mistake, because whenever there are insults, slanders, and disqualifications," that means someone ran out of arguments, and that is serious in a political discussion." "I believe the party members are interested in hearing a discussion of ideas, although they may be contradictory, because we can reach through ideas new elements "that give us new unity within the party." "If I get called a rightist for expressing an idea, then the person on the other side already lost the discussion," Ramirez said, citing something Unan [National Autonomous University of Nicaragua] President Mariano Fiallos had said some years ago about two people who were holding a discussion. When one of them lost the argument, he said: "The truth is I will not continue to argue with you, because you are really ugly, and that is how the discussion ended." The easy thing to do to downplay the political debate pertaining to the FSLN's future "is to simplify it by saying it is a struggle among individuals, and a struggle among individuals is not valid when dealing with matters as important as the ones we are experiencing within the FSLN." This is a matter of positions "such as mine in favor of the overall renewal of the FSLN so that it will become a viable party in the face of society, attract voters, and cease to be a minority party, which is what it is following the 1990 elections, so it can allow us to gather the different social groups of the many people who did not vote for the FSLN in 1990. [no closing quotation mark as published] Sergio said the FSLN must proselytize, and "we must not be afraid of the world electoral proselytism, because we cannot return to a government through any means other than an election. To win the elections we need votes, and we will not win votes if we continue to isolate ourselves from society." Topics such as relations were broached during the program. Ramirez said "this offends some within the FSLN ranks who claim to be anti-imperialists and yet have 10-year visas to enter the United States, whereas "some of us have trouble getting a visa for just one occasion." Those irked by this topic, including people who have been born in, lived, and studied in the United States, "are the ones who do not accept the humble anti-imperialism that some of us Sandinists have shown during our work for national sovereignty." The FSLN deputy affirmed he is neither morbidly anti-imperialist nor a royalist [principista]. In conclusion, the Sandinist leader called on the members of his party to gain stature in the debates and not fall for provocations. To those who side with any line of thought, he said "the only advice I can give you is not to stop thinking. Never imagine others can think for you; do not mull over what others have mulled over before." "What a person must not do is allow someone else to tell him what he should think. Do not allow someone to play cassettes in your head, because human beings are not tape players," Ramirez said.
