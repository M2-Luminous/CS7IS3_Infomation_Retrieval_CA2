The crew devoted much time over the past few days to geophysical explorations fulfilled with the use of photographic equipment and videospectromic instrumentation installed on the Kvant-2 module. They made snapshots of the areas of Chernobyl and the Aral sea, agricultural lands in the Krasnodar territory and the Kalmyk Republic as well as industrial areas in Kazakhstan. Under the programme of experiments on extra-atmospheric astronomy, the cosmonauts carried out several sessions of observations and registation of galactic and extra-galactic sources of roentgen radiation. They also continued to measure spectres of space radiation in various ranges of wave lengths. The aim of the explorations is to get scientific information on interaction between physical processes in the universe and near-Earth space. An adjustment of the station's orbit was made on May 16 with the propulsion unit of the Progress M-2 spacecraft. The flight plan for Tuesday provides for astrophysical, medical and technical experiments, re-equipment of the station and modules with new instrumentation brought to the station by a ferry. The cosmonauts feel well. Work aboard the station proceeds normally.
