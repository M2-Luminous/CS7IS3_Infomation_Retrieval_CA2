FBIS4-21725 "jptot014__l94025" JPRS-TOT-94-014-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 30 March 1994 LATIN AMERICA MEXICO Armed Man Arrested During Zedillo's Nomination Armed Man Arrested During Zedillo's Nomination PA3003154294 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 1410 GMT 30 Mar 94 PA3003154294 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network Spanish BFN [Report by Radio ACIR Program Director Guillermo Ochoa; from the ``Panorama'' Newscast] [Text] A man armed with a .38 caliber gun was arrested yesterday during the event to nominate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon as the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate. Members of the presidential general staff arrested the man just a few steps from the multiple purpose room where the appointment was announced. The man's name is Miguel Angel Bernal Vargas and he was taken to the Attorney General's Office 7th Agency located at the Cuahtemoc Station. Bernal Vargas said he is a member of the General Secretariat of Safety and Roads, and that his mission was to an act as an ear in the event. He was disguised, sorry to say, wearing a jacket with many pockets, like the ones used by photographers and hunters. These jackets are useful as they can hold films and other supplies in all the pockets. That is the way this individual was disguised. Inasmuch as persons entering the hall were being searched, it was discovered this man was carrying a .38 caliber gun in a small bag. He was arrested and turned over to the 7th Police Station [as heard]. Mr. Lievano Sanchez, PRI secretary of information and propaganda, confirmed the arrest of this man, who claimed he was acting as an ear. This is a regrettable practice of some government offices and persons, and even of the Federal Army. They send individuals disguised as photographers to certain events so that they can prepare a detailed report on not only what was said -- for example in a news conference -- but also of the reactions, attitudes, and so forth. They prepare very special reports for certain persons or certain offices. They simply carry a recorder or a photographer's jacket and are sent to these events. Sometimes, they carry a recorder and pose as radio reporters, other times, they carry a camera and pose as photographers. They mingle with the rest of the reporters, and then go and present their private reports. Unfortunately, this is a method frequently used by government offices. In this case, who knows who sent this ear, but he must not be very intelligent because the ear was carrying a gun to cover an event of this type. This is unbelievable, truly unbelievable.
