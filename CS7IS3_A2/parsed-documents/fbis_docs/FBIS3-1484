Lewis] [Text] Pretoria March 28 SAPA -- The National Party [NP] has condemned the carnage and mayhem in central Johannesburg on Monday, saying such chaos made an all-inclusive political solution less attainable. "We deplore the fact that a whole city could be held hostage by political organisations who cannot solve their disputes peacefully and responsibly," said NP director of information Mr Marthinus van Schalkwyk. He added, however, there were too many differing viewpoints to form a definite picture of who started the carnage.
