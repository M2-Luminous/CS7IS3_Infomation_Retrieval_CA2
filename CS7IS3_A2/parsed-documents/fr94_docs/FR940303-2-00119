FR940303-2-00119 FR940303-2-00068 Frank N. Beckles, M.D.; Revocation of Registration On October 29, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator (then-Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Frank N. Beckles, M.D., of 923 E Street, SE., Washington, DC 20003. The Order to Show Cause proposed to revoke Dr. Beckles' DEA Certificate of Registration, BB0922674, under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3), and deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration under 21 U.S.C. 823(f) for reason that his continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. The Order to Show Cause was served on Dr. Beckles on November 2, 1993. More than thirty days have passed since the Order to Show Cause was received by Dr. Beckles. The Drug Enforcement Administration has received no response from Dr. Beckles or anyone purporting to represent him. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Acting Administrator finds that Dr. Beckles has waived his opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57, the Acting Administrator enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based on the investigative file. The Acting Administrator finds that on January 9, 1991, the District of Columbia Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, Board of Medicine (Board) issued to Dr. Beckles, a ``Notice of Intent to Revoke License'', and an amendment thereto, was issued on April 16, 1991. The notices alleged charges of professional incompetence, willful and careless disregard of the health, welfare, and safety of a patient, and failure to conform to the prevailing standards of acceptable medical practice. Following a settlement conference on May 1, 1991, Dr. Beckles informed the Board of his intent to surrender his license to practice medicine, and on June 18, 1991, Dr. Beckles consented to surrender his license to practice medicine in the District of Columbia, effective June 30, 1991. As a result of Dr. Beckles' surrender of his medical license, on July 10, 1991, the Board ordered the revocation of Dr. Beckles' license to practice medicine, and ordered Dr. Beckles not to seek reinstatement of his license. The Acting Administrator finds that as of July 10, 1991, Dr. Beckles' license to practice medicine in the District of Columbia has been revoked, and as a result, he is unable to handle controlled substances. The Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register or maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f) and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently upheld. See James H. Nickens, M.D., 57 FR 59847 (1992); Elliott Monroe, M.D., 57 FR 23246 (1992); Bobby Watts, M.D., 53 FR 11919 (1988). Based on the foregoing, it is clear that Dr. Beckles' DEA Certificate of Registration must be revoked. Accordingly, the Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, BB0922674, previously issued to Frank N. Beckles, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked and that any pending applications for renewal of such registration be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective March 3, 1994. Dated: February 25, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Acting Administrator of Drug Enforcement. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4887 Filed 3&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
