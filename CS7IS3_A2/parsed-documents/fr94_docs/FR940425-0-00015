SUMMARY: This order revokes a public land order insofar as it affects a 0.25 acre parcel of National Forest System land withdrawn for the Forest Service's Williams Lake Recreation Area within the Salmon National Forest.

Appropriation of land described in this order under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988), shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local courts. Dated: April 8, 1994. Bob Armstrong, Assistant Secretary of the Interior. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9908 Filed 4&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;GG&hyph;M
