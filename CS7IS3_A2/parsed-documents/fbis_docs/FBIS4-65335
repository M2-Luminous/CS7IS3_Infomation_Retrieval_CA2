In an interview prior to Slovak President Michal Kovac's visit to Austria today, Klestil says that for Central European states Austria can be the "Trojan horse (of integration), because if it joins the EU, the Slovaks, Czechs, Hungarians... will join it as well," Klestil is quoted by the paper as saying. Germany supported full Austrian membership in the final stage not because it would create a sort of German bloc, but because Germany realized that without Austria it was impossible to get other states involved in the integration process into the EU, Klestil says. "It is absolutely clear that we will back our neighbors' efforts at EU membership," he says, pointing out that in the event of a positive result to Austria's referendum (on joining the EU) Slovakia will become a direct neighbor to the EU. On economic cooperation, Klestil says that his country's investments in Slovakia are quite high and that the number of joint ventures is also quite big, which he describes as a positive development. "However, it is also true that sometimes Austrian firms complained about the slow pace of privatization and unresolved property and other issues," Klestil says. Asked by the paper whether Austria could be a mediator in overcoming tension between Slovakia and Hungary, Klestil replies that this can happen only if both sides so request. In his opinion, it is better for Austria to meet the two countries' representatives and discuss issues informally. "And this is what we are doing," Klestil says.
