This cash shortage at the central bank is occurring three months after the monetary reform that was introduced on 22 October by the outgoing government of Faustin Birindwa and that was aimed resolving liquidity problems. The commercial banks have been operating with closed counters and have only been attending to the affairs of business customers, a bank source disclosed to PANA. The same source also confirmed that there is an increase in check-cash exchange operations, with the current exchange rate standing at one zaire for a check of three zaires -- which was the practice before the introduction of the monetary reform. Statistics from the Bank of Zaire reveal that cash issuances amounted to 13,867,437 billion zaires at the end of December 1993, while deposit money [words indistinct] billion zaires during the same period -- $1 equals 100 new zaires [NZ]. All the measures announced to support the monetary reforms have ended up being invalidated, financial sources interviewed by PANA in Kinshasa say. Yet, on 24 October--two days after the reform--Bank of Zaire Governor Buhendwa Bwa Mushaba, who was fired on 1 February, told a news conference that the central bank should no longer give concessionary facilities to the government and that the ceiling for covering government expenditure should not be exceeded. This challenge could not be met by the central bank, where 98 percent of banknotes issued went into state expenditure and only 2 percent were used for investment and economic revival. According to a central bank expert, the financing of the state budget deficit through the banking system amounted to 9,203,867 old zaires for the whole of 1993. For the first week of January 1994, the financing of the budget deficit amounted to NZ471.4 million and all funds disbursed for government economic activities were limited to 644,588 billion old zaires. During the launching of the reform, the central bank authorities had planned to freeze 98 percent of checking deposits within the banking system, which should have made it possible to determine the money supply that is compatible with the real need of the economy. According to the same expert, "this important measure was scuttled in favor of hoarding and financing chance black market activities. Today, while the bank's coffers are empty, huge quantities of banknotes are circulating freely in the hands of informal sector speculators, who apparently do not have any problems." This situation has not enabled the central bank to mobilize foreign exchange resources to support the new national currency and meet external commitments, especially the importation of new currency symbols and the payment of the country's foreign debt service. The foreign exchange earnings registered by the national bank after the reform are very low, a study published in the NOTE CONJONCTURE journal indicates. It reveals that they amounted to $3.6 in October, $2.4 in November, and $4 million in December 1993. However, this institution owes local businesses $20 million, the German currency printing firm Giesecke and Devrient $45 million, and $21.431 million to an import-export company that prints, transports, purchases, and conveys molds and numbering machines to Zaire, bank sources reveal.
