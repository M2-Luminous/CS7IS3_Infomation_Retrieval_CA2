In midsummer the government is "sure to take a series of pro-inflation measures to rescue the country's machine building industry." This was announced by Sergey Pavlenko, head of the Working Center, at a press conference at the Radisson Slavyanskaya Hotel. In addition to the supposed government measures, some other factors too point to increased inflation, Pavlenko said. For example, cash emission went up by a factor of 2.5 or 3 in April. Nevertheless, the three-month financial stabilization yielded indisputably positive results. First and foremost it gave the population an opportunity to adapt to economic change. A normal reaction by citizens can be seen in the growing sums in savings accounts, control of which is confidently switching from the Russian Federation Savings Bank to commercial banks (the Savings Bank share has fallen to 50 percent). The population's trust in the government's financial policy can also be seen, according to Mr. Pavlenko, in the lower proportion of hard currency savings. According to Sergey Vasilyev's [as published] forecast, if the existing draft budget is adopted for implementation the population will continue to have faith in the financial policy of the state and the future inflationary surge will not exceed the 10 percent of GDP ceiling planned for the year's end. Assessing the aftermath of the production crisis in Russia, Mr. Pavlenko pointed out that, despite the psychological shock the government experienced at the absolute figures for the production decline in January, the crisis reflects what is now a definite pattern -- a decrease at the start of the year, some recovery of production in May through June, another decline in the fall, and a rise toward the year's end. Today, according to the Working Center, there is a slight recovery in the fuel and energy complex, in ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, and in some sectors geared to the consumer market. The steady negative indicators in machine building are natural and point to the need for structural reform. The important thing, the Working Center experts think, is for Chernomyrdin's cabinet not to panic. Analyzing the current state of the Russian economy, Professor Richard Layard of the London School of Economics, who is in charge of a group of foreign advisers at the Working Center, pointed out that the main problem with the state budget is insufficient tax revenue. Budget revenue in the first quarter of the current year was 36 percent of the planned level. Assessing the real consumption figures, Mr. Layard said there is insufficient official information. According to the method used by the State Committee for Statistics (real incomes minus real savings), social consumption has grown 11 percent. If you rely on the results of a households study, the figure will be 18 percent in the first quarter of the year. Analyzing the labor market, Mr. Layard stated that Russia has discovered a unique method of regulating unemployment. Open unemployment has not grown more than 1 percent this year. The main levers to regulate it are the great differentiation of wages in various sectors and methods of latent unemployment (enforced vacations and shorter workweeks). In the first quarter shorter workdays affected 2 percent of people in employment, and enforced vacations affected 4.4 percent. As little as 1.5 percent were affected by personnel reductions out of 25 percent of the total number employed in production. During the same period, the number of people hired for jobs amounted to 21 percent of number already in employment. For the time being enterprises are managing to preserve jobs by cutting wages. But this tendency, Mr. Layard thinks, will not last long. Then open unemployment will grow, but it will be lower than in the Eastern European countries, the English professor hopes.
