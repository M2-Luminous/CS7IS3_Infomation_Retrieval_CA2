In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali submitted to him Wednesday [22 June] by Iran's permanent envoy to the U.N. Kamal Kharrazi, Velayati referred to the June 20 terrorist bomb blast at the holy shrine of Imam Reza (as) in Mashhad. He underlined that the failure of the advocates of international campaign against terrorism to curb the activities of the MKO terrorist group has not only encouraged the continuation of such acts of blind terrorism, but also put their own commitment to combat this international menace into serious question. "The massive explosion caused the martyrdom of at least 26 and severe injury of over 170 innocent pilgrims, including many children, elderly and women", the letter said. It further called on the U.N. secretary-general to consider the General Assembly's Resolution 48/122 of 20 December 1993 urging the international community to enhance cooperation in the fight against the threat of terrorism at national, regional and international levels. Moreover, the eleventh ministerial meeting of Non-aligned Movement (NAM) held in Cairo urged that this international campaign should be directed without discrimination or double-standards against "terrorism wherever, by whoever and against whomever it occurs." It is the responsibility of all states to live up to their international commitments in our common endeavor to eradicate terrorism, Velayati said. He added that it was possible to eradicate terrorism through joint endeavor of all states by not only condemning this cowardly act of inhumanity, but also investigating whether their official institutions, their nationals or their territories were used by this terrorist organization for the commission, planning, financing, instigating or supporting this crime and take appropriate and effective measures accordingly.
