FR941017-2-00104 FR941017-2-00061 (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The PHLX does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others No written comments were solicited or received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change constitutes a stated policy, practice or interpretation with respect to the administration of an existing PHLX rule. Specifically, the proposal modifies Advice A&hyph;11 by adding paragraph (b), ``Trade or Fade,'' to make Advice A&hyph;11 consistent with PHLX Rule 1015. In addition, the proposal clarifies PHLX Rule 1015(a) by adding the phrase ``in any options series on the Exchange'' to the rule; the proposal also clarifies Advice A&hyph;11 by adding the heading ``Quotation Guarantees'' to paragraph (a) of Advice A&hyph;11. Accordingly, the proposal has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
