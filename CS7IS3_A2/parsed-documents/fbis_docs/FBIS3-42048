The nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula has been raised since the United States deployed nuclear weapons in South Korea against the DPRK and it has become all the more grave matter with continued nuclear threat to the Korean people from the ground, sea and sky with South Korea as the largest nuclear forward base in the Far East, the paper points out, and continues: The United States is the very one who creates nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula and the DPRK is the victim who is exposed to the nuclear threat for scores of years. The DPRK and the United States are the parties concerned who are mainly responsible and have authority to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. This matter, therefore, can be solved through dialogue and negotiations between the United States, maker of nuclear threat against us, and the DPRK, a victim. At the first round of the talks, both sides discussed and agreed on the matters of principle in the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and made public a joint statement, and at the second round of the talks, the sides discussed practical steps to implement the principles agreed upon in the joint statement. Out the third round of the talks has been long deadlocked by moves of the Western insound forces and their followers. Out of the desire to fundamentally solve on an equal and fair basis the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, the DPRK side put forward a formula of package dealing and has consistently made efforts for an agreement at working-level contacts between both sides. At the 18th DPRK-U.S. contact held on 29 December last year, the sides agreed to discuss in a package deal the issues for a fundamental solution of the nuclear problem. The DPRK-U.S. contacts show that the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula can be solved in a fair and peaceful way when both sides display the spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation. A fair solution to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula favours the interest of the United States itself. The lesson of the DPRK-U.S. contacts since the second round of the talks is that the matter can never be untangled by means of resorting to delaying tactics or putting pressure, placing unreasonable precondition and, moreover, the threat and hostile act infringing upon the dignity and sovereignty of the partner of dialogue will lead the situation to a catastrophe. If the principles already agreed upon between the DPRK and the United States are observed and implemented, the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula would be solved fairly.
