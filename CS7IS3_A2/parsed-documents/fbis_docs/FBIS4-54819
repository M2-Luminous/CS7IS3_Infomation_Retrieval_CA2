But your ministry is rejecting increasing numbers of applications for this form of ownership transformation from employees' joint-partnership companies. Employees resent these refusals, saying: First you let us choose our preferred form of privatization, and now you refuse to approve it. [Kaczmarek] Employees' joint-partnership companies are very good at seeing to work forces' social welfare provisions. On the other hand, there are two areas they find difficult to deal with. The first is the price, usually too low, which the employees' joint companies offer in the bid to buy their enterprises. The second area is these companies' credibility as regards realization of the investment-package deals. I am an advocate of the quickest method of selling small and medium-size enterprises. I believe that, in their case, success is measured in terms of their stable functioning and development. I do not need to aim for getting the highest possible prices for them. However, I should like to adopt a slightly different approach to larger enterprises. [Krzyzaniak] Where does a medium enterprise end and a large one begin? [Kaczmarek] I think privatization by liquidation can be approved for enterprises employing up to 400 persons. In some cases, this number can be larger: We can negotiate in the case of enterprises with up to 500-700 employees. The upper limit is an enterprise whose turnover, in money terms, amounts to a maximum of 12 million ECU's [European Currency Units] and whose statutory fund and enterprise fund amount to a maximum of 8 million ECU's. If a given enterprise fits in this category, we will happily approve privatization by liquidation. If it exceeds them, it should be privatized by capital takeover. Of course, in well-justified cases, we can depart from these limits. [Krzyzaniak] To what extent is your limit on privatization through employees' shareholding schemes imposed by the requirement that the Ownership Transformations Ministry transfer all profits from privatization by capital takeover to the state budget? [Kaczmarek] Such a requirement does exist, and we must remember that the state budget does not profit much from a transaction whereby an enterprise is sold to its employees and its status changed to that of a an employees' joint-partnership company. However, we can still view employees' joint-partnership companies as taxpayers. I am not against employees' companies. I believe we should seek solutions together, in partnership. [Krzyzaniak] The progress of privatization has been halted in certain sectors, especially those connected with agriculture. Debates are in progress on whether privatization should be controlled by the Ownership Transformations Ministry solely, or also by other ministries, such as the Agriculture Ministry and the Industry and Trade Ministry. [Kaczmarek] I am firmly opposed to the transfer of ownership transformation powers to other ministries. They should attend, instead, to the creation of model programs and solutions for individual branches of industry. We have a ready example here in the grain, sugar, and tobacco products manufacturing industries. It is strange, to say the least, that the same ministry that halts the privatization of tobacco products manufacturing enterprises issues licenses to other firms to build new cigarette factories. Of course, we, too, implement model solutions. An example here is the National Investment Funds project. The only people with sufficient expertise on privatization can be found at the Ownership Transformations Ministry and voivodship offices. We often hear complaints about the privatization schemes and, consequently, about my ministry. But the majority of investigation proceedings, prosecution cases, protests, and problems with ownership supervision that accompany the implementation of the privatization scheme are connected with other sectors. [Krzyzaniak] Nevertheless, there has been a noticeable slowing down of the privatization processes. One of the reasons for this is the conflict between individual ministries over their respective ranges of competence. What is the source of this conflict? [Kaczmarek] Without any doubt, work on the Enterprises Pact and the associated promise of the issue of free shares to employees caused considerable delays. Employees preferred to wait until the pact came into force. I declare that I will not touch the 20 percent of shares reserved for employees. Another reason is that the management structure at the voivodship level is currently undergoing a series of changes, and it is in voivodships that two-thirds of all privatization operations take place. [Krzyzaniak] Foreign investors buy shares in our factories when they bring their money to Poland. There is also another group of investors that builds factories from scratch on our territory: these are the so-called greenfield projects. Examples of the latter practice are the chocolate factory near Wroclaw that is being built by Cutberry [as published; Cadbury would have been intended but transcribed incorrectly by interviewer] or the Dutch-Japanese battery-manufacturing plant in Gniezno. These plants are often competitive in relation to already established Polish enterprises. [Kaczmarek] My principal area of responsibility is to encourage foreign investors interested in Polish enterprises to undertake to transform and modernize these enterprises. Today these projects receive priority status in which a strategic investor enters the enterprise. On the other hand, I cannot say I am not interested in the greenfield projects you just mentioned. They provide additional bridging components in our scheme, and they greatly facilitate our cooperation with international financial institutions and foreign investors. If we refuse entry to greenfield projects and welcome only investors interested in bringing their capital to our privatization projects, we will build a trap for ourselves and discourage much Western capital from coming here. Because these are firms that operate on the principle of starting from scratch, we spend tremendous sums of money on getting foreign investors interested in Poland, and this is beginning to bring results. Foreign capital investors have already invested more than $3 billion. The Germans, for example, were quite upset to learn that they are only in fifth place as regards the amount of capital invested. They have been left behind by the Americans, the multinational capital, the Italians, and the Dutch.
