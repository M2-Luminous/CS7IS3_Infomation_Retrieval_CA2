Five people, including Congressman Bill Richardson (Democrat-New Mexico) and the United Nations Development Program resident representative in Rangoon, were allowed to see Aung San Suu Kyi, a reliable source said. She had previously had contact only with immediate family members or security officials at her heavily-guarded lakeside home on the outskirts of Rangoon. The meeting was apparently filmed, as a crew from Burmese state television was seen entering the premises at around 9 a.m. Richardson, who arrived in Rangoon Sunday at the invitation of the ruling military junta, the State Law and Order Coordination Council (SLORC), is a member of the Congressional committee monitoring human rights under the Helsinki agreement.
