When asked about the LDP's strategy for taking power and the possibility of the LDP allying with the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), Mori says: "It is important for the LDP to hold talks with various parties from now on. Although the LDP does not intend to take an arrogant attitude, the fact is, that although the LDP did not win a majority, it did win a large number of votes in the (House of Representatives) election last year. In this sense, it is very important to establish an administration that reflects the people's will." Noting the LDP has been making efforts to reform itself and that the party is responsible for managing politics, Mori says: "We would like to hold talks with various parties to seek their understanding." He adds that the LDP may not start discussion with the coalition immediately because of a 25 June meeting, during which Komeito (Clean Government Party) Secretary General Ichikawa told him that the coalition wanted to cautiously watch the situation for the time being. At 2242 GMT, Kuroiwa asks whether or not the LDP will put forward party president Yohei Kono as a candidate for the next prime minister. Mori replies: "As Mr. Kono is the LDP president, our party intends to field him in the premiership election. However, several cards will be revealed during talks (with other parties). Even if the LDP insists on the LDP card, others may not agree to it. In this case, it cannot be helped." The program then shows a brief recorded comment by LDP member Takeshi Noda, who stresses the need to establish an administration headed by LDP President Kono. Mori says the best thing for the LDP to do is to form an administration headed by the LDP, and adds it is also important for the party to participate in an administration. Asked about the possibility of forming an LDP-SDPJ-Sakigake (Harbinger) coalition and the possibility of Sakigake Representative Masayoshi Takemura running for prime minister, Mori says: "One option is that various parties will reach a consensus on a decision." Reviewing the past LDP structure, Mori says the LDP is now changing itself. Asked whether the next administration will be a full-fledged one or an interim one for dealing with the current situation, Mori says: "We should not seek an interim administration." On the possibility of the lower house's dissolution and a general election, he says Mr. Hata's decision to resign (to avoid a lower house dissolution) was right because a political vacuum would affect the economy. He adds it is necessary to convene an extraordinary Diet session this fall to enact political reform-related bills, including the redistricting bill, to further promote political reform. At 2249 GMT, Takao Iwami, a MAINICHI SHIMBUN special editorial adviser, phones in from a Shibuy hotel to give his view on the LDP stance, stating the LDP lacks a strong eagerness to take power. At 2250 GMT, Kuroiwa points out the ambiguity of LDP policies toward taking power. Mori says: "I do not think there are large differences among various parties on policies, especially domestic affairs. It is important to leave room for discussions with other parties." Discussing the consumption tax hike, Mori says it is necessary to seek public understanding on the issue. But, he adds: "I think the consumption tax hike should be avoided at the present in view of the current economic situation." He says it is necessary to promote administrative reform by 2010, while working with our welfare policies. The interview with Mori concludes at 2257 GMT.
