The same roster of torture personnel serves dictators and democrats. Extraction of confessions is aimed at incriminating journalists and politicians. According to the Political Constitution of the State, the democratic system protects the physical and psychic integrity of persons. According to reports in the hands of the Chamber of Deputies Committee on Human Rights, neither democracy nor the various other types of government can prevent the existence of a quasi-autonomous organization dedicated to the corporal and moral annihilation of those who fall into their hands charged with terrorism or subversion of public order. But according to Deputy Ramiro Barrenechea, a member of the Human Rights Committee, the aforementioned organization shows a propensity for "modernizing" through more sophisticated methods, with participation in them ranging from physicians who determine the extent to which the detainee is likely to withstand the tortures, to psychologists who separate the false information from the truth after hours of uninterrupted interrogation on a single point. There may be more, but, in the investigation being conducted by the committee, Barrenechea states that it has detected the existence of 21 types of torture and three phases of altered behavior of the persons, aimed at extracting handwritten self-incriminating statements, or statements that involve other persons in specified acts. "The tortures identified by the committee include beatings, electric prods, the `submarine,' `bell,' and `pig' treatments, special blows to the genitals, and raping of men and women," he said. He added that violence of the sexual type is the most frequently used. Until Turned Into Limp Flesh Based on data provided by testimonies, Barrenechea explained that the techniques designed to extract confessions involve three evaluation phases. The first, aimed at uncommunicativeness, consists of unlimited physical violence and threats of violence against members of the victim's family, and it is conducted by Bolivian torturers. In the second phase, the system of tortures is refined and is conducted with greater discernment and sophistication, because it is done by foreign experts. In the third phase, the intensity of the tortures is diminished, but techniques are applied that are designed to break routines and create situations of mental derangement. One of the torturers assumes a paternal role, pretends identification with the victim's problem, and persuades the victim to sign anything. During the persuasion interval, other methods are also used, such as preventing sleep for 17 days, or keeping the victim seated and tied to a chair for five consecutive days, without permitting movement even for tending to physiological needs, all the while pressing the victim with repeated questions. "Those acting the role of psychologists take part in this phase, asking the same question or others some 50 to 500 times to detect associations and verify whether what is being said by the victim, converted now into a lump of limp flesh, is the truth or a lie," said Barrenechea, adding: "Pressure is also applied scientifically, and we are trying to determine who are the doctors responsible for prescribing the dosages of torture and pressures the victim is able to take." Barrenechea stated that after such treatment, the victim's sole desire is to die and get it all over with rather than continue living in constant dread, and that this state is used to get the victim to sign a confession and incriminate other persons. "We have found a constant in all of these interrogations: The victim is handed a list of names of persons that includes those of many journalists and politicians," he said, adding that the victims sign what they are told to sign, and even incriminate themselves, in order to end the tortures, despite the fact that Bolivian law does not accept such documents as valid. "The committee is now also investigating why the judges are not accepting the evidence being presented by detainees attesting to their having been compelled to incriminate themselves and others by torture," he said. A Power That Vies With That of Government and State Barrenechea stated that the personnel conducting the tortures are "professionals," and that they have not been removed since the era of dictatorships, and even previous to that, because they "include persons from the first MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] period of rule. These are persons who have worked with the MNR's system of political control, the dictatorships of Banzer and Garcia Meza, the Patriotic Agreement government, and the present government. They are apparently irremovable persons with international specialization," he said. The existence of that apparatus specializing in repression, said Barrenechea, is constant, regardless of political regimes, and has become a quasi-autonomous structure beyond the control of even the executive branch of the government. "This is why the committee is working to reconcile the state with civil society, and to prevent the committing of these utterly savage acts in the name of the law," he said. Terrorist Unions The entire description mentioned above is drawn from the testimony heard by the Committee on Human Rights from 36 persons who were detained for acts of terrorism. They are members of subversive groups such as Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army [EGTK], "Zarate Willka," the Nestor Paz Zamora Command [CNPZ], and the Army of National Liberation [ELN], who appeared before the committee last week in compliance with a summons issued by the Chamber of Deputies. "This is part of an investigation of 50 persons charged with acts of terrorism, 10 of whom are in Chonchocoro, 11 in San Pedro, five in Posta, five in the Women's Correction Center, and four in prison in Cochabamba. Ten other persons are fugitives at large, one is a `missing person,' and four were released after being detained." Upon completing its evaluation, which will address elements of what is stated in the above paragraphs, the committee will issue a report, summon torturers, and police and judicial officials who permitted the violation of human and constitutional rights, and inspect the houses of detention.
