FR941128-2-00160 FR941128-2-00085 GPUN intends to enter into a Non-Nuclear Technical, Training, Management and Consulting Services Agreement (``Agreement'') with the GPU Companies to provide the Services in connection with their business operations. The Agreement will be substantially in the form of the Laboratory Service Agreement previously filed (Exhibit A&hyph;4) in SEC File No. 70&hyph;7720. Schedule I to the Agreement describes the types of Services that GPUN intends to furnish to the GPU Companies. Schedule II to the Agreement, Determination of Cost of Service and Allocation Thereof, provides that any Services to be rendered by GPUN will be charged at cost pursuant to the Act and the regulations thereunder. Schedule II will also reflect the practice of (i) charging capital costs for providing Services to the serviced companies consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, and (ii) billing to the serviced company the costs of service before they are paid by GPUN, which is consistent with the practice that was approved by the Commission in its letter to GPUS dated June 3, 1982. Such costs will be accounted for and billed to the GPU Companies substantially as described in HCAR No. 25149 (Sept. 14, 1990). The GPU Companies believe that the technical, analytical and related expertise of GPUN can be usefully applied in support of their business activities. Providing the Services will not interfere with GPUN's primary responsibility of operating and maintaining nuclear generating facilities of behalf of those companies. The total level of Services GPUN will provide will not exceed ten percent of the level of primary nuclear services which it is currently providing to the GPU Companies. GPUN will, by May 1 each year, separately report to the Commission any revenues received from the performance of the Services on its annual report on Form U&hyph;13&hyph;60 filed under the Act. American Electric Power Co., et al. (70&hyph;8429) American Electric Power Company, Inc. (``AEP''), 1 Riverside Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43215, a registered holding company, and AEP Resources, Inc. (``Resources''), 1 Riverside Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43215, a non-utility subsidiary company of AEP, have filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), 32 and 33 of the Act and Rules 45 and 53 thereunder. AEP and Resources propose to issue and sell up to $300 million in debt and/or equity securities through June 30, 1997 to invest in two types of power projects (``Power Projects'')_exempt wholesale generators (``EWGs'') and foreign utility companies (``FUCOs''). AEP and Resources also request approval to acquire the securities of one or more companies (``Project Parents'') that will directly or indirectly own and hold the securities of one or more FUCOs and EWGs. AEP proposes to guarantee the debt securities and other commitments of Resources, and AEP and Resources also propose to guarantee the securities of one or more Project Parents or Power Projects, and for Project Parents to guarantee the securities of their Power Projects, through June 30, 1997, in an aggregate amount which together with the securities will not exceed $300 million.
