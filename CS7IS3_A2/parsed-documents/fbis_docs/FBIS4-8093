Our correspondent from Tarcin has sent us this report: All access roads to Tarcin are still blocked. According to reports we have received so far, the situation is becoming increasingly complex according to Bosnia-Hercegovina radio broadcasts about the dramatic situation at the Gorazde battlefield. At the first roadblock in Tarcin, we have learned that despite all measures carried out by police forces of the Hadzici public security station, soldiers of the Fifth Hill Brigade, and members of the antiterrorist squad, embittered citizens from eastern Bosnia [Muslim refugees] and the local people expressing solidarity with their demands have seized silos in which the arrested aggressor soldiers are being held. Judging by the shots we heard fired from infantry weapons, the Tarcin drama culminated this evening. This was immediately followed by sirens of ambulance cars in Tarcin. However, we still have not received any details about casualties. We are unable to get details because Tarcin is completely blocked. [passage omitted] As we are filing this report, we have just received a report that police forces and members of the antiterrorist squad have seized the control of the silo prison again. However, the protesters have taken three aggressor soldiers in an unknown direction. [passage omitted]
