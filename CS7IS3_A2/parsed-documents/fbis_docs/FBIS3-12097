The tour will start in Montevideo on 4 April. New Cuban Ambassador to Uruguay Manuel Aguilera de la Paz made this announcement during an interview with EFE. Robaina will be in Montevideo from the morning of 4 April to the afternoon of 6 April and will meet with the country's main political leaders. Robaina will visit Quito [Ecuador], Lima [Peru], Asuncion [Paraguay], and Buenos Aires [Argentina]. Its "priority is to explain our policies in favor of Latin American integration, which includes economic as well as political integration," Aguilera de la Paz told EFE. During his meetings with Uruguayan politicians, Robaina will discuss the latest Cuban Government measures to legalize private economic activities and his country's willingness to receive investments from Latin American entrepreneurs. While visiting the Latin American capitals, Robaina will discuss arrangements for the next Ibero-American summit to be held in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) next June. Aguilera de la Paz said Cuba believes it is important for this summit to reiterate its condemnation of the embargo on trade against Cuba maintained by the United States. The previous Ibero-American summit held in Salvador, Bahia, (Brazil) last year condemned this embargo, but in a very tenuous manner. The Cuban ambassador added: "Latin American support against the embargo may be becoming stronger. It will foster Cuba's political and economic integration into the hemisphere." He added: "Second, as a bloc, it will exert pressure on the U.S. Government, convincing it that the embargo is an obsolete policy that will lead nowhere." Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle will receive the Cuban foreign minister, who will also meet with left-wing leaders from the Broad Front, namely Montevideo Mayor Tabare Vasquez -- his party's presidential candidate -- and the renowned General Liber Seregni. Aguilera de la Paz pointed out that Robaina will not be able to meet former President Julio Maria Sanguinetti -- who is the social democratic Colorado Party's presidential candidate in this year's election -- as he will not be in the country at that time. Robaina's visit to Latin America will be followed by another tour of other countries in the hemisphere, about which he declined to comment. This is part of an overall diplomatic offensive launched by Cuba, which has recently taken the foreign minister to Asia and which will take him to other European nations, including Spain. Aguilera de la Paz explained that Robaina, 38, "has given greater impetus to Cuban foreign policy" since he assumed the foreign affairs portfolio last year. Aguilera de la Paz, like Robaina, comes from the communist youth. He entered the diplomatic service under the new foreign minister. Asked if Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's accession to the OAS General Secretariat would favor Cuba's rejoining this organization, Aguilera de la Paz replied that "Cuba is not eager to return to the OAS." He said: "We maintain, to a certain extent, a passive attitude on this issue. We have not asked to rejoin the OAS but we are sure that it will happen although we do not know how long it will take."
