When the two journalists, who were on assignment to cover the demolition exercise in Mushin on the outskirts of Lagos, were shown on the television, they could hardly walk. One of them was almost naked as his clothes were torn following the beating. The security agents were members of a environmental sanitation special task force set up by the Lagos state government to demolish about 300 shops and buildings in Mushin which had made it impossible to construct a government hospital. The demolition exercise started Tuesday following the expiry of a one-week ultimatum given to the owners of the buildings by state military administrator Colonel Olagunsoye Oyinlola to vacate the area or face demolition of the structures. THE GUARDIAN newspaper protested against the maltreatment of the journalists amd the government sent officials to apologise, the newspaper reported Wednesday here.
