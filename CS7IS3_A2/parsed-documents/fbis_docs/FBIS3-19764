The two politicians discussed the serious tensions between Skopje and Athens, which even exacerbated after the imposition of the Greek embargo. Kinkel expressed understanding of the attitude of the FYROM not to negotiate under the pressure of the Greek embargo, the Foreign Ministry announced after the meeting. However, it is important to prevent another increase in the tensions and to also show understanding for the Greek worries regarding territorial claims against the neighboring province of Macedonia "by clarifying the situation." Gligorov, who privately attended a European forum in Bonn for three days, stressed his readiness for negotiations without any preconditions at a news conference on Wednesday [16 March]. However, it is out of the question to comply with Greek wishes for bilateral talks on the name of Macedonia used on both sides of the border, because no results have been achieved in the past two years. Now an overall package for this internationally recognized FYROM must be presented at the negotiating table, Gligorov pointed out.
