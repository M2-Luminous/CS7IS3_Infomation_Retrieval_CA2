As advocated by the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SPDJ] and other parties, the argument for a new organization for PKO participation concerns the concept of creating a new organization other than the Self-Defense Forces. Chairman Higuchi said that in the course of the discussions, a majority of the panel members voiced their opposition to the plan. For example, one said, "When the United Nation requests the dispatch of military personnel, the military ranks of the personnel are specified." And another said: "Even if a new organization should be created, it would be considered by the international community to be a military force and its members to be servicemen. Therefore, it will not be efficient to take the trouble to create a new organization."
