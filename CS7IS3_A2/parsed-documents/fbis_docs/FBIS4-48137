The Angolan president wants to know what the UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] leader wants and asked Soares to tell Savimbi to speed up the Lusaka talks: [Begin dos Santos recording] We did not ask Dr. Mario Soares, the Portuguese president, to mediate between the Angolan president and the UNITA president. We raised a concern that we had already raised anyway with the deceased President Houphouet-Boigny, which is to find out what Savimbi wanted and to try to get out of him what he wants for the war to end in Angola. That is all I told Soares. I did not ask him to persuade Savimbi to agree to an immediate cease-fire. I will repeat that I asked Soares to find out from Savimbi what he wants and also asked him, obviously, to advise Savimbi to accelerate certain negotiations going on in Lusaka. [end recording] That was Jose Eduardo dos Santos talking to Radio Nova.
