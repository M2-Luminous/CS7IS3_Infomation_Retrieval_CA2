This is a cunning, shameless tactic which only the traitor turning away from the people, a filthy flunkyist nation-seller, can mention. As everyone knows, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique promised the U.S. masters toward the end of last year to totally open the South Korean rice market. At the Uruguay Round negotiation as well, the clique agreed to all the demand for opening markets. The grave consequences of the nation-selling treachery which the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique committed, including the opening of the rice market, will come not only in rupturing the South Korean agriculture and leading the 6 million peasants to destruction. It will seriously affect other sectors of the economy as well, bringing about catastrophic results. The Daewoo Economic Institute said that with the settlement of the Uruguay Round negotiation, the small and medium industries, whose competitiveness is fragile, could go bankrupt, and that unemployment will become a major social problem. The Samsung Economic Institute also predicted that imports will increase in such areas as foodstuff, textile, and machinery, bringing about grave consequences. These economic institutes had good reason to make such predictions. The market opening will thus lead the South Korean economy to irreversible catastrophe, increasing unemployment and leading the lives of workers to further destitution. Traitor Kim Yong-sam raved about the maintenance of industrial peace and restraining wage hike as if they were some effective measures to win in international competition. However, it is impossible for the South Korean economy to win international competition, for the South Korean economy has nothing of its own worth mentioning but consists of the vulnerable colonial subjugated economy in which it can carry on only such a thing as bonded processing trade with others' capital, technology, facilities, and materials. The puppets are raving about international competitiveness only to shirk responsibility for the catastrophic crisis that will result from opening markets. The Kim Yong-sam clique raved about maintenance of industrial peace and restraining wage hikes with a sinister purpose of forcing obedience and sacrifice upon the workers and further stepping up suppression of the labor movement so as to stabilize its power. The puppet traitor on that day stressed the need to persuade the labor unions of the major business groups, which lead the labor movement for wage hikes. Before this, he stressed the need for the relevant departments to actively cooperate for the settlement of industrial peace. He also said that although the workers' strike is not against the law, he will have the right of emergency coordination exercised. All this proves his said sinister purpose. Traitor Kim Yong-sam is a rare fascist tyrant who does not hesitate anything if it serves to fill his personal greed for power. He is a politico, a filthy impostor who habitually deceives and mocks the people. He disguises himself under the mask of a civilian regime and pretend to do something for the people, but he is a more cunning and shameless person than his predecessor military dictators. It is expected that the workers will wage a more vigorous struggle in South Korea this year resisting the puppets' flunkyist nation-selling economic policy and antipeople labor policy. Fearing this, the puppets are attempting to prevent their struggle by means of temptation, coercion, appeasement, and deception. This, however, will not work. The South Korean workers will not move off from the struggle out of fear of suppression. The criminal will be punished according to the crime he committed. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, which is habitually engaged in nation-selling treachery and suppression of the people, turning away from the country and the nation, will certainly be subjected to the people's stern judgment.
