Nuclear suspicions involving the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK] is one cause. The SDPJ was forced to leave the administration because the coalition government had to take into consideration its capability in dealing with the crisis if an unforeseen situation takes place. However, ironically the coalition government's foundation has been weakened with the SDPJ leaving the administration, and at least temporarily has lowered its capability for crisis management. It Has Become Difficult To Form a Consensus During the Cold War, the positions of the Japanese political parties were determined by their distance with the United States or the USSR. At the start of the Hata administration, instead of this criterion, the stance of the Japanese political parties in dealing with the problems involving North Korea became one of the criteria in determining their positions, at least for the time being. In the process of forming the coalition government's policy consensus, which has become a scrap paper, Shinseito's [Japan Renewal Party] Ichiro Ozawa used the various cards in persistently requesting the SDPJ to compromise. Persons concerned with the coalition parties admit that Ozawa intended to give priority to internal affairs by "first cornering the SDPJ, and second by sending the message to the United States that we are taking this problem seriously." As a result, the coalition parties have made at least two mistakes. First, more discrepancies than consensus have been revealed among the coalition parties, which the coalition parties managed to patch up through political measures. If this becomes known to the public, it will be difficult to form a national consensus which is indispensable in dealing with the crisis. Second, it has become apparent that no consideration is being paid to the People's Republic of China [PRC] in the process of arguments. We should say Japan has committed a serious diplomatic error when we consider the significance of the PRC. Actually, Japan can shoulder its responsibilities in the international community so long as its actions are based on three key principles--the Constitution, the Japan-U.S. security structure, and the United Nations. However, in part, Japan could not do so because the national discussion on the issue is still immature. On one hand, there are people who argue that economic sanctions are indispensable in order to make North Korea give up its nuclear development and therefore a naval blockade may become necessary in effecting the sanction. Their argument sounds as if they are prepared to fight a war. On the other hand, there are those who see the situation optimistically without grounds simply because they want to avert their eyes from such a worst-case scenario. Though the attitude of the latter group is out of the question, the former group is also to blame in the sense they tend to unnecessarily stir up a sense of crisis. The UN Security Council will take step-by-step sanctions if North Korea does not agree to undergo inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As expected, the PRC will also make its intention clear during the process, and as exports to the country are not to be totally banned immediately, it is not realistic to talk about a naval blockade. If the countries concerned intend to impose sanctions by themselves, their sanctions will also be imposed step by step. The countries concerned are also in agreement that the window for negotiations should be kept open in order not to uselessly incite North Korea. There is no need to uselessly create a sense of crisis. At the same time, we should realize more seriously the negative aspects of the crisis to be created if North Korea declares that it is armed with nuclear weapons. Discussions May Take Place on Nuclear Armaments In order to cope with the threat of a nuclear-armed North Korea, the United States will try to maintain a nuclear deterrent by including allied countries such as Japan and the Republic of Korea [ROK] under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. However, if North Korea becomes so desperate it is not afraid of being attacked with nuclear weapons, it is possible the logic of deterrence may no longer hold true. Some people may claim that Japan should be armed with nuclear weapons, and in certain cases it may be difficult to convince these people that such an option is not necessary. The fact that the arms race is beginning in northeast Asia is not the only problem. North Korea's behavior might incite other countries such as Iraq, Iran, and others subjected to nuclear suspicion. It might might also jeopardize the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) structure. If military tension is intensified in the Middle East, with nuclear issues as the background, it could even affect the trend of petroleum supplies, creating confusion in the world economy as a whole. Russia is another dangerous neighbor which is strengthening its nationalistic tendency. Former presidential assistant Zbigniew Brzezinski expressed anxiety that "Russia is aiming at becoming an imperial rather than a democratic state." U.S. strategic experts consider the possibility of a new Cold War taking place as a result of the confrontation between Russia and Ukraine. Prime Minister Hata is regarded as "a person able to see things from the standpoint of the general public." However, amateurism should be excluded as far as diplomatic and security problems are concerned. In that sense, the first thing the prime minister should do is correct the course of the amateurish diplomacy laid out by Hosokawa, who tried to explain the failure of the Japan-U.S. summit as "relations of mature men." When we take into account the cloudy situation seen in North Korea and Russia, we realize what the prime minister should do is to repair Japan-U.S. relations. In the White House administration of former President Nixon, who died recently, all diplomatic papers used to be written taking U.S.-Soviet relations into consideration. Even in producing papers on U.S.-Uruguay relations, it was necessary to analyze the possible influence the papers might have on U.S.-Soviet relations. A Way Out Not in Sight The USSR has disappeared, and the Clinton administration does not maintain the habit of seeing everything in the context of U.S.-Soviet relations. However, even after the end of the Cold War, the significance of the United States to Japan has not decreased at all. The Japan-U.S. security structure is already functioning as a system capable of dealing with the post-Cold War threat. Every diplomatic policy should be considered in the context of Japan-U.S. relations. If people feel that such a way of thinking is a Cold War-oriented attitude, they are mistaken. J. Hodge, chief editor of FOREIGN AFFAIRS, wrote a short article in the latest issue entitled "From Chaos to Order." The shift from the Hosokawa to the Hata administration might also have been a process of seeking for a new order. However, no outlet from the chaos has been found yet.
