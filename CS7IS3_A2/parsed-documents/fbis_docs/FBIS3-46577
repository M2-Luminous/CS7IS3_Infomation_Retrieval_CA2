The revolutionary spirit of our people who are advancing along the straight road of chuche finds a graphic expression in that they firmly arm themselves with the great chuche-based idea of socialism and think and act only in accordance with its requirement and that they are making strenuous efforts to defend and thoroughly implement the party's line and policies, the article says, and continues: The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, basing himself on the chuche idea founded by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, has developed and perfected the idea of socialism from a new angle. The chuche-based idea of socialism proves that socialism is the most advanced society where the popular masses are the masters of everything and everything serves them and which is steadily developed by their concerted efforts. As our people have firmly armed themselves with the chuche idea they cherish the justness of the socialist cause of chuche as their faith and dynamically advance along the road of socialism without wavering under any anti-socialist whirlwind. Today our people's struggle to defend and build socialism is immediately a struggle to implement the party's line and policies. At the 21st plenary meeting of the 6th party Central Committee our party, on the basis of a profound analysis of the changed circumstances and the realistic demands of our socialist construction, set the three years to come as a period for adjustment in socialist economic construction and put forward a strategic agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first policy. Our people find their way in the line and policies of the party and deem it as the requirement of a worthy life to defend and implement them and turn out dynamically to this end. As they have a definite stand toward the party's line and policies, our people are displaying a high revolutionary spirit and militancy and creating new miracles and feats in carrying them through. The revolutionary spirit of our people is also manifested in solving all problems by themselves in the high revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, the article says. Noting that it is the revolutionary spirit of our people to decisively counter the base maneuverings of the enemies with redoubled courage in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, the article stresses that for this the foundations of our independent socialist national economy are firmly consolidated with each passing day and our political, economic and military might strengthened still further.
