FR940503-2-00058 FR940503-2-00039 However, in those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated, based upon DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis. Therefore, DMO's Application for an Interim Waiver from the DOE test procedure for its HDS series gas furnaces regarding blower time delay is granted. DMO shall be permitted to test its HDS series gas furnaces on the basis of the test procedures specified in 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix N, with the modification set forth below: (i) Section 3.0 in Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph: 3.0␣Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in Section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE 103&hyph;82 with the exception of Sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures: (ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 in Appendix N as follows: 3.10␣Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up, delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-) unless: (1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the indoor air circulation blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) The furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or (3) The delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay (t-) using a stop watch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within 0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. This Interim Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements and all allegations submitted by the company. This Interim Waiver may be removed or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the application is incorrect. The Interim Waiver shall remain in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE acts on the Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180-day period, if necessary. ␣␣␣Sincerely, Frank M. Stewart, Jr., Acting Chief of Staff, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
