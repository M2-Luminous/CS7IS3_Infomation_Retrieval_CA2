Agai Aminiyan, head of the team of Iranian experts investigating the accident, said at a meeting with Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev in Baku on Thursday that the plane which was flying from Moscow to Tehran did not have any serious technical flaws which could have caused a crash. It remains unclear so far why the plane diverted from the route. Because the planes of this type do not have black boxes, the cause may be identified only after deciphering the tapes with recordings of the negotiations between the crew and air controllers. Iranian experts have already been handed over the tapes by Yerevan and Tbilisi and are now seeking to receive recordings from Azerbaijan. The Armenian side has not assumed direct responsibility for the accident, Aminiyan said. However, it has admitted that its troops had taken the Iranian plane for an Azerbaijani craft. This can serve as indirect proof that it could have been shot down by Armenian troops. Additionally, the Armenian troops do not deny that they did not try to get in touch with the plane in order to identify it. Aliyev confirmed his readiness to provide the Iranian commission with every possible assistance in carrying out the investigation.
