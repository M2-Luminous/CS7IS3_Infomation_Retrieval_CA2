This was reported by several people who attended a meeting of the "Kefar Vitkin group," the joint forum of Likud and Labor MK's on 17 June. The same sources also claimed that Likud MK's at the meeting expressed no opposition to the relocation of settlements and their concentration in large settlement blocs. The Kefar Vitkin group reconvened at MK Mikha'el Eytan's house in Kokhav Ya'ir on 17 June. The Labor MK's who participated in the meeting were Gedalya Gal, Ori Or, Eli Goldschmidt, and Rafi Elul, who recently joined the forum in the place of Efrayim Sne who resigned after being appointed health minister. The fifth Labor MK in the forum, Deputy Education Minister Mikha Goldman, was abroad and therefore absent from the 17 June meeting. The Likud was represented by MK's Dan Meridor, Mikha'el Eytan, David Magen, Avraham Herschson, and 'Ovadya Eli. The forum continued a discussion that started at their first meeting two weeks ago, at Gedalya Gal's home in Kefar Vitkin. The debate focused on the definition of the security requirements Israel must insist upon when signing political agreements. Although the participants agreed to maintain secrecy, some details of the discussion have been learned. MK Ori Or, the chairman of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, asserted that progress on the Palestinian track must be expedited. He noted the need to hold elections expeditiously in the territories, even at the expense of movement on the Syrian track. Or said that there should be no rush to reach an agreement with Syria. The government should not feel under pressure and try to reach an agreement with the Syrians before the 1996 elections. In his opinion, such pressure could result in an agreement that was bad for Israel. In Or's opinion, Israel should not agree to the stationing of UN observers, international forces, of U.S. soldiers in the territories or on the Golan Heights. He prefers joint patrols, similar to the ones now being carried out by Palestinians and Israelis in the autonomous areas. Or said that Israel's security needs necessitate its continued control over the Golan Heights, the Jordan Rift Valley, the northern part of the Dead Sea, and the Jerusalem area, as well as several strategic points where Palestinian autonomy should not be permitted. Or mentioned the possibility of creating Jewish settlement blocs in Judaea and Samaria and did not rule out the possibility of uprooting remote or isolated settlements and relocating them inside the Jewish settlement blocs. Meridor enumerated the threats to Israel's security that would be posed by the establishment of a Palestinian state. As stated before, several participants claimed that Meridor did not categorically reject a territorial compromise if Israel's security was guaranteed. According to these sources, Likud MK's did not express any opposition to lumping the Jewish settlements in the territories together in large blocs. Yesterday, Meridor denied that he had expressed readiness for a territorial compromise. He was furious that details of the meeting had leaked to the media and said that if these leaks continued he would propose to dissolve the forum. The forum members will apparently meet in another two weeks at Eli Goldschmidt's home in Kibbutz Deganya. The LEHAVA [Hebrew acronym for Renewal in the Likud Movement] group has begun signing up Likud Central Committee members on a manifesto expressing support for the possibility of territorial compromise. The group's members have called for an urgent convention of the Likud Central Committee, in which they intend to put their political plan to a vote. Statements in support of the Allon Plan, which were voiced by Dani Kohen, the group's chairman, at a convention of the "Third Path" two weeks ago, drew sharp criticism from the Likud spokesman who asserted that "Dani Kohen was a marginal figure in the Likud." In response, Kohen said that the LEHAVA group comprised several hundred party members, including several dozen central committee members. The LEHAVA manifesto stipulates that Israel's political plan should include its opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip and a total rejection of the Right of Return. The plan should note Israel's readiness for a territorial compromise -- which would only be spelled out in detail in the framework of negotiations. Autonomy would only apply to individuals and not to territories, and Israel's continued sovereignty over the Jordan Rift Valley, the northern part of the Dead Sea, the Golan Heights, metropolitan Jerusalem, the 'Etzyon Bloc, the Qatif Bloc, and in all the areas of Jewish settlement considered vital for security would be guaranteed. It should be noted that despite being entrusted with the task by the party's central committee over six months ago, the Likud bureau has still not formulated a draft proposal for a political plan.
