FR940620-0-00010 FR940620-0-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;142&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8938; AD 94&hyph;12&hyph;10] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 767 Series Airplanes Equipped With Pratt & Whitney PW4000 Series Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series airplanes, that currently requires repetitive inspections, tests, adjustments, and functional checks of the thrust reverser system and of selected engine wiring. This amendment adds a requirement for installation of a terminating modification, repetitive operational checks of that installation, and repair of any discrepancy found. This amendment is prompted by the identification of a modification that ensures that the level of safety inherent in the original type design of the thrust reverser system is further enhanced. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent deployment of a thrust reverser in flight and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane. DATES: Effective July 20, 1994. The incorporation by reference of Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;78&hyph;0062, Revision 2, dated June 3, 1993; and Revision 3, dated February 24, 1994; as listed in the regulations, is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 20, 1994.

The action proposed to continue to require repetitive inspections, tests, adjustments, and functional checks of the thrust reverser system and of selected engine wiring; and to add a requirement for installation of a terminating modification, repetitive operational checks of that installation, and repair of any discrepancy found.
