The spokesman said the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog body made the demand in a letter sent to North Korea on Sunday. The IAEA wants to send an inspection team to North Korea to oversee the refueling which involves the replacement of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang. The Yongbyon complex has been the focus of allegations that North Korea is pursuing a clandestine nuclear weapons program. North Korea on April 29 offered to allow IAEA inspectors to be present at the unloading of spent fuel rods from the reactor, but said it would not permit the IAEA to measure radioactivity levels or take samples. The IAEA later indicated that North Korea's terms were unacceptable. North Korea had indicated it would like to conduct the refueling as early as late April. The latest IAEA message to North Korea indicates that the Agency has not budged from the insistence that it wants full inspections of the facility and that it will consider a failure to allow this as an infringement of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said in Seoul on April 21 that North Korea will be able to acquire enough plutonium "within weeks" to make four to five nuclear bombs with the fuel rod change at the reactor.
