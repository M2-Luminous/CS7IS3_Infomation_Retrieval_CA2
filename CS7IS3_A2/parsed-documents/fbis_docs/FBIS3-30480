The letter refers to the claims presented to the UNSC chairman by UN Secretary-General Butrus-Ghali in his letter dated 1 February. We will broadcast Nobilo's letter in its entirety. My government does not deny that regular Croatian forces are deployed in the border areas between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. They have been deployed there in accordance with the joint agreement between my government and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government of 12 July 1992. The redeployment of those forces would put in serious jeopardy the territorial integrity and security of the Republic of Croatia. Considering the defense of towns on Croatia's Dalmatian coast, such a change in the balance of power in relation to the Serb side would put in serious jeopardy the support for the [Croatian] president's peace initiative, which is currently being discussed in the assembly, aiming at normalizing relations with Sarajevo and Belgrade. My government cannot accept the simplified interpretation of the joint declaration with Belgrade of 19 January 1994 that the declaration is directed against the side that did not sign it [the Muslim side]. In fact, my president [Tudjman] proposed to the prime ministers of Turkey and Pakistan to mediate in the negotiations between the Croatian and Bosnian Muslim sides -- as the Croatian side proposed in Bonn -- before all sides resume their negotiations in Geneva scheduled for 10 February. The Security Council will conclude that the joint statement by my government and Belgrade is fully in line with Security Council Resolution 871 from 1993, the CSCE final documents from Rome, and the EU's modus vivendi action plan of 22 November 1993, Nobilo said in his letter and added: My government remains concerned for the well-being of the Croats, citizens of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who are besieged by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in Vitez, Kiseljak, Usora, Zepce, and elsewhere. We have warned the Security Council on several occasions that the ethnic Croats, citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, should be treated in the same way as the Muslims who are besieged in Srebrenica, Zepa, Gorazde, Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Bihac. The enclaves of Vitez, Kiseljak, Usora, and Zepce should be proclaimed protected areas in line with principles of Resolution 824 from 1993. On 2 December 1993 and 24 January 1994, my government called on the Security Council to review the problem of large-scale violations of international humanitarian law committed by the [Bosnian] government forces, against Croats, citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Forces of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army have carried out at least eight mass executions of Croats, citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, since July last year. Under such circumstances, when the Security Council has no means of protecting Croats, citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, my government has no moral right to prevent Croat volunteers from helping the threatened community of Croats in Bosnia, who account for 18 percent of the Bosnia-Herzegovina population and have been forced into 10 percent of the territory. My government believes that a military solution to the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina, or the problem of the UN protected areas in Croatia, is not acceptable, and in this respect it will continue supporting international mediation. We lend special support to international mechanisms supervising the number, presence, and intentions of the Croatian Army and Croatian volunteers in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this context, I would like to repeat the Croatian president's invitation to the Security Council of 16 July 1993 to supervise the Croatian and Bosnia-Herzegovina borders. Croatia will immediately give its support to such a mechanism. If the Security Council is ready to suggest a better solution to the crisis in the area, than the one offered by the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, my government is ready to review their proposal. However, my government would like to warn the Security Council that any serious change in the balance of power in the area would derail the current process. In this respect, my government calls on the Security Council to give its full and unconditional support to the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, and especially to the Owen-Stoltenberg peace plan on Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to tell all interested parties that this is the only possible way to end the difficult human tragedy in the area. This is said in the letter by Mario Nobilo, permanent representatives of the Republic of Croatia in the United Nations.
