The military court of Sidi Barrani, near the Libyan border, passed the death sentence against a second lieutenant in the reserves, Midhat Tahawi, and two conscripts, Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi and Muhammad Ahmad Sa'id Salih, on Wednesday. One of the conscripts was among the seven Islamic militants killed in a police raid on the Cairo district of al-Zawiyah al- Hamra' in early February, according to an informed source. The other two appeared in court. Another second lieutenant, Fathi Mahmud Khattab, and two more conscripts were each sentenced to 10 years of hard labour. The court said the six soldiers had planted explosives at Sidi Barrani airport and planned to detonate the bomb during a visit by Mubarak, who often meets his Libyan counterpart Mu'ammar al- Qadhdhafi in the border town. The trial opened on January 30 behind closed doors. The latest verdicts raised to 43 the number of Islamic militants sent to death row since October 1992. Twenty-nine people have been executed over the last nine months.
