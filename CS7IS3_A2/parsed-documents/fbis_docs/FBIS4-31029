FBIS4-31029 "dreeu107__s94004" FBIS-EEU-94-107-S Daily Report 3 June 1994 Hungary Hungary AU0505093294 Economic Review -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0505093294 Economic Review -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BFN STATE ASSETS PRIVATIZED: By the end of last year, only 15 percent of the state assets of 430 billion forints (HUF) held by the State Property Agency (AVU) and the State Holding Company's HUF1,400 billion had been privatized, according to a recent report by the independent research organization Kopint-Datorg. Last year's income from privatization was HUF77.9 billion, slightly up on 1992's HUF74.6 billion. Of the 1993 income, however, the proportion of foreign investment was only one-third, as compared to 55 percent in 1992, and the cash element in the total income figure fell from 85 percent to 55 percent. Preferential payment forms (for example, privatization leasing) accounted for 45 percent of the total income in 1993, compared with only 15 percent in the previous year. The report states that preferential payment schemes have created problems for companies privatized in this way; creating uncertainty over their future and failing to provide secure long-term successful operations. State assets to a book value of HUF152.8 billion were privatized between 1990 and 1992 and the privatization income in this period was around two-thirds of book value. The book value of privatized state assets last year was HUF127.8 billion, but the privatization income was only 55 percent of this figure. The continued operation of state- owned companies is becoming increasingly expensive and company assets worth HUF67.2 billion were sold off in 1993. AVU expenditure on various guarantees amounted to HUF5.7 billion in 1993 and this amount is projected to rise to HUF15 billion in the 1994 Property Policy Guidelines. Although AVU expenditure on company reorganization and guarantees is classified as the redistribution of privatization revenues, Kopint-Datorg argues that it is paradoxical that privatization incomes are in effect being use to increase the state's control over state-owned companies. (Budapest MTI in English 1406 GMT 3 May 94) NATIONAL BANK BALANCE: The Hungarian National Bank (MNB) closed last year with a balance-sheet total of HUF3,468.8 billion, 29 percent up on the previous year. MNB revenues of HUF236.3 billion and expenditures of HUF223.4 billion resulted in pre-tax profit of HUF12.82 billion, which was HUF3.9 billion more than last year. After-tax profits were HUF2.5 billion. The above figures were published at MNB's general assembly on 29 April. The bank's results are closely linked with Hungary's economic situation. Last year's processes exhibited differences from the original plan, with a fall in exports and a 9 percent rise in domestic consumption. After a decline lasting years, industrial output increased by 4 percent; agricultural production continued to decrease, reaching 6 percent; gross domestic product fell by 0-2 percent. Last year the MNB and the government devalued the forint in five stages, by a total of 15 percent. The international basic balance, that is the balance of the current account, net borrowings, repayments, and working capital investments, showed a surplus of $755 million in 1992, and $2.2 billion in 1993. At the same time, the current account last year dipped $3.5 billion into the red. In 1993, foreign resources of $4.4 billion were mobilized through 16 bond issues, and $2.3 billion working capital arrived in the country, with the total amount considerably exceeding debt-repayment obligations. The country had net debts of $14.9 billion at the end of 1993, an increase of $1.7 billion from the previous year. Hard- currency reserves amounted to $6.7 billion late last year. The gross national debt went up by $3.1 billion in one year, to reach $24.6 billion by the end of December. (Budapest MTI in English 1528 GMT 29 Apr 94) INVESTMENT BANK PROFITS: The Hungarian Investment and Development Bank (MBFB Rt) held total assets last year of HUF20.5 billion, registering pre-tax profits of HUF667 million and after-tax profits of HUF460 million, according to its March 2 annual general meeting (AGM) report. These figures are around 50 percent up on the 1992 figures. MBFB could have paid a 5 percent dividend from 1992's profit reserves and last year's profit, but the AGM decided instead to allocate 50 percent of the 1993 profit to general reserves and the other half to profit reserves. The bank's total assets are expected to rise to HUF44 billion this year, with credit outlays of over HUF16 billion, eight times more than in 1993. The bank is to become increasingly involved in the long-term financing of major projects, mainly in the construction and building materials industries, and in infrastructure development projects. To enable it to do this, MBFB plans to take out long-term credit on HUF12 billion from foreign banks. The State Holding Company (AV Rt) has raised the bank's reserve capital by HUF2 billion to HUF12.2 billion. AV Rt now holds 55.73 percent of the bank, with the SPA holding 21.18 percent and the State Development Institute (AFI) 22.94 percent. (Budapest MTI in English 1041 GMT 3 May 94) BNP-KH-DRESDNER BALANCE: BNP-KH-Dresdner Bank (BKD) closed last year with a balance sheet total of HUF15 billion and a pre-tax profit of 454 million forints (HUF). The bank had an after-tax profit of HUF377 million, of which HUF200 million was set aside for the payment of dividends. BKD had interest revenue of HUF1.949 billion, paying out HUF1.417 billion interest leaving net interest revenue at HUF532 million. Other income was almost HUF600 million. Total operating costs were HUF593 million. Of the remaining after- tax profit, the bank is to pay HUF109 million into general reserves and HUF67 million into capital reserves. The bank's stock of loans amounted to HUF4.874 billion in 1992 and HUF5.305 billion last year. BKD's stock of state securities grew from HUF494 million in 1992 to HUF2.244 billion. BKD was established at the end of 1990 by Banque National de Paris (37 percent), Dresdner Bank AG (37 percent) and Kereskedelmi Bank Rt (26 percent). The bank has registered capital of HUF1.14 billion and capital reserves of HUF333.3 million. (Budapest MTI in English 1742 GMT 28 Apr 94) GOLDSUN SHARE OFFER: The frozen food company Goldsun Hutoipari Rt is to publicly offer 300,000 registered HUF1,000 face-value shares between May 2 and 13. The new shares will be offered to Hungarian private investors and to Hungarian and foreign corporate investors. No oversubscription will be accepted. The issue price will be HUF1,300 or its equivalent in U.S. dollars at the central bank mid-rate on May 2. The issue is managed by Talentum Rt. The shares are expected to be introduced on the Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE) shortly after their issue and are likely to be later floated on foreign stock exchanges. Alongside the share issue, Goldsun will also offer convertible bonds to a total face value of HUF10 million. The convertible bonds will have face value of HUF100 and will be issued at par. Each bond entitles the bearer to an option on the purchase of one registered ordinary HUF1,000 face-value share at a price of HUF1,500 in the first week of November 1995. If the option is not used, the bonds may be redeemed at face value. The convertible bonds, which will not be introduced on the BSE, will be available to Hungarians and foreigners. Goldsun Hutoipari Rt, the legal successor of Zalaegerszegi Hutoipari Kft, was established as a shareholders' company (Rt) on December 1 last year with founding capital of HUF764 million. The American investment company, Shamrock Capital Investors III Inc bought 51 percent of the Zala company from the State Property Agency in April 1992 and purchased the remaining 49 percent a year later. Sunfrost, Israel's largest refrigerating company, bought 50 percent of the company last October. Goldsun, which ranks second or third among Hungary's eight major frozen food companies, had a sales income last year of HUF1.4 billion. Exports to western Europe account for 54 percent of all sales. Sales are expected to reach HUF1.642 billion this year and the income from work under commission contracts will be HUF103 million. The company is exempt from profit tax until 1996 and will enjoy a 60 percent tax allowance up to 2001. Last year, Goldsun received a $5.2 million development loan from the EBRD, HUF2 million of which was used in 1993. (Budapest MTI in English 1355 GMT 29 Apr 94) GRAIN HARVEST FORECASTS: This year's grain harvest is expected to be around 6 million metric tons, including a wheat harvest of 4 million metric tons. Last year's wheat harvest was 3.032 million metric tons, which represented an average of 3,060 kilos per hectare. Wheat was sown on an area of 992,000 hectares. In 1993, the total harvest of cereals -- grains and maize -- was 8.389 million metric tons, with maize accounting for 4.012 million metric tons. Last year maize was harvested on an area of 1.131 million hectares, an average yield of 3,550 kilos per hectare. Cereal crops were sown on a total area of 2.742 million hectares last year. The relatively wet spring means that this year's cereal (grains and maize), harvest is expected to reach 11 million metric tons. As the domestic market generally takes 8.5-9 million metric tons, there is expected to be a surplus for export. It is estimated that the area sown with maize this year is 1-1.2 million hectares and a maize harvest of around 5 million metric tons is forecast. (Budapest MTI in English 1413 GMT 28 Apr 94) GAMBLING: Gambling accounted for one-fourth of payments by state firms to the central budget in 1993 (HUF6.7 billion). The total revenue of HUF24.4 billion acquired by gambling organizers is less than 1 percent of Hungary's annual total domestic income. The operation of casinos continues to be the most profitable branch within the industry, with a major decline in the demand for Bingo and raffle tickets. According to estimates, 75-80 percent of the population has gambled in one form or another at least once. Of them, every third is an active punter, placing regular bets. The most popular games, for instance, football lottery, the lottery, Bingo, and racing, are state monopolies. At present, some 250 firms organize gambling, but the state sector continues to dominate gambling. This is mainly due to the lottery and football lottery monopoly of the Gambling Co., which has an equity of HUF1.8 billion. Of the 17 casinos operating nationwide, the firm operates nine, and also has 12 slot-machine halls, and issued six various raffle tickets in 1993. Bingosport Plc. is the other state-owned gambling firm, but the number of its Bingo halls fell from 18 to nine in 1993. No bookmakers operate in Hungary, although a private venture opened 14 such offices, based on the English model, but was forced to shut down due to heavy losses. The raffle ticket and game market also declined: While there were 26 raffle ticket issuing companies in 1992, their number was only 19 last year. The operation of casinos continues to be the strong part of Hungarian gambling; five new casinos were opened in towns throughout the country in 1993. This year, another two casinos are to open where betting is possible in forints. (Of the 17 casinos in Hungary at present, only three accept bets in forints, the other 14 require foreign currency.) The number of slot-machines in Hungary has shown a steady increase since 1992, with about 4,000-5,000 throughout the country. Although a law bans these, the authorities are unable to enforce the ban as the maximum fine that can be imposed is only HUF30,000. Gambling brought in revenue of HUF24.4 billion in 1993, which is not even one percent of the country's total domestic income. However, gambling accounted for more than one-fourth of payments by state firms (various taxes and contributions) to the central budget in 1993. Apart from this, as concession fees, an additional HUF443 million was levied on gambling organizers. According to surveys in 1993, the majority (some 70 percent) of gambling organizers ended the year with a loss, or were just able to break even. Even the largest state monopoly firm, the Gambling Co. produced losses of HUF182 million in the first half of the year, but managed to end the year without a loss. Analysts say that besides heavy tax burdens, the operational costs of gambling are extremely high. Apart from the general taxes levied on entrepreneurs, gambling organizers also face additional deductions of 44 percent. (Budapest MTI in English 0815 GMT 29 Apr 94) FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING: Trading on the inter-bank foreign-exchange market is calm, with no signs of any forint devaluation expectations for the near future. Banks have not responded to the first-round Hungarian election results with any major forex purchases. (Budapest MTI in English 1149 GMT 10 May 94) AVU CONTINUES PRIVATIZATION: The State Property Agency (AVU) Board confirmed after its meeting on 11 May it would continue the privatization process but would concentrate on closing transactions already in progress. New tenders are expected to be evaluated starting in August. Privatization will not be accelerated and the AVU will try to avoid making strategic decisions. Its most important aim is to maintain and increase the reliability of the process, the board said. (Budapest MTI in English 1625 GMT 11 May 94) CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT: The current account deficit stood at $573 million at the end of February, compared to $378 million at the end of January, according to the Hungarian National Bank. As a result of a $910 million surplus in the capital account, the country's balance of payments showed a $337 million surplus in the first two months, as against a $853 million surplus in January. The trade balance deficit grew from $389 million in January to $536 million in February, with exports amounting to $1.146 billion and imports totalling $1.681 billion. In February, exports amounted to $540 million and imports totalled $687 million, resulting in a deficit of $147 million. Direct foreign cash investment amounted to $20 million in February, compared to $88 million in January, while long-term capital inflow was $1.578 billion, an increase of $102 million from $1.476 billion in January. Hungary's international reserves stood at $7.333 billion, slightly down on $7.539 billion in the preceding month and compared to $6.736 billion at the end of last year. Total direct cash investment amounted to $5.661 billion at the end of January, up from $5.575 billion at the end of December 1993. Foreign debt totalled $26.078 billion at the end of February, as against $25.698 billion in January and $24.560 billion at the end of last year. (Budapest MTI in English 1111 GMT 11 May 94) NBH REPORT: The 1993 monetary and budget policies had to be corrected, since economic trends were in several respects different than expected, says the Hungarian National Bank's (NBH) annual report. One difference is that the increase in industrial production in 1993 resulted not from exports, but mainly from a significant rise in domestic corporate demand. Corporate demand was not counterbalanced by a decrease in the budget deficit, leading to the rise in domestic demand. The foreign trade balance and that of current payments have been showing a monthly deficit since the third quarter of 1992. Additionally, deposit interest rates have significantly fallen as a result of over-liquidity in the banking system, a condition intended to allow market interest rates to adjust to the slowing rate of inflation. This, however, has discouraged savings. The decrease in the deposit interest rate was followed by a smaller decrease in the lending interest rate only a few months later. As a result, the amount of bank loans has hardly risen, and the interest margin has increased over the year. At the same time, the central budget financing offered a safe investment possibility to banks. High lending interest rates inspired prospering companies to take out foreign loans. Corrective measures carried out by the central bank over the year aimed to boost savings and increase the competitiveness of Hungarian products in foreign markets. These measures included the rise in central bank interest rates in June and September, the bank's urging the Finance Ministry to raise interest on state securities, and the devaluation of the forint by a total of 15 percent in 1993. The impacts of these measures, however, could not have been felt in 1993, except for the fact that the savings rate stopped falling by the end of the year. Banks' foreign debts decreased by a total of HUF6.2 billion in 1993. The direct capital inflow and foreign loans taken out by companies equaled the current account deficit. There was a slight increase in business deposits and a steep one in their debts. This resulted in, unlike in 1992, entrepreneurs becoming net debtors to the banks with net debts of HUF54.7 billion by the end of 1993. Direct foreign loans taken out by companies grew by $700 million over last year. Net personal savings showed an increase of HUF146.3 billion in 1993, a lower figure than expected, and savings were increasingly deposited outside the banking sector. Net outstanding claims of banks to the budget increased by HUF38.2 billion. Total domestic loans increased by HUF16.3 percent, with loans granted to private individuals rising by 14.6 percent, and those granted to companies by 18.5 percent. Net debt of the consolidated state budget significantly rose in mid- year; however, it exceeded last year's figure only by 3.5 percent at the end of 1993, mainly as a result of the privatization of the telecommunications company MATAV in December. In 1993 broad money increased by 16.1 percent while nominal GDP went up by 18-19 percent. Over the previous three years, nominal GDP increased by a lower rate than broad money. The velocity of money rose by 2 percent.

The plant is expected to start operating in September and will produce 800,000 monitors a year when it reaches full capacity in 1996. The project has the support of the regional Labor Office and the local council, with the Labor Office to grant a 20 million forint (HUF) loan and the council granting the company a tax exemption. The plant is expected to provide about 230 new jobs. (Budapest MTI in English 1619 GMT 5 May 94) PHARMACY PRIVATIZATION: The State Property Agency (AVU) is to invite tenders for the privatization of 61 pharmacies on 6 May. The asset value of the pharmacies, including their residential real estate, ranges between HUF1.3 million and HUF21 million. The pharmacies' current stocks will not be included in the tenders but successful bidders will be able to buy these from regional pharmaceutical centers under a deferred payment scheme involving a preferential interest rate. Hungarian pharmacies generally have a stock turnover period of one month. Other sources put the value of each pharmacy's stocks at between HUF1 million and HUF25 million. The pharmacies were separated from the regional pharmaceutical centers so that bidders could offer payment with E-loans ("existence" loans) or compensation coupons. Because of the long-running dispute between the AVU and local councils over the ownership of the pharmacies, half of the income from the privatization of the pharmacies will go to foundations that support pharmacies. The AVU is expected to invite bids for the sale of a further group of pharmacies in June. (Budapest MTI in English 1639 GMT 5 May 94) SLOVAKIA OFFICE: The State Property Agency (AVU) opened its second office abroad in Komarno, Slovakia. Hungary's compensation laws affect almost 2 million people in 16 countries. Run by BBS Invest Ltd. of Komarno, the office will also have a branch in Moldava nad Bodvou. Both offices will provide up-to-date information for any Slovak citizens who are eligible for compensation in Hungary. The first AVU office on foreign soil opened in Miercurea-Ciuc, Romania, one and a half months ago. (Budapest MTI in English 1941 GMT 4 May 94) WINE QUALITY BILL: The Ministry of Agriculture prepared its bill on grape and wine production bearing in mind the need to put the laws in line with European Union rules. The law will guarantee the designation of the place of origin (that is quality consistency), and will introduce an origin protection system as a guarantee for the financial interest of producers. The law would also oblige private wine producers to become members of so-called self-administrating "wine-growing communities" that will be licensed as authorities. Following the change in political system, lands, vineyards and forests were reprivatized, and the interests of producers made it necessary to meet market demands, mainly to fully observe equality guarantees. At the same time, producers themselves also want a return to their own, ancient institutions. (Budapest MTI in English 0745 GMT 5 May 94) NEW MORTGAGE BILL: A new law under preparation would extend mortgages to personal, movable property. The bill is expected to go before the new parliament this fall. The mortgage law could significantly contribute to the further development of the credit system. A team from the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) worked out the mortgage model that Justice Ministry officials used to prepare the new legal measure. The bill was put together so as to conform to Western European legal measures on credit guarantees. Under the bill, the mortgage would extend to profits from land (for instance, produce). A new element is that mortgaged property would not, in all cases, need to be used by the owner until the loan is repaid. For instance, rented apartments inhabited by tenants, rather than the owner, can be mortgaged. Any item that can be possessed can be mortgaged: securities, money, transferable rights, claims, and shares in economic partnerships. An important change is that mortgage rights can also be enforced through execution, not merely through court proceedings. There have been cases in the past when the property used as a guarantee for the raising of a loan was mortgaged only after several years, because of lengthy court proceedings. Under the bill, the debtor and the creditor can agree on the joint sale of the pledged property. In order to prevent the same object being mortgaged more than once, a suitable registration system must be created. The bill contains several versions for personal, movable properties. Accordingly, the territorial chamber of commerce, the trade directory, the local council, or notary would be in charge of keeping records. (Budapest MTI in English 1000 GMT 5 May 94) GERMAN BUSINESS ADVICE: Small and medium-sized businesses will be able to gain start-up help from a German-supported advisory system to be established shortly. This follows the signing of a cooperation contract between the leaders of the National Association of Industrial Bodies (Iposz) and the Directorate for the Rationalization of the German Economy (RKW). The German Ministry of Economics commissioned the Deutsche Ausgleichsbank to grant 1.8 million German marks to finance the setting up and operation of the economic coordination office. The office will choose advisers by the beginning of June. Representatives of new businesses or ones established not longer than three years ago may receive six days of advice of which half the fees will be paid by the German program. The coordination office will be operated until June 1995 by RKW, and after that by Iposz. (Budapest MTI in English 1638 GMT 6 May 94) BOOK PUBLISHING PRIVATIZED: The book publishing industry has been almost completely privatized. While the country's publishers have lost markets, money, and experts due to the systemic change, they have acquired new talent, impetus, self-organization, and lobbying techniques. State patronage is also helping the publication of books today. The number of books published nationwide has dropped from 113 million in 1989 to 80 million by 1994. The number of titles published in a year has also declined: from 13,500 between 1991 and 1993, to 12,500 currently. Privatized book publishing had to start out from a capital- deficient situation. Publishers and dealers still lack capital. Book wholesalers first gather orders from retailers throughout the country, and then forward these to the publishers, ordering only the number of books for which they have concrete clients. They then add their costs to the price. (The price gap between wholesale book trade and retail trade is 40 percent.) Privatization of book selling has not yet been completed. The situation is more favorable in publishing. The top 25 publishers are old Hungarian firms, previously taken over by the state, and now accounting for 60 percent of the market. (Budapest MTI in English 1045 GMT 10 May 94) EXCHANGE RATES: Over the past year, the Hungarian forint (HUF) lost 17.9 percent of its value as against the U.S. dollar. From May 13, 1990 to May 13, 1994, the forint rate against the dollar declined by 58 percent, as a comparative analysis of the National Bank of Hungary (MNB) exchange rates shows. Last year the forint rate dropped by the greatest extent -- 20.4 percent -- against the Swiss franc. (The four-year decline was 54.9 percent.) Four years ago the MNB sold a Swiss franc for 47.17 forints, a year ago for 60.7 forints, and now it sells for 73.1 forints. As compared to the German mark and the Austrian schilling, the forint lost 13.5 percent of its value last year, and 55.5 percent in four years. Four years ago, the MNB paid HUF66.12 for a dollar, HUF40.21 for a mark, and HUF5.71 for a schilling. Twelve months ago a dollar equalled to HUF88.62, a mark HUF55.06, and a schilling HUF7.82. (Budapest MTI in English 1453 GMT 13 May 94) CONSUMER PRICES: According to April 1994 figures, consumer prices rose by 1.2 percent in the last month. The increase over the past 12 months has been 17.3 percent, the Central Statistical Office said. The January 1994 increase in consumer prices was 3.2 percent, declining to 1.4 percent in February, and to 1 percent in March. The 1.2 percent rise in April was primarily due to market conditions and to locally increased charges for piped water, sewage, and district heating. Last January's inflation rate was 6.8 percent, dropping to 1.7 in February, and down to 0.8 percent both in March and April. In the past 12 months, the highest rate of inflation occurred this April. The average annual increase in the consumer-price index -- assessing the figures for the preceding twelve months -- was 17 percent this January, 16.6 percent in February, 16.8 percent in March, and 17.3 percent in April. For an average Hungarian family living in an urban area and consisting of two adults and two under- 15 children, the minimum subsistence-level monthly income rose to HUF51,100 (approx. $510) this April, which is HUF12,780 per person. The minimum subsistence-level monthly income for a family has risen by a total of HUF500 since February, which is an increase of HUF130 per capita. (Budapest MTI in English 1225 GMT 16 May 94) BONDS IN AUSTRIA: The Hungarian National Bank (MNB) launched a 1 billion Austrian schillings bond issue in Austria on 18 May. The bond issue was lead-managed by Creditanstalt-Bankverein and underwritten by 12 banks. The seven-year bond bears a 9 percent interest. This was the second foreign bond issue of the central bank this year. The MNB issued bonds to a face value of 2.5 billion Luxembourg francs (125 million German marks) in Luxembourg in March. The MNB plans to raise $2 billion through bond issues on the international capital market this year of which $1.4 billion has already been realized. The MNB raised a total of $4.5 billion through foreign bond issues last year. There were two issues of bonds to a total value of $1.1 billion at the end of last year, with payment in January 1994. Hungarian securities sell well on the Austrian money market. Preparations for issuing MNB bonds in yen and German mark are under way. (Budapest MTI in English 0823 GMT 18 May 94) SMALL INVESTOR PROGRAM: Hungarian citizens can purchase over HUF100 billion (about $1 billion) worth of bonds until the end of 1998. Within the framework of the Small Investor Shareholder Program (SISP), launched this April, stakes in 70 state-owned companies are to be offered to the public over a nearly five-year period. The SISP only includes companies fit to be introduced onto the stock exchange. This way, 10-20 percent of the companies' stake can be sold to private investors. The State Property Agency (AVU) has found as many as 70 state-owned companies suitable for joining the SISP. Over a five- year period, small investors can have access to a total of HUF100- 200 billion worth of stakes. Customers can pay either in cash or by compensation coupons and no coverage is required from them. Bonds can also be purchased on loan to be repaid in instalments over a five-year period. The SISP began with a trial phase in April, offering the bonds of four companies involved in trade, hotel and food industry, amounting to a total value of HUF4 billion. Following first assessments results, public service and pharmaceutical companies will also be included in the second phase. More than half of the new owners utilized the opportunity for loans, and many paid with compensation coupons. Recent polls show that people are satisfied with these bonds as investment and utilize the possibility of paying in instalments, as these loans are interest- free. (Budapest MTI in English 0951 GMT 16 May 94) STATE OWNERSHIP: The government modified its earlier decision on long-term state ownership. The change affects the state's holdings in AB-Aegon Insurance Rt, Penzjegynyomda Rt, Szikra Lapnyomda Rt, Postabank Rt, Borsodferr Rt, and Szerencsejatek Rt. The State Property Management Corporation (AV Rt) will now retain only a single "golden share" in the insurance company AB-Aegon Biztosito Rt and in the banknote printing company Penzjegynyomda Rt. It was earlier planned that 5 percent of AB-Aegon and a 25 percent plus one vote stake in Penzjegynyomda Rt would remain in long-term state ownership. Penzjegynyomda had shareholders' equity of HUF2.024 billion, with registered capital of HUF1.82 billion at the end of last year, of which the Hungarian National Bank (MNB) held 50.1 percent, with AV Rt holding the remainder. As a result of a HUF600 million equity increase earlier this year, the MNB has increased its stake by 12.1 percent. Forthcoming technical developments at the printing company will be financed by the MNB through a further equity raise. AV Rt will now retain only a 25 percent plus one vote stake in the printing company Szikra Lapnyomda Rt instead of the originally planned 50 percent plus one vote. The printing company has registered capital of HUF1.8 billion. Some of the shares freed will be offered in exchange for compensation coupons. The state will now relinquish its entire holding in Postabank Rt. It was originally planned that the state would hold 20 percent of the bank, but as AV Rt does not plan to contribute to a planned HUF2 billion equity raise, the state's stake would have fallen anyway to 16 percent. Postabank, which has registered capital of HUF6.5 billion, has the most extensive branch network in Hungary. The state will now retain only a 25 percent plus one vote stake in the steel company Borsodferr Rt, which was recently established with registered capital of HUF50 million. It was earlier planned that the company would be wholly state-owned. (Budapest MTI in English 1156 GMT 13 May 94) AGRICULTURE FORECAST: A recent Agriculture Ministry report expects that 1994 will be a year of stabilization in the agricultural sector, with rising production following last year's drastic decline. Agricultural production is forecast to rise by between 5 percent and 8 percent overall. Although crop production is expected to rise by 14-20 percent, no increase in livestock production is expected. Food industry output is expected to grow by 3-5 percent. Autumn wheat has been sown on more than 1 million hectares and this year's total grain crop, including maize, is expected to be over 11 million metric tons. It is estimated that agricultural production will account for 16-18 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) this year and for at least 25 percent of all exports. One in five people works in the agricultural sector. Last year, agricultural exports were worth $2.6 billion as compared to $2.2 billion in 1990, $2.7 billion in 1991, and $2.8 billion in 1992. Up to the end of last year, land to a value of 27 million golden crowns had been sold through compensation land auctions and the number of those acquiring land exceeded 320,000. This year's central budget allocates HUF57 billion to agricultural support, with HUF10 billion to finance agricultural production and HUF7.5 billion to finance an ongoing reorganization program. The amount available through the Agricultural Development Fund is HUF6 billion and HUF2 billion has been allocated to infrastructural development.

Among the ex-socialist countries Hungary has become the largest outlet for forgeries, mostly due to a lack of adequate legislation. The Industrial Property Rights Association (IPRA) and firms suffering damages from the trend -- mainly sportswear manufacturers -- have repeatedly proposed amending the misdemeanor law that does not allow confiscation of goods. Legal retail trade in Hungary last year amounted to HUF1,500 billion, with illegal distribution reaching HUF500 billion, according to the Consumer Protection Inspectorate. It is estimated that black marketeers make profits of HUF200 billion from unpaid duties, value added tax (VAT), and personal income tax. (Budapest MTI in English 1526 GMT 16 May 94) BUENOS AIRES EXHIBIT: The four-day independent Hungarian economic exhibition held in Buenos Aires with support from the Ministry of International Economic Relations was termed a success by Hungarian officials. The exhibition featured 17 Hungarian firms, mainly recently privatized small and medium-sized companies, which presented their products, along with delivery and cooperation possibilities. Argentine business groups showed considerable interest in the exhibition. Official talks were held on expanding bilateral economic ties. The Argentinian business leaders were interested in production cooperation, joint ventures, and Hungarian capital investments. The latter would mainly be in agriculture and the food-processing industry. A demand emerged for participation in the privatization of the Hungarian milling industry. In the course of official talks, the two sides agreed to speed up talks aimed at reaching an agreement on abolishing double taxation. Based on Hungarian results in the creation of a market economy, the Argentines consider Hungary a possible bridgehead in central and Eastern Europe. It was also announced that a chief commissioner to coordinate and prepare Argentine participation in the 1996 Budapest World Expo would shortly be appointed. (Budapest MTI in English 0946 GMT 13 May 94) BUSINESS WITH AUSTRIA: According to International Economic Relations Minister Bela Kadar, the change in Hungary's government will not affect the development of increased Austrian-Hungarian economic links. Hungary hopes the June 12 Austrian referendum regarding EU entry will turn out positively, because Austria's EU membership would clearly have a beneficial effect on Hungary. After last year's stagnation, bilateral business ties have begun to develop rapidly. Hungary now ranks first among Austria's trading partners in the region, and fifth worldwide, ahead of the United States and Britain. This trend meets the mutual expectations attached to the EFTA agreement. In the first quarter of this year, Austrian exports to Hungary rose by 15.1 percent, to 4.4 billion schillings, while Hungary exported 12.4 percent more goods to Austria, reaching a total of 2.6 billion schillings. (Budapest MTI in English 1420 GMT 17 May 94) JAN-MAR ECONOMICS: Central Statistical Office (KSH) figures show an increase in the number of economic organizations over the first three months of this year, an approximately 1 percent rise in prices per month, falling unemployment, and a greater foreign trade and central-budget deficit. In the first quarter of 1994, 4,699 economic organizations were founded, including 1,042 with foreign interests. Investments increased by 1.6 times more than in the first three months of last year, calculated at current prices. Industrial production continued to increase -- by 9.4 percent -- after last year's upswing. Energy use was down 5.7 percent on the first quarter of 1993, partly due to the mild winter. Consumer prices rose by 1 percent from February to March, and by 1.2 percent from March to April. The number of unemployed fell by 19,600 in March, to 611,000 -- 87,000 more than at the same time last year. In the period under survey, imports grew by 31 percent and exports by 25 percent, resulting in a trade deficit of 78.6 billion Hungarian forints (HUF), 1.5 times that of last year. The current account showed a deficit amounting to $573 million for the first two months of this year, 35 percent up on the previous year. Gross national debt had risen to $26.1 billion and net debt to $16.2 billion by the end of February. The January-March deficit of the central budget was double the 1993 first-quarter amount, exceeding HUF86 billion. (Budapest MTI in English 1223 GMT 20 May 94) PRICES RISE: Industrial prices rose 0.8 percent in March and were 9.1 percent up on March 1993, the Central Statistical Office reported. Domestic producer prices rose 7.8 percent in the 12 months up to the end of March. Calculated in forints, export prices rose 13.2 percent in the same period. However, the rise in export prices was entirely due to the 16 percent devaluation of the forint in the period and export producer prices fell by around 3 percent calculated in foreign exchange, the report adds. Domestic sales prices in the industrial and agricultural sectors rose overall by 9.2 percent in the 12 months up to March. At the end of March, producer prices, domestic sales prices and export prices, calculated in forints, were all 3.5 percent up on December 1993. Industrial producer prices rose by 1.8 percent in January and 0.9 percent in February. The 12-month increases were 8.1 percent in January and 8.7 percent a month later. Domestic producer prices were 6.8 percent up in January and 7.5 percent higher in February compared to the same months of 1993. On a 12-month basis, export prices, calculated in forints, were 12.4 percent up in January and 12 percent higher in February. Domestic sales prices in the industrial and agricultural sectors were up 8.1 percent overall in January and 9.0 percent higher in February than in the corresponding months of 1993. In March, public utility sales prices were on average only 1.7 percent higher than a year earlier, with a 15.9 percent rise in the price of water, and electricity prices remaining unchanged. Within the 9.9 percent average increase in producer prices in the manufacturing sector, prices of chemicals rose by 5.3 percent while those of food, drinks and tobacco rose by 15.2 percent in the 12 months up to the end of March. (Budapest MTI in English 1721 GMT 20 May 94) FARM MARKET EXPECTATIONS: According to the Ministry of International Economic Relations, the market for Hungarian agricultural produce is expected to improve following the coming into force of the GATT agreement in July, 1995. Export prices for agricultural produce are expected to increase by 10 percent over the medium-term. Export revenue is expected to increase by a maximum of $100m a year. This is equivalent to a 5 percent rise in agricultural exports based on the current $2 billion worth of agricultural produce exported a year. Hungary has already met some of the requirements of the GATT agreement, including abolishing subsidies. Other requirements could be met without major problems. An analysis of the agricultural regulations connected with the GATT agreement is expected to be completed soon. Agricultural subsidies will be calculated according to GATT standards in next year's budget, with parliament expected to ratify the GATT agreement this autumn. This will follow the building in of bilateral and free trade agreements with the EU, European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and Central European Free Trade Association (CEFTA) countries. (Budapest MTI in English 1427 GMT 24 May 94) ENERGY CONSUMPTION DOWN: Total energy consumption was 383 peta-joules (PJ) in the first four months of 1994, 5 percent less than in the same period of 1993, preliminary figures from the State Authority for Energy Management and Energy Safety show. The lower figure was the result of higher average temperatures and a fall in industrial energy consumption in the first four months of this year. Total consumption of electricity was 12,343 gigawatt hours (GWh) in the first four months, 3 percent down on the same period of 1993. In the same period, total available energy sources were 386.0 PJ, 0.5 percent down on the same period of last year. Of the total, 197.0 PJ came from domestic production and 189.0 PJ from imports. The proportion of domestic sources was 2.7 percent less than in the first four months of 1993. The proportion of coal and other coal derivatives fell from 16.2 percent (62.9 PJ) in January-April 1993 to 14.8 percent (57.2PJ) in the same period of this year, while that of oil and gas grew from 66.9 percent (259.6 PJ) to 69.4 percent (266.0 PJ). Energy exports totalled 21.0 PJ in the first four months of 1994, 5 percent more than in the same period of the last year. The country's total energy reserves are estimated to have stood at 154 PJ at the end of this April, 25.2 percent more than a year earlier. (Budapest MTI in English 1559 GMT 19 May 94) HIGH DOMESTIC DEMAND: A high demand market has come about in domestic trade over the last few years, mainly as the result of import deregulation and expanding enterprise, according to the Industry and Trade Ministry. Seventy percent of consumer products can now be imported without any restrictions. In other areas, such as capital investment goods (fixed assets), the proportion is even higher. However, the share of foreign capital in domestic trade is lower than the overall average, standing at 17 percent. Privatization of domestic trade has been successful. Over the last few years, the number of legal commercial enterprises has risen from 2,000 to 27,000, and the number of private entrepreneurs from 40,000 to 240,000. There are still 65 commercial firms operating as state companies. However, 14 of them are under liquidation or have gone bankrupt. All in all, proprietary and organizational transformation has yielded significant results: The value of retail trade in 1993 was HUF1967.4 billion, up 2.8 percent over the previous year when taking the 121.9 percent retail trade price index into consideration. The figure is up 25.3 percent when calculated at current prices. At the end of 1993, there were 10,700 Hungarian economic organizations in which foreign investors held a stake; overall foreign investment amounted to somewhat more than HUF116 billion. (Budapest MTI in English 1148 GMT 24 May 94) FOREIGN ACCOUNT CHANGES: The government amended the regulations on the use of forint trade accounts held by foreigners. As of June 1, non-Hungarians will be able to convert their forint accounts containing income from payments by Hungarian importers for foreign goods into foreign currency. The change is expected to encourage foreign companies to carry out foreign trade deals in forints and represents a further step toward the convertibility of the forint. Prior to the current amendment, foreigners could use their forint accounts only to buy Hungarian goods or services, including goods for export. Although non-Hungarians have been able to open forint accounts for two years, few have in fact done so and the amounts involved were usually negligible. The alteration of this situation was the main reason for the government's decision. The Hungarian National Bank (MNB) and the government consider encouraging foreigners to hold Hungarian bank accounts, either in foreign currency or in forints, an important element in the development of the economy. The government also intends to stimulate the forint money market and in this respect it is of special importance that as many foreigners as possible accept forints as payment. The current government amendment, however, only affects money transfers related to foreign trade deals and capital transfers are still subject to foreign exchange controls. (Budapest MTI in English 1334 GMT 20 May 94) MINSK-MADE BUS: The first Ikarus bus fitted in Belarus was recently introduced into Minsk's public transport. Belarus -- due to financial problems and the lack of currency -- had not been buying buses from Hungary in the previous four years, although it would need at least 3,000 new buses per year to renew its present stock. Therefore the Ikarus Rt welcomed Minsk's decision on setting up an assembly workshop in order to reduce costs and create jobs. The Hungarian Ikarus Rt and the Belarusian Amcodor joint-stock concern are planning to assemble at least 50 Ikarus buses this year. They also intend to increase the proportion of Belarusian parts fitted into the buses, expecting it to reach 80 percent in a few years' time. At present, 70 percent of Minsk's public transport buses bear the Ikarus emblem. (Budapest MTI in English 0756 GMT 24 May 94) EBRD LOANS: The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has since 1991 approved 15 major Hungarian projects and three smaller ones, mainly for industrial, agricultural, and infrastructural development, with a total value of $642.2 million. Hungary headed the list for the EBRD loans granted in 1993: Hungarian banks and companies received a total of 418.3 million European currency units (ECU) (ECU 1 = approx. $1.15). The first industrial loan approved by the bank in 1991 was an allotment of ECU 5.1 million to assist in restructuring one of Hungary's largest printing houses: Petofi Press of Kecskemet (Central Hungary). The loan has since been repaid. That same year, the Microsystem Co. -- at that time considered to be one of the largest private computer technology firms in Hungary -- received a loan from the EBRD. Microsystem has since gone bankrupt. In 1992 the EBRD provided assistance to a total of 30 projects, three of them in Hungary. The most important of these was the ECU 65.4 million loan to General Motors for construction of an Opel car assembly plant in Szentgotthard (western Hungary). The plant is already operating and is considered one of the largest Hungarian investments of the last four years. (The total value of investments in the project was $250 million.) In 1993, the Kner Press Co. of Gyomro (central Hungary) received a loan of ECU 9.37 million, and Zalaegerszeg Refrigerating Industry Plc. of south-west Hungary was granted ECU 4.66 million. The EBRD also approved a blanket loan through three Hungarian commercial banks totalling ECU 65 million to develop agricultural ventures. The revaluation (and the nearly 40 percent increase in equity) of Egis Pharmaceuticals in Budapest was considered a sensation in the privatization of Hungarian pharmaceutical companies, as the EBRD purchased 30 percent of the company's shares at a value of ECU 26.52 million. The bank purchased shares in Fusion Invest for ECU 3 million, and assisted the construction firm RZB/CEAL with a loan of ECU 0.9 million. In addition, it purchased ECU 6.25 million worth of shares in the Hungarian-French owned Accor-Pannonia Hotel. That same year, the EBRD and the Budapest Wholesale Market Co. arranged a novel loan agreement, in which the bank provided a loan of ECU 5.9 million to develop Hungary's agricultural wholesale trade-center in such a way that the municipal government agreed to act as guarantor for repayment. This year, the first EBRD loan was awarded to a Hungarian-French industrial company -- ECU 3 million -- for its infrastructure and environmental-protection development projects. The EBRD is participating as a shareholder in the Vienna-Budapest motorway construction project by providing credit, accepting loan guarantees, and acting as the loan manager. The EBRD also participated in the Hungarian Foreign Trade Bank's international bond-issue. It was the first issuance of Hungarian securities abroad in which the state was not the repurchasing guarantor. In the future, Hungary hopes that the EBRD will help support the growing number of small and medium-sized businesses in the country, and assist in the development of the money-market, mainly by working through the country's banking sector. Hungarian experts believe a concrete proving-case for this could be the granting of loans to set up Eximbank, which is specifically oriented toward boosting exports, based on a government resolution.
