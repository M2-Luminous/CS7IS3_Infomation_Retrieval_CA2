On 25 March, a relevant Foreign Ministry official indirectly refused the Russian Government's proposal, saying: "We believe we need to prudently review the proposal for the conference, which will include relevant countries, such as the United States and Japan, on the North Korean nuclear issue. It is more important, however, to be patient because the UN Security Council is now discussing the North Korean nuclear issue." The official said that "the Russian Government had already informed the ROK Embassy in Russia of its intention to make the proposal before it was announced internationally." He added that "the Russian Government's proposal was likely made to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, which has been recently deadlocked, through a multilateral approach."
