The city central heat and power station has shifted from burning natural gas to burning residual fuel oil. Once again, the Sakhalinmorneftegaz Association has grabbed the Komsomolsk-on-Amur residents "by the throat" and cut off the supply of the blue fuel. This time the reason for such harsh measures was not a delay in mutual settlements but the petroleum that, along with the gas, is discharged from Sakhalin wells in the form of condensate. The islanders were sending it, like the gas, to the "city of youth" through the pipelines whose construction was hailed in the well-known novel Daleko ot Moskvy [Far From Moscow]. The price for it was cranked up immensely -- to 140,000 rubles per tonne. If the Komsomolsk Petroleum Refinery had continued to take raw material at that price, it would have long since gone bankrupt. The petroleum refinery found suppliers with a better-quality and less expensive product--the Tyumen oil fields, which are delivering petroleum to Khabarovsk Kray at R110,000 a tonne. The Sakhalin people did not rack their brains trying to figure out how to lower the price of their oil, but decided to act from a position of strength--they delivered an ultimatum to the Komsomolsk-on-Amur's residents: either take our oil at our prices, or we will close the valve on the gas pipeline. They closed it, forgetting that Khabarovsk Kray could take countermeasures. After all, Sakhalin receives up to 70 percent of its economic cargo by way of the Vanino-Kholmsk ferry crossing. However, to the credit of the kray's leaders, this time, as during the first such incident last year, they have been showing restraint and reasonableness. Residual fuel oil, jet fuel and all other goods addressed to the island oblast are being punctually dispatched to it. The kray's administration has sent an emergency telegram informing the Russian president and head of government of the existing situation. The law, not arbitrary rule, should act.
