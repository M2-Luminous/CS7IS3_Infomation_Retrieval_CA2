FR940513-2-00030 FR940513-2-00018 [Project No. 2561&hyph;003, Missouri] Sho-Me Power Corp.; Availability of Final Environmental Assessment May 9, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for a new license for the existing Niangua Hydroelectric Project, located on the Niangua River in Camden County, Missouri near the city of Camdenton, and has prepared a Final Environmental Assessment (EA) for the project. In the EA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective or enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment. Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
