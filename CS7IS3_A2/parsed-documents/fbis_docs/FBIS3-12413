This massacre falls within the framework and development of the settlement policy. Most important, it took place as a result of the decision of the Israeli Government and army to give the green light to the settlers to persecute our defenseless people. Anyone who reminds himself of past events will be able to recall ugly scenes similar to the one that took place yesterday in full view of the world. Thus, it is wrong to wonder if the Israeli Government is responsible for the terrible massacre yesterday. The Israeli Government is not only responsible for the massacre, it was involved in it, proven by the pictures that have been beamed by international media organs, pictures that remind people of despicable Nazism. These are pictures of the Israeli Army protecting the settlers who, in civilian clothes, were hitting Palestinians with sticks, kicking them, opening fire on them, and attacking their vehicles. Thus, it is important to view the massacre as an official Israeli massacre for it was conducted on the one hand under the protection of the Israeli Army and police, which do not leave the Ibrahimi shrine unprotected [as heard]; on the other hand, it was a natural development of the policy of using the settlers as a means of terrorism and spreading fear among Palestinians as well as to intimidate them. The settlers were thereby able to do what the Israeli officials could not do publicly. Furthermore, the martyrs who fell at the Ibrahimi shrine were not the only victims of yesterday, a black day in the holy month of Ramadan. What about those who were killed or injured in front of hospitals and those who fell during the confrontation between the Israeli Army and police and those who went out to express their outrage? The Israeli Army and police killed them deliberately and clearly in front of the cameras. Thus, the problem of settlement should become the most important topic on the agenda of the talks as no negotiations will proceed in the right diretion without first resolving such a problem. No progress or development in negotiations will take place as long as such a problem is not resolved in a way that will prevent the Israeli Government from using the settlements to carry out more massacres for political aims. Some people believed, however, that disarming the settlers would be enough; such a view would not resolve the core of the problem because settlements were set up as military projects with a number of functions: to intervene by using terror and repression. Therefore, disarming them cannot be guaranteed by anyone, and we cannot be assured that yesterday's atrocity will not be repeated. Therefore, the removal of all settlements is the most correct and the most urgent matter, particularly given the fact that negotiations will be taking place later about the future of the settlements. However, in negotiations there are usually problems and developments that will make their progress dependent on whether there is a need to continue with the negotiations themselves or not. [sentence as heard] Nevetheless, if removing the settlements is hard to achieve, then an agreement should at least be reached on the protection of our people--by an international force sent by the United Nations to protect our people from these wanton, terrible, and racist aggressions that have been carried out by the settlers with the Rabin government's protection and participation--until talks about the future of the settlement are held in accordance with the timetable agreed upon between the PLO and the Israelis. This could be a price that our people might accept, given the amount of killing, savagery, racism, and religious fanaticism, which is focused on the annihilation of the Palestinian people by killing them while they were praying their god. A fanatic Israeli organization announced responsibility for the massacre shortly after it was committed. This means that the massacre was also plotted by the settlers and not the government alone. This should lead us to a very interesting question about the nature of Israel and how we should deal with the Israeli Government: Should we deal with it as a state or merely as a party, a faction, or an organization for as long as the settlers hold tens of thousands of weapons which can be used at any time for public and premeditated killing, by an individual or by a group, of our defenseless Palestinian people.
