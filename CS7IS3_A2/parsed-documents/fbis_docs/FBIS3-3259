Agriculture, peasants, and the rural economy heading for the market is historically inevitable. However, this is not a simple thing. Nor can we get the desired results simply by removing restrictions. Although the broad masses of peasants have been tempered in commodity production for many years since the beginning of reform and opening up, and the market is playing a more and more important role in agriculture and the rural economy, this remains a new task for both the broad masses of rural cadres and hundreds of millions of peasants. What are the responsibilities of government departments in this process? How should they give guidance to the peasants? How should they organize people to blaze new trails? How should thousands upon thousands of households be merged with the market? Who should provide information in a larger scope? How should various kinds of risks be shared? All these questions demand exploration and prompts answers in practice. In recent years, various localities have gained some successful experiences in the transition to the socialist market economy, and they also have encountered some new problems. We have opened this new column today to report questions on "How Peasants Head for the Market" in a concentrated manner. We warmly and sincerely welcome articles on successful experiences, good methods, feelings, understandings, questions, and even perplexity so long as they contribute to mutual exchange and mutual enlightenment.
