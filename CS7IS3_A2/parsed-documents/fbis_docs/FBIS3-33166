During the inauguration of the 20th extraordinary period of sessions of the Inter-American Cooperation for Development General Assembly at the Foreign Minister, OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente Baena Soares warned that the downtrodden need much more than just a chance to be heard in order to maintain stability and democracy in the region. [Begin Baena Soares recording] Just giving the downtrodden a chance to be heard is not enough to improve the fate of large segments of our society, rescue them from scarcity and exploitation, and ensure their full right to live with hope. We need sustainable democracy to overcome extreme poverty. [end recording] Speaking to 20 Latin American foreign ministers and 34 special delegates from member countries, Baena Soares warned government representatives of the danger that extreme poverty and social injustice may break the region's democratic order. Recalling the Mexico Declaration, signed in March 1945, which emphasizes the right of equal opportunity for all people in the hemisphere, Baena Soares hit the nail on the head when he affirmed that more progress is made today consolidating wealth than in halting the avalanche of extreme poverty and neglect, although the growth of these factors dampens possibilities for stability, development, and peace, which the countries of Latin America require to advance on the path of democracy. As an example, the OAS secretary general said that 230 million citizens in the region lack the resources to meet their basic needs. He stressed that in at least 11 Latin American and Caribbean countries, the available firsthand information reveals that one-fifth of the population earns less than 6 percent of the total per capita income. He noted that even those societies that have achieved high levels of production exhibit serious deficiencies linked to the displacement of indigenous communities, neglected populations, a lack of food and housing, high rates of crime and violence, the illegal trafficking and use of drugs, and environmental deterioration. Baena Soares noted that among the international community, close to 6.5 percent of the labor force in the wealthier countries is jobless. The unemployment rate of the hemisphere's industrialized countries is almost 7 percent. This segment of society, the poorest, must work an average of nine weeks to acquire the resources earned in just one week by the richer 20 percent. Although cold and repetitive, the figures are a cause for reflection after almost half a century of OAS assemblies, where extreme poverty, injustice, and democracy are recurrent themes. The OAS secretary general stressed the need for the OAS member countries to ratify their commitment to base the preservation of democratic order on an open struggle against extreme poverty and on the consolidation of social justice. American countries, he said, have the resources to defeat poverty. In turn, Mexican Foreign Minister Manuel Tello, who was elected president of the extraordinary assembly, stated during the inaugural ceremony that Mexico is convinced that the people's aspirations for justice and welfare demand an end to the backwardness and neglect in which millions of Latin American live. That, he said, can only be achieved as peoples and governments make new commitments to cooperation and development. The war on extreme poverty, Tello concluded, should become a priority of the OAS, because inequality hurts everyone.
