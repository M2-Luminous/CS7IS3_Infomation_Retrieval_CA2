"The key question is how Ukraine now develops: whether it will become federalized or draw closer to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)," Kanis said. Commenting on NATO's offer of special status to Russia in the Partnership for Peace program, allowing it consultation on European security issues, he said, "Russia as a Eurasian nuclear superpower cannot have the same status as the other countries." Slovakia will submit a presentation document -- providing the basis for an individual program of cooperation with NATO -- on May 25 at a session of the North Atlantic Council for Cooperation in Brussels. The document has first to be approved by the Slovak government on Tuesday, along with the new national defense doctrine. Kanis said the United States had appreciated the fact that the document had been prepared through broad consultation. The Slovak side, he said, had had consultations in Washington, in Garmisch- Partenkirchen at the Marshall Institute and also with German Defense Minister Volker Ruhe. Kanis said it was symbolic that the government would debate the presentation document and the new defense doctrine at the same time. The previous cabinet, headed by Vladimir Meciar, approved the Slovak defense doctrine at the beginning of the year. The decision to prepare a new doctrine was taken, Kanis said, so that those who did not agree with opinions of former Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak could also contribute.
