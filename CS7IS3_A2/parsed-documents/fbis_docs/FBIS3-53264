Arab and foreign news agencies correspondents attended the news conference held at the al-Khalisah compound in al-Yarmuk camp. Attending the news conference were: Comrade 'Isam al-Qadi al-Sa'iqah, secretary general; Abu Musa [Sa'id Musa Muragha], secretary of the Fatah Movement's Central Committee; Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLFP-GC]; Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement; Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary general of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front [PPSF]; 'Arabi 'Awwad, secretary general of the Palestinian Revolutionary Communist Party [PRCP]; Abu-'Ali Mustafa, assistant secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP]; Ibrahim Ghawshah, Hamas Political Bureau member and official spokesman; Abu-Layla [Qays al-Samarra'i], member of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] Political Bureau; 'Ali 'Aziz, Palestine Liberation Front [PLF] Political Bureau member; and several representatives of these factions' commands. At the start of the news conference, the formation of the Alliance of Palestinian forces comprising the 10 Palestinian factions was announced. A statement in the name of the alliance was then read. The statement stresses the need to abide by the Palestinian National Charter, and the Palestinian people's inalienable national rights to Palestine, their homeland, and to repatriation, self-determination, and complete national independence. The statement also emphasizes that the Palestinian cause is an Arab and Islamic cause and that the liberation of Palestine is the responsibility of the Arab and Islamic nation, most of all the Palestinian people. The statement stresses the importance of the Palestinian people's unity, territorial integrity, and the unity of their cause, objectives, and national fate, and the abidance by all their national and historical rights. The statement says that no one has the right to give up any of these rights, and views the Gaza-Jericho agreement as not binding for the Palestinian people. The statement calls for clinging to Palestine as an irreplaceable historical homeland for the Palestinian people, and for opposing all the schemes for a substitute homeland, resettlement, transfer, compensation, or attempts to obliterate the Palestinian people's national identity. In its statement, the alliance calls for continuing intifadah activities. It emphasizes that the Palestine question is the core of the Arab-Zionist conflict, and stresses the need for bolstering joint Palestinian militant ties. The statement emphasizes the right of the Palestinian people in the diaspora to exercise their militant responsibilities alongside the nationalist, Arab, and Islamic forces to promote liberation, return, self-determination, and full national independence. The statement calls for stepping up cooperation with the Islamic, Asian, and African states as well as with all the friendly nations standing by the struggle of our Palestinian people and supporting their inalienable national rights. It emphasizes the importance of forging an alliance with all the forces for liberation and progress around the world--the forces that support our national rights. The statement calls for work to disseminate all that relates to the Palestinian cause and the national struggle to win the widest public opinion over to the cause of our struggle and rights, and to make the case that Gaza-Jericho agreement neither amounts to a solution nor brings peace. The statement says the alliance will form a Central Command, which will be responsible for formulating its decisions and policies that are based on the alliance's political tasks. The Central Command will include two representatives of each faction, while its secretariat will include one representative of each faction. The Alliance of Palestinian forces groups the following factions: The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas; the PFLP-GC; the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, Fatah; the PFLP; the DFLP; al-Sa'iqah Organization; the PPSF; the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement, the the PRCP; and the PLF. The secretaries general then answered questions posed by journalists on issues relating to the situation in the Palestinian arena.
