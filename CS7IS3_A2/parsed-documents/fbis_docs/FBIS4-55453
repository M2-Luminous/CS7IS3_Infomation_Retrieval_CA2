The most dangerous of these are the pollution of the soil and the water table by chemical waste and petroleum lines. The estimated cost of the damage is approximately 52 billion zlotys [Z]. Already in the 1980's, the Polish Ecological Services tried sporadically to control pollution from some of the Soviet military bases. Most of these efforts failed because "outsiders" were not permitted to enter Soviet bases. Not until May 1992 did the situation change, after the signing of a Polish-Soviet agreement on the removal of Soviet forces from Poland. Joint inspections of both Polish and Russian bases began. The result of all of this was ecological standards that were incorporated into the agreements for transferring the former Soviet military bases to the Poles. "We have documented the magnitude of all the damage caused, and we have calculated the costs," stated Andrzej Walewski, the Main Inspector for Environmental Protection. "The Russians left without paying for the ecological damage they committed, so, in turn, we are not going to pay them for any of the equipment they left behind," stated Walewski. According to him, Poland won the battle with a political success, while the Czechs and Hungarians incurred many costs during the Soviet pullout. "The fact that our country had documentation on the ecological damage played a great psychological role," stated Walewski. Of 59 sites that were occupied by the Soviets, 35 had the potential to be ecological hazards. The National Inspector for Environmental Protection chose 21 sites believed to be the most contaminated. The inspections included all of the air bases, large fuel depots, ammunition dumps, and firing ranges. Tests were conducted on underground water to see if there was chemical contamination. "Water was inspected both above and below ground. Also, the damage done in forests and on roads and contamination from chemical and nuclear weapons were examined," stated Walewski. These tests were conducted on the grounds of the bases and around them. Hydrological tests are being conducted on a wide scale by using bore-hole methods. Physiochemical tests of the water and water table are being done in specialized laboratories. The tests are conducted at government expense, and, to complete them, it is estimated that the cost will be approximately Z14 million. The tests are being funded by Polish zlotys exclusively and under the direction of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. The Military Technical Academy will also participate in the tests in tandem with other research groups. The damage may be assessed at Z52.2 billion. "This is a rather abstract sum, a sum we would have to pay in order to fully recultivate the land," stated Walewski. [passage omitted] The majority of the funds will come from the national budget. The Environmental Protection group has developed a special ranking in terms of money and in terms of which area will be "cleaned" first. The cleaning will take place first in the most contaminated areas. These areas are: Kluczewo, in the Szczecin voivodship; Brzeg, in the Opole voivodship; and Swinouscie and Borne Sulinowo in the Koszalin voivodship. Let us not forget that the Soviet forces were stationed on Polish soil from World War II until 17 September 1993, over an area of 70,000 hectares and 59 bases. Their stay was legitimized by an agreement between the People's Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union.
