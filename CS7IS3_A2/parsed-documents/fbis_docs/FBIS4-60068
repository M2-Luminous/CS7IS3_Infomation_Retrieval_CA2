[Beilin] I admit I was very surprised, and up to this moment I have not been officially informed about it. I understand from the media that it is final, and if that is so, then it is very problematic and very regrettable from our viewpoint due to his short tenure and Djerejian's importance in the political process. [Zissowitz] Did you not detect a short circuit between Djerejian and his State Department bosses in Washington? [Beilin] I do not think there was anything like that, anyway I did not know about anything like that. According to the report from Washington, it was not due to any internal problem, but because he has received an outside offer he could not turn down. [Zissowitz] Djerejian was meant to have a central role in the talks with the Syrians, and will be missed, if only due to the fact that he was ambassador in Damascus and knew al-Asad. [Beilin] That is true. He made a very important contribution. We had a very interesting situation in which our ambassador, Itamar Rabinovich, also heads the talks with Syria and is an expert on Syria. The U.S. ambassador in Israel was previously ambassador in Syria, and then assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs. The fact that the two played a role in the political process was very, very important for the shuttle diplomacy commenced by the secretary of state. That is why we so much regret his apparent decision to resign. [Zissowitz] Could it impair, spoil the negotiations with the Syrians? [Beilin] No, it cannot hamper the negotiations, but he made a contribution, which will cease with his departure. It cannot harm or deeply hinder the political process, which at the moment depends to a certain extent on U.S. readiness to enhance its efforts in the shuttle between the two sides in view of the existing gaps and the positive basis existing between them. [Zissowitz] How would you define the situation in the talks with the Syrians? [Beilin] I would say that the shared principle of peace and territories is very firm, as never before, and it gives me hope that we will have a peace accord within months and not years. The separate positions appear to be very far apart, therefore there is an optically distorted picture of gaps that cannot be bridged. I believe the gaps can be bridged, and I think it is the U.S. Administration that can bridge those gaps, because at the moment, I do not see a better channel for talks between us and them, especially since the Syrians are still unprepared for talks between the two sides on a senior political level. Therefore, in addition to the resumption of the bilateral talks in Washington, U.S. shuttle diplomacy will have a role in closing the gaps. That is why I am optimistic, and anything that harms the chance to succeed in that diplomacy, such as Djerejian's announcement, is regrettable. [Zissowitz] Djerejian served as ambassador here only a short time. Would you call him a friend of Israel? [Beilin] I do not know if we can use that expression.... [Zissowitz, interrupting] We usually like to stick those titles on people. [Beilin] I have my own formula. I say that whoever is a friend of peace is a friend of Israel, and Djerejian definitely was a friend of peace. I also think that he can be seen as a personal friend of many among us. The man was very informed. I met him almost 10 years ago when he began his post as head of the Israel desk in the State Department, and then in other posts, including ambassador in Syria, and assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, and in all those roles he made an important contribution to the political process. In his previous position, he headed their team in the multilateral talks, and together we advanced those talks beyond their poor start and made them into something much more significant. He is one of the most knowledgeable people on the Middle East in the State Department, and there are not many others like him. That is why his move is a blow to us. In order to find somebody to replace Djerejian as ambassador in Israel they will have to search far and wide in the State Department for somebody with his level of expertise, knowledge, and familiarity. [Zissowitz] Will Israel ask that the appointment be made as soon as possible? [Beilin] I assume that is a top American interest. We will not intervene in the selection of the person or the timing, but it is obvious that in the very intensive relations between us and the Americans, neither of us can permit long interruptions.
